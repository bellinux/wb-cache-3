40|$|BACKGROUND: The authors {{reviewed}} various {{recommendations and}} practices for cost-effectiveness analysis. They also performed a PubMed search for clopidogrel and cost-effectiveness from 2004 to early 2008 to obtain original analyses published in English {{to look for}} possible associations of assumptions and conclusions with reported <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>support.</b> RESULTS:. Inclusion of incident cases and truncation at a sensible follow-up time more appropriately reflect the burden to be assumed by third-party payers. Extending the time horizon too far {{runs the risk of}} decreasing any relation with future reality. Parsimony cannot justify simplifications that omit relevant issues such as noncoronary costs, which worsen the calculated cost-effectiveness ratio of clopidogrel by 5 % to 27 %. The choice of the population to be analyzed has a major effect on cost-effectiveness: pharmaceutically sponsored studies published between 2004 and early 2008 focused on high-risk patients and have routinely shown more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios for clopidogrel than studies without <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>support.</b> CONCLUSION:. Any entity hoping to make the cost-effectiveness ratio of clopidogrel look more favorable would prefer the isolated, cohort approach and limit the analysis to high-risk patients most likely to benefit from it. This approach ignores the reality of medical policies and does not address the most relevant questions regarding the optimum use of clopidogrel...|$|E

The combined {{results show that the}} United States' health care system very similar to other health care systems with respect to organizational and delivery characters but substantially differs from the other health care systems in terms of financing mechanism. In addition, the United States has much higher total health expenditures and a much smaller public share of total health expenditures than any other country included in this study.; Finally, based on the findings from the descriptive analysis and building on previous research, a multivariate analysis using fixed effects focuses on the relationship between total health expenditures and public share of health care system in nineteen OECD countries over a thirty-year period. This analysis differs from previous research in two ways. First, this analysis includes a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the models and, different models are tested separately as well as in one model. While GDP remains the most important explanatory variable, public share is inversely related to total health expenditures. Public integrated health care systems relying predominantly on public provision have an expenditure-increasing effect, supporting the public choice theory. Third, consistent negative estimates are obtained for share of health expenditures spent on <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>supporting</b> the substitution theory.

40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify how many publications retracted because of misconduct involved declared medical writers (i. e., not ghostwriters) or declared <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry <b>support.</b> The secondary objective was to investigate factors associated with misconduct retractions. Design: A systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study. Data source: Retracted publications dataset in the MEDLINE database. Data selection: PubMed was searched (Limits: English, human, January 1966 – February 2008) to identify publications retracted because of misconduct. Publications retracted because of mistake served as the control group. Standardized definitions and data collection tools were used, and data were analyzed by an independent academic statistician. Results: Of the 463 retracted publications retrieved, 213 (46 %) were retracted because of misconduct. Publications retracted because of misconduct rarely involved declared medical writers (3 / 213; 1. 4 %) or declared <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry <b>support</b> (8 / 213; 3. 8 %); no misconduct retractions involved both declared medical writers and the industry. Retraction because of misconduct, rather than mistake, was significantly associated with: absence of declared medical writers (odds ratio: 0. 16; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 05 – 0. 57); absence of declared industry involvement (0. 25; 0. 11 – 0. 58); single authorship (2. 04; 1. 01 – 4. 12); first author having at least one other retraction (2. 05; 1. 35 – 3. 11); and first author affiliated with a low/middle income country (2. 34; 1. 18 – 4. 63).

METHODS This is an interview-based study, which was undertaken in 2012, using semi-structured questionnaires with social actors from the pharmaceutical market, the pharmaceuticals industry, consumers and the regulatory agency. In addition, drug prices were compiled based on surveys conducted {{in the state of}} Sao Paulo, at the point of sale, between February 2009 and May 2012. RESULTS The mean drug prices charged at the point of sale (pharmacies) were well below the maximum price to the consumer, compared with many drugs sold in Brazil. Between 2009 and 2012, 44 of the 129 prices, corresponding to 99 drugs listed in the database of compiled prices, showed a variation of more than 20. 0 % in the mean prices at the point of sale and the maximum price to the consumer. In addition, many laboratories have refused to apply the price adequacy coefficient in their sales to government agencies.

30|$|In {{an effort}} {{to reduce the number of}} smokers in Malaysia, several quit smoking {{programs}} were initiated in Malaysia, such as “Tak Nak!” or “Say No!”, a nationwide anti-smoking campaign that used mass and print media to spread public awareness regarding the dangers of smoking (Hong et al. 2013). Other efforts include “Kempen Nafas Baru Bermula Ramadhan” (“New Breath Beginning Ramadhan”) (Ministry of Health Malaysia 2014), quit smoking clinics nationwide (Ministry of Health Malaysia 2010), and quit line services over the phone. In order to further enhance smoking cessation efforts, it is important to study smoking behavior of Malaysians, as well as related factors, such as withdrawal, mood, and self-efficacy that could contribute to effective smoking cessation programs. It is difficult for smokers to stop smoking because of the addictive nature of cigarette smoking (National Institute of Drug Abuse 2012). Past studies in Malaysia indicated no standard treatment strategies at the quit smoking clinics nationwide. They also indicated there were differences in the success rate between clinics (Wee et al. 2011). Wee et al. (2011) found high default rates of 51.8 % at 6 -month follow-up. Research is needed to examine how different approaches to behavioral support, skills of practitioners and availability of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>support</b> affect smoking cessation success rates. One behavioral technique that has shown promise is promoting physical activity (PA) participation as an adjunct to smoking cessation (e.g. Taylor et al. 2014). In this study, we examined the impact of Physical Activity Consultation (PAC) as an adjunct to standard smoking cessation treatment among males in Malaysia.|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Tremendous growth in opioid prescribing {{over two decades}} in the USA has correlated with proportional increases in diversion, addiction, and overdose deaths. Pseudoaddiction, a concept coined in 1989, has frequently been cited to indicate that under-treatment of pain, rather than addiction, is the more pressing and authentic clinical problem in opioid-seeking pa-tients. This investigative review searched Medline articles containing the term Bpseudoaddiction ^ to determine its foot-print in the literature {{with a focus on}} how it has been charac-terized and empirically validated. By 2014, pseudoaddiction was discussed in 224 articles. Only 18 of these articles con-tributed to or questioned pseudoaddiction from an anecdotal or theoretical standpoint, and none empirically tested or con-firmed its existence. Twelve of these articles, including all four that acknowledged pharmaceutical funding, were proponents of pseudoaddiction. These papers described pseudoaddiction as an iatrogenic disease resulting fromwithholding opioids for pain that can be diagnosed, prevented, and treated with more aggressive opioid treatment. In contrast, six articles, none with <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>support,</b> questioned pseudoaddiction as a clin-ical construct. Empirical evidence supporting pseudoaddiction as a diagnosis distinct from addiction has not emerged. Nevertheless, the term has been accepted and proliferated in the literature as a justification for opioid therapy for non-terminal pain in patients who may appear to be addicted but should not, from the perspective of pseudoaddiction, be diag-nosed with addiction. Future studies should examine whether acceptance of pseudoaddiction has complicated accurate pain assessment and treatment, and whether it has contributed to or reflected medical-cultural shifts that produced the iatrogenic opioid addiction epidemic...|$|E

We set out to determine associations between these potential measures of program quality. Methods: Survey of internal medicine residency programs that shared an online ambulatory curriculum on hospital type, faculty size, number of trainees, proportion of international medical graduate (IMG) trainees, Internal Medicine In-Training Examination (IM-ITE) scores, three-year American Board of Internal Medicine Certifying Examination (ABIM-CE) first-try pass rates, Residency Review Committee-Internal Medicine (RRC-IM) certification length, program director clinical duties, and use of pharmaceutical funding to support education. Associations assessed using Chi-square, Spearman rank correlation, univariate and multivariable linear regression. Results: Fifty one of 67 programs responded (response rate 76. 1 %), including 29 (56. 9 %) community teaching and 17 (33. 3 %) university hospitals, {{with a mean of}} 68 trainees and 101 faculty. Forty four percent of trainees were IMGs. The average post-graduate year (PGY) - 2 IM-ITE raw score was 63. 1, which was 66. 8 for PGY 3 s. Average 3 -year ABIM-CE pass rate was 95. 8 %; average RRC-IM certification was 4. 3 years. ABIM-CE results, IM-ITE results, and length of RRC-IM certification were strongly associated with each other (p < 0. 05). PGY 3 IM-ITE scores were higher in programs with more IMGs and in programs that accepted <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>support</b> (p < 0. 05). RRC-IM certification was shorter in programs with higher numbers of IMGs. In multivariable analysis, a higher proportion of IMGs was associated with 1. 17 years shorter RRC accreditation. Conclusions: Associations between quality indicators are complex, but suggest that the presence of IMGs is associated with better performance on standardized tests but decreased duration of RRC-IM certification...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} {{scene in}} 2008 – 2009 In times of economic crisis {{the supply of}} medicines is often the first component of the health-care budget to be cut. Since January 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) has been monitoring the health impact of the economic crisis through quarterly reports of medicine consumption and prices in over 80 countries. These data are collected by the Essential Medicines and Pharmaceutical Policies Department (EMP) in collaboration with IMS Health. EMP has also contributed to mitigating {{the effects of the}} H 1 N 1 pandemic. EMP was actively involved {{in the development of the}} clinical guidelines for the treatment of H 1 N 1 influenza; a monitoring tool (PaniFlow) was developed in cooperation with Swiss regulators to monitor adverse events following immunization or the use of medicines; and key antiviral medicines were prequalified, thereby increasing competition and supplier security, and reducing the price of these medicines for low- and middle-income countries by half. The positive effects of the merger of the two WHO medicines departments and the move of EMP to the Health Systems and Services Cluster have become increasingly apparent. The three functions of EMP (global normative work, technical support to countries and innovative public health thinking) are now fully integrated. In addition to the ongoing collaboration between the medicines programmes at headquarters, regional and country offices, several cluster-wide projects have started, such as the development of performance indicators for renewed Primary Health Care. Meanwhile, international interest in the quality and regulation of medicines has never been so great. In addition to its continuing role in the development of new medicine quality standards and prequalification of large numbers of new products for UN procurement, WHO is now involved, together with several international donors, in a new initiative to promote regional harmonization of medicine regulatory systems within and between African regional economic communities.
