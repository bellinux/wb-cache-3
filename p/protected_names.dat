40|$|Since the 15 th century, European {{states have}} sought to protect certain {{foodstuffs}} originating from a designated geographic location. When multilateral and bilateral agreements failed to establish sufficient protection amongst the European Community member states, the European Community sought to establish uniform standards of protection by adopting Regulation 2081 / 92 in 1992. While {{an important step in}} the harmonization of varying European state practices, Regulation 2081 / 92 failed {{to address the problem of}} names that are homonymous to registered, <b>protected</b> <b>names.</b> In 2006, the European Community attempted to address this issue in Regulation 510 / 2006. This Note explores the issue of “homonymous names” and how the European Court of Justice has struggled to define the term. The author concludes that Regulation 510 / 2006 fails to provide a clear standard regarding homonymous names and should be amended to avoid the very problem the European Community sought to address in enacting uniform standards of protection: varying state practices which result in increased litigation...|$|E
40|$|Protection of Domain Names (master's degree thesis) The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse a legal {{interpretation}} of the domain name. The thesis analyzes the theoretical base of this term, authorities competent to constitute rules on the market of domain names and {{to decide how to}} judge corelated disputes, attention is also drawn to the conflict of <b>protected</b> <b>names</b> and domain names. The important question to be answered is the eventual social significance of a juridical framework of domain name. The question of domain names (and also other institutes connected with internet) is a widely discussed and disputed topic. The last three decades the rules and the execution of them were constantly developing and underwent major changes. Therefore it's very interesting to watch this progress and to compare the many different points of view on the whole issue. Those were the main reasons for my research. The thesis consists of seven chapters. Chapter One, Two and Three are introductory, they define the term 'domain name', its function and structure. They also express and explain the basic terminology attached to domain names. Chapter Four analyzes the place of the domain name in Czech law system. This chapter is divided into two parts. Part One is focussing on the previous private law codex. The Second Part [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{new rules}} {{formulated}} in Article 59 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) will cause numerous, often undesirable, name changes, when only phylogenetically defined clades are named. Our {{task is to}} name fungal taxa and not just clades. Two suggestions are made here that may help to alleviate some disadvantages of the new system. (1) Officially an epithet coined in a list-demoted genus that is older than the oldest one available in the list-accepted genus {{would have to be}} recombined in the accepted genus. We recommend that individual authors and committees establishing lists of <b>protected</b> <b>names</b> should generally not recombine older epithets from a demoted genus into the accepted genus, when another one from pre- 2013 is available in that genus. (2) Because the concepts of correlated teleomorph and anamorph genera are often incongruent, enforced congruence leads to a loss of information. Retaining the most suitable generic name is imperative, even when this is subordinated to another, list-accepted, generic name. Some kind of cryptic dual generic nomenclature is bound to persist. We therefore strongly recommend the retention of binomials in genera where they are most informative. With these recommendations, the upheaval of fungal nomenclature ensuing from the loss of the former Art. 59 can be reduced to an unavoidable minimum...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The main {{objective}} of the present research is to update information on the Portuguese traditional foods from fresh meat group with quality product designations. Moreover, this study reviews published data on nutritional composition and bioactive compounds of these foodstuffs. Method: Portuguese fresh meats with quality product designation were identified and categorized in Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), according to the information available in DOOR database ([URL] A literature review from scientific publications with peer-review has been also carried out to compile the information available on nutritional composition and bioactive compounds, namely, total fat content, individual fatty acids, cholesterol, α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol and β-carotene. Results: A total of 29 Portuguese fresh meats with quality designation are registered (16 PDO and 13 PGI). In Portugal, there are 12 bovine meats with <b>protected</b> <b>names,</b> of which 9 PDO (Barrosã, Mirandesa, Maronesa, Arouquesa, Marinhoa, Carnalentejana, Mertolenga, Cachena da Peneda and Charneca) and 3 PGI (Vitela de Lafões, Açores and Cruzado Lameiros do Barroso). Nevertheless, only 44 % of all these fresh meats were characterized regarding the nutritional composition and bioactive compounds content. Total fat content varied between 0. 5 - 2. 7 g/ 100 g for Mertolenga and Arouquesa, respectively while cholesterol ranged from 41 - 64 mg/ 100 g for Mirandesa and Maronesa, respectively. Conclusions: Fresh meats with protected designation represent 25 % of the Portuguese traditional foods with quality product designation. Nevertheless, there is {{a vast number of}} traditional fresh meats that have never been characterized with respect to nutritional and bioactive compounds content and this review aims to evaluate the state-of–the art in this research field and to promote investigation and the interest among food researchers, manufacturers and consumers on these foods.
