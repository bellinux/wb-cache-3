5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, the RAN's combat {{strength}} numbered 150 {{ships with}} an additional 200 auxiliary craft with the service reaching its peak in June 1945, when it ranks swelled to 39,650 personnel. During the six years of war, the RAN lost three cruisers, four destroyers, two sloops, a corvette, and an auxiliary minesweeper to enemy action. Casualties included 1,740 personnel from the 19 ships sunk, and another 436 personnel killed aboard other ships or at other <b>posts.</b> <b>By</b> most measures, such losses were heavy for such a small service, representing over half its pre-war strength in ships and one-fifth in men. Against this the RAN destroyed one cruiser, an armed merchant raider, three destroyers or torpedo boats, a minesweeper, many light craft and seven submarines. It also destroyed or captured more than 150,000 tons of Axis merchant shipping and shot down {{more than a hundred}} aircraft. Although difficult to quantify the RAN also played a role in numerous other successes.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his victory}} against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, {{which he did}} on 13 October. He {{returned}} two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided to move against Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at Nabatieh on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, {{only to have the}} pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of Deir al-Qamar, while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> the Sublime Porte. Although, he could not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain.|$|E

25|$|In Conquest mode, {{players are}} {{required}} to capture and hold strategic points on the map, known in the game as command posts. Players capture command <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> standing near one until its holograph transitions to blue, indicating it is held by their forces. Players can capture both enemy command posts, which are designated red, and neutral command posts, which are white. For enemy command posts, enemy units can continue to spawn in the area until the post is denergized and turns white. When all command posts belong to a given team, a twenty-second timer begins in which the opposing team must deenergize a command post or they lose. Alternatively, if one team eliminates all opposing reinforcements, they win.|$|E
25|$|The first Chief Constable was Captain Samuel Meredith RN {{who placed}} an {{advertisement}} {{in the local}} paper to recruit 200 constables who were paid 17/6d a week. New constables were given their uniform and an instruction booklet and then sent off to work without any training or guidance. It wasn't until 1843 (and later 1855) that they were given training. Wiltshire Constabulary started operating from January 1840 and had filled almost all its <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> summertime. The Chief Constable spent {{the first months of}} his time visiting all the boroughs in Wiltshire, spending almost all his £400 salary on travel. The first ranks were only Constable and Superintendent, but Sergeant, Inspector, Detectives and five classes of Constable were later introduced.|$|E

25|$|A behind, worth 1 point, is scored {{when the}} ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> {{touching}} it with {{any part of the}} body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort to ensure that a goal is not scored) this is termed a rushed behind. As of the 2009 AFL season, a free kick is awarded against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Mubo raid, the unit {{moved to the}} nearby Markham valley on long range patrols. In January 1943, the 2/5th with the 2/7th flew to Wau {{airfield}} which was under Japanese attack. They went straight into action leaving the aircraft under fire, and repelled the Japanese invasion. Finally, in February 1943, exhausted from starvation, illness and injury, and beset by atrocious weather, they were withdrawn for rest, {{with the majority of}} the sick congregating at Wau, before being transported to Edie Creek at Kaindi to recuperate. On 20 March 1943, the 2/5th was ordered to return to the Markham area to conduct patrols around the Snake River and to prepare defensive positions. Throughout April they undertook active patrols with the 2/6th Battalion and established observation <b>posts.</b> <b>By</b> 21 April the lead elements of the 24th Battalion began arriving at Bulolo as the 3rd Division moved forward and prepared to relieve the forward Australian troops, including the 2/5th, which was subsequently withdrawn to Port Moresby after almost a year of continuous operations.|$|E

500|$|Human Rights Watch (HRW) {{states that}} {{all parties to}} the war seriously {{violated}} international laws governing war, causing many civilian casualties. HRW reported that no proof of intentional attacks on civilians by Georgian troops had been discovered. The South Ossetian parliament and several schools and nurseries were used as military positions or <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> South Ossetian troops and volunteer militias and targeted by Georgian artillery fire. Georgia stated that its attacks only intended to [...] "neutralize firing positions from where Georgian positions were being targeted". HRW documented witness accounts of the usage of civilian objects by South Ossetian fighters. Such usage made civilian objects permissible military aims, and HRW concluded that South Ossetian fighters put civilians at risk by setting up military positions near or in civilian structures. Georgia was responsible for indiscriminate attacks, with little concern for minimising civilian risk.|$|E
500|$|At {{the center}} of the French line, at Hoßkirch, [...] {{east-south-east}} of Ostrach, General Lefebvre's column attacked the Austrians in an action that lasted most of the day. The Austrian line included several seasoned Grenzer (border) regiments, the Vecsy Hussars, and some lancers; although Lefebvre's initial assault caused confusion in the Austrian ranks, the Lancers counter-attacked with ferocity and, joined by the Grenzers and the Hussars, pursued the French along the Ostrach river valley, and cut up four squadrons of the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs à Cheval. Lefebvre's column was forced out of the hamlet by the Austrians, who had four battalions, 1200horse, and six cannons. After bringing up additional reinforcements—several light artillery, Chasseurs à Cheval, Hussars, and the 17th Regiment of Dragoons, Lefebvre was able to take the village again. By 0500of 21March, however, he sent word to Jourdan that he was being attacked on all <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> the Austrians, and they must soon expect a general engagement.|$|E
500|$|... 34,000 {{members of}} the Civil Guards and 17,000 Assault Guards {{enforced}} security on election day, many freed from their regular <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> the carabineros. Six people were killed during the elections, and perhaps another 30 injured. Ballots were generally fair and {{in accordance with the}} 1931 constitution, although three cases of electoral fraud occurred. The first was in Galicia, in north-west Spain, and orchestrated by the incumbent government; [...] there also, in A Coruña, by the political left. The voting in Granada was forcibly (and unfairly) dominated by the government. In some villages, the police stopped anyone not wearing a collar from voting. Wherever the Socialists were poorly organised, farm workers continued to vote how they were told by their bosses or caciques. Similarly, some right-wing voters were put off from voting in strongly socialist areas. However, such instances were comparatively rare. The first results to be released, in the evening of the 14, from urban areas, were encouraging for the Popular Front.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} his tour as Director of Intelligence at AAF HQ {{at the end}} of 1944, Hewitt became acting Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in 1945. As AMP, Hewitt sat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. Along with {{the other members of the}} board, he reviewed the findings of the inquiry by Justice John Vincent Barry into the [...] "Morotai Mutiny", which had involved senior pilots of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF) attempting to resign their commissions to protest the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to strategically unimportant ground attack missions. Hewitt recommended that the AOC No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, be removed from command, along with his two senior staff officers. The majority of the Air Board saw no reason to take such action, leaving Hewitt to append a dissenting note to its decision. Drakeford supported Hewitt's position, and the three senior No.1 TAF officers were later dismissed from their <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> Air Vice Marshal Jones.|$|E
500|$|CPC general {{secretary}} Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng as [...] "paramount leader" [...] in the 1990s, and continued {{most of his}} policies. As part of Jiang Zemin's nominal legacy, the CPC ratified the Three Represents for the 2003 revision of the party's constitution, as a [...] "guiding ideology" [...] to encourage the party to represent [...] "advanced productive forces, the progressive course of China's culture, and the fundamental interests of the people." [...] The theory legitimized the entry of private business owners and bourgeois elements into the party. Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin's successor as paramount leader, took office in 2002. Unlike Mao, Deng and Jiang Zemin, Hu laid emphasis on collective leadership and opposed one-man dominance of the political system. The insistence on focusing on economic growth led {{to a wide range}} of serious social problems. To address these, Hu introduced two main ideological concepts: the Scientific Outlook on Development and Harmonious Socialist Society. Hu resigned from his post as CPC {{general secretary}} and Chairman of the CMC at the 18th National Congress held in 2012, and was succeeded in both <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> Xi Jinping.|$|E
500|$|Anglin officially {{endorsed}} Donald Trump {{for president}} in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to [...] "vote {{for the first time}} in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests". The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed [...] "Heil Donald Trump – The Ultimate Savior". According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump is unprecedented, as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians. In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and The Daily Stormer were mentioned by Lacy Clay, Democratic Representative from Missouri, as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter <b>posts</b> <b>by</b> white supremacists. [...] Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Huffington Post journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, while at the same time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs.|$|E
