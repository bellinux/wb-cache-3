60|$|Now then, {{since this}} porch was the common <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> for all worshippers, {{and the place}} also where they laid the beggars, {{it looks as if}} it were to be a type of the church's bosom for charity. Here the proselytes were entertained, here the beggars were relieved, and {{received}} alms. These gates were seldom shut; and the houses of Christian compassion should be always open. This therefore beautified this gate, as charity beautifies any of the churches. Largeness of heart, and tender compassion at the church-door, is excellent; it is the bond of perfectness (1 Cor 12:31, 13:1-4; Heb 13:1-3; John 5:6,7; Col 3:14).|$|E

This porch therefore was the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> in common for all, whether Jews or religious proselytes, who came to Jerusalem to worship (Acts 3:11, 5:12). 3. This porch had a door or gate belonging to it, but such as was seldom shut, except in declining times, or when men put themselves into a rage against those better than themselves (2 Chron 29:7; Acts 21:28-30). 4. this gate of this porch was called Beautiful, even the Beautiful gate of the temple, and was that at which the lame man lay, to beg for an alms of them that went in thither to worship (Acts 3:1,2,10).|$|E

In this urban space helmet it stands as a thoughtful sentinel to defend the territory. Piazza Umberto I becomes an area of services capable of hosting a multi-storey car park which offers, for its strategic position and the geometry of space, to serve as a support of the complex knot of collective public activities, trade and services included in the walls of the nearby historic town. The vast space of about 6,000 square meters will house, therefore, a two-level underground parking for a total of about 250 cars.

40|$|The {{notion of}} réception was first {{applied to the}} councils and, in the Orthodox Church, to the «non-reception» {{of the council of}} Florence by the {{entirety}} of the People of God. In modem Catholic theology, the notion of réception by the People of God had little place. However the Constitution «Lumen Gentium» (n° 12) contains the root of the idea. The notion of réception will also have to be applied to the bilateral talks between the Catholic Church and the other Christian Fellowships. In Tradition, that which is «received» must be founded on Scripture as interpreted by the councils and the fathers where the Roman magisterium plays a role. For Metropolitan John Zizioulas, the Church «receives» right from the outset and must continue to do so again. The Church, in the final analysis, receives Christ and his message.

40|$|The {{attention}} {{of the media and}} international news is addressed to the migration issues, just during the landings of illegal migrants, and especially when these landings are linked to the deaths of migrants. However, for nearly thirty years, Sicily, among the Southern European regions most affected by the phenomenon of migration flows, has assumed the role of “gate” which introduces to Europe from Africa, making a bridge among nearest worlds, but often extremely different. This condition is, in fact, a historical value, given that Sicily has always been the crossroads of migration flows among Mediterranean Europe, Asia and Africa which allowed the exchange among cultures, ethnicities and religions. When we talk about immigration in Sicily, therefore, we refer nowadays to a structural reality, which the Islanders have generally agreed with the sense of hospitality and openness. Over the last thirty years, however, this phenomenon, to the different ways with which often occurs (the territorial scale of the phenomenon, the considerable increase of flows, the different ethnic groups, emerging conflicts and latent ones, the inadequacy of policies etc.) and in relation to issues of inclusion/exclusion processes, poses many problems affecting even, from a social, spatial and economic point of view, urban and territorial planning (Sandercock, 2000; Lo Piccolo, 2006). In particular, the controversial experience <b>of</b> the migrants’ <b>reception</b> centers, expected by Italian laws for the state of emergency generated by great flows of migrants, produces a state of exception, characterized by the suspension of the rights/norms that is paradoxically legalized (Schmitt, 1922; Agamben, 2005). State of emergency and state of exception transform these centers in “juridically indistinct places” (Agamben, 2005), where migrants’ rights are temporally suspended. Agamben, in fact, argues that the state of exception, which {{was meant to be a}} provisional measure, became in the course of the twentieth century a normal paradigm of government in emergency conditions. The aim of this paper is to explore the controversial and unclear role that planning, as policies and spatial planning, carries out in the “migrants reception policies” related to realization <b>of</b> the <b>reception</b> centers. In these cases, planning is used as an instrument of oppression and exclusion (Sandercock 1998; Friedmann, 1973; Healey 1997), transforming the <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> in zones <b>of</b> subjugation and control...|$|R
40|$|The present study's {{objective}} was to analyze the procedures aimed at guaranteeing sanitary conditions when acquiring meat. The {{study was conducted with}} university restaurants of the Federal Institutions of Higher Education (IFES) located in the five regions of Brazil. Data were collected using a questionnaire and an evaluation list, which was available online to restaurant professionals. The results showed that restaurants chose one or two types of meat, the most frequent of which were beef and chicken. In restaurants managed by the IFES, the acquisition of raw material occurred by bidding. For vendor selection, the restaurants required product registration with the Inspection Service and requested regulation of the supplier by the Health Surveillance. Monitoring was carried out through a technical visit to the supplier and a review of the past records of the supplier. A higher percentage of restaurants in the Southeast region met appropriate sanitary and hygienic criteria for the receipt of meat, followed by the South, Midwest, Northeast and North. We conclude that restaurants meet most of the safety criteria set in the legislation. However, some weaknesses are evident in the physical and functional structure, the system of transportation of raw material and the records of control measures at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between marginalized individuals and space as it is represented in a selection of 20 th century Mexican novels. I focus on analyzing the differences and inequalities expressed within specific ethnic (indigenous), gender (feminine), sexuality (homosexual) and socioeconomic categories (the working class). I rely on national and urban theoretical discourses in order to distinguish and delineate the voices and minority perspectives that are ever present in Mexican culture. I argue that the individuals in these novels become subjected to multiple forms of marginality which ultimately shape the types of cartographies they construct. Additionally, I demonstrate how in the novels: Balún Canán, Oficio de tinieblas, Los albañiles, Chin chin el Teporocho, El vampiro de la Colonia Roma and Las púberes canéforas, these alternative discourses challenge and subvert the ethical values established and legitimized by an institutionalized patriarchal order. By constructing these cartographies {{they are not only}} able to survive within the spaces they inhabit but also contest and problematize pre-established notions of Mexico's national identity. In addition to analyzing urban spaces, I examine the interstices of domestic space; a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> and rebellious subversion of patriarchal regulations in the novels: Los recuerdos del porvenir, Como agua para chocolate, Dos Mujeres and La cresta de Ilión. I also focus on female characters who venture outside the private sphere of the home and into "public" spaces previously inaccessible to them in Hasta no verte Jesús mío, La insólita historia de la Santa de Cabora and Duerme. Ultimately, these novels reconfigure the parameters of traditional gender identities and demonstrate how various characters' subjectively create new meaning by re-mapping and dismantling the fixed and unitary nature of the official national discourse which they re-appropriate...|$|E

40|$|My {{doctoral}} {{research work}} {{is the product of}} my interest in the areas of literature, philosophy and biblical scholarship which has grown over the years. An interdisciplinary approach to the study of a biblical text is afforded in this dissertation. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, I shall discuss the theoretical grounds for the study of the Rezeptionsgeschichte of a biblical text. In chapter 1, I shall argue in favour of the rehistoricisation of biblical exegesis in the light of the concept of the historicity of understanding as proposed by Gadamer in his philosophical hermeneutics and by Jauss in his aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>reception.</b> In chapter 2, I shall survey the appropriation ofthese concepts and insights for biblical exegesis. The selection of these exegetical works represents various stages in their appropriation ranging from a sheer awareness of them to their methodological application. The contours <b>of</b> a Biblical <b>Reception</b> Theory shall be outlined in chapter 3. There I propose methodological guidelines for the study of the Rezeptiollsgeschichte of biblical texts based on the hypothetical reconstruction <b>of</b> their early <b>reception,</b> the encyclopaedic competence of their readers, and the recognition of the genres in which their various instances ofreception are given. The Rezeptiollsgeschichte of Romans 13. 1 - 7 can be described as an interplay between successive readings down the ages. Put differently, the history <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> a biblical text is an account of the concrete interaction between the effects of the text and its readers whose life-world is rooted in pragmatic history. In the second part of the dissertation I shall attempt to establish the various links and paradigm shifts between a selection of influential instances <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> Paul's paraenesis by comparing them in order to obtain a broader perspective of its Sac/teo In chapter 4, the selected instances <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> Rom. 13. 1 - 7 represent significant concerns which are part of the horizon of its contemporary readers. The reconstruction <b>of</b> an early <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> Paul's paraenesis is rendered in chapter 5. It is important to notice the hypothetical character of this reconstruction which is intended to facilitate the possibility of drawing productive comparisons with other instances <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> with the purpose of gaining a fresh perspective of its Sac/teo In chapter 6, significant instances <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> from the late 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd centuries shall be studied, namely, Clement's of Rome, Polycarp's, Irenaeus' and Origen's <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> Rom. 13. 1 - 7.
