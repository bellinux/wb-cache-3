40|$|The {{characteristics}} of municipal waste as a fuel is marked mainly by its hetero-geneous composition and relatively poor heating value. Two solutions {{have been proposed}} for its combustion, namely, in the form {{in which it is}} delivered, or after some type of preparation. Whichever solution is chosen, refuse boilers must contain certain features aimed specifically at the prevention of corrosion and fouling. Studies and investigations carried out over a 10 -year period have achieved installations characterized by high and stable efficiency, excellent availability, and low maintenance costs. After a research of curative measures to be applied to existing <b>plants</b> (<b>shield</b> block, refractory concrete), the survey has been directed towards a research of pre-ventive measures to be taken for new plants. These surveys have been principally based upon statistics in existing plants, evolution of the thermal balance-sheets in current operation, the physico-chemical analysis of fly ash, research of correlation between measurements of combustion chambers and phenomena of corrosion and fouling in convection banks.

40|$|Nuclear {{power plant}} {{radiation}} protection design features {{are based on}} radionuclide source terms derived from conservative assumptions that envelope expected operating experience. Two parameters that significantly affect the radionuclide concentrations in the source term are failed fuel fraction and effective fission product appearance rate coefficients. Failed fuel fraction may be a regulatory based assumption {{such as in the}} U. S. Appearance rate coefficients are not specified in regulatory requirements, but have been referenced to experimental data that is over 50 years old. No doubt the source terms are conservative as demonstrated by operating experience that has included failed fuel, but it may be too conservative leading to over-designed shielding for normal operations as an example. Design basis source term methodologies for normal operations had not advanced until EPRI published in 2015 an updated ANSI/ANS 18. 1 source term basis document. Our paper revisits the fission product appearance rate coefficients as applied in the derivation source terms following the original U. S. NRC NUREG- 0017 methodology.

40|$|To study {{functional}} {{relationships between}} the effects of solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) on {{different aspects of the}} physiology of a wild plant, we carried out exclusion experiments in the field with the summer annual Datura ferox L. Solar UV-B incident over Buenos Aires reduced daytime seedling emergence, inhibited stem elongation and leaf expansion, and tended to reduce biomass accumulation during early growth. However, UV-B had no effect on calculated net assimilation rate. Using a monoclonal antibody specific to the cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimer (CPD), we found that plants receiving full sunlight had more CPDs per unit of DNA than <b>plants</b> <b>shielded</b> from solar UV-B, but the positive correlation between UV-B and CPD burden tended to level off at high (near solar) UV-B levels. At our field site, Datura plants were consumed by leaf beetles (Coleoptera), and the proportion of plants attacked by insects declined with the amount of UV-B received during growth. Field experiments showed that plant exposure to solar UV-B reduced the likelihood of leaf beetle attack by one-half. Our results highlight the complexities associated with scaling plant responses to solar UV-B, because they show: (a) a lack of correspondence between UV-B effects on net assimilation rate and whole-plant growth rate, (b) nonlinear UV-B dose-response curves, and (c) UV-B effects of plant attractiveness to natural herbivores...|$|R

2500|$|The {{higher the}} energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the {{shielding}} made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the half value layer or HVL). For example, gamma rays that require [...] (0.4″) of lead to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by [...] of granite rock, 6cm (2½″) of concrete, or 9cm (3½″) of packed soil. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. Depleted uranium is used for shielding in portable gamma ray sources, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, as portable sources' shape resembles a sphere to some extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced by a factor of eight, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk). In a nuclear power <b>plant,</b> <b>shielding</b> can be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core.
