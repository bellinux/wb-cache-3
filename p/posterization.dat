40|$|The {{camera is}} one of the most precise {{instruments}} available to the artist for visual expression. Together with the artist's good sense for composition, the camera lens format helps in the elimination of distracting elements in the environment. By its very nature, the camera allows the artist to communicate clearly and simply. There are many photographic techniques available to the graphic artist today. The photographic image can be reproduced as <b>posterizations,</b> line resolutions, and literally hundreds of various screens which separate the photographic image into textures, colors, and patterns. Choosing which technique to use should be determined by what enhances the subject in relation to the concept. The majority of photographic techniques used today, produce flat two-dimensional effects. Very few techniques can add free-form shapes and three-dimensional qualities to the original photographic image. This abstract introduces a new technique in the area of photo-illustrative graphics. This unique process enhances the photographic image by the application of color, texture and form...|$|R

5000|$|The {{effect may}} be created deliberately, or happen accidentally. For artistic effect, most image editing {{programs}} provide a <b>posterization</b> feature, or photographic processes may be used.|$|E

50|$|More formally, this is downsampling in {{the time}} dimension, as it is {{reducing}} the resolution (precision of the input), not the bit rate (precision of the output, as in <b>posterization).</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 1968 he filmed Apex, with Rodolfo Musitelli {{and actress}} Adriana Lagomarsino. This {{was the first}} short in Cinemascope done in Uruguay using <b>posterization,</b> years before its use Andy Warhol in 1970.|$|E
50|$|While scaling a {{video signal}} does {{allow it to}} match {{the size of a}} {{particular}} display, the process can result in an increased number of visual artifacts in the signal, such as ringing and <b>posterization.</b>|$|E
50|$|A related {{capability}} is the <b>posterization</b> artistic effect, which also reduces {{the number of}} colors represented in an image. The difference between this and standard color quantization is that while in standard quantization the final palette is selected based upon a weighting of the prominence of existing colors in the image, <b>posterization</b> creates a palette of colors smoothly distributed across the spectrum represented in the image. Whereas with standard color quantization all of the final color values are ones {{that were in the}} original image, the color values in a posterized image may not have been present in the original image but are in between the original color values.|$|E
50|$|Temporal <b>posterization</b> is {{the visual}} effect of {{reducing}} the number of frames of video, while not reducing the speed at which it actually plays. This compares to regular <b>posterization,</b> where the number of individual color variations is reduced, while the overall range of colors is not. The motion effect is similar to the effect of a flashing strobe light, but without the contrast of bright and dark. Unlike a pulldown, the unused frames are simply discarded, and it is intended to be apparent (longer than the persistence of vision that video and motion pictures normally depend on). An animated GIF often looks posterized because of its normally-low frame rate.|$|E
50|$|When {{working in}} color spaces {{with such a}} large gamut, it is {{recommended}} to work in 16-bit color depth to avoid <b>posterization</b> effects. This will occur more frequently in 8-bit modes as the gradient steps are much larger.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>posterization</b> is {{used for}} tracing contour lines and vectorizing photo-realistic images. This tracing process starts with 1 bit per channel and {{advances}} to 4 bits per channel. As the bits per channel increases, the number of levels of lightness a color can display increases.|$|E
50|$|The {{higher the}} pixel {{resolution}} of a source file, {{the greater the}} detail that can be reproduced. However, such increase also requires a corresponding increase in screen ruling or the output will suffer from <b>posterization.</b> Therefore file resolution is matched to the output resolution.|$|E
50|$|<b>Posterization</b> is {{a process}} in {{photograph}} development which converts normal photographs into an image consisting of distinct, but flat, areas of different tones or colors. A posterized image often has the same general appearance, but portions of the original image that presented gradual transitions are replaced by abrupt changes in shading and gradation from one area of tone to another. Printing <b>posterization</b> from black and white requires density separations, which one then prints on the same piece of paper to create the whole image. Separations may be made by density or color, using different exposures. Density Separations may be created by printing three prints of the same picture, each at a different exposure time that will be combined for the final image.|$|E
5000|$|Higher image quality. Because all the {{calculations}} (such as applying gamma correction, demosaicing, white balance, brightness, contrast, etc...) {{used to generate}} pixel values (in RGB format for most images) are performed in one step on the base data, the resultant pixel values will be more accurate and exhibit less <b>posterization.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Reducing {{the color}} {{space to the}} most common colors in the image. The {{selected}} colors are specified in the color palette in the header of the compressed image. Each pixel just references the index of a color in the color palette, this method can be combined with dithering to avoid <b>posterization.</b>|$|E

Scottie Pippen won with a dunk on Patrick Ewing on May 20, 1994.|$|E
50|$|Unwanted <b>posterization,</b> {{also known}} as banding, may occur when the color depth, {{sometimes}} called bit depth, is insufficient to accurately sample a continuous gradation of color tone. As a result, a continuous gradient appears {{as a series of}} discrete steps or bands of color â€” hence the name. When discussing fixed pixel displays, such as LCD and plasma televisions, this effect is referred to as false contouring. Additionally, compression in image formats such as JPEG can also result in <b>posterization</b> when a smooth gradient of colour or luminosity is compressed into discrete quantized blocks with stepped gradients. The result may be compounded further by an optical illusion, called the Mach band illusion, in which each band appears to have an intensity gradient in the direction opposing the overall gradient. This problem may be resolved, in part, with dithering.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{transformations of}} the data, such as {{increasing}} {{the exposure of}} a dramatically under-exposed photo, result in fewer visible artifacts when done from raw data than when done from already rendered image files. Raw data leave more scope for both corrections and artistic manipulations, without resulting in images with visible flaws such as <b>posterization.</b>|$|E
50|$|High {{levels of}} noise {{are almost always}} undesirable, but there are cases when {{a certain amount of}} noise is useful, for example to prevent {{discretization}} artifacts (color banding or <b>posterization).</b> Some noise also increases acutance (apparent sharpness). Noise purposely added for such purposes is called dither; it improves the image perceptually, though it degrades the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
50|$|Vectorization {{is usually}} {{inappropriate}} for continuous tone images such as portraits. The result is often poor. For example, many different image tracing algorithms {{were applied to}} a 25 kB JPEG image. The resulting vector images are at least a factor of ten larger and may have pronounced <b>posterization</b> effects when {{a small number of}} colors are used.|$|E
50|$|Working spaces, such as sRGB, Adobe RGB or ProPhoto are color {{spaces that}} {{facilitate}} good results while editing. For instance, pixels with equal values of R,G,B should appear neutral. Using a large (gamut) working space {{will lead to}} <b>posterization,</b> while using a small working space will lead to clipping. This trade-off is a consideration for the critical image editor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Posterization</b> or {{posterisation}} of {{an image}} entails conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, with abrupt changes from one tone to another. This was originally done with photographic processes to create posters. It can now be done photographically or with digital image processing, and may be deliberate or an unintended artifact of color quantization.|$|E
50|$|In digital images, 48 bits per pixel, or 16 bits per {{each color}} channel (red, green and blue), {{is used for}} {{accurate}} processing. For the human eye, {{it is almost impossible}} to see any difference between such an image and a 24-bit image, but the existence of more shades of each of the three primary colors (65,536 as opposed to 256) means that more operations can be performed on the image without risk of noticeable banding or <b>posterization.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Shaders {{are used}} widely in cinema postprocessing, computer-generated imagery, {{and video games}} to produce a {{seemingly}} infinite range of effects. Beyond just simple lighting models, more complex uses include altering the hue, saturation, brightness or contrast of an image, producing blur, light bloom, volumetric lighting, normal mapping for depth effects, bokeh, cel shading, <b>posterization,</b> bump mapping, distortion, chroma keying (so-called [...] "bluescreen/greenscreen" [...] effects), edge detection and motion detection, psychedelic effects, and {{a wide range of}} others.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{vectorization}} {{programs will}} group same-color pixels into lines, curves, or outlined shapes. If each possible color is grouped {{into its own}} object, there can be {{an enormous number of}} objects. Instead, the user is asked to select a finite number of colors (usually less than 256), the image is reduced to using that many colors (this step is color quantization), and then the vectorization is done on the reduced image. For continuous tone images such as photographs, the result of color quantization is <b>posterization.</b> Gradient fills will also be posterized.|$|E
50|$|This {{is because}} a {{difference}} of 1 stop represents a doubling or halving of exposure. The next highest stop uses half of the remaining values, the next uses half of what is left and so on, such that the lowest stop uses {{only a small fraction}} of the tonal values available. This may result in a loss of tonal detail in the dark areas of a photograph and <b>posterization</b> during post-production. By deliberately exposing to the right and then stopping down afterwards (during processing) the maximum amount of information is retained.|$|E
5000|$|Most raw formats {{implement}} lossless {{data compression}} {{to reduce the}} size of the files without affecting image quality. But some others use lossy data compression where quantization and filtering is performed on the image data. Sonyâ€™s lossy 11+7 bit delta compression of raw data causes <b>posterization</b> under certain conditions. Several Nikon cameras let photographers choose between no compression, lossless compression or lossy compression for their raw images. Red Digital Cinema Camera Company introduced [...] REDCODE RAW with compression ratio from 3:1 to 18:1 which depends on resolution and frame rates.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{xerography}} and {{inkjet printing}} employ a halftone process and ink to reproduce digital images on paper, digital-C is a photographic continuous tone process rather than halftone or error diffusion which are common on offset press or ink-jet. The device natively supports 24-bit RGB raster files, and is capable printing vector based files when fronted by a photographic Raster Image Processor (RIP). 24 bit color continuous-tone devices use large multitudes of colors, up to 16,777,216, {{rather than the}} small number of colors available to 4-color press and 8-color ink-jet type devices. Therefore, <b>posterization</b> and banding are unlikely from these types of prints when provided with a file of good integrity. Due to slight halation of the light source, digital C-prints produced on high end equipment have true continuous tones not possible with images created with ink or pigments (due to CMYK halftone limitations).|$|E
