5|$|In 1921, brothers-in-law Rinzō Satake and Shōkō Sasaki {{consulted}} with Kanae {{to develop a}} <b>pastel</b> crayon with an oil binder; development took three years and resulted in the world's first oil <b>pastel,</b> marketed under the name Cray-Pas through the Sakura Color Products Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Although known {{mostly for}} his work in black and white, Koppelman's painterly {{interest}} in color took a new form in the 1970s, when he began using color in his prints. After 1980, he worked increasingly in <b>pastel</b> and watercolor.|$|E
5|$|Batik Banten employs bright <b>pastel</b> colours and {{represents}} {{a revival of}} a lost art from the Sultanate of Banten, rediscovered through archaeological work during 2002–2004. Twelve motifs from locations such as Surosowan and several other places have been identified.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>Pastels.</b> <b>Pastels</b> that are made of pigment {{particles}} bound together with a binding agent, and oil <b>pastels</b> that have pigments mixed with wax and non-drying oil. <b>Pastels</b> that are pigment particles bound together take on a more chalky and loose powdery characterization, and are secured to its supports using fixative or diluted resin in solution. Oil <b>pastels</b> never fully dry, and are sensitive to scrapes, dust and dirt.|$|R

50|$|The Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art has {{a notable}} {{collection}} of plein-air <b>pastels</b> by Theodore Lukits. These have {{been central to}} two exhibitions at SAMA, one in 1999, devoted to landscape <b>pastels,</b> {{and the other in}} 2008, which featured watercolors and <b>pastels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The game {{retains the}} classic <b>pastel</b> / crayon visuals from its predecessor. Small changes are {{noticeable}} — water animation has been improved, the black outlines around objects {{are not as}} thick and the backgrounds are less cluttered; but the visuals are still tightly-centered on those of the SNES game.|$|E
5|$|Dylan's second {{show at the}} Gagosian Gallery, Revisionist Art, {{opened in}} November 2012. The show {{consisted}} of thirty paintings, transforming and satirizing popular magazines, including Playboy and Babytalk. In February 2013, Dylan exhibited the New Orleans Series of paintings at the Palazzo Reale in Milan. In August 2013, Britain's National Portrait Gallery in London hosted Dylan's first major UK exhibition, Face Value, featuring twelve <b>pastel</b> portraits.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Misako Aoki in 2015, Kurosaki discussed the influence of lolita fashion on her work. Her life changed when she encountered lolita fashion, and modeling in the style would broaden her world {{and give her a}} sense of comfort. Kurosaki was inspired by the film Legally Blonde because of the film's main character always wearing what she wants to wear, and how the main character's bedroom is colored <b>pastel</b> pink, a color scheme that Kurosaki liked.|$|E
50|$|Russell {{was born}} in London, and was the {{daughter}} of painter John Russell. She produced copies of her father's <b>pastels</b> {{as well as those of}} Rosalba Carriera, and was said to assist her father not only in his painting but also in making his <b>pastels.</b> Her siblings were also artists; William and Jane produced <b>pastels,</b> while Maria was a watercolorist. A variety of <b>pastels</b> by her hand, largely copies of the work of other artists, are known to survive.|$|R

5000|$|The surface {{chosen for}} oil <b>pastels</b> {{can have a}} very {{dramatic}} effect on the final painting. Paper is a common surface but this medium {{can be used on}} other surfaces including wood, metal, hardboard (often known as [...] "masonite"), MDF, canvas and glass. Many companies make papers specifically for <b>pastels</b> that are suitable for use with oil <b>pastels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most modern cultivars lack any {{fragrance}} although 'Dancing Queen' {{represents an}} exception. Fragrance is genetically related to flower colour (white, or <b>pastel</b> shades) {{and is a}} recessive characteristic, so that when fragrant and non fragrant varieties are crossed, not all progeny will be fragrant, whereas two fragrant progenitors will produce an all fragrant progeny.|$|E
5|$|On {{the corner}} pendentives, {{each of which}} depicts a violent subject, {{the removal of the}} carbon black has diminished the {{dramatic}} intensity of all four scenes. This is particularly noticeable in the loss of depth in the Punishment of Haman. Where once the figure projected starkly against the darkly shadowed interior, now foreshortening, definition and drama is lost in the <b>pastel</b> monotone that remains.|$|E
5|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed with}} their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, Sylvania introduced fluorescent <b>pastel</b> lights. In 1955, NOMA manufactured flashing lights. In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy Lights were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|The Alonzo Gallery {{closed in}} 1980, and in 1981 Clutz became {{represented}} by the nearby 57th St. Tatistcheff Gallery. He exhibited <b>pastels</b> often there in group and solo shows. Clutz left the gallery because he {{was more interested in}} showing paintings rather than <b>pastels.</b> After leaving Tatistcheff, Clutz continued to show <b>pastels</b> in Los Angeles at Terrence Rogers Fine Art.|$|R
5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a 1944 {{triptych}} {{painted by}} the Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon. The canvasses {{are based on}} the Eumenides—or Furies—of Aeschylus's Oresteia, and depict three writhing anthropomorphic creatures set against a flat burnt orange background. It was executed in oil paint and <b>pastel</b> on Sundeala fibre board and completed within two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Coggins was a {{signature}} member and Master Pastelist of the <b>Pastel</b> Society of America, a Fellow of the American Society of Marine Artists, {{a member of}} the American Ordnance Association, the U.S. Naval Institute, and an adviser to the boards of the Philadelphia Maritime Museum and the Reading Public Museum. He died at his home in Berks County, Pennsylvania at the age of 94 and willed his body to medical science. Alma Wood-Coggins died March 4, 2007. Jack and Alma Coggins had no children and were survived by several nieces and nephews.|$|E
5|$|Coggins's {{work has}} been {{accepted}} for show by the American Watercolor Society, the Salmagundi Club, the American Artist Professional League, and the <b>Pastel</b> Society of America. Coggins received a number of awards and accolades during his career, including the American Revolution Round Table Award in 1969, the Daniel Boone National Foundation's Americanism Award in 1985, the Mystic Maritime Gallery's Purchase Award in 1989, the International Maritime Exhibition's Rudolph Shaeffer Award from 1987 to 1990, and Berks Art Council's Pagoda Award in 1995. In 2000, he was inducted to the International Association of Astronomical Artists Hall of Fame as a Living Legend and celebrated master of the genre of Space Art.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s, Clutz {{continued}} to sell many <b>pastels</b> and paintings through the Alonzo Gallery on 57th Street. [...] Many of these <b>pastels</b> were shown in his exhibition in the Walther-Rathenau-Saal, Berlin 1978.|$|R
5000|$|Hard pastels: These have {{a higher}} portion of binder and less pigment, {{producing}} a sharp drawing material that is useful for fine details. These {{can be used with}} other <b>pastels</b> for drawing outlines and adding accents. Hard <b>pastels</b> are traditionally used to create the preliminary sketching out of a composition. However, the colors are less brilliant and are available in a restricted range in contrast to soft <b>pastels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} is a portrait in tempera grassa on paper on panel. Elizabeth is depicted wearing the red robes of the Order of the British Empire. 18 sittings were held over eight months between the Queen and Annigoni; {{the first eight}} sittings resulted in a large oil and <b>pastel</b> study that was later bought from Annigoni's family by Elizabeth in 2006. A photograph by Cecil Beaton in which Elizabeth wears the red Order of the British Empire robes has been considered {{as a source for}} the portrait.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} in Europe, Fuller had great success. After a <b>pastel</b> {{portrait}} of hers was accepted for the Paris Salon in 1895, two of her paintings were shown there in 1896. That was followed by another, La Glaneuse, in 1897, in which year {{she also had a}} work accepted by the Royal Academy in London. She exhibited in many other locations: the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and Manchester Art Gallery in England, as well as the Victorian Artists Society and the New South Wales Society of Artists, and at the Melbourne studio of Jane Sutherland. There was even a painting, Landscape, hung in the exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Bendigo. Not all her time was spent in Europe, however; in 1899 she returned to South Africa to paint Cecil Rhodes. One source suggests that she ultimately prepared five portraits of the founder of Rhodesia. A later newspaper report stated that Fuller also travelled and made sketches in Wales, Ireland, and Italy.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with <b>pastel</b> work than with oil painting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pastels</b> {{have been}} favored by many modern artists {{because of the}} medium's broad range of bright colors. Modern notable artists who have worked {{extensively}} in <b>pastels</b> include Fernando Botero, Francesco Clemente, Daniel Greene, Wolf Kahn, and R. B. Kitaj.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to painting portrait miniatures, Shirreff also produced <b>pastels</b> {{in his early}} years. Shirreff successfully exhibited oil paintings, <b>pastels,</b> and pencil drawings at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1771, and at the Free Society of Artists from 1770 until 1773.|$|R
5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a <b>pastel</b> blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and sunglasses in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared the sofa in the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E
5|$|The Bogdan-Pitești trust {{included}} many samples of Luchian's art. Two {{of his famous}} paintings featured there were Lăutul ("Washing the Hair")—which Bogdan-Pitești {{is said to have}} likened to the luminous oil paintings of Paolo Veronese, and Safta Florăreasa ("Safta the Flower Girl")—originally part of the Luchian family collection. Also included was the 1907 oil portrait of Luchian's cousin, Alecu Literatu ("Alecu the Literary Man"). They were accompanied by the 1906 <b>pastel</b> Durerea ("Pain"), which had been reproduced in a 1914 issue of Seara, and by the paintings De Nămezi ("Lunchtime") and Lica, fetița cu portocala ("Lica, the Girl with the Orange"). Among the works in the series were two portraits of Bogdan-Pitești: an ink drawing, copies of which were circulated with Bogdan-Pitești's election manifesto of 1899, and a since-lost oil painting.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted <b>pastel</b> sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a red car into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{paintings}} and <b>pastels</b> depict themes inspired by Dalton Brown's 2015 Visiting Artist Residency at the American Academy in Rome. <b>Pastels</b> like American Academy in Rome #7, 2015 extend ideas {{begun in the}} 1990s in Italy in works such as Tuscan Patio, 1994.|$|R
