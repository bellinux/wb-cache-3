The Navy SNF has been considered for disposal at the potential Yucca Mountain site. For some <b>waste</b> <b>packages,</b> the containment may breach (Ref. 3), allowing the influx of water.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to estimate the probability of misloading a commercial spent nuclear fuel <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> with a fuel assembly(s) that has a reactivity (i. e., enrichment and/or burnup) outside the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> design. The <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> designs {{are based on the}} expected commercial spent nuclear fuel assemblies and previous analyses (Macheret, P. 2001, Section 4. 1 and Table 1). For this calculation, a misloaded <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> is defined as a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> that has a fuel assembly(s) loaded into it with an enrichment and/or burnup outside the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> design. An example of this type of misload is a fuel assembly designated for the 21 -PWR Control Rod <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> being incorrectly loaded into a 21 -PWR Absorber Plate <b>waste</b> <b>package.</b> This constitutes a misloaded 21 -PWR Absorber Plate <b>waste</b> <b>package,</b> because the reactivity (i. e., enrichment and/or burnup) of a 21 -PWR Control Rod <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> fuel assembly is outside the design of a 21 -PWR Absorber Plate <b>waste</b> <b>package.</b> These types of misloads (i. e., fuel assembly with enrichment and/or burnup outside <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> design) are the only types that are evaluated in this calculation. This calculation utilizes information from ''Frequency of SNF Misload for Uncanistered Fuel Waste Package'' (CRWMS M&O 1998) as the starting point. The scope of this calculation is limited to the information available.

40|$|The various {{layers of}} {{material}} from the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> (such as components of the engineered barrier system and the host rock surface) to a given distance within the rock wall at a given distance {{can be described as}} concentric circles with varying thermal properties (see Figure 5. 1 - 1). The selected model approach examines the contributions of the <b>waste</b> <b>package,</b> axial <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> neighbors and lateral neighboring emplacement drifts (see Section 5. 2. 1 and Appendix H, Section 2). In clay and deep borehole media, the peak temperature is driven by the central <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> whereas, in granite and salt, the contribution to the temperature rise by adjacent (lateral) <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> in drift or emplacement borehole lines is dominant {{at the time of the}} peak temperature. Mathematical models generated using Mathcad software provide insight into the effects of changing <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing for six waste forms, namely UOX, MOX, co-extraction, new extraction, E-Chem ceramic and E-Chem metal in four different geologic media (granite, clay, salt and deep borehole). Each scenario includes thermal conductivity and diffusivity for each layer between the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> and the host rock, dimensions of representative repository designs (such as <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing, drift or emplacement borehole spacing, <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> dimensions and layer thickness), and decay heat curves generated from knowledge of the contents of a given waste form after 10, 50, 100 and 200 years of surface storage. Key results generated for each scenario include rock temperature at a given time calculated at a given radius from the central <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> (Section 5. 2. 1 and Appendix H, Section 3), the corresponding temperature at the interface of the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> and EBS material, and at each EBS layer in between (Section 5. 2. 2 and Appendix H, Section 4). This information is vital to understand the implications of repository design (<b>waste</b> <b>package</b> capacity, surface storage time, <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing, and emplacement drift or borehole spacing) by comparing the peak temperature to the thermal limits of the concentric layers surrounding the waste package; specifically 100 C for the bentonite buffer in granite and clay repositories, 100 C for rock wall in a clay repository and 200 C at the rock wall for a salt repository. These thermal limits are both preliminary and approximate, and serve as a means to evaluate design options rather than determining compliance for licensing situations. The thermal behavior of a salt repository is more difficult to model because it is not a concentric geometry and because the crushed salt backfill initially has a much higher thermal resistance than intact salt. Three models were investigated, namely a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in complete contact with crushed salt, secondly a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in contact with intact salt, and thirdly a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in contact with 75 % intact and 25 % crushed salt. The latter model best depicts emplacement of a <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in the corner of an intact salt alcove and subsequently covered with crushed salt backfill to the angle of repose. The most conservative model (crushed salt) had temperatures much higher than the other models and although bounding, is too conservative to use. The most realistic model (75 / 25) had only a small temperature difference from the simplest (non-conservative, intact salt) model, and is the one chosen in this report (see Section 5. 2. 3). A trade-study investigating three key variables (surface storage time, <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> capacity and <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing) is important to understand and design a repository. <b>Waste</b> <b>package</b> heat can be reduced by storing for longer periods prior to emplacement, or by reducing the number of assemblies or canisters within that <b>waste</b> <b>package.</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing can be altered to optimize the thermal load without exceeding the thermal limits of the host rock or EBS components. By examining each of these variables, repository footprint (and therefore cost) can be optimized. For this report, the layout was fixed for each geologic medium based on prior published designs in the international community, but it will be varied in future work. Section 5. 2. 4 summarizes the conclusions based on varying two of the three parameters (storage time and <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> capacity), and the results are shown in Appendix H, Sections 5 and 6...|$|R

During the operational period, the barriers will function as vessels for handling, emplacement, and waste retrieval (if necessary). During the years following repository closure, the containment barriers will be relied upon to provide substantially complete containment, through 10, 000 years and beyond. Following the substantially complete containment phase, the barriers and the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> internal structures help minimize release of radionuclides by aqueous- and gaseous-phase transport.
