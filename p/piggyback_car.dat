50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of , the #17 was out switching coal hoppers when the dry-pipe inside the boiler suddenly collapsed and indefinitely put the engine out of service unless another major overhaul could be performed on it. The CO&E Railroad's fame of pulling common carrier freight trains, including intermodal <b>piggyback</b> <b>cars,</b> with a steam locomotive finally {{came to an abrupt}} end due to this incident. The incident also marked {{the end of an era}} for American-wide railroading in general.|$|R
50|$|Santa Fe tried {{high-speed}} freight {{operations on}} its Illinois Division in late 1966. By year's end, passenger-geared GE U28CG locomotives took 19 <b>piggyback</b> <b>cars</b> from L.A.'s Hobart Yard to Chicago in 61 hours. On June 8, 1967 a joint run using New York Central's Flexi-Van container cars traveled from New York City to Los Angeles in 54 hours, 21 minutes. The Super C carried high-priority {{items such as}} auto parts and electronic components; the United States Post Office soon became a consistent customer. It was allowed 79 mph.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the opening}} of the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 1980, the Swiss Federal Railways offered <b>piggyback</b> {{services}} for <b>cars</b> and trucks through the Gotthard Tunnel. Today, that service exists as the rolling highway from the German to the Italian border and aims to reduce truck traffic on Swiss expressways. An improvisational piggyback service from GÃ¶schenen to Airolo was offered during the two-month closure of the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 2001.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a conceptual {{design for a}} High Level Waste disposal system for fuel discharged by U. S. commercial power reactors, using the Yucca Mountain repository site recently designated by federal legislation. It represents the results of approximately 2000 person-hours of work by {{students enrolled in the}} combined undergraduate and graduate design subjects 22. 033 / 22. 33 of the M. I. T. Nuclear Engineering Department during Spring Term 1988. Principal features of the resulting conceptual design include - use of unit trains (including <b>piggyback</b> <b>cars</b> for truck cask transporters where required) for periodic (once every ten years at each reactor) removal of old (cooled > 10 yrs.) spent fuel from at-reactor storage facilities - buffer storage at the repository site using dual purpose transportation/storage casks of the CASTOR V/ 21 type - repackaging of the spent fuel from the dual purpose transportation/storage casks directly into special-alloy disposal canisters as intact fuel assemblies, without rod consolidation - emplacement into a repository of modular design having a maximum total capacity of 150, 000 MT and an annual handling capability of 4000 MT/yr - use of excavation techniques that minimize disturbance, both mechanical and chemical,to the geologic environment - Incoloy 825 waste canisters arrayed to provide 57 kW/acre thermal loading optimized to the projected inventories - include a unit rail mounted vehicle for both the transportation and emplacement of the canister from the surface facilities to the underground repository - cost-effectiveness of the Yucca Mountain Site Criteria was studied via: a computer model, "WADCOM-II - Waste Disposal Cost Model II"; and an independent cost evaluation by the members of the design team. The total system cost (in constant 1988 dollars) was 1. 9 billion dollars by WADCOM-II, and 5. 3 billion dollars from the independent cost evaluation, resulting in a levelized disposal cost of 0. 2 mills/kW-hr by WADCOM-II and 0. 55 mills/kW-hr by the independent cost evaluation.
