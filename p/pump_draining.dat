Wolstanton had shafts descending up to 3,000 feet (914 metres), and as it was the last working pit in the area, it was responsible for pumping. This had a direct effect on Chatterley Whitfield as it was high at 2,000 feet (610 metres) the <b>pumping</b> <b>drained</b> the ‘Higher’.|$|R

50|$|To the east, {{the parish}} {{boundary}} runs {{for a short}} distance against the River Witham and the North Hykeham <b>Pump</b> <b>Drain,</b> where it borders Waddington. It deviates to the west from the Witham, following the <b>Pump</b> <b>Drain,</b> then follows the Witham further south from Hykeham Bridge for 0.5 mi. To the south it follows The Beck, with South Hykeham to the south, and passes {{to the south of}} Grange Farm. it crosses Newark Road (A1434) at Ascot Way. At Pike Drain, near the Sailing Club and Teal Lake, it borders Doddington and Whisby. Directly north of the Sailing Club, it crosses the railway, then crosses the A46 bypass to the north-west. It passes through the middle of West Lodge Game Farm and on the eastern edge of Coronation Plantation. South-west of the A46 Doddington Road roundabout, the parish meets Lincoln, becoming the North Kesteven boundary. The boundary crosses the A46 just south of the roundabout, following Prial Drain. The parish includes the Lyndon Business Park next to the A46, the factory units on Whisby Road and the Hotel Ibis on Runcorn Road. Although Prial Drain crosses Doddington Road (B1190), the boundary deviates to the east, following the road to the south, just north of the transport museum, to the railway line. It leaves the railway line on {{the eastern edge of the}} lakes, and runs straight through a housing estate to meet Tritton Road (B1003). It crosses the A1434 at the Tritton Road junction. South-east, it crosses Hykeham Road, and passes just north of Conway Drive to the river.|$|R

5000|$|An {{interesting}} consequence {{arises from}} basic algebra in problems where people or systems work together. As an example, if a gas-powered <b>pump</b> can <b>drain</b> a pool in 4 hours and a battery-powered <b>pump</b> can <b>drain</b> the same pool in 6 hours, {{then it will}} take both pumps , which is equal to 2.4 hours, to drain the pool together. Interestingly, this is one-half of the harmonic mean of 6 and 4: [...] That is the appropriate average for {{the two types of}} pump is the harmonic mean, and with one pair of pumps (two pumps) it takes half this harmonic mean time, while with two pairs of pumps (four pumps) it would take a quarter of this harmonic mean time.|$|R

2500|$|The Brandon {{site was}} finally {{abandoned}} in the 1950s. The White House drain, which supplied it, had become steadily deeper as the land surface had sunk, and the soil through which it ran was unstable, requiring regular maintenance to prevent slippage. The pumping station was effectively {{on top of a}} hill, rather than being at the lowest part of the Fen, and so a decision was taken to construct a new pumping station at Whitehall on the River Great Ouse, which required the construction of [...] of main <b>pumping</b> <b>drain,</b> to connect it to the existing drains. Two [...] electric motors with vertical spindle axial flow pumps were supplied by W. H. Allen Sons and Company Ltd, and the station was opened on 10 September 1958.|$|R

2500|$|The Lark Engine {{pumping station}} was {{upgraded}} again in 1974. The Blackstone engine was retired but kept intact {{as part of}} the history of the district, the Crossley engine became the standby, and the Crossley enginehouse was extended to allow the installation of a [...] Dorman diesel engine, which drives a [...] Allen Gwynne vertical spindle pump. The work included the provision of a wooden plaque, showing all of the engines which had been installed since the opening of the station in 1842, which was unveiled by Mrs F. G. Starling at the formal opening held on 25 May 1976. Further improvements followed, when negotiations with British Rail resulted in the skew bridge, which carried the Ely to Norwich line over the main drain being demolished and replaced by a culvert. This action allowed the main <b>pumping</b> <b>drain</b> to the Lark Engine to be made deeper and wider, improving flows between the two halves of Burnt Fen.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Trees {{transport}} water from their roots to their leaves {{thanks to an}} efficient but vulnerable vascular system. Assessing the vulnerability to drought of the xylem {{and its ability to}} recover from failure are not an easy task but recent findings demonstrate that, contrary to what is commonly believed, hydraulic failure and embolism repair are not routine in trees. Trees are amazing organisms. They have the capacity to pull tons of water up to 100 meters above ground, when the best engineered suction pumps are limited to 10 meters at most. Indeed, above 10 meters, the pull of gravity exceeds the atmospheric pressure, the pressure {{at the top of the}} water column then becomes negative and metastable and <b>pumps</b> <b>drain</b> by vaporization or cavitation. How trees cope with cavitation? Are they astonishingly immune to this breakdown or do they possess remarkable repair capacities? These questions were asked when the mechanism of sap ascent in trees was unraveled in the late 19 th (Brown 2013), and were first answered only when reliable methods for measuring cavitation were introduced a century later. This early work showed that trees suffer cavitation under severe drought only. During the past decade, numerous studies have questioned our former understanding of tre...|$|R
50|$|During {{a normal}} cycle, most Whirlpool-built wig-wag {{equipped}} washers will fill, start the motor, then engage the wash solenoid. Upon {{completion of the}} wash mode, the wash (agitate) solenoid will be turned off, which will allow the <b>pump</b> to <b>drain</b> the tub. After a minute or two, the timer will then engage the spin wig-wag which will cause {{the rotation of the}} tub. This is in contrast to most other top-load washing machines which start spinning and draining simultaneously. There are no pauses between cycles in these machines.|$|R
