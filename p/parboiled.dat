5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} <b>parboiled</b> before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are <b>parboiled</b> or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and <b>parboiled</b> twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{a popular}} form, <b>parboiled</b> rice (also known as {{converted}} rice) {{is subjected to}} a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, {{and the color of}} the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled <b>parboiled</b> rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially thiamine) to move into the endosperm, so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. <b>Parboiled</b> rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming <b>parboiled</b> rice.|$|E
25|$|Instant rice {{differs from}} <b>parboiled</b> rice {{in that it}} is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a {{significant}} degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and starch often are used in batters and breadings to increase crispiness.|$|E
25|$|Pullao {{is made by}} cooking meat in ghee {{with warm}} {{aromatic}} spices until the meat is tender, then adding rice and cooking in the sealed pot over low heat till done. With biryani, the rice is boiled or <b>parboiled</b> separately in spiced water and then layered with meat curry or marinade (depending {{on the type of}} biryani), then sealed and cooked over low heat until done. The vegetarian version is called tehri.|$|E
25|$|Couscous is {{distinct}} from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, {{in that it is}} made from crushed durum wheat semolina, while pasta is made from ground wheat. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined. Pasta is cooked by boiling and couscous is steamed. Burghul or bulgur is a kind of <b>parboiled</b> dried cracked wheat of similar size to couscous, cooked by adding boiling water and leaving for a few minutes to soften.|$|E
25|$|Once {{separated}} from the stalks, the grain was used {{in a number of}} ways: Most simply, unripe kernels of grain were eaten fresh, particularly in the spring, before ripe grain was available, and both unripe and ripe grain was roasted over fire for immediate use. Ripe grains of wheat were also <b>parboiled</b> and dried, like modern bulgur, and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used to make gruel and in stews. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread.|$|E
25|$|Major {{importers}} usually include Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brazil {{and some}} African and Persian Gulf countries. In common with other West African countries, Nigeria is actively promoting domestic production. However, its very heavy import duties (110%) open it to smuggling from neighboring countries. <b>Parboiled</b> rice is particularly popular in Nigeria. Although China and India {{are the two}} largest producers of rice in the world, both countries consume {{the majority of the}} rice produced domestically, leaving little to be traded internationally.|$|E
25|$|Oyster {{mushrooms}} are <b>parboiled</b> in salted boiling water, slightly pressed to squeeze water, torn by their grain, and seasoned. Dried shiitake {{mushrooms are}} soaked in lukewarm water, {{and if a}} small amount of sugar is added to the water, that helps the mushrooms to rehydrate more quickly. The stipes of the mushroom are taken out, and the caps are shredded and seasoned. Green chili peppers are seeded and chopped and onions and carrots are chopped into pieces {{the same size as the}} peppers. Scallions are cut into long diagonal strips.|$|E
25|$|Raw wheat can {{be ground}} into flour or, using hard durum wheat only, can be ground into semolina; germinated and dried {{creating}} malt; crushed or cut into cracked wheat; <b>parboiled</b> (or steamed), dried, crushed and de-branned into bulgur {{also known as}} groats. If the raw wheat is broken into parts at the mill, as is usually done, the outer husk or bran can be used several ways. Wheat is a major ingredient in such foods as bread, porridge, crackers, biscuits, Muesli, pancakes, pies, pastries, cakes, cookies, muffins, rolls, doughnuts, gravy, beer, vodka, boza (a fermented beverage), and breakfast cereals.|$|E
25|$|Either by hand or in a rice polisher, {{white rice}} may be buffed with glucose or talc powder (often called {{polished}} rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), <b>parboiled,</b> or processed into flour. White rice {{may also be}} enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.|$|E
25|$|In the Goa, Udupi and Mangalore districts, {{people usually}} eat rice ganji in a variant manner made by Kannada-speaking, Tulu-speaking or Konkani {{people in and}} around Udupi and Mangalore (Karnataka, South India). There, <b>parboiled</b> rice (kocheel akki in Kannada, oorpel aari for black rice, bolenta aari for white rice in Tulu or ukde tandool in Konkani) is steamed with {{a large amount of}} water. Jain ganji matt are famous in these districts. Usually, simple ganji with pickle and milk are served, in jain matts. Fresh coconut is grated, and the {{resulting}} milk skimmed and added to the ganji (called paez or pyaaz in Konkani), which is served hot with fish curry, coconut chutney, or Indian pickles. In Goa, it is normally served with dried or fresh cooked fish, papad or vegetables.|$|E
25|$|However, durum {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or <b>parboiled</b> and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (<b>parboiled)</b> prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 37, 15, 1991 Egg white and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin-binding proteins, which are required for storage of free riboflavin in the egg {{for use by the}} developing embryo.|$|E
500|$|No records {{exist to}} {{demonstrate}} {{exactly how the}} corpse was quartered, although an engraving of the quartering of Sir Thomas Armstrong in 1684 shows the executioner making vertical cuts through the spine and removing the legs at the hip. The distribution of Dafydd ap Gruffydd's remains was described by Herbert Maxwell: [...] "the right arm with a ring on the finger in York; the left arm in Bristol; the right leg and hip at Northampton; the left [...] at Hereford. [...] But the villain's head was bound with iron, lest it should fall to pieces from putrefaction, and set conspicuously upon a long spear-shaft for the mockery of London." [...] After the execution in 1660 {{of several of the}} regicides involved in the death of King Charles I eleven years earlier, the diarist John Evelyn remarked: [...] "I saw not their execution, but met their quarters, mangled, and cut, and reeking, as they were brought from the gallows in baskets on the hurdle." [...] Such remains were typically <b>parboiled</b> and displayed as a gruesome reminder of the penalty for high treason, usually wherever the traitor had conspired or found support. [...] Salt and cumin seed would be added during the boiling process: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the cumin seed to prevent birds pecking at the flesh.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the failed}} Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, almost 1,400rebels {{involved}} in the plot to overthrow Charles' brother, King James II, were charged with treason, and tried during {{what became known as}} the Bloody Assizes. [...] In less than a month over 200of them were hanged, drawn and quartered. [...] Their remains were <b>parboiled,</b> tarred, and displayed on poles, trees and lampposts; only when James conducted a progress through the area were they removed and buried. [...] James was, however, the last Catholic monarch to reign over the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, abdicating during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. [...] During Charles' reign it was made treason to imagine any physical injury to the king, but in 1702, according to the Act of Settlement, the offence was expanded to include interference with the succession. [...] Asserting the right to the throne of anyone outside the line of succession became an offence in 1707. [...] The 1715 Riot Act allowed the government to treat rioters as felons, dispensing with the requirement under the 1351 act to use constructive treason.|$|E

60|$|I saw an {{abandoned}} boat, {{very small and}} remote, drifting down-stream; and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, {{as well as my}} <b>parboiled</b> hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well understand. I followed the river, because I considered that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.|$|E

I longed for a white vest but did not attain to that splendor.|$|E
60|$|The {{arrival of}} M. Blériot {{suggests}} most horribly {{to me how}} far behind we must be in all matters of ingenuity, device, and mechanical contrivance. I am reminded again of the days during the Boer war, when one realised that {{it had never occurred}} to our happy-go-lucky Army that it was possible to make a military use of barbed wire or construct a trench to defy shrapnel. Suppose in the North Sea we got a surprise like that, and fished out a <b>parboiled,</b> half-drowned admiral explaining what a confoundedly slim, unexpected, almost ungentlemanly thing the enemy had done to him.|$|E
60|$|First I found Robert Lanfranc, and, next, Henry Bohemond. But before I {{found them}} I {{encountered}} a windlestraw which showed which way blew {{the wind and}} gave promise of a very gale.

His blue eyes, small and pinched close to ether, were likewise red, at least in the whites of them; and his skin, of the sort that goes with such types, was red and freckled. He had quite a <b>parboiled</b> appearance.|$|E

They told me, when I got down among the people again, that the black's face had been dilated with delight the whole time, though he stood fairly exposed to musketry, his mouth grinning from ear to ear. Neb was justly elated with the success that attended this exhibition of his skill, and described the retreat of our enemies with a humour and relish that raised many a laugh at the discomfited privateersman.

He promised himself to write to her, and beg her not to care for him, because he was not worthy of that. He framed a letter in his mind, in which he posed in some noble attitudes, and brought tears into his eyes by his magnanimous appeal to her not to suffer for the sake of one so unworthy of her serious thought. He pictured her greatly moved by some of the phrases, and he composed for her a reply, which led to another letter from him, and so to a correspondence and a long and tender friendship. In the end he died suddenly, and then she discovered that she had always loved him. He discovered that he was playing the fool again, and he rose from the berth where he had tumbled himself.
