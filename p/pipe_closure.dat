40|$|Selecting {{one from}} several {{available}} fluid samples is a procedure often performed especially in chemical engineering. It is usually done by {{an array of}} valves sequentially opened and closed. Not generally known is an advantageous alternative: fluidic sampling units without moving parts. In the absence of complete <b>pipe</b> <b>closure,</b> cross-contamination between samples cannot be ruled out. This is eliminated by arranging for small protective flows that clear the cavities and remove any contaminated fluid. Although this complicates the overall circuit layout, fluidic sampling units with these "guard" flows were successfully built and tested. Recent interest in microchemistry leads to additional problems due very low operating Reynolds numbers. This necessitated the design of microfluidic sampling units based on new operating principles...|$|E
40|$|A two-tank flow {{facility}} {{has been designed}} and tested {{for the study of}} sudden blockage in pipe flow. Preliminary experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the system. Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry was used to calibrate the flow facility and investigate the mean and fluctuating velocity components of the flow system {{in the absence of a}} blockage. Hydrogen bubble visualisation was used to visualise the velocity profile at a distance of 2 pipe diameters upstream of the pipe exit. In the absence of a blockage, a parabolic velocity profile was observed indicating fully-developed laminar pipe flow. When the flow in the pipe was suddenly blocked, the flow near the inside walls of the pipe was observed to reverse direction. Dye visualisation showed a stopping vortex near the pipe blockage. Vardi and Hwang [4], amongst others, have identified similar flow features in their studies of sudden <b>pipe</b> <b>closure.</b> The broader context of this work is to compare experimental results to the already published numerical simulations of project collaborator...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to underline that, to define a good WNP, {{it is necessary to}} satisfy two crucial major requirements for the optimal functioning of a WDN: 1) network connectivity, i.e. each demand node of the water network must be connected to at least one water source, and 2) nodal minimum pressure, i.e. each node must have a pressure equal or higher than the minimum level of service that allows satisfying the water demand of the users. Therefore, the design of a WNP, as any problem of network subdivision, is a complex challenge for operators, because the permanent partitioning changes the original topological layout of water systems. Indeed, network partitioning, achieved by <b>pipe</b> <b>closures,</b> reduces the overall pipe section availability, with the consequent decrease of network water pressure, especially during peak hours, worsening the level of service offered to users.|$|R
40|$|Water quality {{models are}} {{increasingly}} being used routinely to help ascertain the quality of water in drinking water distribution systems for design and operational management purposes. Conventional water quality models are demand driven and consequently do not incorporate the effects of any deficiency in pressure on the water quality throughout the distribution network. This paper assesses a new integrated pressure dependent hydraulic and water quality model. The model {{is an extension of}} the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and <b>pipe</b> <b>closures.</b> It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory. The results here may be indicative of modelling errors that may not have been recognised explicitly hitherto...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{operation}} of large water distribution systems (WDS) {{has always been}} a tedious task especially when combined with determination of district metered areas (DMAs). This paper presents a novel framework based on graph theory and optimisation models to design DMA configuration and identify optimal {{operation of}} large WDS for both dry and rainy seasons. The methodology comprise three main phases of preliminary analysis, DMA configuration and optimal operation. The preliminary analysis assists in identifying key features and potential bottlenecks in the WDS and hence narrow down the large number of decision variables. The second phase employs a graph theory approach to specify DMAs and adjust their configuration based on similarity of total water demands and pressure uniformity in DMAs. Third phase uses several consecutive single-objective and multi-objective optimisation models. The decision variables are pipe rehabilitation, tank upgrade, location of valves and <b>pipes</b> <b>closure,</b> and valve settings for each DMA. The objective functions are to minimise total annual cost of rehabilitation, water age and pressure uniformity. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through its application to large real-world WDS of E-Town. The results show that the proposed methodology can determine a desirable DMA configuration mainly supplied directly by trunk mains...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} featuring waterhammer in viscoelastic pipes {{is presented}} in which the effects of pipe-wall viscoelasticity on waterhammer pressures are investigated. A large-scale pipeline apparatus made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) at Deltares, Delft, The Netherlands, {{has been used to}} carry out waterhammer experiments. Tests have been conducted in a reservoir-pipeline-valve system consisting of a main viscoelastic pipeline and two short steel pipes placed upstream and downstream of the main <b>pipe.</b> Rapid <b>closure</b> of a manually operated valve at the downstream end generates waterhammer. Repeated measurements at several positions along the pipeline have been recorded; these are plotted in figures and appropriately interpreted...|$|R
40|$|The main {{rules of}} {{computer}} models construction were developed, which intended for pipeline networks design {{and they were}} considered as single whole hydraulic systems. The construction of new sections is possible after their design {{in order to provide}} operation in given regime. In heat networks operation we see the following problems: irregular change in pressure between direct and return pipelines, increased pressure in return pipeline, misalignment of network and others. Their causes may be: undersize thickness of pipelines, reduction in diameter caused by scales in internal surfaces of <b>pipes,</b> <b>closure</b> of gate valves in sections of networks with big speeds of heat coolant, “parasitic” circulations and others. Efficient mean for determining the main reasons of these problems, they may be in any heat pipeline, and also for new heating pipe networks design we consider computer models, which allow to simulate (practically in the whole volume) hydraulic and temperature regimes of their work.    The purpose of work – using computer models for implementation of project of new heat removal pipe from Tolyatti central thermal station in order to heat the Central Region of Tolyatti, feeding from heat power station of the Volga car factory. With the help of developed computer model the location of equipment and their main characteristics were determined, they take into account joint work of two sources of heat (central thermal station of Tolyatti and the Volga car factory).   </p...|$|R

Canada de-rates closures, where, for instance a 2-hour closure is acceptable {{for use in}} a 3-hour fire separation, so long as the fire separation is not an occupancy separation or firewall. The lowered rating is then referred to as a fire protection rating, both for firestops, unless they contain plastic <b>pipes</b> and regular <b>closures.</b>|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Experimental measurements of the wall shear stress combined {{to those of the}} velocity profiles via the electrochemical technique and Ultrasonic pulsed Doppler Velocimetry, are used to analyse the flow behaviour in transient flow caused by a downstream short <b>pipe</b> valve <b>closure.</b> The Reynolds number of the steady flow based on the pipe diameter is Re = 121700. The results show that the quasi-steady approach of representing unsteady friction is valid during the initial phase for relatively large decelerations. For higher decelerations, the unsteady wall shear stress is consistently higher than the quasi-steady values obtained from the velocity profiles. An examination of the range of applicability of the instantaneous-acceleration model shows that the empirical coefficient of unsteady friction is closely linked to the deceleration intensity. This study is made possible owing to the repeatability of different valve closures allowing data to be averaged over numerous tests. vk 201...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the proactive control of flow velocities to maximise the self-cleaning capacity of the drinking water distribution systems under normal operations both through a change of the network topology and through an optimal control of pressure reducing valve (PRV) settings. Inspired by line outage flow distribution in electrical networks, we show how a fast network graph analysis of link closures {{can be used to}} estimate the potential changes in flow velocities, which are then used to determine the most favourable <b>pipes</b> for <b>closure.</b> Where closing of pipes cannot be used because of other conflicting objectives, {{we consider}} the optimal control of PRVs to maximise self-cleaning at peak demand periods. We formulate a novel optimisation problem to maximise the network operations for increased self-cleaning capacity, while satisfying hydraulic and regulatory pressure constraints at demand nodes. A new smooth objective function approximation for cleaning capacity of the network is proposed along with a scalable sequential convex programming method to solve the resulting valve optimization problems. We use a published benchmark network as a case study to show the efficacy of these new approaches...|$|R
50|$|The Wave Method {{is based}} on the {{physically}} accurate concept that transient pipe flow occurs as a result of pressure waves generated and propagated from a disturbance in the <b>pipe</b> system (valve <b>closure,</b> pump trip, etc.) This method was developed and first described by Don J. Wood in 1966. A pressure wave, which represents a rapid pressure and associated flow change, travels at sonic velocity for the liquid pipe medium, and the wave is partially transmitted and reflected at all discontinuities in the pipe system (pipe junctions, pumps, open or closed ends, surge tanks, etc.) A pressure wave can also be modified by pipe wall resistance. This description is one that closely represents the actual mechanism of transient pipe flow.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} closing the Boussinesq-based Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes {{equations}} are considered, {{and suggestions for}} improving two-equation turbulence models are made. The traditional smooth-wall boundary conditions are shown to be incorrect, and the correct boundary conditions are provided along with sample solutions to traditional models. The correct boundary condition at a smooth wall for dissipation-based turbulence models is that which forces both the turbulent kinetic energy and its first derivative to zero. Foundations for an energy-vorticity model suggested by Phillips are presented along with the near-smooth-wall behavior of the model. These results show that at a perfectly smooth wall, the turbulent kinetic energy may approach the wall at a higher order than is generally accepted. The foundations of this model {{are used in the}} development of a k-λ model for fully rough <b>pipe</b> flow. <b>Closure</b> coefficients for the model are developed through gradient-based optimization techniques. Results of the model are compared to results from the Wilcox 1998 and 2006 k-ω models as well as four eddy-viscosity models. The results show that the Phillips k-λ model is much more accurate than other models for predicting the relationship between Reynolds number and friction factor for fully rough pipe flow. However, the velocity profiles resulting from the model deviate noticeably from the law of the wall...|$|R
40|$|Soil-pipes (porous pipes {{inside a}} hillslope) are often {{detected}} in collapsed slopes indicating {{their influence on}} slope failure processes. Only limited studies can be found regarding the impacts of soil-pipes on landslide mechanisms. Hillslope models prepared in a flume are experimented with different soil-pipe configurations: a) no pipe, b) closed pipe and c) open pipe. Pore-water pressures were measured at six different locations along a slope. Discharges at the outlet of soil-pipe and groundwater seepage were also recorded. For the above mentioned pipe configurations two types of experiments were conducted: a) rainfall-induced failure and b) seepage-induced failure. Experimental results show that a closed pipe accumulates water around its lower end and continuously increases pore-water pressure till a failure. An open pipe works {{as a means of}} hillslope drainage and reduces the pore-water pressure of an entire slope. However, if open pipe is blocked, pore-water pressure close to its lower end rises rapidly, leading to immediate soil mass movement. For both seepage and rainfall-induced failure experiments, the maximum pressure before the failure was larger at a slope with an open pipe (once it is closed) than a slope with a pipe closed from the beginning or that without a soil-pipe. This indicates that the blockage of soil-pipes makes a slope more susceptible to failure. Displacement vectors show that soil movement velocity close to the surface was highest at slopes with open <b>pipes</b> after <b>closure</b> and lowest at slopes without pipes because of a higher degree of saturation and pore-water pressure at the time of failure of the former. Before a large failure, small fluctuations in pore-water pressure were also observed which can be an indicator of impending failure...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} qualify CFD codes for {{accurate}} numerical predictions of transient evolution of flow regimes in a vertical gas–liquid two-phase flow in a <b>pipe,</b> suitable <b>closure</b> models (inter-phase forces) for the momentum exchange between the continuous and dispersed phases are needed. In this study, under the assumption of monodisperse bubbles, a consistent set of inter-phase force models have been investigated. The effect of Drag Force, Lift Force, Wall Lubrication Force and Turbulent Dispersion Force has been assessed. The predicted local radial distributions of four primitive variables: gas volume fraction, interfacial area concentration, gas velocity and liquid velocity, are validated against experimental data of Monrós-Andreu et al. (2013, EPJ Web Conf. 45, 01105). New parameters have been introduced in the wall lubrication force models of Antal et al. (1991, Int. J. Multiphase Flow 7, 635) and Frank et al., (2004, Proc. of the Third Int. Symposium on Two-Phase Modelling and Experimentation, Pisa, Italy, 2008, Nucl. Eng. and Des. 238, 647) as well as implementing additional drag coefficient models using CFX expression language (CEL). In general, the predictions from the sets of inter-phase closure models {{presented in this paper}} yielded satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. Based on the result of the validation of different inter-phase force models, a set of Grace drag coefficient model, Tomiyama lift coefficient model, Antal et al. ’s wall force model, and Favre averaged turbulent dispersion force was found to provide the best agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential for}} public health risks associated with intrusion of contamination into water supply distribution systems resulting from transient low or negative pressures, as well as methods for preventing intrusion of contaminants {{that may lead to}} increased health risks, and mitigation of existing contaminant intrusion problems. This problem is defined as a specialized backflow situation that occurs in an otherwise pressurized system, and therefore the reader is referred to the cross connection white paper for a broader consideration of cross connection issues, health risks, and mitigation techniques. Definition of the Problem A pressure transient in a drinking water pipeline is caused by an abrupt change in the velocity of water. This event is sometimes termed “surge ” or “water hammer. ” The energy at any point in the pipeline is composed of kinetic and potential energy. Water will move through a pipe from points of higher energy to points of lower energy regardless of its position. Any change in flow in a pipe (due to valve <b>closure,</b> <b>pipe</b> fracture, or pump stoppage) will result in an exchange of energy between flow and pressure. The change in pressure can be defined by the Joukowsky equation (Thorley 1991) : H = 4660 * (Vi- Vf) where...|$|R
