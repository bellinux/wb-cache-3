Instead, Sellars emphasizes the need to dispel the myth by closely examining the “form of the givenness”, dissecting the proposed operations of acquaintance in terms of “such facts as that physical object X looks red to <b>person</b> <b>S</b> at time t, or that there looks to <b>person</b> <b>S</b> at time t to be a red physical object over there.” (Sellars) ...|$|E

5000|$|The Principle of Avoiding Circularity (PAC) is stated as follows: [...] "For all x, if a <b>person,</b> <b>S,</b> has a {{justification}} for x, then for all y, if y is in the evidential ancestry of x for S, then x {{is not in the}} evidential ancestry of y for S."

5000|$|The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) is stated as follows: [...] "For all x, if a <b>person,</b> <b>S,</b> has a {{justification}} for x, then there is some reason, r1, available to S for x; {{and there is some}} reason, r2, available to S for r1; etc." [...] PAA says that in order to avoid arbitrariness, for any proposition x to be justified for an epistemological agent, there must be some reason r available to the agent; this reason will in turn require the same structure of justification, and so on ad infinitum. Foundationalist theories can only avoid arbitrariness by claiming that some propositions are self-justified. But if a proposition is its own justification (e.g. coherentism), then it is a member of its own evidential ancestry, and the structure of justification is circular.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{complications}} of boils are scarring and infection or abscess of the skin, spinal cord, brain, kidneys, or other organs. Infections may also {{spread to the}} bloodstream (bacteremia) and become life-threatening. [...] S. aureus strains first infect the skin and its structures (for example, sebaceous glands, hair follicles) or invade damaged skin (cuts, abrasions). Sometimes the infections are relatively limited (such as a stye, boil, furuncle, or carbuncle), but other times they may spread to other skin areas (causing cellulitis, folliculitis, or impetigo). Unfortunately, these bacteria can reach the bloodstream (bacteremia) and end up in many different body sites, causing infections (wound infections, abscesses, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia) that may severely harm or kill the infected <b>person.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus strains also produce enzymes and exotoxins that likely cause or increase the severity of certain diseases. Such diseases include food poisoning, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, and scalded skin syndrome. Almost any organ system can be infected by S. aureus. Squeezing or cutting boils (and even smaller pimples) in the danger triangle of the face can be particularly dangerous if done outside a medical setting, as blood vessels in this area drain into the brain and can carry serious infections there.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{such thing}} as United Kingdom {{partnership}} law The law governing Partnerships in the UK is either English law or Scots law depending upon where the Partnership was formed. There are many common acts relating to Partnerships in both legal systems but there are also many differences for example under Scots Law a Partnership is considered to be a distinct legal entity and therefore can borrow money from a bank in the name of the Partnership. Under English law a Partnership is not a distinct legal entity and therefore borrowing would be in the names of the individual partners. Partnerships are a form of business association, which arises automatically when people carry on business with a view to a profit. (Partnership Act 1890 s 1). Partners are jointly and severally liable, just as they own the property in common. A limited partnership, under the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 may have sleeping partners, who if they do not partake in any business management will not be liable beyond their investments (s 6). A ‘partnership’ under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 is now considered a separate legal <b>person</b> (<b>s</b> 11) with limited liability (ss 1 and 14), though it is treated as a partnership for tax, and is not subject to so much regulation as would be a company. There must, however, be at least two partners.|$|E

40|$|A {{major factor}} {{affecting}} a <b>person</b> <b>s</b> happiness is {{the gap between}} their income and their neighbors, independent of their own income. This effect is strongest when the neighbor has moderately higher income. In addition a <b>person</b> <b>s</b> lifetime happiness often follows a "U" shape. Previous models have explained subsets of these phenomena, typically assuming the person has limited ability to assess their own (hedonic) utility. Here I present a model that explains all the phenomena, without such assumptions. In this model greater income of your neighbor is statistical data that, if carefully analyzed, would recommend that you explore for a new income-generating strategy. This explains unhappiness that your neighbor has greater income, as an emotional "prod" that induces you to explore, in accord with careful statistical analysis. It explains the "U" shape of happiness similarly. Another benefit of this model {{is that it makes}} many falsifiable predictions...|$|E
