50|$|The {{primary basis}} for customs {{valuation}} under the Agreement is “transaction value” {{as defined in}} Article 1. Article 1 defines transaction value as “the <b>price</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation.” Article 1 must be read together with Article 8, which lets Customs authorities make adjustments to the transaction value in cases where certain specific parts of the good - {{considered to be a}} part of the value for customs purposes - are incurred by the buyer but are not actually included in the price paid or payable for the imported goods. Article 8 also allows for the inclusion in transaction value of exchanges ("considerations") between the buyer and seller in forms other than money. Articles 2 through 7 provide methods of determining the customs value whenever it cannot be determined under the provisions of Article 1.|$|E

The central question usually addressed is whether the discount is fully capitalized {{in the value of the}} house [...] whether the price of creative finance is unity. In our view, one should not ask what the price of creative finance is because this price, like that of other housing attributes, likely depends upon supply and demand conditions. We develop and estimate a model incorporating this dependency. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of provider uncompensated care {{has become an}} important public policy issue. Yet existing measures of uncompensated care are flawed because they compare uninsured payments to list prices, not to the <b>prices</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> by the insured. We address this issue using a novel source of data from a vendor that processes financial data for almost 4000 physicians. We measure uncompensated care as the net amount that physicians lose by lower payments from the uninsured than from the insured. Our best estimate is that physicians provide negative uncompensated care to the uninsured, earning more on uninsured patients than on insured patients with comparable treatments. Even our most conservative estimates suggest that uncompensated care amounts to only 0. 8 % of revenues, or at most $ 3. 2 billion nationally. These results highlight the important distinction between charges and payments, and point {{to the need for}} a re-definition of uncompensated care in the health sector going forward. ...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{policy makers}} need {{detailed}} information {{on the effectiveness of}} past policies, in order to increase the efficiency of government interventions to foster agricultural development and poverty reduction. The indicators of policy distortions reported in this study aim to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the direction and magnitude to which policy instruments have affected incentives that agricultural producers and food consumers in Nigeria have faced over the past 50 years. In particular, the distortion indicators attempt to measure the divergence between the <b>price</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> to the agricultural producer and the price that the farmer would have received in a distortion-free policy environment. The findings indicate that Nigeria’s policies towards agricultural producers have shifted significantly over time, with agricultural producer support first declining after the country’s independence, then increasing again between the mid- 1970 s and the mid- 1980 s, and afterwards moving towards an incentive-neutral stance. The sectoral averages hide large support differences across commodities though. Export commodities have consistently been explicitly or implicitly taxed, while import-competing commodities have benefitted from producer support through tariff and non-tariff barriers and, to a lesser extent, budgetary payments. In this context, recent policy reforms towards greater regional and global trade integration promise to remove the remaining anti-trade bias and provide producers with a more market-friendly policy environment. ...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{road pricing}} as a {{function}} of congestion costs in the United Kingdom (U. K.) was put forward in a seminal report published by the U. K. Ministry of Transport in 1964. After 35 years, little has been done and the reasons behind this delay are mainly political, as the failure to implement congestion metering in Cambridge {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s shows. The subject has taken on a new urgency now that the U. K. government has announced its intention to authorize local councils to introduce road charges. Road pricing has a strong theoretical basis, but congestion costs must be quantified before it can be implemented. For that purpose, a simulation model is used. The social costs of congestion are measured by the deadweight loss and calculated from the difference between the marginal social costs and the <b>price</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> by trip makers. An exercise was done for two similar towns, Cambridge and York and potential road charges differing by only 8 percent on average were obtained. This seems to strengthen the idea that finding road charges in a few cases, each one characteristic of a larger set of towns, would allow the provision of guidelines to local councils. In that way, fair road prices could be established across the U. K. The use of revenues from public-accepted road charges is also discussed...|$|E

In this article, Mark Wynne and Fiona Sigalla explain the construction of the CPI and evaluate some of its potential shortcomings as a measure of inflation. Specifically, they examine the discrepancies that arise between the CPI and the true cost- of-living index as a result of improvements in the quality of goods, the introduction of new goods, substitution on the part of consumers between different goods and retail outlets, and the difficulty of measuring the <b>prices</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> by consumers for the goods they purchase.; The authors review the literature that quantifies these discrepancies, with the objective of estimating the magnitude of the overall bias in the CPI. Wynne and Sigalla argue that, in fact, remarkably {{little is known about the}} extent or significance of the overall bias in the CPI. They conclude that biases in the CPI cause it to overstate inflation by no more than 1 percent a year, and probably less. Consumer price indexes; Prices...|$|R
40|$|Indices which {{represent}} weighted averages of {{the prices of}} 'basic' commodities are often used in analysing inflationary pressures. Because basic commodities are usually purchased for further processing, changes in their prices will affect producers' costs, and these changes may eventually {{be passed on to}} consumers. Although {{there are a variety of}} such indices to choose from, they tend to reflect world demand for commodities (which is dominated by US demand) and so do not reflect commodity price pressures from a purely UK point of view. This paper presents a commodity price index which attempts to reflect UK commodity price pressures. It differs from other indices in three main ways. First, the weights used are based on UK demand for each commodity. Second, instead of using a sterling equivalent of world prices, the index uses <b>prices</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> in the UK and so allows for factors such as CAP administered prices. Third, its coverage of fuels is more comprehensive than most indices. This index is already presented in the Inflation Report and an article describing it appeared in the August 1995 Quarterly Bulletin. The purpose of the Working Paper is mainly to outline the method for those who wish to replicate this index. ...|$|R

40|$|The South African Revenue Service {{has since}} 2009 {{introduced}} “reference pricing” {{as a tool}} to detect undervaluation of customs values of imported clothing and textiles. The term “reference pricing” is not defined in the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 which is the legislation that governs the importation of goods into the Republic of South Africa. The mandate of the South African Revenue Service, amongst others, is to facilitate legitimate trade. By applying the reference pricing guidelines the South African Revenue Service will target all importers who declare customs values which are less than the reference price for a targeted tariff heading associated with an item of clothing or textile. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 is clear in that the transaction value which is the price paid or payable for the imported goods shall be the value used for customs duty purposes. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 also requires that the interpretation of the sections 65, 66 and 67 of the said Act shall be subject to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Valuation Agreement). Part I of the Valuation Agreement deals with the rules for customs valuation. Article 17 of part 1 allows for customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. The Technical Committee on Customs Valuation of the World Trade Organisation decided the following in so far as Article 17 of the aforesaid agreement is concerned: “ 1. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, [...] ” It would appear that the South African Revenue Service is using reference prices {{as a tool to}} support its reason for doubting the truth or accuracy of the declared customs values. The indiscriminate use of reference pricing, it is submitted, affects legitimate trade adversely. This treatise provides an understanding of how the customs value should be determined in terms of the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 and the Valuation Agreement. It then provides a background to reference pricing and how reference pricing will be used to detect undervalued imports of clothing and textiles, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using reference pricing and a comparative analysis of the approach adopted by the Mexican Tax Administration Service in so far as the use of reference pricing is concerned. It was established that the reference price cannot replace the customs value of an imported clothing item as the customs value is based on the <b>price</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> or payable for it and not on some arbitrary or fictitious value. The reference price can only be used as a tool to identify importers that are possibly undervaluing the customs values. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of using reference pricing. The treatise further provides a background to the use of a valuation database as a risk assessment tool and compares this to the use of reference pricing. The use of reference pricing and its impact on trade facilitation is then discussed as well as whether the use of reference pricing is consistent with the risk management principles as discussed in the World Customs Organisation Risk Management Guide. It was established that the South African Revenue Service has not disclosed the basis of arriving at the reference price per tariff heading that it targets and the use of reference pricing is not sanctioned by any international guideline or agreement. It was also established that the use of reference pricing targets compliant importers unnecessarily and this practice goes against the principles of trade facilitation. The use of reference pricing can be used as a tool to detect undervalued imports of clothing but should not be used as a basis to stop every consignment of clothing simply because the customs value declared is less than the reference price. It should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather enhanced further with the recommendations provided. In the final analysis, recommendations are provided which seek to enhance the reference pricing mechanism and to further identify and exclude compliant importers and limit the use of reference pricing to target non-compliant importers who undervalue the customs value of imported clothing and textile items...|$|E
40|$|Objective: People on {{a limited}} budget {{want to know the}} ‘good price’ of foods. Here we report the {{methodology}} used to produce an educational tool designed to help recognize foods with good nutritional quality and price, and assess the validity and relevancy of the tool. Design: A ‘Good Price Booklet’ presenting a list of foods with good nutritional quality and price was constructed. The validity of the in-booklet prices was assessed by comparing them with <b>prices</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> by households from the Opticourses project. The relevancy of the booklet tool was assessed by semi-structured interviews with Opticourses participants. Setting: Socio-economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Marseille, France. Subjects: Ninety-one participants collected household food-purchase receipts over a 1 -month period. Results: Based on the French food database, foods with higher-than-median nutritional quality were identified. After grouping similar foods, 100 foods were selected and their corresponding in-booklet prices were derived based on the distribution of average national prices by food group. Household food purchases data revealed that of the 2386 purchases of foods listed in the booklet, 67 · 1 % were bought at prices lower than the in-booklet prices. Nineteen semi-structured interviews showed that participants understood the tool and most continued using it more than a month after the intervention. Conclusion: A method was developed to ease the identification of foods with good nutritional quality and price. The Good Price Booklet is an effective tool to help guide people shopping on a low budget...|$|R
40|$|Water {{markets have}} become an {{integral}} part of water and property management in Australia over the last twenty years or so. Land and water rights have been separated with wide ranging consequences for many property professionals. A number of papers on PRRES conferences over the last five years have been dealing with the operations and implications of water markets and analysing water market prices and behaviour. This paper continues this line of research by looking at the elasticity of demand and supply for agricultural water. This information is essential to better understand price fluctuations and market behaviour and to make better informed decisions in water market both as a water user and as an investor. Bid prices for the demand and supply of water in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District of Victoria between 2001 and 2006 are analysed to estimate monthly price elasticities. Based on bid prices, the elasticity of demand for irrigation water appears high. The price elasticity varies over the season, with low elasticities in early season, increasing to maximum elasticity mid season and then becoming inelastic towards the close of the season. Elasticity also increases considerably in higher price ranges. The traded volumes and mean monthly <b>prices</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> for water allocations are then analysed to investigate the factors influencing water demand and to estimate price elasticities. Using actual prices paid, water demand appears positively related to price but volume trade is more influenced by demand the previous month, rainfall and evaporation, seasonal factors, rural commodity prices and farm GDP...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{assignment}} of prices or costs to pharmaceuticals can {{be crucial to}} results and conclusions that are derived from pharmacoeconomic cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs). Although numerous pharmacoeconomic practice guidelines {{are available in the}} literature and have been promulgated in many countries, these guidelines are either vague or silent about how drug costs should be established or measured. This is particularly problematic in pharmacoeconomic studies performed from the “societal” perspective, because typically the measured cost of a brand name pharmaceutical is not a true economic cost but also includes transfer payments from some members of society (patients and third party payers) to other members of society (pharmaceutical manufacturer stockholders) in large part as a reward for biomedical innovation. Moreover, there are numerous and complex institutional factors that influence how drug costs should be measured from other CEA perspectives, both internationally and within the domestic US context. The objective of this report is to provide guidance and recommendations on how drug costs should be measured for CEAs performed from a number of key analytic perspectives. MethodsISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices—Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (Drug Cost Task Force [DCTF]) was appointed with the advice and consent of the ISPOR Board of Directors. Members were experienced developers or users of CEA models, worked in academia, industry, and as advisors to governments, and came from several countries. Because how drug costs should be measured for CEAs depend on the perspectives, five Task Force subgroups were created to develop drug cost standards from the societal, managed care, US government, industry, and international perspective. The ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices—Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis (DCTF) subgroups met to develop core assumptions and an outline before preparing six draft reports. They solicited comments on the outline and drafts from a core group of 174 external reviewers and more broadly from the membership of ISPOR at two ISPOR meetings and via the ISPOR web site. ResultsDrug cost measurements should be fully transparent and reflect the net payment most relevant to the user's perspective. The Task Force recommends that for CEAs of brand name drugs performed from a societal perspective, either 1) CEA analysts use a cost that more accurately reflects true societal drug costs (e. g., 20 – 60 % of average sales price), or when that is too unrealistic to be meaningful for decision-makers, 2) refer to their analyses as from a “limited societal perspective. ” CEAs performed from a payer perspective should use drug <b>prices</b> <b>actually</b> <b>paid</b> by the relevant payer net of all rebates, copays, or other adjustments. When such price adjustments are confidential, the analyst should apply a typical or average discount that preserves this confidentiality. ConclusionsDrug transaction prices not only ration current use of medication but also ration future biomedical research and development. CEA researchers should tailor the appropriate measure of drug costs to the analytic perspective, maintain clarity and transparency on drug cost measurement, and report the sensitivity of CEA results to reasonable drug cost measurement alternatives...|$|R
