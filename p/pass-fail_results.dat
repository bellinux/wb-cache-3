40|$|The {{belief that}} {{polygraph}} evidence is inadmissible in English criminal proceedings {{has as its}} basis a variety of common law exclusionary evidential rules. In reality, this view is backed up by very little English case law. Further, several of the relevant common law rules have been modified by statute, have become obsolescent or, dependent upon circumstances, may not always exclude polygraph. Moreover, {{it is necessary to}} distinguish expert evidence based on the <b>pass-fail</b> <b>results</b> of a polygraph examination (which, if admissible at all, would appear only to be admissible in very limited circumstances) from evidence of statements made by the subject of the polygraph examination (which may be admissible in a wider variety of circumstances) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{performance}} of automated auditory brainstem responses (a-ABR) and automated transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (a-TEOAEs). Material/Methods: A prospective, case-control study in a group of newborns was performed in a maternity hospital carrying out universal newborn hearing screening. Two groups of full-term newborns were examined. The first group included 50 newborns (100 ears) who underwent: 1) a-TEOAEs, 2) a-ABR, and 3) transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). The second group consisted of the same number of newborns who underwent identical testing, but in a different order: 1) a-ABR, 2) a-TEOAEs, and 3) TEOAEs. All a-TEOAE and a-ABR testing was performed using the AccuScreen device and all standard TEOAE testing was performed using the ILO 88. The <b>pass-fail</b> <b>results</b> of each method were recorded and compared. Results: a-ABR yielded lower referral rates than the otoacoustic emission tests, but the differences were not statistically significant. Comparison between the two groups of study showed higher "pass" rates in the second group, indicating an order effect. Conclusions: Either method might be useful in universal newborn hearing screening. However, the lower referal rate obtained by a-ABR and its potential to recognize infants at risk for auditory neuropathy and central pathology should be considered...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} elemental compositions of ions, a mass peak profile {{generation model}} (PGM) {{was developed to}} plan data acquisitions and to interpret {{the data obtained by}} using a high resolution mass spectrometer (VG 70 - 250 SE). The PGM provides a list of all compositions possible for the exact mass of ion M and its error range from which the user selects a hypothetical composition. The PGM then plots [M + 1] and [M + 2] mass peak profiles and calculates masses and abundances of full and partial [M + 1] and [M + 2] profiles relative to the M profile. All possible compositions, calculated values for the exact masses and relative abundances, and measures of profile broadening and the shape of the [M + 2] profile are listed in a table. <b>Pass-fail</b> <b>results</b> for each of six criteria based on a comparison between table entries for the hypothetical composition and each of the other compositions are indicated. Compositions failing one or more criteria will be eliminated if the hypothetical composition is correct. The table provides assurance that all possible compositions based on the elements specified by the user have been considered. The PGM can be used to estimate the minimum resolution and number of determinations necessary to identify the correct composition by eliminating all others. As multiple determinations are made and error limits become smaller, average values are entered into the PGM to determine all compositions consistent with the data, often until only one composition remains...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} procedural justice perceptions on outcomes in an actual selection context with applicants taking a general mental ability test to gain employment as utility meter readers. Applicant attraction and intention related to the organization were measured at 3 time periods. This allowed us to control for initial levels of outcome vari-ables and the <b>pass–fail</b> <b>result</b> when assessing procedural justice effects. Procedural justice perceptions modestly predicted organizational attractiveness and intention prior to pass– fail feedback. However, the procedural justice effects on these outcomes were diminished after controlling for the <b>pass–fail</b> <b>result.</b> Either changes in R 2 or regression coefficients associated with procedural justice perceptions failed to achieve significance for all out-comes. We discuss {{the implications of these}} findings for procedural justice research and for employment managers. With many organizations using written ability tests for hiring (Rowe, Williams, & Day, 1994), applicant reactions to such tests are highly relevant to organizational research (Smither, Reilly, Millsap, Pearlman, & Stoffey, 1993). Despite the notable validity and utility of written ability tests (Hunter & Hunter...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Aim of {{this study}} is to {{elucidate}} which standard setting method is optimal to prevent incompetent students to pass and competent students to fail a dental Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Material and methods: An OSCE with 14 test stations was used to assess the performance of 119 third year dental students in a training group practice. To establish the pass/fail standard per station, three standard setting methods were applied: the Angoff I method, the modified Angoff II with reality check and the Borderline Regression (BR) method. For the final decision about passing or failing the complete OSCE, three methods were compared: total compensatory (TC), a partial compensatory (PC) within clusters of competence and a non-compensatory (NC) model. The reliability of the pass/fail standard of the three methods was indicated by the root mean square error (RMSE). As a criterion measure, a sample of the students (n = 89) was rated in the clinic by their instructors and accordingly these students were divided into two groups: competent and incompetent students. The students' clinical rating (considered for this study as 'true qualification') was compared with the <b>pass-fail</b> classification <b>resulting</b> from the OSCE. Undeserved passing of an incompetent student was considered as more damaging than failing a competent student. Results: The BR method showed more acceptable results than the two Angoff methods. In terms of pass rate the BR method showed the highest pass rates: for the TC model the Angoff method I and II and the BR showed pass rates of 86. 6 %, 86. 6 % and 97. 5 % respectively. For the PC model the pass rates were 30. 3 %, 34. 5 % and 61. 3 %, and for the NC model the pass rates were 0. 8 %, 1. 7 % and 7. 6 %. The BR method showed lower RMSEs (higher reliability) : for the TC model the RMSEs were 1. 3 %, 1. 0 % and 0. 3 % for the Angoff I, Angoff II and BR method respectively, and for the PC model the RMSE of the clusters of competence range was 2. 0 — 3. 7 % for Angoffs I; 1. 8 — 2. 2 % for Angoff II and 0. 6 — 0. 7 % for the BR method. In terms of incorrect decisions, the BR method had a higher loss due to incorrect decisions for the TC model than for the PC model which is in accordance with the results of other studies in medical education. Conclusions: Therefore we conclude that the BR method in a PC model provides defensible pass/fail standards and seems to be the optimal choice for OSCEs in health education...|$|R
40|$|Background: Multiple-choice {{questions}} (MCQs) are {{a common}} assessment method in health-science disciplines. This study reports the impact of item-writing flaws (IWFs) in MCQs on student achievement in high-stakes assessments. Summary of work: MCQ items on 10 summative test papers administered to undergraduate nursing students were reviewed for 15 commonly occurring IWFs. For each paper, two scales were computed: a total scale representing the test as delivered and a standard scale reflecting a theoretical test with only unflawed items. The <b>pass-fail</b> <b>results</b> and students with > 80 % outcomes were recorded. Summary of results: The proportion of flawed items on the 10 test papers ranged from 28 - 75 %; 47. 3 % of all items were flawed. Fewer examinees passed the standard scale than the total scale (748 vs. 779; 90. 6 % vs. 94. 3 %). Conversely, the proportion of examinees obtaining a score of ≥ 80 % was higher on the standard scale than the total scale (173 vs. 120; 20. 9 % vs. 14. 5 %). Conclusions: Flawed MCQ items were common in high-stakes nursing assessments. In contrast to previous research however, flawed items benefitted the test scores of borderline students and test scores of high-achieving students were adversely affected. Take-home message: Greater effort must be placed on {{improving the quality of}} MCQs used in assessments. It is important that teachers are provided with adequate training in writing high-quality test items and that all tests and examinations are subjected to adequate review both prior to and after administration...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the relative merits of two screening tests used for visual acuity assessment of preschool children. The tests that were compared were the Good-Lite Company versions of the E-Test and of the STYCAR (Screening Test for Young Children and Retardates). The former is the most popular method for evaluating central acuity in young children in this nation; the STYCAR is a relatively new letter-matching-test developed in England, where it is widely employed. The E-Test poses left-right orientation problems which are eliminated by the symmetrical letters H, T, O and V utilized in the Letter-Matching-Test. Both visual acuity tests were administered on two separate occasions by personnel from the Prevention of Blindness Society of Metropolitan Washington to 633 preschool children in Washington, D. C. By random selection, 150 of the children received the E-Test at both sessions, 162 children received the Letter-Matching-Test at both sessions, 160 chilt athe the second session, and 161 children received the Letter-Matching-Test at the first session and the E-Test at the second session. The author medically examined the eyes of 408 of the 633 children without knowledge of which test had been initially administered. Statistical analysis of the data obtained from the study indicated that the Letter-Matching-Test was significantly better in terms of testability rates, group and individual instruction time, and performance time. The E-Test was more reliable in terms of test-retest acuity scores and was also more valid in terms of agreement between <b>pass-fail</b> <b>results</b> obtained at the first screening session and two levels of pass-fail refraction criteria...|$|E
