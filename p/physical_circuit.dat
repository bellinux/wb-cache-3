40|$|International audienceIn {{contrast}} to analog models, binary circuit models are high-level abstractions that {{play an important}} role in assess-ing the correctness and performance characteristics of digital circuit designs: (i) modern circuit design relies on fast digital timing simulation tools and, hence, on binary-valued circuit models that faithfully model signal propagation, even throughout a complex design, and (ii) binary circuit models provide a level of abstraction that is amenable to formal correctness proofs. A mandatory feature of any such model is the ability to trace glitches and other short pulses precisely as they occur in <b>physical</b> <b>circuits,</b> as their presence may affect a circuit's correctness and its performance characteristics. Unfortunately, it was recently proved [Függer et al., ASYNC' 13] that none of the existing binary-valued circuit models proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and inertial delay channels and any other bounded single-history channel, is realistic in the following sense: For the simple Short-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability to suppress a single glitch, they showed that every bounded single-history channel either contradicts the unsolvability of SPF in bounded time or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in <b>physical</b> <b>circuits,</b> i. e., no existing model correctly captures physical solvability with respect to glitch propagation. We propose a binary circuit model, based on so-called in-volution channels, which do not suffer from this deficiency. In sharp {{contrast to}} what is possible with all the existing models, they allow to solve the SPF problem precisely when this is possible in <b>physical</b> <b>circuits.</b> To the best of our knowledge, our involution channel model is hence the very first binary circuit model that realistically models glitch propagation, which makes it a promising candidate for developing more accurate tools for simulation and formal verification of digital circuits...|$|R

50|$|In {{the field}} of telecommunications, a Clos network {{is a kind of}} {{multistage}} circuit switching network, first formalized by Charles Clos in 1952, which represents a theoretical idealization of practical multi-stage telephone switching systems. Clos networks are required when the <b>physical</b> <b>circuit</b> switching needs to exceed the capacity of the largest feasible single crossbar switch. The key advantage of Clos networks is that the number of crosspoints (which make up each crossbar switch) required can be far fewer than would be the case if the entire switching system were implemented with one large crossbar switch. When the Clos network was first devised, the number of crosspoints was a reasonable approximate indication of the total cost of the switching system. While this was important for electromechanical crossbars, it became less relevant with the advent of VLSI, wherein the interconnects often could be implemented either directly in silicon, or within a relatively small cluster of boards. However, the advent of complex data centers, with huge interconnect structures, each based on optical fiber links, means that they are again important.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} two suspended substrate stripline (SSS) bandpass filters (BPFs), both with a source-load coupling structure embedded to create a transmission zero (TZ) near {{each side of the}} passband edges. For the first BPF, the <b>physical</b> <b>circuit</b> layout is proposed first and followed by the establishment of an equivalent LC circuit. The optimization of element values of the LC circuit using a circuit-level simulator leads to quick adjustment of the structural parameters of the <b>physical</b> <b>circuit</b> layout {{with the aid of a}} full-wave simulator. For the second BPF, the ingenious equivalent LC circuit modified from that of the first one is proposed for bandwidth enhancement, which is achieved by exciting two extra loaded resonances in the passband. With the element values of the LC circuit optimized, proper reshaping the <b>physical</b> <b>circuit</b> layout from that of the first BPF is easily accomplished. The presented lumped and full-wave mixed approach is very efficient in that the circuit-level simulator is used to the largest extent and the time-consuming full-wave simulator is employed only at the later stage of the design. Experiments are conducted to verify the design of the two SSS BPFs and agreements are observed between the measured and simulated data. 1...|$|E

We introduce SyPVL, an eficient and numerically stable algorithm for the computation of reduced-order models of large, linear, passive networks. SyPVL represents the specializa-tion of the more general PVL algorithm, to symmetric problems. Besides the gain in eficiency over PVL, SyPVL also preserves the symmetry of the problem, and, as a consequence, can often guarantee the sta-bility of the resulting reduced-order models. Moreover, these reduced-order models can be synthesized as actual <b>physical</b> <b>circuits,</b> thus facilitating compatibility with existing analysis tools.

Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based on involutions, i. e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example of such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order analog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We prove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history channels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a lower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide an unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit models based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is possible in <b>physical</b> <b>circuits.</b> To the best of our knowledge, our model is hence the very first candidate for a model that indeed guarantees faithful glitch propagation. ...|$|R
