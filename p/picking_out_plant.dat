50|$|When Alexander W. Livingston {{had begun}} his {{attempts}} to develop the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size and having better flavor. One year, after many attempts, he passed through his fields, <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> particular tomato <b>plants</b> having distinct characteristics and heavy foliage. He saved the seeds carefully. The following spring he set two rows across his family garden located just below the hill and milk house. To his happy surprise, each plant bore perfect tomatoes like the parent vine. After five years, the fruit became fleshier and larger. In 1870, Alexander introduced the Paragon and tomato culture soon became a great enterprise in the county. Today, the crop is grown in {{every state in the}} Union. He eventually developed over seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant.|$|R

40|$|In "Individuals", Peter Strawson {{talks about}} identifying, discriminating and <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> {{particular}} objects, regarding discriminating and <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> as ways of identifying. I object that, strictly speaking, identification means to say {{of two things}} {{that they are the}} same. In contrast, discriminating an object from all others can be done by just ascribing some predicate to it that does not apply to the others. <b>Picking</b> <b>out</b> an object does not even seem to require to distinguish it from all others. The object picked is distinct in that it is the picked one, {{but it is not clear}} - even in the context of sensorily <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> - that I have to be aware of this in order to do the picking...|$|R
