2500|$|James Perone {{writes of}} the second track from Pet Sounds, [...] "You Still Believe in Me", [...] "One of the high points of the {{composition}} and Brian's vocal performance ... is the snaky, though generally descending melodic line on the line 'I want to cry,' his response {{to the realization that}} his girlfriend still believes in him despite his past failures." [...] He describes the [...] "stepwise falloff of the interval of a third {{at the end of each}} verse" [...] to be a typically [...] "Wilsonian" [...] feature. The feature recurs alongside a [...] "madrigal sigh motif" [...] in [...] "That's Not Me", where the motif concludes each line of the verses. This sighing motif then appears in the next track, [...] "Don't Talk (<b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> on My Shoulder)", a piece inspired by classical music, and once again in the closing [...] "Caroline, No".|$|E
2500|$|Responding to the songwriters' denials of a {{conscious}} lyric theme, Nick Kent observed: [...] " [...] album documents the male participant's attempts at {{coming to terms}} with himself and the world about him. Each song pinpoints a crisis of faith in love and life: confusion ('That's Not Me'), disorientation (the staggeringly beautiful 'I Just Wasn't Made for These Times'), recognition of love's capricious impermanence ('Here Today') and finally, the grand betrayal of innocence featured in 'Caroline, No'." [...] From another viewpoint, author Scott Schinder has written that Wilson and Asher crafted an [...] "emotion-charge song cycle that surveyed the emotional challenges accompanying the transition from youth to adulthood." [...] Schinder continues: [...] "Lyrically, Pet Sounds encompassed the loss of innocent idealism ("Caroline, No"), the transient nature of love ("Here Today"), faith in the face of heartbreak ("I'm Waiting for the Day"), the demands and disappointments of independence ("That's Not Me"), the feeling of being {{out of step with the}} modern world ("I Just Wasn't Made for These Times"), and the longing for a happy, loving future ("Wouldn't It Be Nice"). The album also featured a series of intimate, hymn-like love songs, [...] "You Still Believe in Me", [...] "Don't Talk (<b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> on My Shoulder)", and [...] "God Only Knows"." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fussili {{states that}} Wilson's {{tendency}} to [...] "wander {{far from the}} logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work" [...] is repeated numerous times in Pet Sounds, but never to [...] "evoke a sense of unbridled joy" [...] as Wilson recently had with the single [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". In the example of [...] "God Only Knows", which contains an ambivalent key and non-diatonic chords, musicologist Philip Lambert cites its [...] "choral fantasy" [...] section to contain complex key changes that elude the listener [...] "for the entire experience—that in fact, the idea of 'key' has itself been challenged and subverted". Perone's interpretation also suggests a visceral musical continuity. On the second track [...] "You Still Believe in Me", [...] "One of the high points of the composition and Brian's vocal performance... is the snaky, though generally descending melodic line on the line 'I want to cry,' his response {{to the realization that}} his girlfriend still believes in him despite his past failures." [...] He describes the [...] "stepwise falloff of the interval of a third {{at the end of each}} verse" [...] to be a typically [...] "Wilsonian" [...] feature that recurs throughout the album in addition to a [...] "madrigal sigh motif" [...] that can be heard in [...] "That's Not Me", where the motif concludes each line of the verses. This sighing motif appears in the next track, [...] "Don't Talk (<b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> on My Shoulder)", a piece inspired by classical music, and once again in [...] "Caroline, No". For the high-pitched electric bass guitar part in [...] "Here Today", Perone says they bring to mind similar parts in [...] "God Only Knows", culminating in what sounds like the vocal protagonist of [...] "Here Today" [...] warning the protagonist of [...] "God Only Knows" [...] that what he sings stands no chance at longevity. The protagonist's relationship then concludes shortly after [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times", while [...] "Caroline, No" [...] is a rumination in broken love.|$|E
