50|$|In 1943 Begun was Vice President of Research for Brush Development Company, Cleveland, Ohio. Brushâ€™s main {{business}} was {{the production of}} piezoelectric <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickups,</b> the least expensive and most widely used pickup of the late 1930s. They also, however, produced in cooperation with Western Electric the magnetic tape sound recorders. These used hardened steel tape as the recording medium.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} other types of input {{transducers}} which may be used occasionally, including magnetic pickups used in electric guitars and electric basses, which are plugged first into a DI box {{and then into the}} snake, contact microphones used on stringed instruments, and pianos and <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickups</b> (cartridges) used in record players. As well, some electronic instruments such as synthesizers can have their output signal routed to the mixing console.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1920s George Beauchamp, a Los Angeles, California guitarist, began {{experimentation}} with electric amplification of the guitar. Originally using a <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickup</b> assembly, Beauchamp began testing many {{different combinations of}} coils and magnets hoping to create the first electromagnetic guitar pickup. He wound his earliest coils using a motor out of a washing machine, later on switching to a sewing machine motor, and eventually using single coiled magnets.|$|R

50|$|He made {{significant}} contributions to room acoustics, regulatedpower supply, lightweight <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickups</b> and electronic reproduction equipment, and notably, during World War II, invented new techniques for sonar (an acronym that he invented, though the gloss was changed by others). He developed the first efficient and modern sonar system, for this work received the Medal for Merit from President Truman (1947), and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal by the U.S. Navy in 1970.|$|R
25|$|Some {{types of}} quartz {{crystals}} have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon {{the application of}} mechanical stress. An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickups.</b> One {{of the most common}} piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. The quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral. The resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the quartz crystal microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, the {{business}} {{moved to a}} bigger facility and expanded its engineering efforts. In 1948, they began successfully producing <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickup</b> cartridges. In 1950, they started production of the first automatic TV booster, which sold in great quantities. They also started to design and produce a consumer loudspeaker line, a timely move for {{the advent of the}} Hi-Fi boom. The Compound Diffraction Horn invention, changed the look and performance the traditional cone-shaped paging horn. Known for its high output, the CDP was deployed by the Navy for carrier and other high noise environments.|$|R

50|$|Founder Alfred L. Williams began Brush Labs in 1919 {{to develop}} {{products}} that utilized piezoelectric crystals. Associates reorganized {{the company as}} Brush Development Company in 1930 with piezoelectric <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickups</b> as the company's main product. Later they began manufacturing wire recorders, microphones, and speakers. Research for improvements to wire recorders resulted in a contract from the US National Defense Research Council during World War II. Brush manufactured a dictation recorder in 1946. In 1950, Brush built the Model BL-206 and BL-216 Multichannel Oscillographs, and associate Model BL-932 DC Amplifiers. Brush Development Co. merged with the original Brush Labs and the Cleveland Graphite Bronze company in 1952. The new company was named Clevite. Audio products under the Brush trademark were sold until 1960. The Clevite company was absorbed by Gould-National Batteries in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|In 1930, two amateur radio operators, Creed M. Chorpening, W8WR (later W8MJM) and F.H. Woodworth, W8AHW began {{experimenting with}} {{different}} types of microphones for their [...] "ham' stations. Their mutual friend, Charles Semple, worked for Brush Development Company {{where he had been}} experimenting with Rochelle salt crystals. Semple demonstrated some crystal pick-ups that Brush was working with, leading Chorpening and Woodworth to found The Astatic Microphone Laboratory, Inc. in Youngstown, Ohio in 1933. Semple was brought into the company as general manager to manufacture and market the company's model D-104 Crystal Microphone as well as other crystal microphones, crystal <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickups</b> and recording heads. In 1944, Astatic moved operations to Conneaut, Ohio and supplied microphones, pickups and crystal cartridges as well as hydrophone and Sonar devices to the military during World War II.|$|R
40|$|Simulating a {{human figure}} {{performing}} a task {{requires that the}} agent interact with objects in the environment in a realistic manner. In this paper we describe a system which directs task-level, general-purpose, object grasping for a simulated human agent. The Object Specific Reasoner (OSR) generates parameters for underspecified task-level instructions such as (<b>pickup</b> <b>jack</b> hammer). The Grasp behavior manages simultaneous motions of the joints in the hand, wrist and arm. When composed hierarchically, the OSR and the Grasp behavior interpret task-level commands to the animation system. These modules are implemented {{as part of the}} Jack project at the University of Pennsylvania...|$|R

She ended up having to protect a young human boy named Jack Darby from two Vehicons. Arcee was quickly joined by Bumblebee in the fight {{and they had a}} {{difficult}} time defeating them, until Bulkhead arrived. After returning to the base, Arcee was ordered by Optimus to <b>pickup</b> <b>Jack</b> from his school. After talking to him briefly, the two were seen by a girl named Miko Nakadai. She took the two back to the base.|$|R
50|$|A {{prolific}} inventor and engineer, Olson {{was awarded}} more than 100 patents {{for the various}} types of microphones (including the widely used 44- and 77-series), cardioid (directional) microphones, loudspeaker baffles, air-suspension loudspeakers, isobaric loudspeakers, early video recording equipment, audio recording equipment, <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickups,</b> underwater sound equipment, noise reduction, sound technology in motion-pictures, and public-address systems he developed. He also authored 135 articles and ten books including an interdisciplinary text charting the dynamical analogies between electrical, acoustical and mechanical systems. In 1949, Olson was honored by being the first recipient of the Audio Engineering Society's John H. Potts Memorial Award, an award program which was later renamed the Gold Medal. In 1953-4 Olson {{served as president of the}} Acoustical Society of America, which awarded him the very first Silver Medal in Engineering Acoustics in 1974 and the Gold Medal in 1981. He won the IEEE Lamme Medal in 1970, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1959, and was the recipient of many honorary degrees during his lifetime.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} twenties, {{the idea for}} {{electrified}} string instruments had been around for some time, and experimental banjo, violin and guitar pickups had been developed. George Beauchamp had himself been experimenting with electric amplification as early as 1925, but his early efforts involving microphones did not produce the effects he desired. Along the way Beauchamp also built a one-string test guitar made out of a 2X4 piece of lumber and an electric <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickup.</b> As the problems at National became more apparent, Beauchamp's home experiments took on a more rigorous shape, {{and he began to}} attend night classes in electronics as well as collaborating with fellow National employee Paul Barth. When the prototype electric pickup they were developing finally worked to his satisfaction, Beauchamp asked former National shop craftsman Harry Watson to make a wooden neck and body to which the electronics could be attached. It was nicknamed the frying pan because of its shape, though Rickenbacker liked to call it the pancake. The final design Beauchamp and Barth developed was an electric pickup consisting of a pair of horseshoe-shaped magnets that enclosed the pickup coil and completely surrounded the strings.|$|R
50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} type {{of electrical}} <b>phonograph</b> <b>pickup</b> {{was introduced in}} 1925. Although electromagnetic, its resemblance to later magnetic cartridges is remote: it contained a bulky horseshoe magnet and employed the same imprecisely mass-produced single-use steel needles which had been standard since the first crude disc record players appeared in the 1890s. Its tracking weight was specified in ounces, not grams. This early type of magnetic pickup completely dominated the market well into the 1930s, {{but by the end}} of that decade it had been superseded by a comparatively lightweight piezoelectric crystal pickup type. The use of short-lived disposable metal needles remained standard. During the years of affluence and long-deferred consumer demand immediately following World War II, as old record players with very heavy pickups were replaced, precision-ground and conveniently long-lasting stylus tips made of sapphire or the exotic hard metal osmium were increasingly popular. However, records made for home use still played at 78 rpm and most of them were still made of the same old abrasive shellac compound formulated to rapidly wear down the points of steel needles to fit the groove.|$|R

50|$|An {{audio signal}} is a {{representation}} of sound, typically as an electrical voltage. Audio signals have frequencies in the audio frequency range of roughly 20 to 20,000 Hz (the limits of human hearing). Audio signals may be synthesized directly, or may originate at a transducer such as a microphone, musical instrument <b>pickup,</b> <b>phonograph</b> cartridge, or tape head. Loudspeakers or headphones convert an electrical audio signal into sound. Digital representations of audio signals exist {{in a variety of}} formats.|$|R
5000|$|The 2848 stored {{the digital}} image of screens of {{information}} in an [...] "acoustic delay line." [...] Before the introduction of integrated circuit chips, the technology was based on discrete-component individual transistors. Mainframe computers used magnetic core memory, which was too expensive for use in video display terminals. The delay line was an unusual mechanical (not electrical) spiral wire with an electromagnet on one end and a torsion rotation detector on the other (which was conceptually similar to an old-fashion <b>phonograph</b> needle <b>pickup).</b> The central controller system vibrated the electromagnet like an audio-speaker voice coil. A {{fraction of a second}} later, {{the other end of the}} mechanical wire would vibrate. The vibration was converted to raster scan lines and sent to the nearby CRT display. The IBM 2848 delay line was a continuous electromechanical feedback loop.|$|R

5000|$|It has a 1972 Telecaster {{body with}} 2 humbucking pickups, one volume knob, a Fender neckplate, and a Telecaster Deluxe headstock. At first the Telecaster {{had only one}} pickup in the bridge, the Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker. This model was first used during the tour for Sum 41's third album [...] "Chuck". A second pickup was later on, the Antiquity JB Model Humbucker but then was {{replaced}} by a Wide Range Humbucker pickup in the neck while leaving the bridge pickup the same. His current model is with Seymour Duncan and Wide Range <b>pickups.</b> The input <b>jack</b> is custom made onto the pickguard rather than a side input jack. The body is featured without the traditional pickup selector switch. The neck's tuning machines are Fender American Standard Series Tuning Machines. The guitar also features red X's that Whibley states [...] "Are there for good luck and design". Whibley uses a Get'm Get'm Sergeant guitar strap with chrome Schaller Strap Locks. There is only one color for the Telecaster Deluxe model (Black body with Black pickguard) but comes either black on black or Olympic White body with Black pickguard for the Squier models.|$|R
5000|$|The Gibson Robot Guitar (a.k.a. GOR) is a limited-edition self-tuning Gibson guitar, {{typically}} a Les Paul. The first run of limited edition Robot Guitars was exclusively {{made up of}} Les Paul bodies. Five different Gibson models were available (2008-2011, Robot X-plorer 2008-2012)) with Robot Guitar features: The Robot Les Paul Studio, Robot SG, Robot Flying V, Robot X-plorer, and a Robot Les Paul Junior. Developed by Chris Adams, its most notable feature is that it uses an onboard computer to automatically tune itself. This {{is not the first}} guitar to be able to tune itself, but it is regarded as the most modern, unique, and non-invasive self-tuning model available, because it does not employ cams or cantilevers throughout the body of the guitar. The non-limited edition SG and Les Paul Studio are available in a variety of finishes. The Flying V and Explorer are only available in metallic red. The price can range from about $1,000-$3,000 or more for custom options. In the case of the [...] "Original 1st Production" [...] Robot guitar the only finish available was Blue Silverburst nitrocellulose, a color which Gibson has stated will never be used on any other Gibson guitar (see photo to the right). The original Robot guitar also featured headstock and neck binding which are not standard on any current Les Paul Robot as well as a chrome truss rod cover with [...] "Robot Guitar" [...] engraved. The production version featured 22-fret rosewood-bound (standard finishes) or white-bound (metallic finishes) ebony fingerboard with figured acrylic tapezoid inlays, white-bound headstock with MOP Gibson logo and flowerpot inlay (metallic finishes) or unbound headstock with screened logo (standard finishes), three-per-side robotic Powerhead Locking tuners, tune-o-matic Powertune bridge, Powertune stop tailpiece, two chrome covered humbucker pickups (490R, 498T), four knobs (three normal, and one Master Control Knob that controls the robotic actions of the guitar), three-way <b>pickup</b> switch, Neutrik <b>jack</b> on side of guitar, chrome hardware.|$|R
