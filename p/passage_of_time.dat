These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp.

5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Light sent {{down into a}} gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

5|$|The Dark Side of the Moon is {{the eighth}} album by English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records.

5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time.

The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work.

5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light.

The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|These were cohortes with a cavalry {{contingent}} attached. There {{is evidence}} that their numbers expanded with the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Only about 40% of attested cohortes are specifically attested as equitatae in inscriptions, which is probably the original Augustan proportion. A study of units stationed in Syria in the mid-2nd century found that many units which did not carry the equitata title did in fact contain cavalrymen e.g. by discovery of a tombstone of a cavalryman attached to the cohort. This implies that by that time, at least 70% of cohortes were probably equitatae. The addition of cavalry to a cohort obviously enabled it {{to carry out a}} wider range of independent operations. A cohors equitata was in effect a self-contained mini-army.|$|E
5|$|Although Watts's {{work was}} seen as {{outdated}} and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed Hope's intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in The Old Guitarist (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, {{by the time of}} his death in 1904 Hope had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill.
