5|$|July 22, 1970– Tropical Storm Becky hits Apachicola, {{producing}} moderate rainfall peaking at over 8inches (203mm) in Tallahassee which floods 104 {{houses and}} injures two. The storm also spawns a tornado which destroys {{a house and}} severely damages three others in <b>Panacea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several tornadoes were reported. Near <b>Panacea,</b> Florida, {{a tornado}} {{destroyed}} {{a house and}} damaged two others. Another tornado in Emanuel County, Georgia killed one person and demolished two homes. However, due to the conditions that spawned the tornadoes, they are not directly attributed to Becky.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a <b>panacea</b> button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E

5|$|The legendary herb {{has entered}} the modern Bulgarian {{vocabulary}} {{as a metaphor for}} a magic key or a <b>panacea</b> in the wider sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ „da namerish razkovnicheto“) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or difficult one. Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.|$|E
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a <b>panacea</b> for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E
25|$|Asclepius {{was married}} to Epione, {{with whom he had}} five daughters: Hygieia, <b>Panacea,</b> Aceso, Iaso, and Aglaea, and three sons: Machaon, Podaleirios and Telesphoros. He also sired a son, Aratus, with Aristodama.|$|E
40|$|Although change {{management}} <b>panaceas</b> {{have been widely}} discussed {{in the business and}} management literature for several decades, not many publications address the role of simulation modeling in supporting these <b>panaceas.</b> This paper investigates four management innovation and change programs: TQM, JIT, BPR and Process Innovation and discusses how simulation modeling could increase their effectiveness. These {{change management}} approaches are compared and contrasted and the applicability of simulation modeling to support the principles of these methods is investigated. It is argued that simulation could be viewed as a missing link between these approaches...|$|R

50|$|Teachers {{understand}} that politically motivated <b>panaceas</b> such as merit pay and eliminating tenure {{do nothing to}} improve teacher quality.

25|$|The {{player has}} enough {{upgrades}} to collect Dee's remaining letters for Dr. Knight, {{who believes that}} he can now make a <b>Panacea.</b> He returns to the safe house, where Knight informs him that the <b>Panacea</b> is not a cure but a vaccine. The Prepper expresses profound disappointment in the player as he returns to Buckingham Palace. Knight has left his bunker for the queen's quarters to access data on a USB key. The player makes {{his way through the}} palace, discovering that Knight has been killed and turned into a zombie. The player uses Knight's eye to bypass a retinal scanner and collect the USB key.|$|E

25|$|Sea urchins {{can also}} be {{infected}} by many parasites, be they internal or external. Pedicellaria are a good means of defense against ectoparasites, but not a <b>panacea</b> as some of them actually feed on it. The hemal system ensures against endoparasites.|$|E

25|$|Algae-based {{biofuels}} {{have been}} promoted {{in the media}} as a potential <b>panacea</b> to crude oil-based transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production.

25|$|As to Squire Western, he {{was seldom}} {{out of the}} sick-room, unless when he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. Nay, he would {{sometimes}} retire hither to take his beer, {{and it was not}} without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer too: for no quack ever held his nostrum to be a more general <b>panacea</b> than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in all the physic in an apothecary's shop.|$|E
25|$|The Congress {{concluded}} that the multiple-use concept presented new challenges and new opportunities to foresters everywhere, with great prospects for additional services {{to the welfare of}} mankind. It was not, however, a <b>panacea</b> which could solve all forest management problems. Often one use must be dominant and other proposed uses must not then be detrimental to the major one. Moreover, there can be disadvantages to multiple use when it is inefficiently applied. But multiple use must be recognized as an important goal of forest policies.|$|E
40|$|Organizational change methods (also {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as management fads, <b>panaceas</b> and quickfixes), are gaining in importance as European companies seek out ways of improving their productivity and product quality.

25|$|There are countless {{indirect}} {{sources for}} the tale as well. Eternal youth is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the philosopher's stone, universal <b>panaceas,</b> and the elixir of life are common throughout Eurasia and elsewhere. An additional hint may have been taken from {{the account of the}} Pool of Bethesda in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus heals a man at the pool in Jerusalem.|$|R
60|$|To have {{followed}} the frequent discussions of the Labour Unrest in the Press is to have learnt quite {{a lot about the}} methods of popular thought. And among other things I see now much better than I did why patent medicines are so popular. It is clear that as a community we are far too impatient of detail and complexity, we want overmuch to simplify, we clamour for <b>panaceas,</b> we are a collective invitation to quacks.|$|R
25|$|The key to {{the early}} renown of the raintree stemmed from the {{apocryphal}} story {{that it was a}} <b>panacea</b> for drought stricken districts through the ability of its leaves to condense moisture out of the air, retain it in large quantities and then expel it through its leaves and trunk. This story, and how it had been disproved, was discussed in two 1911 articles from the Port Douglas and Mossman Record. Otherwise it was seriously considered as a useful crop for the fodder its large seed pods provided for cattle.|$|E
25|$|Swarming {{is not a}} <b>panacea</b> for {{conflict}} at all levels. If {{there is a significant}} military force preventing the system administrator from working on developing connections, {{the other part of the}} paradigm comes into play: the leviathan, a first-world military force that takes down the opposition regular forces. Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the tactical level, but its dispatch is a strategic decision that may be made unilaterally, or by an established core group such as NATO, ASEAN, or the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|Perception {{surrounding}} smoking has varied {{over time}} and {{from one place to}} another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a <b>panacea</b> and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.|$|E
40|$|Water {{governance}} debates {{have increasingly}} {{recognized the importance}} of adaptive governance for short- and long-term sustainability, especially with respect to increasing climate unpredictability and growing urbanization. A parallel focus on enhancing community participation pervades international development recommendations and policy literature. Indeed, there are often implicit and explicit connections made between the participatory character of water governance institutions and their adaptive capacity. The social-ecological systems literature, however, has also urged caution with respect to embracing <b>panaceas,</b> with increasing calls to be attentive to the limitations of proposed "solutions. " We discuss the parallels between the adaptive governance, comanagement, and participatory resource governance literatures and analyze efforts to encourage such participation in urban water governance through Local Water Boards in Accra, Ghana. Drawing on interview data, participant observations, and a survey of 243 individuals, we explored what participatory spaces have been opened or foreclosed as well as the possibilities for adaptive urban water governance in Accra. Applying insights from recent debates about <b>panaceas,</b> we argue that discerning the potential and limits for sustainable resource governance and associated development goals requires that participatory mechanisms be subjected to systematic and contextual analysis...|$|R
50|$|The Democratic Party in Eastern and Midwestern cities had {{a strong}} German Catholic base that was alienated by free silver and inflationist <b>panaceas.</b> They showed little enthusiasm for Bryan, {{although}} many were worried that a Republican victory would bring prohibition into play. The Irish Catholics disliked Bryan's revivalistic rhetoric and worried about prohibition as well. However their leaders decided to stick with Bryan, since the departure of so many Bourbon businessmen from the party left the Irish increasingly in control.|$|R
5000|$|The Fountain of Youth reputedly restores {{the youth}} of anyone who drinks of its waters. The New Testament, {{following}} older Jewish tradition, attributes healing to the Pool of Bethesda when the waters are [...] "stirred" [...] by an angel. Herodotus attributes exceptional longevity to a fountain {{in the land of}} the Ethiopians. The lore of the Alexander Romance and of Al-Khidr describes such a fountain, and stories about the philosopher's stone, universal <b>panaceas,</b> and the elixir of life are widespread.|$|R
25|$|In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold {{traveled}} around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata {{made from a}} special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a <b>panacea</b> effective against every type of poison and several diseases, including plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} an {{intention}} to give {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy overtones of unification, nationalism and being above the particular interests of individual social classes. This <b>panacea</b> that would cure, once and for all, all the ills of the nation, elevating it to glory, emphasised two fundamental tendencies: nationalism and colonialism. From this combination came the final desertion of Iberian Federalism, patent in the first republican theses by José Félix Henriques Nogueira, identifying the monarchy as antipatriotism and the yielding to foreign interests. Another strong component of republican ideology was emphasised by anti-clericalism, due to the theorisation of Teófilo Braga, who identified religion as an obstacle to progress and responsible for the scientific retardation of Portugal, in opposition to republicanism, which was linked by him to science, progress and well-being.|$|E
25|$|Custom-compounded BHRT is a {{practice}} almost wholly {{restricted to the}} United States. BHRT {{is a form of}} alternative medicine, and has been promoted as a <b>panacea</b> for many diseases {{in addition to being a}} means of relieving the symptoms of menopause and/or reducing the risk of osteoporosis (historically, the goals of hormone replacement therapy in allopathic medicine). There is little evidence to support many of these claims; the hormones are expected to have the same risks and benefits of comparable approved drugs for which there is an evidence base and extensive research and regulation. The exception is progesterone, which may have an improved safety profile than artificial progestogens, though direct comparisons with progestins have not been made. Risks associated with the process of compounding bioidentical hormones are not clearly understood. In addition, the accuracy and efficacy of saliva testing has not been definitively proven, and the long-term effects of using blood testing to reach target levels of hormones have not been researched.|$|E

40|$|This comment {{addresses}} the {{context within which}} markets have turned into purported <b>panaceas</b> to alleviate poverty and promote development. Expanding formal markets and rescuing the poor from the traps of informality is often seen as recipe to unlock the untapped energies {{at the base of}} the pyramid (BoP), turning individuals into budding entrepreneurs and aspiring consumers. But, so far we have failed to appreciate how the informal sector plays a key role in supporting the formal economy and providing a route for subsistence at the BoP...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{diminishing}} role of the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, whose main objective {{is to protect the}} health of the population, particularly through the mitigation of risks from consumer products, such as medications. This devaluation of the agency is caused by the growing threats to its areas of actuation, largely due to decisions made the Brazilian Congress, which is pressured by some groups, or even social upheaval driven by notions of <b>panaceas.</b> Two emblematic cases are analyzed: appetite suppressants and synthetic phosphoethanolamine...|$|R
