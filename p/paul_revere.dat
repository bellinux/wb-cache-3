5|$|In Philadelphia, Adams {{promoted}} colonial unity {{while using}} his political skills to lobby other delegates. On September 16, messenger <b>Paul</b> <b>Revere</b> brought Congress the Suffolk Resolves, {{one of many}} resolutions passed in Massachusetts that promised strident resistance to the Coercive Acts.

5|$|The crowd {{eventually}} dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but {{the crowd}} re-formed the next day, prompting {{the withdrawal of the}} troops to Castle Island. Eight soldiers, one officer, and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder. Defended by lawyer and future American president John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand. Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by <b>Paul</b> <b>Revere</b> (shown at top-right), further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, George Washington {{owned and}} raced a Narragansett Pacer, while in 1772, Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair. <b>Paul</b> <b>Revere</b> {{possibly}} rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States. The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having {{been brought to the}} area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known Pacer, a mare, died around 1880.|$|E

5|$|The Boston Massacre, {{known as}} the Incident on King Street by the British, was an {{incident}} on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed people while under attack by a mob. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as <b>Paul</b> <b>Revere</b> and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 {{in order to protect}} and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a fair trial so {{there could be no}} grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and <b>Paul</b> <b>Revere,</b> who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E

This was an important event, as this court was the first establishment of civil and criminal law in the pioneer country.|$|E
