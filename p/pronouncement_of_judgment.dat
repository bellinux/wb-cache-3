In this period, on the other hand, the responsa were restricted almost entirely to legal regulations. Since the <b>pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> was regarded as a religious duty, and since in most countries the Jews were unwilling to submit to a non-Jewish court, legal questions formed {{a large part of the}} responsa.|$|E
50|$|Govindaswamy (aged 30, from Virudhachalam, Cuddalore district, Tamil Nadu) {{has been}} found guilty in the rape and murder case of Soumya by the Thrissur fast track court judge, KN Raveendra Babu, on October 31, 2011. <b>Pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> has been delayed for 4 November since the Public Prosecutor {{submitted}} before the court the documents to prove previous convictions of the accused which showed that he had undergone imprisonment in eight cases in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and trial of another robbery case was in progress. He was later awarded death sentence by the court. High court of Kerala upheld the trial court verdict in a 359-page judgement by the judges, T.R. Ramachandran Nair and B. Kemal Pasha.|$|E
50|$|In early English dramas Justice was personified as {{an entity}} which {{exercised}} “theological virtue or grace, and {{was concerned with}} the divine <b>pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> on man”. However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see Justice begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge. The Justice in Respublica begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind. This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in Respublica is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”. An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice, he begins to don on the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.|$|E

40|$|Modern – or {{so-called}} ‘new’ - judiciaries {{are more}} active {{in the field of}} law-making than they used to be. It is argued that this calls for new checks and balances. New forms of public, social accountability are warranted to enable public scrutiny. This contribution discusses and analyses the efforts of some judiciaries in Europe and the US to open up and work more transparently and thus further so-called soft public accountability. To this end, the paper looks into the different legal regimes of access to information pertaining to information held and produced by courts and the law on public hearing and public <b>pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgments.</b> The paper does not stop at an inventory of the different legal regimes but it compares and analyses the way in which judiciaries in different countries tackle the demand for information about cases, case-related or court-related issues (i. e. the information-provision policies) as well. From these policies on information provision we may read how different courts themselves cope with the demand for public accountability. In conclusion the question is tackled whether and to what extent these information-provision policies, as methods of soft accountability, contribute to the legitimacy of the judiciary...|$|R
25|$|Divine <b>pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> three <b>judgments</b> {{are then}} laid against all culprits (3:14–19). A {{judgement}} oracle {{and the nature}} of the crime is first laid upon the serpent, then the woman, and finally Adam. After the serpent is cursed by Yahweh, the woman receives a penalty that impacts two primary roles: childbearing and her subservient relationship to her husband. Adam's penalty thus follows. The reaction of Adam, the naming of Eve, and Yahweh making skin garments are described in a concise narrative (3:20-21). The garden account ends with an intradivine monologue, determining the couple's expulsion, and the execution of that deliberation (3:22–24).|$|R
40|$|The free {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> in the European Area of Justice presupposes {{a high level}} of mutual trust between the judiciaries of the Member States. From the citizens' perspective, the key issue is the balancing of the fundamental rights of claimants and defendants, i. e. the right of access to justice (to pursue a claim) and the rights of the defence. Mutual trust in judiciaries can be built in various ways. First of all, through the creation of uniform European procedures in the form of optional instruments, which lead to the <b>pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> on the basis of common rules of procedure. Secondly, sectorspecific harmonisation of procedural law is possible, addressing civil procedure in the context of other policy areas, such as intellectual property, competition law or consumer protection. Thirdly, horizontal harmonisation of civil procedure by way of directives is also possible. Up to now, only selected and rather narrow areas of civil procedure have been addressed in this manner. However, a more ambitious project has been launched by the European Law Institute (ELI) in collaboration with the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit), aimed at elaborating European rules of civil procedure. These rules, once finalised, could be the basis of a future directive on minimum standards of civil procedure in the EU...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of risk {{communication}} in genetic counseling, {{there appears to be}} a tension between clients seeking an authoritative, definitive risk assessment and the geneticist-expert actively defining the boundaries of his or her (in) expertise through formulation of uncertainty that is such a feature of genetic disorders. In the process of demarcating his or her zone of expertise, he or she defers to the <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> other medical colleagues with expertise in "adjacent" areas. Our claim is that the genetic counselor delineates his or her (in) expertise through a systematic deployment of a range of modalized discourse strategies (e. g., contrast and hedging) while claiming authority in a limited knowledge field. At the broader professional level, this is motivated in part by the limits to professional knowledge and in part by the desire to maintain a "nondirective" (i. e., neutral) stance. Our analysis focuses on the expert formulation of uncertainty in a single counseling session around 4 strategic moments: (a) display of specialist knowledge, (b) <b>pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> considered <b>judgment,</b> (c) response to clients' volunteered information, and (d) maintenance of a nondirective stance in the face of explicit advice seeking by clients...|$|R
40|$|Diploma thesis The Right to be Forgotten on the Internet {{applies to}} the {{functions}} of Internet search engines, search algorithms {{and the impact of}} the digital footprint that on the Internet user essentially leaves. With this issue is, on the one hand, inseparably linked the protection of personal data in the online environment, on the other hand the constitutionally enshrined right to information and other fundamental rights. Not ignored should be also the risk of censorship of the Internet. An application of the right to be forgotten adds a whole new dimension to this problems. The right to be forgotten is inferred from the <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> the European Court of Justice on 13 May 2014 in the case Costeja versus Google Spain, where an Internet user named Mario Costeja Gonzáles first succeeded with a request of removal of unflattering information about himself from results of the search engine Google. Thus a reform precedent will have a big impact on seeking information on the Internet in the future, since the <b>pronouncement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judgment</b> about the removal of his personal data may ask any European Internet user.
