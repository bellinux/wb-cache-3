25|$|The ALUPEC {{comes close}} to a perfect <b>phonetic</b> <b>system</b> in that almost every letter {{represents}} only one sound and almost every sound is represented by only one letter.

25|$|Prior to World War II, {{language}} scholars {{were concerned}} with these problems in learning Japanese writing. One of their more radical proposals was to abolish the Chinese kanji characters entirely and make use of an entirely <b>phonetic</b> <b>system.</b> When the Ministry of Education tried to implement this reform, however, it encountered strong opposition from scientists, writers and the general public, and the idea was finally dropped.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>phonetic</b> <b>system</b> {{is easy to}} learn, {{choosing}} appropriate Chinese characters slows typing speed. Most users {{report a}} typing speed of fifty characters per minute, though some reach over one hundred per minute. With some phonetic IMEs, in addition to predictive input based on previous conversions, {{it is possible for}} users to create custom dictionary entries for frequently used characters and phrases, potentially lowering the number of characters required to evoke it.|$|E

25|$|In fact, Hong Kong {{has been}} so greatly westernised that the Cantonese {{language}} has borrowed a lot of words from English during the colonisation period and these loanwords have since been integrated {{as a part of}} the Hong Kong style Cantonese language. A large number of commonly used Cantonese words are actually phonetic borrowings from the English language which apply the Cantonese <b>phonetic</b> <b>system</b> to represent the most similar pronunciation of those English words.|$|E
25|$|Boas applied these {{principles}} to his studies of Inuit languages. Researchers have reported {{a variety of}} spellings for a given word. In the past, researchers have interpreted this data {{in a number of}} ways—it could indicate local variations in the pronunciation of a word, or it could indicate different dialects. Boas argues an alternative explanation: that the difference is not in how Inuit pronounce the word, but rather in how English-speaking scholars perceive the pronunciation of the word. It is not that English speakers are physically incapable of perceiving the sound in question; rather, the <b>phonetic</b> <b>system</b> of English cannot accommodate the perceived sound.|$|E
25|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{project to}} promote spoken language unification was in 1936: Wang Li's 4 volume Mandarin <b>Phonetic</b> <b>System</b> (MPS) entry, Guoyu Cidian (Kuo-yu Tz'u-tien). In 1949 it was re-edited into the MPS Hanyu Da Cidian with Kang Xi 214 radical index, {{and a small}} Four Corner dictionary was available as the Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian of 1953. After 1949, limited use of MPS and the original Four-Corner Method continued under the People's Government, until the introduction of pinyin in 1958 and after. Today's Chinese dictionaries still contain MPS characters below each Pinyin class entry and sometimes in a phonetics chart in tables (Xinhua Cidian), while main entries are all in Hanyu Pinyin order. There is one all-sijiaohaoma small dictionary (Third Revision, below).|$|E

500|$|Objections to [...] "pe̍h-ōe-jī" [...] {{are that}} it can refer {{to more than one}} system and that both {{literary}} and colloquial register Southern Min appear in the system and so describing it as [...] "vernacular" [...] writing might be inaccurate. Objections to [...] "Church Romanization" [...] are that some non-Christians and some secular writing use it. One commentator observes that POJ [...] "today is largely disassociated from its former religious purposes." [...] The term [...] "romanization" [...] is also disliked by some, who see it as belittling the status of pe̍h-ōe-jī by identifying it as a supplementary <b>phonetic</b> <b>system</b> instead of a fully-fledged orthography. Sources disagree on which of the two is more commonly used.|$|E
500|$|Fujishima was {{particularly}} interested in the concept of a goddess [...] "as a job", and turned to Norse mythology as he felt that it was relatively unknown in Japan. Thus Belldandy is based on Verðandi (or Verthandi), the Norse Goddess of the present, (whose name is literally translated as [...] "to become" [...] or [...] "becoming"), and {{she is one of the}} three Norns or [...] "fates" [...] from Norse mythology. Verdandi, when translated into Japanese, becomes ベルダンディー (Berudandī). As the Japanese <b>phonetic</b> <b>system</b> does not distinguish between [...] "b" [...] and [...] "v" [...] or [...] "r" [...] and [...] "l" [...] (although ヴ can describe [...] "v".), [...] "Belldandy" [...] can emerge as a product of consonant substitutions. Indeed, it was in the first chapter of the manga that her name was transliterated as Belldandy rather than Verdandi, and this romanization has stuck since. When the English translations were being prepared, Toren Smith considered returning the name to [...] "Verthandi", (which Smith had determined to be the correct translation of the Old Norse), but chose to stick with Belldandy on the grounds that Fujishima was already [...] "playing fast and loose with the mythos" [...] and thus felt that no further harm was likely to come from employing Fujishima's transliteration. (Nevertheless, in the Swedish translation of the manga, released in 2007, her name was returned to Verdandi).|$|E

The principal reason Hangul has attracted this praise {{is that the}} shapes of the letters are related to the features of the sounds they represent: the letters for consonants pronounced in the same place in the mouth are built on the same underlying shape. In addition, vowels are made from vertical or horizontal lines so that they are easily distinguishable from consonants.|$|E
