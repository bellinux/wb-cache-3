25|$|In 2005, Isaac Njilah, a {{geologist}} at the University of Yaoundé, {{suggested that the}} natural dam of volcanic rock that keeps in the lake's waters could collapse in the near future. Erosion has worn the dam away, causing holes and <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> develop in the dam's upper layer, and water already passes through the lower section. Meanwhile, landslides have reduced dam strength on the outside. Seismic activity caused by the lake's volcanic foundation could thus cause the lake wall to give way, resulting in up to 50million cubic metres (1.8billion cuft) of water flooding downhill into areas of the Northwest Province and the Nigerian states of Taraba and Benue. Njilah estimates that the area is {{home to more than}} 10,000people.|$|E
25|$|The jacket harness is a {{waistcoat}} (vest) style garment {{with strong}} adjustable webbing straps which are adjustable and securely buckled over the shoulders, across {{the chest and}} waist, and through the crotch or around each thigh, so that the diver can not slide out under any predictable circumstance. The harness is fitted with several heavy duty D-rings, fixed to the webbing {{in such a way}} that the full weight of the diver and all his equipment can be safely supported. A minimum strength of 500kgf is recommended or required by some codes of practice. A jacket harness is usually provided with webbing straps or a cloth pocket on the back to support the bailout cylinder, and may have a variety of <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> carry tools, and may also carry ditchable or fixed main weights. There are usually several strong D-rings to secure the umbilical and other equipment.|$|E
25|$|Popper has {{developed}} some equipment innovations to accommodate {{his use of}} harmonicas during onstage performances. Because each individual diatonic harmonica is tuned to one particular key, he fashioned belts with enough <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> hold harmonicas in all 12 keys (plus extras) and wore them as a bandolier, or slung over his neck. He frequently has to switch keys multiple times within one song, and this arrangement allowed him to quickly trade one harmonica for another without looking. In 2002, he stopped using the belts because they no longer fit him properly due to his weight loss; now he carries his harmonicas in a small black attaché case. He uses a special microphone with switches that change the audio effect of the harmonica as it is played through an amplifier, similar to a guitar effects pedal. Popper was inspired by Jimi Hendrix's guitar playing to make his instrument sound however he wanted.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{the band}} {{received}} a substantial boost in funding, which allowed the band to supply more uniform parts {{free of charge}} that were previously purchased by band students. The band also purchased new cold weather overcoats that could be worn in the stands during a game. Previous cold weather coats included black wool, collared jackets from Holloway and Liz Claiborne. In 2013, the band has switched to double breasted wool overcoats which {{are similar to the}} U.S. Army's Class A overcoat. This coat features six Great Seal of Ohio buttons, and has large <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> keep band members' hands warm while not playing their instrument. The band also changed the vinyl spats. Previously worn spats had white elastic straps, which were a custom ordered product. Due to shortages in marching band spats across the United States, the band opted to wear standard white vinyl spats which have a black elastic strap.|$|E
500|$|After {{forming the}} band and finalizing the lineup in 1971, the band started to garner some local success doing live shows. Originally booked through the Ed Malhoit Agency, the band signed a {{promotion}} deal with Frank Connelly and eventually secured a management deal with David Krebs and Steve Leber in 1972. Krebs and Leber invited Columbia Records President Clive Davis to see the band at Max's Kansas City in New York City. Aerosmith was not originally scheduled to play {{that night at the}} club, but they paid from their own <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> secure a place on the bill, reportedly the only band ever to do so at Max's.

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} {{were created by}} Sony Pictures Imageworks, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns. The VFX company's two key goals were to {{accurately}} portray von Stauffenberg's injuries {{and to create a}} 1943 period look to Berlin. With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically, the majority of the 800 computer-generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg's injuries. A digital version of Cruise's hand was designed, and VFX employees rotoscoped the hand in every movement it could make so the missing fingers were erased in the process. With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg's hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own, were inescapable. According to VFX supervisor Richard R. Hoover, [...] "We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn't stick his hands in his <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> try and hide his injuries." ...|$|E

500|$|The stern section, which {{measures}} about [...] long, was catastrophically damaged during the descent and in {{landing on the}} sea bed. It had not fully filled with water when it sank and the increasing water pressure caused trapped air <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> implode, tearing apart the hull. It was loud enough that multiple survivors reported hearing explosions about ten seconds after the stern had sank beneath the waves. Data from a sonar map made during a 2010 expedition showed that the stern section rotated like a helicopter blade as it sank. The rudder appears to have swung over to an angle of about 30–45° during the stern's descent, causing the section to follow a tight spiral to the bottom. It probably struck rudder-first, burying most of the rudder in the mud up {{to a depth of}} [...] The decks pancaked {{on top of each other}} and the hull plating splayed out to the sides of the shattered section.

[...] GamesRadar also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that [...] "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough <b>pockets</b> <b>to</b> afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one." ...|$|E

It does not offer new historical knowledge to the viewer, even if one were to treat history as a novel: it reinforces, in truth, the ideas that the viewers bring, being zero in terms of increased knowledge...
