5|$|The {{tomb of the}} princess: {{dating to}} c. 1800 BC, it is the oldest and {{smallest}} of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained {{the remains of a}} young woman, hence the naming. The dormos has steps, partially cut in the bedrock and partially <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> stones, leading to the chamber, which was achieved through the enlargement of a natural cave. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.|$|E
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{the remedy}} was ‘oiling,’ whereby heavy asphaltic oil was sprayed atop {{a layer of}} gravel or other base material; a process was also {{referred}} to as ‘inverted penetration.” Oiling was soon supplanted by <b>paving</b> <b>with</b> bituminous mix (asphalt),a process still in wide use. <b>Paving</b> <b>with</b> concrete was also performed, albeit on a limited basis initially. (Concrete is now used more commonly, primarily in urban or high traffic rural settings.) By 1939, more than 90 percent of the state highway system had been paved.|$|R

5|$|The Ridge Route, officially the Castaic-Tejon Route, was a two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Kern counties, California. Opened in 1915 and <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> 15-ft {{concrete}} between 1917 and 1921, {{the road}} was the first paved highway directly linking the Los Angeles Basin with the San Joaquin Valley over the Tejon Pass and the rugged Sierra Pelona Mountains ridge south of Gorman. Much of the old road runs through the Angeles National Forest, and passes by many historical landmarks, including the National Forest Inn, Reservoir Summit, Kelly's Half Way Inn, Tumble Inn, and Sandberg's Summit Hotel. North of the forest, the Ridge Route passed through Deadman's Curve before ending at Grapevine.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, the PAVN {{logistical}} system {{consisted of}} a two-lane <b>paved</b> (<b>with</b> crushed limestone and gravel) highway that ran from the mountain passes of North Vietnam to the Chu Pong Massif in South Vietnam. By 1974 {{it was possible to}} travel a completely paved four-lane route from the Central Highlands to Tây Ninh Province, northwest of Saigon. The single oil pipeline that had once terminated near the A Shau Valley now consisted of four lines (the largest eight inches in diameter) and extended south to Lộc Ninh. In July 1973 the 259th Group as redesignated the Truong Son Command, the regimental sectors were converted to divisions, and the binh trams were designated as regiments. By late 1974 forces under the new command included AAA Division 377, Transportation Division 571, Engineering Division 473, the 968th Infantry Division, and sectoral divisions 470, 471, and 472.|$|E

5|$|Constructed by the Ruthvens {{after they}} {{acquired}} the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents {{the final stage}} of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children. The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately {{to the north of the}} de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.|$|E
5|$|During its peak, up to 300 people {{visited the}} hot spring daily. On 1 March 2002, {{it was closed}} for two months while {{upgrading}} and improvement works were carried out to {{the area around the}} spring, which had become sodden and muddy. Litter had also become a problem because of the increased numbers of visitors. The former dirt track leading to the spring was <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> cement, and lined with bougainvillea bushes and high fences to ensure the security of the air base. Drainage pipes were also installed. Mindef, which owns the land, allows public access between 7 am and 7 pm daily, free-of-charge. When the spring reopened on 1 May 2002, more than 100 people visited the site despite the afternoon drizzle. At the same time, some new free-hold condominiums were built in the surrounding area; one of the developments, built by the property arm of F in 2001, is called Seletaris after the company's former mineral water.|$|E
5|$|Ninah Cummer and Clara Cummer, {{both now}} widows, died in 1958. Ninah Cummer left her estate, {{including}} her gardens, to the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation for a museum to house her art collection. In 1960, the siblings' homes were both demolished {{in order to}} build the museum. Clara and Waldo's property was sold and now houses the Northeast Florida chapter of the American Red Cross and the Cummer's education center, Art Connections. Parts of the gardens were also destroyed during this demolition. The new building was designed by Saxelbye and Powell and constructed in 1961. It featured an Art Deco façade and an inner courtyard that was <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> the terra cotta tiles of the Cummers' old roof. One room from the original Cummer home, known as the Tudor Room, was preserved and incorporated into the new museum. The Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens, then named The Cummer Gallery, opened on November 11, 1961.|$|E

5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform's base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on either side of a stone ball.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Masks {{is named}} after the mosaic motif of theatre masks decorating ivy scrolls {{arranged}} in strips around a central surface area decorated in a cubic pattern. The more intricately decorated mosaics are found in four different rooms branching off from the peristyle courtyard <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> marble chips, with corridor mosaics utilizing amphora fragments. In the center of one mosaic is the figure of Dionysos riding a leopard against a similar black background to the mosaic in the House of Dionysos. Another central mosaic features a flute player and a dancing figure, the latter perhaps representing Silenus. Only the Dionysos figure employs the vermiculatum method. The other mosaics of the house fail to achieve the naturalism of finer figure scenes and motifs, but they nevertheless demonstrate an attempt at mimicking their illusionist qualities with the tesselated technique.|$|E
5|$|The Sammamish River valley {{was settled}} in the late 19th century and served by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad, built in 1889 from Bothell to North Bend, {{traveling}} through Redmond, Issaquah, Fall City, and Snoqualmie. By 1902, several wagon roads were built along the railroad, including a road between Fall City and North Bend, which was incorporated into the Sunset Highway when it was designated as a state highway in 1909. The road from Redmond to North Bend {{became part of the}} national Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s, including a section near Redmond that was <b>paved</b> <b>with</b> bricks in 1913. A portion of the Yellowstone Trail, along with unpaved roads from Redmond to Bothell, were designated as a state highway in 1925. The highway was paved in the late 1920s, and was incorporated into the Seattle–Fall City branch of the Sunset Highway (Primary State Highway 2) in 1937. After the opening of the North Bend bypass in 1941, the branch highway was extended to North Bend over the former Sunset Highway.|$|E
