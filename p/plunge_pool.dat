5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series of}} small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the <b>plunge</b> <b>pool.</b> Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E

5|$|Upstream {{from the}} bridge is a grotto and bath house, built in a similar rustic style and presumably by the same architect. The bath house is a square vaulted chamber, with a <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> fed by river water. The upper chamber {{comprises}} a circular saloon with windows, although this is now roofless and in poor condition. The original roof was a conical thatched structure, and a niche on the exterior wall may have housed a statue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plunge</b> <b>pools</b> {{are formed}} by the natural force of falling water, such as at a {{waterfall}} or cascade; they also result from man-made structures such as some spillway designs, <b>Plunge</b> <b>pools</b> are often very deep, generally related to the height of fall, the volume of water, {{the resistance of the}} rock below the pool and other factors. The impacting and swirling water, sometimes carrying rocks within it, abrades the riverbed into a basin, which often features rough and irregular sides. <b>Plunge</b> <b>pools</b> can remain long after the waterfall has ceased flow or the stream has been diverted. Several examples of former <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> exist at Dry Falls in the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington.|$|R

40|$|Many waterfalls {{have deep}} <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> {{that are often}} {{partially}} or fully filled with sediment. Sediment fill may control plunge-pool bedrock erosion rates, partially determine habitat availability for aquatic organisms, and affect sediment routing and debris flow initiation. Currently, there exists no mechanistic model to describe sediment transport through waterfall <b>plunge</b> <b>pools.</b> Here we develop an analytical model to predict steady-state plunge-pool depth and sediment-transport capacity by combining existing jet theory with sediment transport mechanics. Our model predicts plunge-pool sediment-transport capacity increases with increasing river discharge, flow velocity, and waterfall drop height and decreases with increasing plunge-pool depth, radius, and grain size. We tested the model using flume experiments under varying waterfall and plunge-pool geometries, flow hydraulics, and sediment size. The model and experiments show that through morphodynamic feedbacks, <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> aggrade to reach shallower equilibrium pool depths in response to increases in imposed sediment supply. Our theory for steady-state pool depth matches the experiments with an R^ 2 value of 0. 8, with discrepancies likely due to model simplifications of the hydraulics and sediment transport. Analysis of 75 waterfalls suggests that the water depths in natural <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> are strongly influenced by upstream sediment supply, and our model provides a mass-conserving framework to predict sediment and water storage in waterfall <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> for sediment routing, habitat assessment, and bedrock erosion modeling...|$|R
25|$|The {{extent by}} which Searsville Reservoir {{serves as a}} source for {{non-native}} species was illustrated when Stanford biologists studied the aquatic fauna found in the <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> below the Searsville dam spillway. The <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> was drained in 2013 to allow for a safety inspection of the base of the dam. Native species found when the <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> was pumped dry include two steelhead trout, 26 California roach and 22 Sacramento suckers. In contrast, more than 1,500 non-native fishes were encountered during the dewatering process, including over 500 sunfish including green sunfish ((Lepomis cyanellus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and likely redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), two bullhead catfish (Ameiurus species) and over 1,000 mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Other non-native in the <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> included 500 bullfrogs and 150 Louisiana red swamp crayfish.|$|E
25|$|Adjacent to {{the pool}} was a bathing {{pavilion}} which housed a diving and harbour <b>plunge</b> <b>pool,</b> a dance hall and dining rooms. The pool was blown down by a large storm in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Facilities {{provided}} {{included a}} large swimming pool, suites of private baths {{for men and}} woman, each with a small <b>plunge</b> <b>pool.</b> Additions were made which included a first class swimming pool, suites of first class private baths and a steam laundry to ease the demand at Kent Street.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{characterized}} by interconnected and hanging flood-created coulees, cataracts, <b>plunge</b> <b>pools,</b> kolk created potholes, rock benches, buttes and pinnacles typical of scablands.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with its}} 22 tennis courts, the NTC is {{equipped}} with a state-of-the-art gymnasium, outdoor sprint track, hydrotherapy, <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> and relaxation 'egg'. The NTC has overnight accommodation for up to 54 people, along with a player lounge and recreation room.|$|R
25|$|The deep <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> at {{the foot}} of the {{waterfall}} was hidden under the thick canopy of the tropical rainforest before deforestation. The Agbpkim Waterfalls on the Cross River descend in terraces through the tropical rainforest. There is a mini zoological garden housing species of animals rarely found in Nigeria, which has helped save some rare species from extinction.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{water slide}} uses a pump system to pump {{water to the}} top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces {{friction}} so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a <b>plunge</b> <b>pool)</b> or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually stationed {{at the top and}} the bottom of the slide, so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately.|$|E
25|$|Sir Michael Somare {{was called}} up to give an {{explanation}} on how he obtained a A$349,000 three-bedroom executive-style apartment with private <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> in inner-city Cairns in April 2007, brokered through a Gold Coast lawyer. Along with his son Arthur Somare who was PNG's State Enterprise Minister and a political heavyweight, he was questioned about a A$685,000 four-bedroom home he had bought two months prior at Trinity Beach. Ombudsman Commission, Opposition Leader Sir Mekere Morauta, and former finance minister Bart Philemon requested an explanation over the provided documents evident of the purchased property.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{characterized}} by interconnected and hanging flood-created coulees, cataracts, <b>plunge</b> <b>pools,</b> kolk created potholes, rock benches, buttes and pinnacles typical of scablands.

50|$|The Sandstone Snake-necked Turtle (Chelodina (Macrochelodina) burrungandjii) is a {{medium-sized}} turtle reaching carapace lengths of 316 mm. The species {{is found in}} the sandstone plateaus and escarpments and the <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> of Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory. The species had been long recognised as valid. However, it had been difficult to research due to the remoteness of its habitat. The species occurs in proximity to Chelodina oblonga, to which it is closely related. For the most part the two species are parapatric in distribution. However, they do come together in limited locations such as <b>plunge</b> <b>pools</b> {{at the base of the}} escarpments. In these areas there is hybridization between the species.|$|R
25|$|The Breakfast Room: A private small low-ceilinged room on {{the rustic}} floor of the south front. In the 18th century this was the house's only bathroom; more of an indoor {{swimming}} pool, the sunken <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> was heated and the room decorated in the Pompeian style complete with Corinthian columns. Converted by the Russian Countess of Pembroke to a breakfast room circa 1815, it is today wallpapered in a Chinese design, the paper being an exact copy of that used in the original 1815 decoration of the room. The 18th century furniture of a simulated-bamboo, Gothic style gives this private dining room a distinct oriental atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, after a tragedy, the Marine Spa was {{demolished}} to {{make way}} for the ill-fated Coral Island leisure complex. This was characterised by its concrete arches on its uppermost floor and sunbathing decks like those of a cruise liner. The site featured a hexagonal outdoor <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> surrounded by sunbathing terraces leading down to Beacon Cove beach. Inside the building were several lounges, a restaurant and a nightclub within the arches of the ancient swimming bath. All levels were served by a hydraulic passenger lift. Coral Island opened in 1977 and closed in 1988. The complex was demolished in 1997, 20 years after its construction. The site remained derelict until 2002 when the Living Coasts coastal zoo was built there.|$|E
500|$|Just {{outside the}} walls of the city, on the {{floodplain}} of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> with three steps leading into it. From the cold room one moved to a vestibule {{at the corner of the}} building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally into the hot room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters [...]|$|E
50|$|A stream pool may be bedded with {{sediment}} or armoured with gravel, and in {{some cases}} the pool formations may have been formed as basins in exposed bedrock formations. <b>Plunge</b> <b>pools,</b> or <b>plunge</b> basins, are stream pools formed by the action of waterfalls.|$|R
50|$|Swimming pool {{sanitation}} is {{the process}} of ensuring healthy conditions in swimming <b>pools,</b> hot tubs, <b>plunge</b> <b>pools,</b> and similar recreational water venues. Proper sanitation is needed to maintain the visual clarity of water and to prevent the transmission of infectious waterborne diseases.|$|R
50|$|The barrio has few {{destinations}} that tourists frequently visit. East of the Lo-oc {{river is}} a series of <b>plunge</b> <b>pools,</b> gorges and rock formations.

50|$|The main rock of {{the river}} valley is turbidite {{sandstone}} with some siltstone which are prevalent in the waterfalls and <b>plunge</b> <b>pools.</b> These lay {{on a bed of}} Precambrian sedimentary rock which show evidence of its oceanic origins in the ripple and folding marks on exposed surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The site, {{which include}} an active tufa-forming stream, {{is in the}} Forest of Dean plateau and Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

2500|$|Spillway Dam at Neponset St. - a.k.a. Canton Viaduct Falls impounds Mill Pond. [...] It is a weir or {{low head}} dam that {{is owned by}} the MBTA. [...] The 16' high by 90' long granite dam was built in 1900 and {{currently}} (2009) averages [...] cubic feet/second annual discharge. [...] Water power was supplied to nearby businesses via water wheel from the canal starting at the waterfall's enclosed <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> and continuing about 200' under the Neponset St. bridge. [...] There were also two channels located between the viaduct and the waterfall (one on each side) referred to as sluices, headraces and flumes in various maps. [...] They were filled in sometime after 1937 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [...] No. [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|However {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} late fall 2016 and {{announced by the}} Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in February 2017 strongly indicated that the disappearing water simply flows back into the Brule River shortly below the falls. [...] At the suggestion of state hydrologist Jeff Green, two DNR experts measured the water flow above the falls and several hundred feet below them. [...] The two readings were virtually identical, suggesting no water was being lost to some other outlet. [...] Green and a colleague plan to conduct a dye tracing experiment in fall 2017 when water flows drop again, {{with the hope of}} determining where the underground channel rejoins the main river. [...] They accounted for the failure of visitors' floating objects to reemerge by explaining that the powerful currents in the kettle's <b>plunge</b> <b>pool</b> would be enough to hold down most material until it was pulverized.|$|E

The west area includes the kitchen (still used as such by the school), the laundry, the dairy and at the extreme west the [...] orangery, designed by Vanbrugh. Although the Central Pavilion of the south front appears to be only two floors high, there are in fact bedrooms over the State Music & Drawing rooms, these are lit by windows facing respectively east and west. The centre is filled by the Marble Saloon which rises to the full height of the building. There are more bedrooms on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors of the north front, and the west and east pavilions of the south front, where the 2nd floor is disguised {{in the same way as}} in the central pavilion.|$|E
50|$|Every dam {{needs some}} form of energy {{dissipation}} in its discharge structure to prevent erosion and scour on the downstream side of the dam, since these phenomena can result in dam failure. <b>Plunge</b> <b>pools</b> (also called stilling basins) and impact boxes are two examples of energy dissipators used on dams.|$|R
50|$|This sudden flood put {{parts of}} Idaho, Washington, and Oregon under {{hundreds}} of feet of water {{in just a few}} days.
