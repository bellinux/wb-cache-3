5000|$|While he was implanted, Matt {{could control}} a {{computer}} [...] "mouse" [...] cursor, using it then to <b>press</b> <b>buttons</b> that can <b>control</b> TV, check e-mail, and do basically everything {{that can be}} done by pressing buttons. He could draw (although the cursor control is not precise) on the screen. He could also send commands to an external prosthetic hand (close and open). The results of the study are published in the journal Nature. Per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and the study protocol, the BrainGate device was removed from him after approximately one year.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLittle AI is a {{pedagogical}} game {{aimed at}} presenting the founding concepts of constructivist learning and developmental Artificial Intelligence. It primarily targets students {{in computer science}} and cognitive science {{but it can also}} interest the general public curious about these topics. It requires no particular scientific background; even children can find it entertaining. Professors can use it as a pedagogical resource in class or in online courses. The player <b>presses</b> <b>buttons</b> to <b>control</b> a simulated “baby robot”. The player cannot see the robot and its environment, and initially ignores the effects of the commands. The only information received by the player is feedback from the player’s commands. The player must learn, at the same time, the functioning of the robot’s body and the structure of the environment from patterns in the stream of commands and feedback. We argue that this situation is analogous to how infants engage in early-stage developmental learning (e. g., Piaget, 1937) ...|$|R
50|$|Debugging NMIs {{have also}} been used by devices that allow leisure users and gamers to {{manipulate}} running programs. Devices which added a button to generate an NMI, such as Romantic Robot's Multiface, were a popular accessory for 1980s 8-bit and 16-bit home computers. These peripherals had {{a small amount of}} ROM and an NMI <b>button.</b> <b>Pressing</b> the <b>button</b> transferred <b>control</b> to the software in the peripheral's ROM, allowing the suspended program to be saved to disk (very useful for tape-based games with no disk support, but also for saving games in progress), screenshots to be saved or printed, or values in memory to be manipulated—a cheating technique to acquire extra lives, for example.|$|R

It is a micro controller based device, which gives the alert sounds just by pressing the <b>control</b> <b>buttons,</b> which are given some redefined messages like asking for water, washroom etc., here the person can just <b>press</b> the <b>control</b> <b>button</b> which indicates the sign of water (example) then the device sounds the same with some output volume. Micro controller {{is the heart of}} the device. It stores the data of the needs of the person. So that it can make use of the data stored whenever the person uses the device. This device helps the deaf and dumb people to announce their requirements. By this the person who is near can understand their need and help them. This saves the time to understand each other and ease in communication.

50|$|The implicit-association test (IAT) {{measures}} differential {{associations of}} two target concepts.Subjects are instructed to <b>press</b> a <b>button</b> {{when they see}} an item (an image or word) that represents a particular concept, and a different button for items that represent another concept. For instance, a subject may <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for words related to weakness and button B for words related to strength. Then subjects may be instructed to <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for male words (he, boy) and button B for female words (she, girl). To test differential association between these two concepts (in this example, strength/weakness and gender), these two tasks would be combined. First, subjects would <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for strength or male, and button B for weakness and female; then they would <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for strength and female, and button B for weakness and male. Differential reaction time to each task may reveal implicit endorsement of that stereotype. For example, if a subject's reaction time is faster when male is paired with science and female is paired with arts, this suggests the subject more strongly associates males with science than females.|$|R

40|$|Perceptual {{filling-in}} {{refers to}} the fading of stabilized retinal patterns and their replacement by non-stabilized surrounding patterns. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to investigate neuronal correlates of perceptual filling-in induced by a dynamic random dot pattern. The stimulus consisted of a moving random dot pattern on dark background surrounding a region devoid of dots (artificial scotoma). The subjects fixated at an eccentrically located spot, and they reported the time of onset of filling-in by <b>button</b> <b>press.</b> We <b>controlled</b> for attention by dimming the fixation spot at random points in time, which the subjects reported via a separate <b>button</b> <b>press.</b> Catch trials in which the stimulus physically filled the artificial scotoma were interspersed with filling-in trials to gauge the subjects performance. General linear model techniques with appropriate predictors were used to define areas of interest for analysis. Filling-in trials for each subject were divided in two groups of 30 trial s each, based on whether filling in occurred earlier (lt; 8 s) or later (8 - 24 s) in a trial. The stimulus was identical for all trials. Preliminary results suggest that the fMRI signal from area V 1 rises initially in both groups but then dips and remains low for the group with early filling-in. This suggests that filling-in is associated with a relative suppression of cortical activity. Other interpretations will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} three new music controllers, each {{designed to be}} played by two players. As the intimacy between two people increases so does their ability to anticipate and predict the other's actions. We hypothesize that this intimacy between two people {{can be used as}} a basis for new controllers for musical expression. Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their tongues and lungs, <b>controlling</b> sound. Coordinated <b>button</b> <b>presses</b> <b>control</b> the music as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid rod with strain gauges and position sensors to track the rod's position. Each player holds opposite ends of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be built, is simply a string attached at both ends with two bridges. Tension is measured with strain gauges. Players manipulate the string tension at each end together to modulate sound. We are looking at different musical mappings appropriate for two players...|$|R
