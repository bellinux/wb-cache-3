40|$|The project {{objectives}} are {{to ensure that}} the simulation results are valid by comparison with the Standard Series Data and compare the performance of propeller with and without fins, based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The propeller is based on Wageningen B 3. 55 series and made from aluminium alloy. Theoretically the fins on the back side of propeller blade will increase the thrust produce by the propeller. The methodology of this project can be divide to three parts depends on the software used; PolyWorks, SolidWorks and CosmosFloWorks. The propeller is divided into two, with and without <b>fins.</b> A <b>propeller</b> with two <b>fins</b> in the format of PolyWorks file after the propeller had through 3 D scan process is provided, thus further 3 D modeling process using PolyWorks had to be made. Other than to process the propeller to desired shape, 3 D modeling also used to smoothen the surface, eliminate any defects like hole and gaps on the surface of propeller. SolidWorks is important software in this project not only because it can read the IGES file format from PolyWorks, also CosmosFloWorks is the plug-in for SolidWorks. The function of CosmosFloWorks is to analyze the performance of propellers where the value of thrust and torque is taken. Thrust is the force produced at a given speed when propeller rotates and torque is the moment act on the propeller blades. The value of thrust and torque from Standard Series Data and analysis of <b>propeller</b> without <b>fins</b> is compared to make sure the data from analysis is valid. It is observed that the value of thrust from Standard Series Data is higher than the thrust value from <b>propeller</b> without <b>fins</b> around 4. 3 % and 2. 6 % for torque. The velocity of boat is set from 3 knots to 7 knots and the slippage is not considered in the analysis. The average increase of thrust by the <b>propeller</b> with <b>fins</b> compare to <b>propeller</b> without <b>fins</b> is around 9. 1 % and 4. 4 % for torque value...|$|R
40|$|Passive locomotory {{tools for}} land {{locomotion}} {{have been shown}} to improve the economy and the speed of progression for any given metabolic power. Like bicycles (e. g. Minetti et al., 2001), roller-skates and skies for terrestrial locomotion, fins can be defined as passive tools for aquatic locomotion, as well as rafts, racing shells or hydrofoils. As pointed out by Abbott et al. (1995), four basic forces act on a boat (or a body) in water: lift, weight, drag and thrust. Human powered watercrafts are designed to decrease weight (e. g. buoyancy devices) and drag (e. g. streamlined shells, reduction of speed oscillations) and to increase lift (e. g. hydrofoils) and thrust (e. g. paddles, oars, <b>propellers).</b> <b>Fins</b> are meant to improve the fraction of the force (thrust) that is useful to propel the body forwards. In other words, they are meant to improve the propelling efficiency of aquatic locomotion...|$|R
50|$|The flat sided, {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage was aluminium framed and skinned. Its cockpit was enclosed {{by a single}} frame canopy, hinged on the port side. Behind the cockpit there was an extended fairing, starting at canopy height and tapering away just behind the wing trailing edge. A short, thin, streamlined pylon reached above it to support the upper wing centre section. Two 8 hp (6 kW) West Bend 82 go-kart engines were mounted behind the fairing on short struts, driving pusher <b>propellers.</b> <b>Fin</b> and rudder were straight tapered and square topped, with the latter extending down to the keel. The constant chord, square tipped tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carried separated elevators, cut away inboard to permit rudder movement. The landing gear comprised a monowheel, fixed but partially faired, a steerable tailwheel and two small balancing outrigger wheels on short, faired struts below the interplane struts.|$|R

For these reasons in the last 10 years, the research community {{in collaboration with the}} industries has developed new manufacturing techniques aimed at reducing the prototyping cost and provide rapidly models ready to be tested; moreover, a significant reduction of the necessary surface treatments and hand finishing has been achieved. In the present paper a review of the possible applications of rapid prototyping techniques for the production of model scale ships components is presented. A comparison of the hydrodynamical behaviour of similar propellers at model scale, made with different materials and produced using SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) technique, is reported.

50|$|Yves Chasle {{worked as}} an Aérospatiale stress {{engineer}} and independently designed several light aircraft, starting with the Chasle YC-12 Tourbillon. His YC-100 Hirondelle is a largely wooden framed and fabric covered single-seat sports aircraft of conventional pusher layout. It has a strut braced high wing of constant chord with styrofoam ribs. The fuselage of the Hirondelle is a slender, rectangular cross-sectioned beam with the pilot's seat upon it ahead of the wing leading edge. Behind the pilot a central structure supports the wing just above head level; on its trailing edge, one of several types of small piston engine, with power outputs typically around , drives a pusher <b>propeller.</b> The <b>fin</b> is broad and straight-tapered and the horizontal tail {{is attached to the}} fuselage underside.

50|$|Although {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a monoplane, most of Dunne's designs were required by his superior officer Col. Capper to be biplanes, typically featuring a fuselage nacelle between the planes with rear-mounted 'pusher' <b>propeller</b> and twin <b>fins</b> between each pair of wing tips. His D.7 monoplane of 1911 was a pusher type high-wing monoplane which featured turned-down wingtips with pronounced wash-out. Control surfaces on {{the trailing edge of}} each wing tip acted together as combined ailerons and elevators.|$|R
50|$|Separating {{the control}} {{surfaces}} allows for additional rudder area or vertical surface without requiring a massive single tail. On multi-engine <b>propeller</b> designs twin <b>fin</b> and rudders {{operating in the}} propeller slipstream give greater rudder authority and improved control at low airspeeds, and when taxiing. A twin tail can also simplify hangar requirements, give dorsal gunners enhanced firing area, {{and in some cases}} reduce the aircraft's weight. It also affords a degree of redundancy—if one tail is damaged, the other may remain functional.|$|R
50|$|The P.B.23 was {{designed}} in 1915 as a single-seat biplane scout, with a fuselage nacelle strut-mounted between the wings.

The P.B.23 failed to gain an order after it first flew in September 1915, but twenty of an improved version, the P.B.25, were ordered by the Royal Naval Air Service. The P.B.25 had swept-back wings, a modified landing gear and a revised fuselage nacelle and although originally powered by a 110 hp (82 kW) Clerget rotary engine, the 20 RNAS aircraft were fitted with Gnome Monosoupape 9 Type B-2 rotary piston engines.|$|R

50|$|Foil shaped fins {{generate}} thrust when moved, {{the lift}} of the fin sets water or air in motion and pushes the fin {{in the opposite}} direction. Aquatic animals get significant thrust by moving fins {{back and forth in}} water. Often the tail fin is used, but some aquatic animals generate thrust from pectoral fins. Fins can also generate thrust if they are rotated in air or water. Turbines and propellers (and sometimes fans and pumps) use a number of rotating fins, also called foils, wings, arms or blades. <b>Propellers</b> use the <b>fins</b> to translate torquing force to lateral thrust, thus propelling an aircraft or ship. Turbines work in reverse, using the lift of the blades to generate torque and power from moving gases or water.|$|R

40|$|Economic {{pressures}} and regulatory requirements have {{brought about a}} great interest in improving ship propulsion efficiency. This can be exercised by installing Energy Saving Devices (ESD) such as <b>Propeller</b> Boss Cap <b>Fins</b> (PBCF). This paper demonstrates an approach for optimising PBCF by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The conducted CFD open water model tests were validated by comparison with experimental data until the simulation was deemed satisfactory within the capabilities and limitations of the model. A design and optimisation procedure was defined to analyse the impact of ESDs on propeller efficiency and then used to evaluate the different geometric parameters and locations of the PBCF on the hub. This analysis was done at full scale using high fidelity CFD - based RANS methods. Outcomes of the study include a design and optimisation process {{that can be used for}} the analysis of other ESDs on the market. The influences of varying the geometry of the PBCF were examined with optimal solutions presented for the analysis case.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulated and experimental results of propeller-rudder systems with <b>propeller</b> boss cap <b>fins</b> (PBCFs) and analyzes the hydrodynamic performance of PBCFs in propeller-rudder systems. The {{purpose is to}} study the impact of PBCFs on the hydrodynamic performance of rudders. Hydrodynamic experiments were carried out on propeller-rudder systems with PBCFs in a cavitation tunnel. The experimental energy-saving effect of the PBCF without a rudder was 1. 47 % at the design advance coefficient J[*]=[*] 0. 8. The numerical simulation {{was based on the}} Navier–Stokes equations solved with a sliding mesh and the SST (Shear Stress Transfer) k-ω turbulence model. After the grid independence analysis, the flow fields of an open-water propeller with and without a PBCF were compared, then the efficiencies of the propulsion systems including different rudders and the thrust coefficient Kr of rudders were analyzed. The results indicate that the installation of a PBCF increases the resistance of the rudder, which results in a reduction in the energy-saving effect of the PBCF. At the design advance coefficient, the energy-saving effect of the PBCF with an ordinary rudder and a twisted rudder decreases from 1. 47 % to 1. 08 % and 1. 16 %, respectively; thus, it is important to factor in the rudder of a propulsion system when evaluating the energy-saving effects of PBCFs...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to this design over {{the more traditional}} system of placing one engine on each wing, the most important being power from two engines with the frontal area (and thus drag) of a single-engine design, allowing for higher performance. It also keeps {{the weight of the}} twin powerplants near, or on, the aircraft centerline, increasing the roll rate compared to a traditional twin. In addition, a single engine failure does not lead to asymmetric thrust, and in normal flight there is no net torque, so the plane is easy to handle. The choice of a full [...] "four-surface" [...] set of cruciform tail surfaces in the Do 335's rear fuselage design, included a ventral vertical fin-rudder assembly to project downwards from the extreme rear of the fuselage, {{in order to protect the}} rear propeller from an accidental ground strike on takeoff. The presence of the rear pusher propeller also mandated the provision for an ejection seat for safe escape from a damaged aircraft, and designing the rear <b>propeller</b> and dorsal <b>fin</b> mounts to use explosive bolts to jettison them before an ejection was attempted — as well as twin canopy jettison levers, one per side located to either side of the forward cockpit interior just below the sills of the five-panel windscreen's sides, to jettison the canopy from atop the cockpit before ejection.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) deployed in different applications such as oceanographic survey, search and detection tasks in a given area necessitates {{the development of an}} appropriate path following controller which offers a precise and rapid control of the AUVs’ control surfaces and propeller system. In order to design such a vehicle control system, {{there is a need for}} good approximation of the vehicles static and dynamic model. Based on a combination of theoretical and empirical data, it can provide a good starting point for vehicle control system development as well as an alternative to the typical trial-and-error methods used for controller design and tuning. As there are no standard procedure for AUV modeling, the simulation of each autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) represents a new challenge. This thesis describes the development of a six degree of freedom, non-linear simulation model for the prototype AUV. In this model, all the forces which strongly affect the dynamic performance of an AUV such as the external forces and moments resulting from hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, lift and drag, added mass, and the control inputs of the AUV <b>propeller</b> and <b>fins</b> are all defined in terms of vehicle coefficients. Computational Fluid Dynamics along with empirical formulas have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of the AUV. In order to model the behavior of the AUV as closely to the real-world system as possible, the equations used for determining the coefficients, as well as those describing the AUVs’ motions were left in non-linear form. Simulation of the AUV motion was achieved using numerical integration techniques of the equations of motion based on the derived coefficients. From the simulation, of the AUV model, results observed led to the development of a controller for the prototype AUV. Sliding Mode Controller was chosen as the desired controller because of its definitive advantages over the PID controller, some of which are the straightforward firmware implementation, use of discrete decision rules which allows the controller to function in hybrid feedback configuration and the fact that it does not suffer from issues related with the drift in controller signal output with time, i. e. latency issues for real time applications. The developed model of the prototype AUV was decoupled into two separate parts namely Heading control and Depth control. State Space Model for each part was derived and a Sliding Mode controller was developed based on the required dynamics of each part. Simulations of the AUV model integrated with Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) was carried out to determine whether the controller was able to direct the motion of the prototype AUV along the desired path, i. e. the level of accuracy of the prototype AUV in path following task...|$|R

The design parameters of PBCF have been selected based on the geometrical shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a propeller open water (POW) test was performed to check the validity of CFD analysis. The design of experiment (DOE) case was selected as a full factorial design, and the experiment was analyzed by POW and CFD analysis.

40|$|The initial water {{impact of}} a free-falling object is {{primarily}} related to the fluid forces on the wetted surface of the object. The shape-dependent added-mass coefficients express the fluid forces integrated over the body, and thus physically represent the additional inertia of water accelerated with the body. The field of hydrodynamic impact has been primarily concerned with estimating the added-mass coefficients of various types of bodies for different water impact types, such as seaplane landings, torpedo drops, and ship slamming. In this study, a numerical model has been constructed to estimate the hydrodynamic impact loads of a REMUS dropped in free-fall from a helicopter in a low hover. Developed by von Alt and associates at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the REMUS (Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS) is a small, man-portable, torpedo shaped Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) that is normally operated from small boats {{for a variety of}} scientific, industrial, and military applications. Finite-element method software and computer aided drafting tools were used to create a simplified model of REMUS without <b>fins,</b> <b>propeller,</b> or transducers. (cont.) This axisymmetric REMUS model was cut by a flat free surface at various pitch angles and submergence values, and a panel mesh of the wetted surface of the vehicle was created using an automatic mesh generator.

Each panel mesh was evaluated for its added- mass characteristics using a source collocation panel method developed by Dr. Yonghwan Kim, formerly of the Vortical Flow Research Laboratory (VFRL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
