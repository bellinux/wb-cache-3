40|$|Environmental {{concern on}} {{packaging}} and packaging materials is growing worldwide, mainly related to waste management and waste treatment, {{but also with}} respect to resources and energy saving efforts. In Europe, a directive on <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> waste issued by the European Community administration is currently being discussed and may be implemented within 1993 or 1994. The aim of this directive is the reduction of packaging waste by requiring - reusable packaging - recovery of packaging materials, - energy recovery from packaging waste to a certain, quantitativly defined extend. From the environmental point of view there are clear priorities on packaging: avoidance of waste by reuse, recovery of packaging waste by material recovery or at least by energy recovery, minimization of materials for final deposition. Methods to evaluate the environmental impact are life cycle analysis and assessment ("eco balance sheets") {{as well as the}} aim of a closed loop material economy. The European st andardization organization CEN is currently developping criteria for environmental conscious packaging, including terminology, life cycle analysis, material recovery, energy recovery, degradability and composting. Thus this standards will affect in future distribution technology, packaging materials development, e. g. biodegradable plastics, reusable and refillable packaging and also packaging testing relating to transportation loads...|$|E

40|$|In {{trying to}} get {{products}} out to the market in promotional or display packaging, companies {{have the option of}} turning to a contract packager. The purpose of this thesis is to present the area of contract packaging, specifically discussing the internal factors that make a contract packager an attractive actor to outsource packaging of products to and also to find out how a contract packager can affect the supply chain of the company outsourcing to such an actor. The questions posed in this thesis are: - When is it appropriate to outsource? - Why is a supplier of contract packaging successful? - How is the supply chain affected when outsourcing to a contract packager? In addressing these questions a systems approach has been used, because a systems approach allows the researcher to see properties of the whole, rather than seeing the sum of parts as the collective properties of a system. The empirical data were collected through a case study of one company performing contract packaging. Literature was studied in the areas of outsourcing, supply chain/supply chain management, third-party logistics and contract packaging. Each of the questions posed was answered through the papers appended in this thesis. The first paper uses complexity theory in order for managers to be able to view outsourcing situations from a balanced perspective, providing guidance from two important functions – relative power and interface complexity. The conclusion reached in this paper is that in order for an outsourcing situation to be appropriate, the outsourcing company, vis-à-vis the supplier of the activity/process, needs to have high relative power while keeping interface complexity low. V The second and third papers discuss why a contract packager is successful and how it affects the supply chain of the company engaging it. In reference to the contract packager, it is ascertained that important activities to offer, besides the packing of products, are design and manufacturing of packaging and warehousing of the product of the customer. In using a contract packager, the company engaging it can utilize certain characteristics of contract packaging. The characteristics displayed by contract packaging are the “one-stop shop”, flexibility and warehousing. These characteristics give an outcome in the supply chain that can be used by the company to achieve effectiveness — from manufacturing of the product to the delivery of the product in display packaging to the store. The company’s supply chain is enabled to reduce uncertainty, reduce time-to-market of the promotions, and increase responsiveness. The company can also realize other benefits including consolidation of products and postponement of manufacturing of <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing...</b>|$|E

40|$|Non-linear pricing, {{the fact}} that prices do not {{necessarily}} change in proportion to size, is a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, it has been neither particularly well understood nor well measured. Non-linear pricing is of practical importance for statistical agencies who, in constructing price indexes, are often required to compare the relative price of a product-variety of two different sizes. It is usually assumed that prices change one-for-one with <b>package</b> <b>and</b> <b>pack</b> size (e. g. a 1 -liter cola costs {{half as much as}} a 2 -liter bottle). We question the wisdom of such an assumption and outline a model to flexibly estimate the price-size function. Applying our model to a large U.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the main}} roles of food {{packaging}} is to retard the natural processes that lead to food deterioration and reduction in quality, safety or both. Food industry has long {{recognized the importance of}} using antioxidants (AOs) for this purpose. The use of antioxidants is not restricted to its direct addition to foods, but they can also be added to the food packaging which can act as a reservoir and release them by a controlled mechanism of diffusion. Packaging designed to foster desirable food packaging interactions have been called as active packaging. The active packaging with antioxidant properties either uses AOs in the form of independent sachets or incorporates them in the polymeric matrix of the packaging. Although many of these antioxidants are artificial molecules like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) or butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), nowadays {{there is a tendency to}} search for natural molecules with the same properties but which are not related with possible toxicological side effects. The most recent contributions on active packaging with natural antioxidants have been reviewed. Material and Methods: For this study, an extensive bibliographic review on food packaging with incorporated natural antioxidants was carried out. Special attention is given to the antioxidants activity tests carried out in both <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>packed</b> foods. Results <b>and</b> conclusion: In the last years, different pure standards of natural antioxidants were incorporated in food packaging such as alpha-tocopherol, caffeic acid, catechin, quercetin or carvacrol. On the other hand, sources of natural antioxidants have also been incorporated in packaging for food applications such as cinnamon, oregano, clove, rosemary, ginger, clove and lemongrass essential oils and extracts of barley husks, green tea, mint and pomegranate peel. DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) is the most common test used to evaluate the antioxidant activity (AA) in packaging, while most of the times the determination of the AA of packed foods is carried out with TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay, although other methods are also used (peroxide value, free fatty acids, conjugated dienes and conjugated triene hydroperoxides, p-anisidine value and hexanal analysis). Generally, because there is no consensus on the best test, most of the studies use more than one test to evaluate the AA. Attention was also devoted to the study of the migration of natural antioxidants into food simulants or foods. Recently, there were great improvements in food packaging materials in order to increase food shelf life and to decrease the impact of packaging in the environment. Therefore, there is a growing interest on the association of active packaging with natural AOs with biodegradable <b>and</b> edible <b>packaging.</b> This work was funded under the Project “SafePack – Evaluation of the food safety of active packaging with antioxidant properties“ of the National Institute of Health Dr Ricardo Jorge, I.

40|$|Aims: We tested whether {{prevalence}} of cigarette <b>pack</b> display <b>and</b> smoking at outdoor venues <b>and</b> <b>pack</b> orientation changed following {{the introduction of}} plain <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> larger pictorial health warnings in Australia. Methods: Between October and April 2011 – 12 (pre-plain <b>packaging,</b> pre-PP) <b>and</b> 2012 – 13 (post-plain packaging, post-PP), we counted patrons, smokers <b>and</b> tobacco <b>packs</b> at cafés, restaurants and bars with outdoor seating. Pack type (fully branded, plain or unknown) and orientation were noted. Rates of <b>pack</b> display, smoking <b>and</b> <b>pack</b> orientation were analysed using multi-level Poisson regression. Results: Pack display declined by 15 % [adjusted incident rate ratio (IRR) [*]=[*] 0. 85, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [*]=[*] 0. 79 – 0. 91, P[*]<[*] 0. 001], driven by a 23 % decline in active smoking (IRR[*]=[*] 0. 77, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 71 – 0. 84, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) between phases. The decline in pack display coincided with the full implementation of plain packaging from December 2012, was stronger in venues with children present and was limited to mid and high socio-economic status (SES) areas. The proportion of packs orientated face-up declined from 85. 4 % of fully branded packs pre-PP to 73. 6 % of plain packs post-PP (IRR[*]=[*] 0. 87, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 79 – 0. 95, P[*]=[*] 0. 002). Alternatively, the proportions concealed by telephones, wallets or other items (4. 4 % of fully branded <b>packs</b> pre-PP <b>and</b> 9. 5 % of plain packs post-PP; IRR[*]=[*] 2. 33, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 72 – 3. 17, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and in an external case (1. 5 – 3. 5 % of all packs; IRR[*]=[*] 2. 79, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 77 – 4. 40, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) increased. Low SES areas evidenced the greatest increase in <b>pack</b> concealment <b>and</b> the greatest decline in face-up pack orientation. Conclusions: Following Australia's 2012 policy of plain <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> larger pictorial health warnings on cigarette <b>and</b> tobacco <b>packs,</b> smoking in outdoor areas of cafés, restaurants and bars <b>and</b> personal <b>pack</b> display (packs clearly visible on tables) declined.

The packaging was designed with a capacity of 8 kg and 15 kg using two packing pattern, namely the fcc and Jumble. Based on the physical and mechanical properties, optimal packing pattern of 8 kg container was 8, 4, and 4 pieces of fruit for the long x, y, and z direction, respectively, with the density of 62 %. Therefore, gave packaging dimension of 39. 4 x 21 x 21 cm. For the 15 kg container, the optimal packing pattern was 8, 6 and 5 pieces of fruit for the x, y, and z direction, respectively, with the packing density of 65. 6 %.
