40|$|Direct {{injection}} {{is becoming}} an important option to further optimize internal combustion engines. In the case of two stroke engines, the opportunity of dramatically reducing the HC emissions by almost eliminating short circuit while scavenging, makes this system even more attractive. For small two stroke engines, like the ones used to <b>power</b> <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> tools, the need of a high pressure fuel pump (its size and electricity needs) makes {{that the use of}} direct injection becomes not feasible. By using a self pressurized (boosted) direct injector, the opportunity of using direct injection opens for these small engines since a high pressure pump is not needed. The Evinrude E-TEC™ outboard engine uses a direct injection system which makes use of this kind of injectors. The Evinrude E-TEC™ outboard engine is analyzed in a test rig to find out the characteristics of the injector and the combustion modes the engine runs at different speeds and loads. The emissions of the engine are measured, along with the power, speed, combustion chamber pressure trace, bsfc, and voltage and current developed by the injector...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Woodcutters’ working {{conditions}} are difficult {{due to the}} presence of numerous occupational hazards. Petrol –fuelled <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> commonly used in forestry produce vibration, which may lead to the development of non-specific disorders in the upper extremities of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operator, referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). The magnitude of coupling forces exerted on a vibrating tool handle may affect the severity of HAVS and hand-wrist cumulative trauma disorders. The aim of the presented study was to measure coupling forces exerted by fellers on various <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> and to find correlation between force magnitude and type of tool used. Material and methods. Coupling forces applied by workers on different types of <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> were measured by means of a hydro-electronic force meter. All measurements were carried out during the harvesting of wood in real work conditions. Results. Mean force applied by forestry workers on their tools was 44. 2 N. Coupling forces registered during cutting wood with small universal <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> were larger than forces exerted on models characterized by higher power profile. Forces applied on comparable tools produced by various manufacturers also differed. Conclusions. The relationship between coupling forces and <b>power</b> of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> should lead to ergonomic improvements of the tool and vibration-reducing devices. These results can also be used as a recommendation for fellers in a range of using proper machines for different types of cut or types of wood. They may also be applicable to develop more effective methods for assessing vibration exposure risks among woodcutters...|$|R

It {{is one of the most}} important disposal as health care among <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operators to leave a worker with disorders off using a <b>chain</b> <b>saw.</b> The author discussed on results of health examination for <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operators performed before and after the disposal introduced in 1973. Two hundred and six examinees were divided into five groups classified by clinical findings of Raynaud's phenomenon, types of work after leaving off a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> work and medical care. The results were as follows: 1) It was not effective for a worker with Raynaud's phenomenon to leave off a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operation. 2) It was also not effective for an elder worker with long term experience of a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operation to leave off the work. 3) It was effective for a worker without abnormal findings on X-ray film of the elbow to stop using a <b>chain</b> <b>saw.</b> The author concluded that the disposal of leaving off a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operation should be provided before appearance of Raynaud's phenomenon and a change from operating a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> to using a hand saw and an axe was not effective for the worker with abnormality on X-ray film of the elbow...|$|R

40|$|Boatbuilding, {{shaping the}} body with {{chainsaws}} About 30 persons gathered in the forest where a large tree had been felled. Using chainsaws men were taking turns shaping the boat body {{out of the tree}} trunk. Meanwhile women were busy cooking for all participants. It takes long time to make a boat. The first step is felling the tree. Next the body is shaped, as recorded here. It takes several full day sessions before that is done. The next major event is pulling the canoe/boat body to the beach. There was no opportunity to record this stage of boat building. Depending on what kind of boat is made, further steps are taken to finish it on the beach (see separate recordings of men working on boat building in Ujir) The media files are concatenated from the following original files: (date; length of recording; short description of sequence) 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 1 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 19 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 2 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 20 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 3 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 4 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 5 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 6 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 7 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 8 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 08 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 9 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 28 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 10 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 26 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 11 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 21 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 12 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 31 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 13 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 45 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 14 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 15 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 04 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 16 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 25 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing,</b> guys watching 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 17 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 07 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 18 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 19 WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 09 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 20 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 21 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 22 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 32 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 23 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 18 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 24 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 14 people, end of the big tree trunk, cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 25 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 26 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 20 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 27 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 28 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 18 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 29 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 15 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 30 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 25 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 31 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 32 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 17 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 33 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 34 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 10 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 35 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 36 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 37 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 14 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 38 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 39 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 23 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 40 _WellfeltE 00 : 01 : 00 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 41 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 27 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 42 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 59 chain sawin...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a concept, known {{for many years}} and commonly applied in the automotive industry, to improve engine performance of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> (higher maximum <b>power</b> rating and more advantageous torque parameters). The analyses were conducted on a Husqvarna 357 XP power saw, equipped with a modified resonance exhaust system with variable dimensions. The system was designed at the Department of Forest Technology (Poznań University of Life Sciences) to the already existing power unit, with specific timing gear, size, shape and angle of cylinder ducts. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess mechanical vibrations, recorded at the handles of a Husqvarna 357 XP <b>chain</b> <b>saw,</b> at three operation regimes of its engine. Analyses were conducted on the same <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> equipped with an original vibration damper and a modified resonance system in its three variants and it may be stated that the introduction of design changes in the exhaust system has a significant effect on an increase in the power and torque of the tested <b>chain</b> <b>saw.</b> On the basis of recorded results it may be stated that the acceleration of vibrations both on the rear and front handles of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> significantly differs in case of the application of the modified exhaust system in comparison to the original vibration damper. The application of the resonance system in the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> exhaust system leads to increased mechanical vibrations produced by the machine. However, it needs to be observed that the volume of the admissible standard is exceeded both for the chainsaw with the original damper and that with the used exhaust system. Vibrations of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> with a resonance damper on the front handle are higher than those of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> with the original damper on average by 28 %, while on the rear handle it is by 27 %.
