40|$|Environmental metrics play a {{significant}} role in behavioural change, policy formation, education, and industrial decision-making. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a powerful framework for providing information on environmental impacts, but LCA data is under-utilized, difficult to access, and difficult to understand. Some of the issues that are required to be resolved to increase relevancy and use of LCA are accessibility, validation, reporting and <b>publication,</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparency.</b> This thesis proposes that many of these issues can be resolved through the application of open frameworks for LCA software and data. The open source software (OSS), open data, open access, and semantic web movements advocate the transparent development of software and data, inviting all interested parties to contribute. A survey was presented to the LCA community to gauge the community’s interest and receptivity to working within open frameworks, as well as their existing concerns with LCA data. Responses indicated dissatisfaction with existing tools and some interest in open frameworks, though interest in contributing was weak. The responses also pointed out transparency, the expansion of LCA information, and feedback to be desirable areas for improvement. Software for providing online LCA databases was developed according to open source, open data, and linked data principles and practices. The produced software incorporates features that attempt to resolve issues identified in previous literature in addition to needs defined from the survey responses. The developed software offers improvements over other databases in areas of transparency, data structure flexibility, and ability to facilitate user feedback. The software was implemented as a proof of concept, as a test-bed for attracting data contributions from LCA practitioners, and as a tool for interested users. The implementation allows users to add LCA data, to search through LCA data, and to use data from the software in separate independent tools [...] The research contributes to the LCA field by addressing barriers to improving LCA data and access, and providing a platform on which LCA database tools and data can develop efficiently, collectively, and iteratively...|$|E

40|$|The paper studies {{liquidity}} (accumulating an ex-ante bu¤er {{of short-term}} assets) <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> (making solvency information easily {{available to the}} market) as two alternative mechanisms of managing bank liquidity risk. We examine the determinants of liquidity <b>and</b> <b>transparency,</b> whether they are complements or substitutes, and how regulation on one dimen-sion can a¤ect the other. We 8 ̆ 5 nd that under some conditions liquidity <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> are perfect substitutes in bank liquidity risk management. When such conditions are relaxed, banks may rely on both liquidity <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> in their risk management. However their decisions on liquid-ity <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> may be socially suboptimal when banks (1) expect LOLR intervention, (2) believe that other banks take suboptimal liquidity or transparency decisions, (3) anticipate more systemic or more severe liq-uidity shocks. This creates a rationale for the CB to encourage prudent liquidity risk management by banks, on both liquidity <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> dimensions. However, while optimal liquidity can be imposed on banks by regulation, the regulatory lever on transparency choices may be smaller. We show that liquidity requirements may compromise bankstransparency incentives and can thus reduce social welfare, implying important challenges for optimal regulatory design...|$|R
