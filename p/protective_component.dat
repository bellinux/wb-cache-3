We therefore hypothesized that A. fumigatus biofilms also possess eDNA as part of the ECM, conferring a functional role. Fluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR analyses demonstrated the presence of eDNA, which was released phase dependently (8 &# 60; 12 &# 60; 24 &# 60; 48 h). Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR showed that eDNA was identical to genomic DNA. Biofilm architectural integrity was destabilized by DNase treatment. Biochemical and transcriptional analyses showed that chitinase activity and mRNA levels of chitinase, a marker of autolysis, were significantly upregulated as the biofilm matured and that inhibition of chitinases affected biofilm growth and stability, indicating mechanistically that autolysis was possibly involved. Finally, using checkerboard assays, it was shown that combinational treatment of biofilms with DNase plus amphotericin B and caspofungin significantly improved antifungal susceptibility. Collectively, these data show that eDNA is an important structural component of A. fumigatus ECM that is released through autolysis, which is important for protection from environmental stresses, including antifungal therapy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Leptin is a 16 kDa protein mainly {{produced}} by adipose tissue {{in proportion to}} adipose tissue mass. Originally {{thought to be a}} satiety factor, leptin is a pleiotropic molecule. In addition to playing a role in energy regulation, leptin also regulates endocrine and immune functions. Both the structure of leptin and that of its receptor suggest that leptin might be classified as a cytokine. The secondary structure of leptin has similarities to the long-chain helical cytokines family, which includes interleukin 6 (IL- 6), IL- 11, CNTF, and LIF, and the leptin receptor is homologous to the gp- 130 signal-transducing subunit of the IL- 6 -type cytokine receptors. Leptin plays a role in innate and acquired immunity. Leptin levels increase acutely during infection and inflammation, and may represent a <b>protective</b> <b>component</b> of the host response to inflammation. More important, leptin deficiency increases susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory stimuli and is associated with dysregulation of cytokine production. Leptin deficiency also causes a defect in hematopoiesis. Leptin regulates T cells responses, polarizing Th cells toward a Th 1 phenotype. Low leptin levels occurring during starvation mediate the neuroendocrine and immune dysfunction of starvation. —Faggioni, R., Feingold, K. R., Grunfeld, C.

The ubiquitin ligases RNF 8 and RNF 168 assemble ubiquitin chains onto histone molecules surrounding DNA breaks and facilitate retention of DNA repair proteins. Although RNF 8 and RNF 168 play important roles in repair of DNA double strand breaks, their requirement for cell protection from replication stress is largely unknown. In this study, we uncovered RNF 168 -independent roles of RNF 8 in repair of replication inhibition-induced DNA damage. We showed that RNF 8 depletion, but not RNF 168 depletion, hyper-sensitized cells to hydroxyurea and aphidicolin treatment. Consistently, hydroxyurea induced persistent single strand DNA lesions and sustained CHK 1 activation in RNF 8 -depleted cells. In line with strict requirement for RAD 51 -dependent repair of hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks, RNF 8 depletion compromised RAD 51 accumulation onto single strand DNA lesions, suggesting that impaired replication fork repair may underlie the enhanced cellular sensitivity to replication arrest observed in RNF 8 -depleted cells.

Rabbits were orally immunized by gastric feeding with Campylobacter spp., and 27 to 30 days later, they were challenged with matched or unmatched serogroups by the removable intestinal tie adult rabbit diarrhea (RITARD) procedure. When immunized animals were challenged with different Lior serotypes, no protection against colonization was seen; however, when challenged with homologous Lior serogroups, protection was demonstrated. Immune animals were colonized {{for an average}} of 1 day or less versus at least 6 days for nonimmune animals. Rabbits challenged with matched Penner-unmatched Lior strains showed only marginal protection.

Campylobacter coli VC 167 B 3, an isogenic, nonflagellated mutant, did not colonize rabbits regardless of the route of administration. Single feeding of the mutant strain did not protect the host, whereas three feedings, 48 h apart, resulted in complete protection against the flagellated parent strain. When mutant strain immunized rabbits were challenged with other strains of the same Lior serotype, marginal protection was obtained.

40|$|Remote {{preconditioning}} is {{a promising}} and robust treatment for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury that evokes cardioprotection through endogenous neural and/or humoral signaling. A recent study {{has reported that}} protective signaling is mediated by exosomes through the circulation; however this concept is supported by limited and inconsistent evidence. Despite overwhelming success in preclinical studies, the efficacy of remote preconditioning in human studies is inconclusive. Importantly, the majority of remote preconditioning studies use healthy animal models despite growing evidence that comorbidities, such as type- 2 diabetes, may negatively influence outcomes. Nonetheless, the efficacy of remote preconditioning {{in the setting of}} type- 2 diabetes has not been investigated. Using an established model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in the Zucker model of type- 2 diabetes and a model of hypoxia/reoxygenation in cultured HL- 1 cardiomyocytes we tested four hypotheses: i. remote preconditioning is ineffective in early-stage type- 2 diabetes in vivo; ii. the traditional ultracentrifugation technique for exosomes isolating is inadequate to isolate protective factor(s) from remote preconditioning; iii. enhanced ultracentrifugation technique for exosome isolation sequesters a protective fraction of serum; iv. the humoral component of remote preconditioning is defective in type- 2 diabetes. In support of Hypothesis I, we demonstrate that remote preconditioning failed to reduce infarct size caused by ischemia/reperfusion in the Zucker model of early-stage type- 2 diabetes. Our results illustrate that the loss in efficacy is not the result of hyperglycemia per se nor sensitization of the myocardium to ischemia/reperfusion. Subsequently, we sought to isolate a subfraction of serum from remote preconditioned rats which contained exosomes that could communicate protection and render HL- 1 cardiomyocytes resistant to hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death. In agreement with Hypothesis II, we report that the traditional ultracentrifugation isolation technique (100, 000 xg for 2 hr) did not isolate the <b>protective</b> <b>component</b> with the exosome-rich pellet from serum, suggesting that the <b>protective</b> <b>component</b> remained in the supernatant. In accordance with these observations, we enhanced the ultracentrifugation technique to improve exosome sedimentation and obtain a protective sub-fraction of serum. In agreement with Hypothesis III, the enhanced ultracentrifugation technique (300, 000 xg for 12 hr) isolated a protective exosome-rich supernatant fraction from remote preconditioned serum. However, our enhanced ultracentrifugation technique also yielded an additional, exosome-rich pellet and an exosome-depleted fraction, neither of which evoked protection. Lastly, in support of Hypothesis IV, we demonstrate that unfractionated serum and the exosome-rich supernatant fraction obtained from remote preconditioned diabetic Zucker Fatty rats did not protect HL- 1 cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation. In conclusion, our results illustrate {{for the first time that}} the infarct-sparing efficacy of remote preconditioning is abolished in the setting of early-stage type- 2 diabetes. We demonstrate that exosomes, although not sufficient for protection, may be requisite in the humoral component of remote preconditioning. Finally, we report that the humoral component of remote preconditioning is defective in the setting of type- 2 diabetes – a defect that may contribute to the failure of remote conditioning to limit infarct size in this comorbid model...|$|E
50|$|A TVS diode {{is a type}} of Zener diode, {{also called}} an {{avalanche}} diode or silicon avalanche diode (SAD), which can limit voltage spikes. These components provide the fastest limiting action of <b>protective</b> <b>components</b> (theoretically in picoseconds), but have a relatively low energy absorbing capability. Voltages can be clamped to less than twice the normal operation voltage. If current impulses remain within the device ratings, life expectancy is exceptionally long. If component ratings are exceeded, the diode may fail as a permanent short circuit; in such cases, protection may remain but normal circuit operation is terminated in the case of low-power signal lines. Due to their relatively limited current capacity, TVS diodes are often restricted to circuits with smaller current spikes. TVS diodes are also used where spikes occur significantly more often than once a year, since this component will not degrade when used within its ratings. A unique type of TVS diode (trade names Transzorb or Transil) contains reversed paired series avalanche diodes for bi-polar operation.|$|R
