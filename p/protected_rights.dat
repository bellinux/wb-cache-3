25|$|Warren's Court ordered {{lawyers for}} indigent {{defendants}} in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), and prevented prosecutors from using evidence seized in illegal searches, in Mapp v. Ohio (1961). The famous case of Miranda v. Arizona (1966) summed up Warren's philosophy. Everyone, even one accused of crimes, still enjoyed constitutionally <b>protected</b> <b>rights,</b> {{and the police}} had to respect those rights and issue a specific warning when making an arrest. Warren {{did not believe in}} coddling criminals; thus in Terry v. Ohio (1968) he gave police officers leeway to stop and frisk those they had reason to believe held weapons.|$|E
25|$|The six {{majority}} judges {{decided that}} section 41 {{was indeed a}} transitional provision, which only operated as a restraint on the first law that the Parliament of Australia passed concerning the federal franchise, the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902. That is, section 41 only <b>protected</b> <b>rights</b> which were in existence before the Franchise Act was passed. No new rights protectable by section 41 could be acquired after that time. Because the four people in this case did not acquire their right to vote in state elections until well after 1902, section 41 did not give them a right to vote in federal elections.|$|E

The most prominent opponents of Black's theory were Justices Felix Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan II. Frankfurter and Harlan argued that the Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate the Bill of Rights , but merely <b>protected</b> <b>rights</b> that are [...] "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," [...] which was the standard Justice Cardozo had established earlier in Palko v. Connecticut.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} better protect these rights in the Reconstruction Era, Congress passed the Second Enforcement Act of 1871 {{at the request of}} President Ulysses S. Grant to better counter white {{supremacist}} organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan that were intimidating and suppressing voting by black citizens. The act provided a remedy for those citizens who were deprived of their constitutional rights under the [...] "color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia" [...] and is currently codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1983. With its decision in Monroe v. Pape (1961), the Court expanded the reach of section 1983 such that it is now used as a method of checking abuse by state officials who infringe upon constitutionally <b>protected</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
500|$|A 27-article bill of rights, containing, {{according}} to historian Howard Miller, an [...] "impressive list" [...] of <b>protected</b> <b>rights,</b> was included. This document aligned closely with contemporary American political ideals, especially {{the notion that}} all men {{had a right to}} liberty. [...] Much of the language and concepts were drawn from [...] the first eight amendments to the United States Constitution. [...] The document called for trial by jury, a distinct departure from Mexican law, which required that trials be heard by the local alcalde. [...] Defendants would be granted counsel and would have the right to examine any evidence against them. [...] They would be protected from excessive bail or cruel and unusual punishments. Civil authorities would take priority over military authorities. Delegates also agreed to protect [...] "free communication of thoughts and opinions", a phrase carefully drafted to imply freedom of speech, of assembly, and of the press. [...] Although it could also be interpreted to imply freedom of religion, delegates were unwilling to explicitly grant that right, knowing that it would cause an uproar in Catholic Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Justice James C. McReynolds, {{joined by}} Justice George Sutherland, deemed {{the issue at}} stake to be [...] "one of gravity".

2500|$|Severe misdeeds were perjury deeds, {{especially}} {{if they had been}} committed insidiously and in secret. Such perpetrators were nithings, despicable beings. Their perjury deeds included: Murder, theft, nightly arson, as well as any deeds that harmed the kinship's legally <b>protected</b> <b>rights</b> (treason, deserting to the enemy, deserting from the army, resisting to fight in a war, and perversion). [...] any crimes offending the deities, such as breaking a special peace treaty (for example thing peace, armistice, security of the ceremony places and buildings, or a special festivity peace), trespass, defilement of graves, sorcery, finally all perjury deeds indicating moral degeneration, such as oathbreaking, perversion, acts of nasty cowardness [...] of moral degeneration.|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{believed}} that the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment ("All persons born and naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State where they reside") differentiated between two citizenships, one of the US and another of the state. Furthermore, the second sentence, forbidding states from making [...] "any law which shall abridge," [...] applied only to federal rights. Thus, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution only <b>protected</b> <b>rights</b> guaranteed by the United States, not individual states. As author Jack Beatty put it, the rights included [...] "access to ports and navigable waterways, the ability to run for federal office, and to be protected while on the high seas... they did not include what we call 'civil rights.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The National Labor Relations Act {{provides}} {{protection to}} employees {{who wish to}} join or form a union and those who engage in union activity. The act also protects employees who engage in a [...] "concerted activity." [...] Most employers set forth their workplace rules and policies in an employee handbook. A common provision in those handbooks is a statement that employment with the employer is [...] "at-will." [...] In 2012, the National Labor Relations Board, the federal administrative agency responsible for enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), instituted two cases attacking at-will employment disclaimers in employee handbooks. The NLRB challenged broadly worded disclaimers, alleging that the statements improperly suggested that employees could not act concertedly to attempt to change the at-will nature of their employment, and thereby interfered with employees’ <b>protected</b> <b>rights</b> under the NLRA.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} {{addressed in}} Part IV {{of the decision}} was whether the Communist Party presented such circumstances. [...] The unions had argued that a [...] "clear and present danger" [...] test {{be applied to the}} legislation, as this was a First Amendment issue, but could not agree on how to do so. Vinson rejected this test as mechanical. But Congress had not concluded in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act that expressing communist beliefs was a danger; rather, Congress had wished to eliminate impediments to interstate commerce. The problem with political strikes, Vinson asserted, was that rather than allowing speech to combat speech in the [...] "marketplace of ideas", strikes constitute force and coercion which Congress has every authority to regulate. One of the unions had argued that political strikes did not constitute such an imminent danger as to pass constitutional scrutiny, but Vinson rejected this once more as a mechanical application of an inapt test. [...] Rather, Vinson argued, the Constitution permits infringement of constitutionally <b>protected</b> <b>rights</b> when a sound truck invades the privacy of the home (Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77 (1949)), unauthorized parades disrupt traffic (Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, (1941)), the health of children is at stake (Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944)), or the provision of public services is affected (United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947)). Advocating a balancing of interests and citing Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145 (1878) (an individual's religious beliefs cannot be accepted as proof of a felony act without evidence of commission of the crime), Vinson instead proposed a balancing test.|$|E
