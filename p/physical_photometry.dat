KROCHMANN Measurements of the spectral luminous efficiency of monochromatic radiation within the mesopic range have already been published. Calculations show that the measured curves can be simulated by a linear combination of the spectral luminous efficiency of monochromatic radiation for scotopic (V’(&lambda;)) and photopic (V(&lambda;)) vision by the equation: Veq(&lambda;) =a. ’ & mbda;) +. la a;) where the values of a and b depend on {{the equivalent}} luminance.

The values of the maximum spectral luminous efficacy Kmeq within the mesopic range have been calculated. A set-up for the measurement of the equivalent luminance by <b>physical</b> <b>photometry</b> is described. (1) Introduction jT~o~~...|$|E
40|$|Change {{detection}} plays a {{very important}} role in real-time image analysis, e. g., detection of intruders. One key issue is robustness to varying illumination conditions. We propose two techniques for change detection that have been developed to deal with variations in illumination and background, with real-time capabilities. The foundations of these techniques are based on a vector model of images and on the exploitation of the concepts of linear dependence and linear independence. Furthermore, the techniques are compatible with <b>physical</b> <b>photometry.</b> A detailed description of the proposed detector and three state-of-the art change detectors is also provided. For the purposes of comparison, an evaluation procedure is presented consisting of both objective and subjective parts. This evaluation procedure results in a final performance value for each detector analyzed.

40|$|Despite growing {{knowledge}} on the biological effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation {{on human health}} and ecosystems, it is still dif&# 64257;cult to predict the negative impacts of the increasing incidence of solar UV radiation in a scenario of global warming and climate changes. Hence, the development and application of DNA-based biological sensors to monitor the solar UV radiation under different environmental conditions is of increasing importance. With a mind to rendering a molecular view-point of the genotoxic impact of sunlight, &# 64257;eld experiments were undertaken with a DNA-dosimeter system in parallel with <b>physical</b> <b>photometry</b> of solar UVB/UVA radiation, at various latitudes in South America. On applying biochemical and immunological approaches based on speci&# 64257;c DNA-repair enzymes and antibodies, for evaluating sunlight-induced DNA damage pro&# 64257;les, {{it became clear that}} the genotoxic potential of sunlight does indeed vary according to latitude. Notwithstanding, while induction of oxidized DNA bases is directly dependent on an increase in latitude, the generation of 6 - 4 PPs is inversely so, whereby the latter can be regarded as a biomolecular marker of UVB incidence. This molecular DNA lesion-pattern largely re&# 64258;ects the relative incidence of UVA and UVB energy at any speci&# 64257;c latitude. Hereby is demonstrated the applicability of this DNA-based biosensor for additional, continuous &# 64257;eld experiments, as a means of registering variations in the genotoxic impact of solar UV radiation.

40|$|A photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic {{investigation}} of the poorly studied open cluster NGC 6738 has been performed in order to ascertain its real nature. NGC 6738 is definitely not a <b>physical</b> stellar ensemble: <b>photometry</b> does not show a defined mean sequence, proper motions and radial velocities are randomly distributed, spectro-photometric parallaxes range between 10 and 1600 pc, and the apparent luminosity function is identical {{to that of the}} surrounding field. NGC 6738 therefore appears to be an apparent concentration of a few bright stars projected on patchy background absorption.

40|$|We {{highlight}} {{and discuss}} the importance of accounting for nebular emission in the SEDs of high redshift galaxies, as lines and continuum emission can contribute significantly or subtly to broad-band <b>photometry.</b> <b>Physical</b> parameters such as the galaxy age, mass, star-formation rate, dust attenuation and others inferred from SED fits can be affected to different extent by the treatment of nebular emission. We analyse a large sample of Lyman break galaxies from z ~ 3 - 6, and show some main results illustrating e. g. the importance of nebular emission for determinations of the mass-SFR relation, attenuation and age. We suggest that a fairly large scatter in such relations could be intrinsic. We find {{that the majority of}} objects (~ 60 - 70 %) is better fit with SEDs accounting for nebular emission; the remaining galaxies are found to show relatively weak or no emission lines. Our modeling, and supporting empirical evidence, suggests the existence of two categories of galaxies, "starbursts” and "post-starbursts” (lower SFR and older galaxies) among the LBG population, and relatively short star-formation timescale...|$|R
40|$|We have {{discovered}} the first example of a star pulsating intrinsically with both � Doradus and � Scuti frequencies. The star, HD 8801, is an Am metallic-line star {{that appears to be}} single. Since the vast majority of Am stars are members of binary systems with periods less than 1000 days and also do not pulsate, HD 8801 possesses a very unusual, if not unique, combination of <b>physical</b> properties. Our <b>photometry,</b> acquired with an automatic telescope at Fairborn Observatory, resolves six independent pulsation periods between 0. 048 and 0. 404 days. The two longest periods lie within the range of � Dor variables, while the four shorter periods are within the range of � Sct stars. Eleven radial velocities, obtained over an 11 month period, have a mean of 0 : 8 � 0 : 3 km s � 1, providing no evidence for a spectroscopic companion. The star is on the main sequence and lies within both the � Dor and � Sct instability strips. Pulsation constants computed for the six periods agree with pulsation constants computed for other � Dor and � Sct variables. HD 8801 is also the first confirmed case of a metallic-line star pulsating with � Dor frequencies. Its projected rotational velocity of 55 km s � 1 is typical for Am stars, which, as a group, rotate more slowly than normal A stars. HD 8801 ’s slow rotation compared to normal A stars does not appear to arise from either a binary companion or evolutionary expansion and thus remains a puzzle. The coexistence of metallicism and pulsation in several main-sequence stars near the red edge of the � Sct strip contradicts recent models that predict pulsations only in more evolved stars...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGJ 758 B is a {{brown dwarf}} {{companion}} {{to a nearby}} (15. 76 %) solar-type, metal-rich (M/H = + 0. 2 dex) main-sequence star (G 9 V) that was discovered with Subaru/HiCIAO in 2009. From previous studies, it has drawn attention as being the coldest (similar to 600 K) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star. We present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of the SPHERE instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The data was obtained in Y-, J-, H-, and K-s-bands with the dual-band imaging (DBI) mode of IRDIS, thus providing a broad coverage of the full near-infrared (near-IR) range at higher contrast and better spectral sampling than previously reported. In this new set of high-quality data, we report the re-detection of the companion, {{as well as the}} first detection of a new candidate closer-in to the star. We use the new eight photometric points for an extended comparison of GJ 758 B with empirical objects and four families of atmospheric models. From comparison to empirical object, we estimate a T 8 spectral type, but none of the comparison objects can accurately represent the observed near-IR fluxes of GJ 758 B. From comparison to atmospheric models, we attribute a T-eff = 600 +/- 100 K, but we find that no atmospheric model can adequately fit all the fluxes of GJ 758 B. The lack of exploration of metal enrichment in model grids appears as a major limitation that prevents an accurate estimation of the companion <b>physical</b> parameters. The <b>photometry</b> of the new candidate companion is broadly consistent with L-type objects, but a second epoch with improved photometry is necessary to clarify its status. The new astrometry of GJ 758 B shows a significant proper motion since the last epoch. We use this result to improve the determination of the orbital characteristics using two fitting approaches: Least-Squares Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo. We confirm the high-eccentricity of the orbit (peak at 0. 5), and find a most likely semi-major axis of 46. 05 AU. We also use our imaging data, as well as archival radial velocity data, to reject the possibility that this is a false positive effect created by an unseen, closer-in, companion. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of our data to additional closer-in companions and reject the possibility of other massive brown dwarf companions down to 4 - 5 AU...|$|R
