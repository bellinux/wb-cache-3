5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Bedminster <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Regional Railways. Local services were franchised to Wales & West when the railway was privatised in 1997, which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded in 2015 as Great Western Railway.|$|E

Edmund's eldest son, Edward, owned it until 1415, when it <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Maud Clifford, the widow of Edmund's younger son Richard, who lived there until 1446. Richard of York then inherited the castle, and on his death in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses it <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> his son Edward, who seized the throne in 1461, bringing Conisbrough back into Crown ownership once again.|$|E

5|$|Talbot died {{in about}} 1140, and his lands <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Sybil, and her second husband, Josce de Dinan. He {{was buried in}} Gloucester Abbey. The lands at Swanscombe were divided between Talbot's two nieces, Cecily and Agnes, the daughters of Sybil and Pain fitzJohn. Cecily married first Roger of Hereford, son of Miles of Gloucester, and second William of Poitou and third Walter de Mayenne, {{but she had no}} {{children}} by any of her marriages and on her death in 1207, her lands <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> the heirs of her sister Agnes. Cecily's death without heirs also meant that the feudal barony of Swanscombe <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> her sister's heirs. Agnes married first Warin de Mountchesney and second Haldenald de Bidun, and her descendants held the barony of Swanscombe until 1324, when the line died out.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks' first-half {{play was}} {{generally}} considered poor—with aimless kicking to Welsh fullback Winfield who returned much better kicks into touch. The first ten minutes saw New Zealand's Roberts break the line twice only, {{to be caught}} by Winfield without support. Eventually Wales had a scrum-feed 25 yards out from the All Blacks' try-line. From this Wales executed a planned move—Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right to Bush. He then turned left and <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Gabe, who <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Bush, who eventually <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion—leaving the score at 3–0. In {{the final stages of}} the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two minutes early, and Wallace that it was three minutes early.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was most}} likely built for John Harington, 1st Baron Harington in the 14th century, {{replacing}} nearby Aldingham Motte. Gleaston Castle descended through the Harrington family until 1458 when it <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> William Bonville through marriage and was subsequently abandoned. The castle <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> the Grey family until Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk was executed for treason in 1554. As a result, Gleaston Castle became royal property before it was bought by the Preston family in the 17th century, and then <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> the Cavendish family.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Ravens {{increased}} their lead as RB Willis McGahee got a 1-yard TD run.

The Cardinals would reply with QB Kurt Warner completing an eight-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Anquan Boldin, yet the Jets continued their victory march with Favre's 40-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Cotchery. Arizona tried to rally as Warner completed a 14-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Jerheme Urban, but New York sealed the win with Favre's 24-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Dustin Keller.|$|R
5|$|The first John Savage succeeded Margaret, {{and nine}} more {{followed}} him. The tenth died young, so the estate <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> his brother, Thomas Savage. In 1626 CharlesI created {{the title of}} Viscount Savage for him. On his death the estate <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> his daughter Joan, who later married John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester. Joan died during childbirth {{at the age of}} 23, and the estate <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> the Marquess.

5|$|A descendent of John de Charlton, {{the first}} Sir Thomas de Charlton, died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> his son, also named Sir Thomas, who became Speaker of the House of Commons and Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He died in 1465, {{at which point}} his son Sir Richard became owner of the manor. Sir Richard was killed {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Richard III during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The victor of the battle, Henry VII, named him in his Act of Attainder, though he granted Sir Richard's wife Elizabeth a life interest in the manor. However, Sir Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted the manor of Swakeleys and Covelhall (Cowley). Upon Sir Thomas' death in 1510, the manor <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> Sir John Peeche as his executor. Sir John had no children, so Swakeleys <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> the Earl of Devon, Henry Courteney in 1521. The Earl granted a licence to control Swakeleys to Sir William Fitzwilliam in 1531, who was acting as trustee for Ralph Pexall.|$|E
