2500|$|... "Autolock" [...] {{collet chucks}} (Osbourn [...] "Pozi-Lock" [...] {{is a similar}} system) were {{designed}} to provide secure clamping of milling cutters with only hand tightening. They were developed in the 1940s by a now defunct UK company, Clarkson (Engineers) Limited, and {{are commonly known as}} Clarkson chucks. Autolock collets require cutters with threaded <b>shank</b> <b>ends</b> to <b>screw</b> into the collet itself. Any rotation of the cutter forces the collet against the collet cap taper which tightly clamps the cutter, the screw fitting also prevents any tendency of the cutter to pull out. Collets are only available in fixed sizes, imperial or metric, and the cutter shank must be an exact match.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a study on full flute (extra-long tool) and ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill wear {{analysis}} by utilizing five-axis CNC to implement flank milling strategy on curved shape part. Five-axis machining eases the user to implement variations of strategy such as flank milling. Flank milling is different from point milling. Point milling cuts materials by using {{the tip of the}} tool whereas the flank milling uses the cutting tool body to cut material. The type of cutting tool used was end mill 10 mm diameter with High Speed Steel (HSS) material. One factor at a time was utilized to analyze the overall data. Feed rate and spindle speed were the two main factors that been set up equally for both full flute and ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill. At the end of this research, the qualitative analysis based on tool wear between full flute and ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill is observed. Generally, both types of cutting tools showed almost the same failure indication such as broken edge or chipped off edge, formation of pinned hole on the surface and serration formation or built-up edge (BUE) on the primary flute. However, the results obtained from the enlarged images which were captured by Optical Microscope indicated that, the ground <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> mill is better than the full flute end mill...|$|R

2500|$|Installer bits, {{also known}} as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a fish tape could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the <b>shank</b> <b>end,</b> the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York was issued [...] for this invention on January 25, 1898.|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} machine tools, the shank type is usually {{one of the}} following: a standard taper (such as Morse or Brown & Sharpe), a straight round shank to be held by a collet, or a straight round shank with a flat for a set screw, to be held by a solid toolholder. For hand tools, the <b>shank</b> <b>end</b> is usually a square drive, intended for use with {{the same type of}} wrench used to turn a tap for the cutting of screw threads.|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{to compare}} {{different}} surface marker configurations in 3 -dimensional motion analysis are warranted as {{more complex and}} custom marker sets become more common. At the knee, different markers can been used to represent the proximal shank. Often, two anatomical markers are placed over the femoral condyles, with their midpoint defining both the distal thigh and proximal <b>shank</b> segment <b>ends.</b> However, two additional markers placed over the tibial plateaus {{have been used to}} define the proximal <b>shank</b> <b>end.</b> For this experiment, simultaneous data for both proximal shank configurations were independently collected at two separate laboratories by different investigators, with one lab capturing a walking population and the other a running population. Common discrete knee joint variables were then compared between marker sets in each population. Using the augmented marker set, peak knee flexion after weight acceptance was less (1. 2 - 1. 7 °, p< 0. 02) and peak knee adduction was greater (0. 7 - 1. 4 °, p< 0. 001) in both data sets. Similarly, the calculated peak knee flexion moment was less by 15 - 20 % and internal rotation moment was greater by 11 - 18 % (p< 0. 001). These results suggest that the calculation of knee joint mechanics are influenced by the proximal shank’s segment endpoint definition, independent of dynamic task, investigator, laboratory environment, and population in this study...|$|R

Most times, two screws {{are placed in}} the first sacral segment, {{even if it is}} possible to place one screw in S 1 and one in S 2, or a single screw may be used if the area of safe placement is limited [14]. At the <b>end,</b> <b>screw</b> position has to be confirmed on antero-posterior, inlet and outlet views [15 – 19].

40|$|Abstract Six {{months after}} {{undergoing}} a Fontan operation, a 7 -year-old boy with right atrial isomerism {{and a single}} functional ventricle was admitted to our emergency department with cyanosis. Emergency cardiac catheterization revealed a large veno-venous fistula that began in a left hepatic vein, connected to the left accessory hepatic veins, and drained into the common atrium, resulting in desaturation. The fistula was occluded proximally with an Amplatzer septal occluder, with satisfying results; the patient's systemic arterial saturation decreased during his hospital stay. Three weeks after the first intervention, a second procedure was performed to retrieve the first device and to close the fistula distally. Multiple attempts with different types of gooseneck snares and a bioptome catheter failed to retrieve the first device, so a telescopic method was used to re-screw it. Using a Mullins long sheath and delivery sheath, the delivery cable was manipulated {{to fit into the}} slot of the <b>end</b> <b>screw,</b> and the cable was rotated gently in a clockwise direction to re-screw the device. Then, another Amplatzer septal occluder was placed at the distal end of the fistula. In conclusion, distal transcatheter occlusion of intrahepatic veno-venous fistulas might lead to better clinical outcomes in selected patients. Amplatzer septal occluder device can be retrieve without any complication within three weeks...|$|R

40|$|Background: Locking plates {{transmit}} load through fixed-angle locking screws instead {{of relying on}} plate-to-bone compression. Therefore, locking screws may induce higher stress at the screw-bone interface than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating. This study investigated whether locked plating in osteoporotic diaphyseal bone causes a greater periprosthetic fracture risk than conventional plating because of stress concentrations at the plate end. It further investigated the effect of replacing the locked end screwwith a conventional screw {{on the strength of}} the fixation construct. Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis. Constructs were tested dynamically to failure in bending, torsion, and axial loading to determine failure loads and failuremodes. A locked plating construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct. Subsequently, the outermost locking screw in locked plating constructs was replaced with a conventional screw to reduce stress concentrations at the plate end. Results: Compared with the conventional plating construct, the locked plating construct was 22 % weaker in bending (p = 0. 013), comparably strong in torsion (p = 0. 05), and 15 % stronger in axial compression (p = 0. 017). Substituting the locked <b>end</b> <b>screw</b> with a conventional screw increased the construct strength by 40 % in bending (p = 0. 001) but had no significant effect on construct strength under torsion (p = 0. 22) and compressive loading (p = 0. 53) compared with the locked plating construct. Under bending, all constructs failed by periprosthetic fracture...|$|R
