40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} <b>processing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> on the {{microstructure}} and residual stresses are studied for laser surface hardening on steel samples of grade AISI 4140. Samples were hardened in air, vacuum and {{inert gas atmosphere}} (Helium) {{by means of a}} stationary laser beam. A high-power diode laser (HPDL) system was used in combination with a custom-designed process chamber. Residual stress distributions in lateral and in depth direction were analysed after laser processing by means of X-ray diffraction according to the well known sinψ- method. X-ray residual stress analyses were supplemented by microscopic investigations of the local microstructure. The results indicate a widening of the compressive stressed region in lateral as well as in depth direction by surface hardening in inert gas atmosphere compared to laser surface hardening in air or vacuum atmosphere. This is due to the local heating flux distribution during the laser assisted heat treatment which is strongly affected by the <b>processing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and leads to an extension of the hardening zone when using helium as inert gas...|$|E

During MOX fuel production, residues unsuitable for further recycle will be produced. Due to their high actinide content MOX residues require immobilization within a robust host matrix. Although {{it is possible to}} immobilize actinides in vitreous wasteforms; ceramic phases, such as brannerite (UTi 2 O 6), are attractive due to their high waste loading capacity and relative insolubility. A range of uranium brannerites, formulated GdxU 1 -xTi 2 O 6, were prepared using a mixed oxide route. Charge compensation of divalent and trivalent cations was expected to occur via the oxidation of U 4 + to higher valence states (U 5 + or U 6 +). Gd 3 + was added to act as a neutron absorber in the final Pu bearing wasteform. X-ray powder diffraction of synthesised specimens found that phase distribution was strongly affected by <b>processing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (air or Ar). In all cases prototypical brannerite was formed accompanied by different secondary phases dependent on <b>processing</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Microstructural analysis (SEM) of the sintered samples confirmed the results of the X-ray powder diffraction.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{continued}} push for high permittivity dielectrics suitable for use at elevated operating temperatures and/or large electric fields, modifications of BaTiO 3 with Bi(M) O 3, where M represents a net-trivalent B-site occupied {{by one or more}} species, have received a great deal of recent attention. Materials in this composition family exhibit weakly coupled relaxor behavior that is not only remarkably stable at high temperatures and under large electric fields, but is also quite similar across various identities of M. Moderate levels of Bi content (as much as 50  mol%) appear to be crucial to the stability of the dielectric response. In addition, the presence of significant Bi reduces the processing temperatures required for densification and increases the required oxygen content in <b>processing</b> <b>atmospheres</b> relative to traditional X 7 R-type BaTiO 3 -based dielectrics. Although detailed understanding of the structure–processing–property relationships in this class of materials is still in its infancy, this article reviews the current state of understanding of the mechanisms underlying the high and stable values of both relative permittivity and resistivity that are characteristic of BaTiO 3 -Bi(M) O 3 dielectrics as well as the processing challenges and opportunities associated with these materials...|$|R

The Raman spectra of the BaTiO 3 films show peaks typical for the tetragonal/cubic Perovskite structure. Polarization-d ependent measurements reveal a mean c-axis orientation normal to the substrate surface, regardless whether a DC-field is applied or not. Using low DC-bias voltages (delta V= 50 V) allows lowering the substrate temperature without affecting the crystal quality of the films, as determined from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Raman peaks, which is a measure for the crystal quality.

40|$|Development of more {{effective}} technologies of utilising low rank coals for power generation {{has been driven}} by a demand for higher efficiency, low capital costs and minimal environmental impacts. Fluidised bed systems are {{regarded as one of the}} more promising alternative technologies for power generation to overcome the disadvantage of the existing pulverised coal burning power generation plants for low rank coals. However, ash deposition and bed agglomeration are potential problems in fluidised bed processing of coals with high alkali and sulphur contents. In order to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of agglomeration in fluidised beds, a good knowledge of the rheological behaviour of coal ash deposits at high temperatures and under the processing conditions is necessary. Rheological characterisation of materials at high temperatures is difficult due to lack of standard instruments and reliable measurement techniques. We have recently developed a rheometer that has the capability of measuring the rheological properties of coal ash slag over a wide range of temperatures from 600 to 1300 °C and under different <b>processing</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> In this paper the features of this unique instrument are described and the experimental technique developed for flow property measurement is outlined. Some typical measured rheological properties of coal ashes from different Australian low-rank coals are presented and discussed to illustrate the potential applicability of the rheometer for high-temperature rheological characterisation. Furthermore, by means of the experimental results obtained it is demonstrated that the alkali content of the coal ash plays a significant role in controlling the rheological characteristics of the ash deposit, which in turn has an important implication on agglomeration in fluidised bed combustion processes.
