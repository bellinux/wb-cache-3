40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} genome is {{a complex}} three-dimensional entity residing in the nucleus. We present evidence that <b>Pol</b> III–transcribed <b>genes</b> such as tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes can localize to centromeres and contribute to a global genome organization. Furthermore, we find that ectopic insertion of <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes</b> into a non-Pol III gene locus results in the centromeric localization of the locus. We show that the centromeric localization of <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes</b> is mediated by condensin, which interacts with the Pol III transcription machinery, and that transcription levels of the <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes</b> are negatively correlated with the centromeric localization of <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes.</b> This centromeric localization of <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes</b> initially observed in interphase becomes prominent during mitosis, when chromosomes are condensed. Remarkably, defective mitotic chromosome condensation by a condensin mutation, cut 3 - 477, which reduces the centromeric localization of <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes,</b> is suppressed by a mutation in the sfc 3 <b>gene</b> encoding the <b>Pol</b> III transcription factor TFIIIC subunit, sfc 3 - 1. The sfc 3 - 1 mutation promotes the centromeric localization of <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes.</b> Our study suggests there are functional links between {{the process of the}} centromeric localization of dispersed <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes,</b> their transcription, and the assembly of condensed mitotic chromosomes...|$|R

40|$|Friend {{murine leukemia}} virus (F-MuLV) is a highly leukemogenic replication-competent murine retrovirus. Both the F-MuLV {{envelope}} gene and the long terminal repeat (LTR) contribute to its pathogenic phenotype (A. Oliff, K. Signorelli, and L. Collins, J. Virol. 51 : 788 - 794, 1984). To determine whether the F-MuLV gag and <b>pol</b> <b>genes</b> also possess sequences that affect leukemogenicity, we generated recombinant viruses between the F-MuLV gag and <b>pol</b> <b>genes</b> and two other murine retroviruses, amphotrophic clone 4070 (Ampho) and Friend mink cell focus-inducing virus (Fr-MCF). The F-MuLV gag and <b>pol</b> <b>genes</b> were molecularly cloned on a 5. 8 -kilobase-pair DNA fragment. This 5. 8 -kilobase-pair F-MuLV DNA was joined to the Ampho envelope gene and LTR creating a hybrid viral DNA, F/A E+L. A second hybrid viral DNA, F/Fr ENV, was made by joining the 5. 8 -kilobase-pair F-MuLV DNA to the Fr-MCF envelope gene plus the F-MuLV LTR. F/A E+L and F/Fr ENV DNAs generated recombinant viruses upon transfection into NIH 3 T 3 cells. F/A E+L virus (F-MuLV gag and pol, Ampho env and LTR) induced leukemia in 20 % of NIH Swiss mice after 6 months. Ampho-infected mice did not develop leukemia. F/Fr ENV virus (F-MuLV gag and pol, Fr-MCV env, F-MuLV LTR) induced leukemia in 46 % of mice after 3 months. Recombinant viruses containing the Ampho gag and pol, Fr-MCF env, and F-MuLV LTR caused leukemia in 38 % of mice after 6 months. We conclude that the F-MuLV gag and <b>pol</b> <b>genes</b> contain sequences {{that contribute to the}} pathogenicity of murine retroviruses.

40|$|The {{association}} of alcohol consumption {{and breast cancer}} is more pronounced in cases that are positive for estrogen receptor (ER+) than in cases that are negative (ER−). Its mechanism remains to be determined. Deregulation of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription enhances cellular tRNAs and 5 S rRNA production, increasing translational capacity to promote cell transformation and tumor formation. Here, we report that alcohol increases <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> transcription in both normal and cancer breast cell lines. The induction in ER+ breast cancer cells (MCF- 7) is significantly higher than in ER − normal breast cells (MCF- 10 A, MCF- 10 F and MCF- 12 A) and is correlated with ER expression. E 2 causes < 2 -fold increase in <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> transcription. The addition of eth-anol to this system now produces a 10 – 15 -fold increase. Ethanol increases ERα expression, resulting {{in an increase in}} Brf 1 protein and mRNA levels. In addition, ethanol markedly stimulates phos-phorylation of JNK 1, but not JNK 2. Inhibition of JNK 1 decreases ERE-Luc reporter activity and represses expression of ERα, Brf 1 and <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes.</b> Reduction of ERα by its small interfering RNA represses Brf 1 and <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> transcription. Ethanol with E 2 produces larger and more numerous colonies. Repression of ERα or Brf 1 inhibits alcohol-induced cell transformation. Together, these results support the idea that alcohol increases ERα expres-sion through JNK 1 to elevate Brf 1 expression and <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> transcription to bring about greater phenotypic changes. These studies demonstrate that ERα mediates <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> transcrip-tion through Brf 1, suggesting that ERα may {{play a critical role in}} alcohol-induced deregulation of <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes</b> in ER+ breast cancer development...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} immunity {{induced by}} a novel DNA prime-boost regimen, we constructed a DNA plasmid encoding the gag and <b>pol</b> <b>genes</b> from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (SIVgag/pol DNA), {{in addition to}} a replication-deficient vaccinia virus strain DIs recombinant expressing SIV gag and <b>pol</b> <b>genes</b> (rDIsSIVgag/pol). In mice, priming with SIVgag/pol DNA, followed by rDIsSIVgag/pol induced an SIV-specific lymphoproliferative response that was mediated by a CD 4 +-T-lymphocyte subset. Immunization with either vaccine alone was insufficient to induce high levels of proliferation or Th 1 responses in the animals. The prime-boost regimen also induced SIV Gag-specific cellular responses based on gamma interferon secretion, as well as cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte responses. Thus, the regimen of DNA priming and recombinant DIs boosting induced Th 1 -type cell-mediated immunity, which was associated with resistance to viral challenge with wild-type vaccinia virus expressing SIVgag/pol, suggesting that this new regimen may hold promise as a safe and effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1...|$|R
40|$|To further our {{understanding}} of the structural and functional organization of the Trypanosoma brucei genome, we have searched for and analyzed sites in the genome where Pol II transcription units meet <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes.</b> Physical and transcriptional maps of cosmid clones spanning the Pol III-transcribed U 2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and U 3 snRNA/ 7 SL RNA gene loci demonstrated that single-copy <b>Pol</b> II <b>genes</b> are closely associated with <b>Pol</b> III-transcribed <b>genes,</b> being separated from each other by 0. 6 - 3 kb. At the U 3 / 7 SL transcriptional domain, two Pol II transcription units converged from either side of the chromosome towards the <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes,</b> suggesting that at least for the chromosome containing the U 3 snRNA and 7 SL RNA genes, there exist two distinct initiation sites for Pol II. Furthermore, in all cases the <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes</b> hallmark the end of Pol II transcription units, suggesting perhaps a functional role for this genetic arrangement. Lastly, we asked whether the environment within a Pol III transcriptional domain allowed expression of pre-mRNA. To test this we inserted a CAT gene cassette, seemingly promoterless but endowed with pre-mRNA processing signals, in the chromosome between the U 3 snRNA and 7 SL RNA genes. Interestingly, abundant CAT mRNA was produced suggesting that the <b>Pol</b> III <b>genes</b> in the immediate vicinity did not prevent access of presumably Pol II to the CAT gene cassette. We propose that either CAT mRNA is synthesized by Pol II run-through transcription or by Pol II initiationupstream from the CAT gene...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} TATA-binding protein (TBP) in modulating RNA polymerase (<b>Pol)</b> III <b>gene</b> activity. Epitope-tagged TBP (e-TBP) was both transiently and stably transfected in Drosophila Schneider S- 2 cells to increase the total cellular level of TBP. Analysis of the transcripts synthesized from cotransfected tRNA and U 6 RNA genes revealed that both types of RNA Pol III promoters were substantially stimulated by an increase in e-TBP in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a TBP-dependent increase in the levels of endogenous tRNA transcripts was produced in the stable line induced to express the e-TBP. We further determined whether the ability of increased TBP to induce RNA <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> expression was due to a direct effect of increased TBP complexes on RNA <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> promoters or an indirect consequence of enhanced expression of RNA <b>Pol</b> II <b>genes.</b> A TBP expression plasmid (e-TBP 332), containing a mutation within the highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain, was both transiently and stably transfected into S- 2 cells. e-TBP 332 augmented the transcription from two RNA <b>Pol</b> II <b>gene</b> promoters indistinguishably from that observed when e-TBP was expressed. In contrast, e-TBP 332 was completely defective in its ability to stimulate either the tRNA or U 6 RNA gene promoters. In addition, increasing levels of a truncated TBP protein containing only the carboxy-terminal region failed to induce either the tRNA or U 6 RNA gene promoter, whereas it retained its ability to stimulate an RNA Pol II promoter. Thus, the TBP-dependent increase in RNA <b>Pol</b> II <b>gene</b> activity is not sufficient for enhanced RNA <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> transcription; rather, a direct effect on RNA Pol III promoters is required. Furthermore, these results provide the first direct evidence that the amino-terminal region of TBP is important for the formation or function of TBP-containing complexes utilized by TATA-less and TATA-containing RNA Pol III promoters. Together, these studies demonstrate that TBP is limiting for the expression of both classes of RNA Pol III promoters in Drosophila cells and implicate an important role for TBP in regulating RNA <b>Pol</b> III <b>gene</b> expression...|$|R

In addition, a nested primer (POL) was designed {{on the basis of the}} highly conserved amino acid sequence YGDTDS found in most B-family (alpha-like) DNA <b>pol</b> <b>genes.</b> These primers were used to amplify DNA from the three viruses, PBCV- 1, NY- 2 A, and MpV-SP 1, for which the primers were designed, as well as eight clonal isolates of genetically distinct viruses which infect M. pusilla and others which infect Chrysochromulina spp. (Prymnesiophyceae), suggesting that these are a group of related viruses. In contrast, no product resulted from using DNA from viruses which infect the marine brown algae Ectocarpus siliculosis and Feldmannia sp.

Sen 1 is an ATP-dependent helicase whose orthologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae contributes both to terminate transcription of some RNA Pol II transcripts and to antagonize the formation of DNA:RNA hybrids in the genome. Using two independent mapping techniques, we show that DNA:RNA hybrids form in abundance at <b>Pol</b> III-transcribed <b>genes</b> in fission yeast but we demonstrate that they are unlikely to faciliate the recruitment of condensin.

When Swd 2. 2 and Sen 1 are lacking, the increased concentration of RNA Pol III and condensin at <b>Pol</b> III-transcribed <b>genes</b> is accompanied by the accumulation of topoisomerase I and II and by local nucleosome depletion, suggesting that <b>Pol</b> III-transcribed <b>genes</b> suffer topological stress.
