Rural metro-adjacent regions are predominantly rural census divisions which are adjacent to metropolitan centres while rural non-metro-adjacent regions are those predominantly rural census divisions which are not adjacent to metropolitan centres. Rural northern regions are predominantly rural census divisions that are found either entirely or mostly above the following lines of parallel in each province: Newfoundland and Labrador, 50th; Quebec and Ontario, 54th; Manitoba, 53rd; Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, 54th.

Spatial planning has a strong tradition in taking ‘here and now’ decisions to responding to problems and difficulties, with not much difference in technical and communicative approaches. If spatial planning wants to be supportive to transformations at various levels of scale in urbanized delta regions alternative time related approaches are desperately needed. The plurality of urbanized delta regions forces such time related planning approaches to be emergent, adaptive, co-evolving and transformative in nature. It means planning has to embrace a non-linear understanding of space and place. This book is meant as an introduction to non-linearity and spatial planning...|$|R

This article presents evidence for the Amsterdam <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> regarding population distribution, selective migration, job growth, and economic specializations of the region's subcenters. It will become clear from our data that the Amsterdam <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> has indeed become more polycentric, but also that Amsterdam has managed to remain a vital center. The newer and older urban subcenters have become increasingly important, but rather than competing with Amsterdam, they develop in a complementary way...|$|R

This article examines the use of the international environmental law principle on transboundary liability in transforming better living environment in <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> by identifying actions and cases which deal with human habitat and environmental protection in <b>urban</b> <b>region.</b> This article also identifies the relation between the international environmental law principle on transboundary liability and Rio Declaration as a means to transform better living environment in <b>urban</b> <b>region.</b> The opportunity to enhance the growth of this principle of transboundary liability in protecting human habitat and environment in <b>urban</b> <b>region,</b> through state practices, following the two-transboundary environmental disasters “Sandoz Spill” and “Chernobyl Explosion,” were lost due to the decision by the injured states not to take international legal actions for causing environmental pollution to their <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> even though the injured states have their right to do so. The support made by the statesaround the globe on the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses Law, 1994 and the Rio Declaration, 1992 clearly reflected the acceptance and the growth of this principle of transboundary liability in protecting human habitat and environment especially in <b>urban</b> <b>region.</b> Finally, the preliminary findings indicate that the influence of interest approach in the international environmental governance is an important aspect to promote and persuade states around the globe to participate in the Montreal Protocol for the purpose to protect global environment by taking into consideration the principle of transboundary liability in order to control world emissions of pollution especially in <b>urban</b> <b>region.</b> These actions are to ensure the transformation for better living environment in urban regio...|$|R

40|$|To {{account for}} {{differences}} among rural and <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> the OECD {{has established a}} regional typology, classifying TL 3 <b>regions</b> as <b>predominantly</b> <b>urban</b> (PU), intermediate (IN) or predominantly rural (PR).

However, it {{does not take into account}} the presence of economic agglomerations if they happen to be in neighbouring regions. Remote rural regions face a different set of problems than rural regions close to a city, where a wider range of services and opportunities can be found. This paper suggests a refinement of the current typology to include a criterion on the accessibility to urban centres. The results show a clear distinction between remote rural regions and rural regions close to a city in terms of declining and ageing population, level of productivity and unemployment. This extended typology, which includes a measure of distance from cities for the population living in a rural area, has been first applied to Europe by the Directorate of Regional Policy of the European Commission and then to North America by the OECD...|$|R

40|$|Detecting <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> {{from very}} high {{resolution}} aerial and satellite images provides very useful results for urban planning, {{and land use}} analysis. Since manual detection is very time consuming and prone to errors, automated systems to detection of <b>urban</b> <b>regions</b> from very high resolution aerial and satellite images are needed. Unfortunately, diverse characteristics of <b>urban</b> <b>regions,</b> and uncontrolled appearance of remote sensing images (illumination, viewing angle, etc.) increase difficulty to develop automated systems. In order to overcome these difficulties, herein we propose a novel <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> detection method using local features and a probabilistic framework. First, we introduce four different local feature extraction methods. Extracted local feature vectors serve as observations of the probability density function to be estimated. Using a variable kernel density estimation method, we estimate the corresponding probability function. Using modes of the estimated density, {{as well as other}} probabilistic properties, we detect <b>urban</b> <b>region</b> boundaries in the image.

In recent years city administrators realised the importance of engineering and orchestrating knowledge city formation through visioning and planning for economic, socio-cultural and physical development.
