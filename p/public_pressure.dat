5|$|Bowing down to <b>public</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{the trade}} {{secretary}} Peter Mandelson referred {{the deal to}} the Mergers Commission in October 1998. The report, finalised in April 1999, found that BSkyB acted selfishly and blocked the broadcaster's bid.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and <b>public</b> <b>pressure</b> for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added <b>public</b> <b>pressure</b> spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable <b>public</b> <b>pressure,</b> the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E
40|$|This note {{seeks to}} examine the {{tripartite}} relationship between legislative delegation, prosecutorial discretion, and <b>public</b> <b>pressures</b> {{in the context of}} Florida 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Stand Your Ground 2 ̆ 2 regime. In the context of high profile criminal cases, a prosecutor faces significant <b>public</b> and political <b>pressures</b> that may influence her exercise of discretion in that case. Ultimately, Castillo argues that when a prosecutor succumbs to these pressures, it undermines her expertise, experience and exercise of discretion, and undercuts the legitimacy {{of the criminal justice system}} as a whole...|$|R
50|$|The British {{government}} was not receptive at first to Hull's proposals, but the U.S. government began pressing London to start negotiations with Chongqing right away, fearing lest waiting until the war's end will strengthen Chinese <b>public</b> <b>pressures</b> to adopt stiffer positions vis-a-vis the U.S. and British governments. On 3 October 1942, the U.S. government submitted to the British government a draft U.S.-Chinese treaty based on Hull's proposal of 27 August.|$|R
40|$|Investors and {{stakeholders}} in continental Europe {{are becoming increasingly}} concerned about corporate environmental policies. As a result, many firms are voluntarily increasing {{the extent of their}} environmental disclosure in their annual report. While mostly unregulated, corporate environmental disclosure does have potential economic significance considering the scarcity of alternative information sources. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify determinants of corporate environmental disclosure using multi-theoretical lenses that rely on economic incentives, <b>public</b> <b>pressures</b> and institutional theory. The study focuses on large firms from a continental Europe country, Germany, with a distinct legal and regulatory context and where environmental concerns are especially acute. Results show that Risk, Ownership, Fixed Assets Age, Firm Size as well as routine determine the level of environmental disclosure by German firms in a given year. Moreover, consistent with institutional theory, results suggest that German firms' disclosure is converging over time. Overall, results strongly suggest that environmental disclosure is multidimensional and is driven by complementary forces. Environmental disclosure, disclosure quality, information costs, routine, <b>public</b> <b>pressures,...</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to <b>public</b> <b>pressure,</b> the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Triumph International had {{to close}} its factory in Myanmar due to <b>public</b> <b>pressure.</b> The Berne Declaration and Clean Clothes Campaign accused the company of renting land from the country's {{military}} regime and thus indirectly supporting it. In January 2002, Triumph International {{announced that it would}} close the affected factory and offer a social plan for the remaining employees because no buyer had been found. Moreover, Triumph International clarified that there had not been any forced laborers among the employees.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} <b>public</b> <b>pressure</b> {{to resolve the}} problem. It becomes clear to the British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point {{turns out to be the}} disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the {{diffusion}} of environmental technologies.

5|$|Some {{preservation}} successes {{have emerged}} in recent years. Two proposals to open a casino at Gettysburg were defeated in 2006 and most recently in 2011, when <b>public</b> <b>pressure</b> forced the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to reject the proposed gambling hub {{at the intersection of}} Routes 15 and 30, near East Cavalry Field. The Civil War Trust also successfully purchased and transferred 95 acres at the former site of the Gettysburg Country Club to the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The United States, however, {{found an}} ally in Buenos Aires' main daily newspaper, La Prensa.

Under <b>public</b> <b>pressure,</b> the naval commission was forced to reconsider its original list, which had placed Italy first and Britain second. It now featured the United States first, Britain second, and Italy last.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the invasion, Portugal cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Indonesia {{and went on to}} support UN resolutions condemning the invasion. However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Portuguese government appeared reluctant to push the issue; American Indonesia specialist, Benedict Anderson suggests this stemmed from uncertainty at the time over its application to the European Community. Portugal's criticism mounted sharply from the mid-1980s, and due to <b>public</b> <b>pressure,</b> the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in international forums for East Timorese self-determination. Throughout the 1990s, Portugal took part in UN-brokered mediations with Indonesia.|$|E

40|$|The {{corporate}} {{approach to}} environmental protection has been evolving from a regulation-driven reactive mode {{to a more}} proactive approach involving voluntarily adopted management systems that integrate environmental concerns with traditional managerial functions. Several hypotheses about the factors explaining the diversity in the environmental management systems adopted by firms are tested using survey data for a sample of S&P 500 firms. The analysis shows {{that the threat of}} environmental liabilities, high costs of compliance, market <b>pressures,</b> and <b>public</b> <b>pressures</b> on firms with high on-site toxic emissions per unit output create incentives for adopting a more comprehensive environmental management system. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy leaves, were worn with similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration of nationalist public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable <b>public</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{issues were}} largely resolved {{after the city}} relented to <b>public</b> <b>pressure</b> and opted to site its memorial on a plot of land off Leeman Road, just outside the city walls, and for a reduced scheme {{in the form of}} a cross due to a shortage of funds. Coincidentally, the land was owned by the railway company and the NER board donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between the company and the city; the NER had by that time been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) as a result of the Railways Act 1921.|$|E
5|$|The vice {{activities}} {{on the island and}} in the county were not unique in Texas. San Antonio had perhaps the second most infamous red-light district in the early 20th century and most major cities in the state had significant vice activities at least until mid-century, though most went into decline before Galveston's did. During the Open Era Galveston's vice industries dominated, while most other areas of the state were at times forced to crack down on vice due to <b>public</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

Chavez y Chavez became a fugitive, but he was eventually arrested on May 26. A jury found him guilty, and he was given the death sentence. In a retrial, Chavez y Chavez was again given a death sentence. This decision was later overturned by a new Governor in New Mexico, who felt compelled to commute Chavez y Chavez's sentence to life in prison instead, given the publicity that this case garnered and the <b>public's</b> <b>pressure</b> towards the Government to spare Chavez y Chavez' life at the time.|$|R

The government of the day proposed to require Universities to implement a system of quotas for admission to research degrees. This meant that available places would be parcelled out to students based on their caste and religion, not just on their merit. Justice Manohar ruled this unconstitutional, despite a strong backlash from certain interest groups, who, in a show of public umbrage, burnt her effigy.|$|R

5|$|Although {{reasonably}} well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to <b>public</b> <b>pressure,</b> shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
