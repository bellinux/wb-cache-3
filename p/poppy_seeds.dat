Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E
5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds</b> are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
