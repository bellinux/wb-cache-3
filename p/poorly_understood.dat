40|$|While {{temperature}} {{effects on}} species' vulnerability {{to climate change}} are well studied, desiccation effects receive comparatively little attention. In addition, we <b>poorly</b> <b>understand</b> the capacity of ectotherms, and especially reptiles, to control water loss rates behaviourally by selecting suitable microhabitats. This study examined water loss rates and behavioural hydroregulation in the tropical rainforest skink Carlia rubrigularis to assess whether this dry-skinned ectotherm actively avoids desiccation and whether trade-offs occur between desiccation avoidance and selection of optimal temperatures, as previously shown in amphibians. Higher temperatures elicited humid refuge choice despite placing individuals in suboptimal thermal conditions, as indicated by preferred substrate temperatures. This finding {{emphasizes the importance of}} water loss even for taxa traditionally assumed to be highly desiccation resistant, and highlights this factor's potential influence on vulnerability to climate change by limiting activity times or by restricting individuals to thermally suboptimal microhabitats...|$|R

40|$|Elucidation of {{the healing}} {{mechanisms}} in damaged tissues is a critical step for establishing breakthroughs in tissue engineering. Articular cartilage is clinically {{one of the most}} successful tissues to be repaired with regenerative medicine because of its homogeneous extracellular matrix and few cell types. However, we only <b>poorly</b> <b>understand</b> cartilage repair mechanisms, and hence, regenerated cartilage remains inferior to the native tissues. Here, we show that glycosylation is an important process for hypertrophic differentiation during articular cartilage repair. GM 3, which is a precursor molecule for most gangliosides, was transiently expressed in surrounding damaged tissue, and depletion of GM 3 synthase enhanced cartilage repair. Gangliosides also regulated chondrocyte hypertrophy via the Indian hedgehog pathway. These results identify a novel mechanism of cartilage healing through chondrocyte hypertrophy that is regulated by glycosylation. Manipulation of gangliosides and their synthases may have beneficial effects on articular cartilage repair...|$|R
40|$|CML, {{characterized}} by the BCR/ABL gene rearrangement has been more extensively studied than any other malignancy. Over the last decade, significant {{progress has been made}} in our understanding of BCR-ABL-induced alterations in intracellular signaling. Unfortunately, we still only <b>poorly</b> <b>understand</b> the correlation between the clinical symptoms of chronic phase CML and the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. This is in part due to lack of a good in vivo animal model of chronic phase CML. In vivo and in vitro studies from the Clarkson group, recently reviewed in this journal (Leukemia 1997; 11 : 1404 - 1428), have significantly enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of CML. However, further characterization of the effect of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein on signal molecules involved with cell differentiation, cell proliferation, cell survival and cell adhesion in primary Ph+ CML progenitors or in vivo models of CML will be needed to provide a full understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic phase CML. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Dysregulated {{autophagy}} {{is associated}} with steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), however the mechanisms connecting them remain <b>poorly</b> <b>understand.</b> Here, we show that co-administration of lovastatin and ezetimibe (L/E) significantly reverses hepatic triglyceride accumulation concomitant {{with an increase in}} SREBP- 2 driven autophagy in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We further show that the statin mediated increase in SREBP- 2 directly activates expression of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing enzyme 8 (PNPLA 8) gene, and PNPLA 8 associates with autophagosomes and {{is associated with}} a decrease in cellular triglyceride. Moreover, we show that over-expression of PNPLA 8 dramatically decreases hepatic steatosis through increased autophagy in hepatocytes of HFD-fed mice. Live-cell imaging analyses also reveal that PNPLA 8 dynamically interacts with LC 3 and we suggest that the SREBP- 2 /PNPLA 8 axis represents a novel regulatory mechanism for lipid homeostasis. These data provide a possible mechanism for the reported beneficial effects of statins for decreasing hepatic triglyceride levels in NAFLD patients. ope...|$|R

40|$|Sedimentary rocks host a vast {{reservoir}} of organic carbon, such as 2 -methylhopane biomarkers, whose evolutionary significance we <b>poorly</b> <b>understand.</b> Our ability to interpret this molecular fossil record is constrained by {{ignorance of the}} function of their molecular antecedents. To gain insight into the meaning of 2 -methylhopanes, we quantified the dominant (des) methylated hopanoid species in the membranes of the model hopanoid-producing bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE- 1. Fluorescence polarization studies of small unilamellar vesicles revealed that hopanoid 2 -methylation specifically renders native bacterial membranes more rigid at concentrations that are relevant in vivo. That hopanoids differentially modify native membrane rigidity {{as a function of}} their methylation state indicates that methylation itself promotes fitness under stress. Moreover, knowing the in vivo (2 Me) -hopanoid concentration range in different cell membranes, and appreciating that (2 Me) -hopanoids' biophysical effects are tuned by the lipid environment, permits the design of more relevant in vitro experiments to study their physiological functions...|$|R
40|$|The obligate anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis is the {{etiological}} agent {{responsible for}} periodontal disease. It must withstand {{high levels of}} reactive nitrogen species in the oral cavity generated by the host and other oral flora. The mechanisms allowing for protection against such stress remain <b>poorly</b> <b>understand.</b> HcpR is an FNR-CRP family regulator that has been implicated in regulation of the nitrosative stress response. In this study we characterize the biochemical properties of HcpR. It is a homo-dimer that is composed of 3 domains – a heme-binding domain, dimerization helix, and a DNA-binding domain. Our studies show that HcpR binds the heme cofactor. UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the bound heme is capable of binding the diatomic gas molecule Nitric Oxide (NO) -a source of nitrosative stress. Binding of NO causes {{a change in the}} oxidation state of the iron. SAXS reveals the protein bears a structural resemblance to homology models generated from an ortholog.

40|$|We <b>poorly</b> <b>understand</b> the {{macroscopic}} {{properties of}} complex fluids and of amorphous bodies in general. This is mainly {{due to the}} interplay between phenomena at different levels and length-scales. In particular, {{it is not necessarily}} true that the microscopic level (dominated by direct interactions) coincides with the level where the continuum description comes into play. This is typically the case in the presence of structural inhomogeneities which are inherent to all structurally disordered states of matter below close packing. As a consequence, the macroscopic response to external fields of either fluid or arrested disordered states is not well understood. In order to disentangle this complexity, in this work we build upon a simple yet seemingly powerful concept. This can be summarized as follows: the mesoscopic length-scale of structural inhomogeneities is assumed to be the characteristic length-scale of the effective building blocks, while the degrees of freedom of the primary particles are integrated out. Theoretical results are derived, in the present work, for the macroscopic response of fluid and dynamically arrested model colloidal states in fields of shear. The predictions of the coarse-grained theories and the applicability of the principle are tested in comparison with original simulation and experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Ankylosaurs {{are one of}} {{the least}} {{explored}} clades of dinosaurs regarding endocranial anatomy, with few available descriptions of braincase anatomy and even less information on brain and inner ear morphologies. The main goal {{of this study is to}} provide a detailed description of the braincase and internal structures of the Early Cretaceous nodosaurid Pawpawsaurus campbelli, based on recently made CT scans. The skull of Pawpawsaurus was CT scanned at University of Texas at Austin (UTCT). Three-dimensional models were constructed using Mimics 18. 0 (Materialise). The digital data and further processed 3 D models revealed inaccessible anatomic structures, allowing a detailed description of the lateral wall of the braincase (obscured by other bones in the articulated skull), and endocranial structures such as the cranial endocast, the most complete inner ear morphology for a nodosaurid, and the interpretation of the airflow system within the nasal cavities. The new information on the endocranial morphology of Pawpawsaurus adds anatomical data to the <b>poorly</b> <b>understand</b> ankylosaur paleoneurology.

40|$|Cryptic {{species are}} {{frequently}} recovered in plant lineages, and considered an important cause for divergent of morphological disparity and species diversity. The identification of cryptic species {{has important implications}} for the assessment of conservation needs of species aggregates. The mechanisms and processes of the origin of cryptic species diversity are still <b>poorly</b> <b>understand</b> based on the lack of studies especially in context of environment factors. Here we explored evidence for cryptic species within the epiphyllous liverworts Cololejeunea lanciloba complex based on two loci, the plastid trnL-F region and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region. Several analytic approaches were employed to delimit species based on DNA sequence variation including phylogenetic reconstruction, statistical parsimony networks analysis and two recently introduced species delimitation criteria: Rosenberg’s reciprocal monophyly and Rodrigo’s randomly distinct. We found evidence for thirteen genetically distinct putative species, each consisting of more than one haplotype, rather than four morphologically-circumscribed species. The results implied that the highly conserved phenotypes are not congruent with the genetic differentiation, contributing to incorrect assessments of the biodiversity of epiphyllous liverworts. We hypothesize that evolution of cryptic species recovered may be caused by selection of traits critical to the survival in epiphyllous habitats combined with limite...|$|R
