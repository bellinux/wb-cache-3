5|$|Farsari sold many {{of these}} <b>photograph</b> albums, {{particularly}} to foreign residents and visitors. He employed excellent artists who each produced high-quality work at a pace {{of two or three}} hand-coloured prints per day. Farsari ensured that the colours were true to life and that the best materials were used. Accordingly, his work was expensive, yet popular and often praised by clients and visitors to Japan, even receiving a glowing reference by Rudyard Kipling following his 1889 visit to Yokohama. That same year, Farsari presented a deluxe <b>photograph</b> album to the King of Italy. By the 1890s, the studio's high reputation earned it exclusive rights to <b>photograph</b> the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo.|$|E

Life initially wanted to <b>photograph</b> the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on the grounds that it would look like they were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to <b>photograph</b> them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E

30|$|The SCB {{length in}} <b>photographs</b> {{can be reduced}} through using lens with a {{narrower}} view angle. Although SCB length is an unmanipulable canopy property, SCB length captured by <b>photographs</b> can vary with lens’ view angle (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). Cover photography developed by Macfarlane et al. (2007) uses lens with view angle narrower {{than that of the}} fisheye lens to acquire <b>photographs</b> for LAI estimation. When taking <b>photographs</b> for the same canopies, the narrower the lens’ view angle, the smaller fraction of canopies is captured, as a result, the shorter SCBs are recorded in <b>photographs</b> (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). Because the grey-pixel fraction, a function of the SCB length (Fig.  4), of cover <b>photographs</b> was lower than that of hemispherical <b>photographs</b> (Chianucci 2016; Macfarlane 2011), estimation derived from cover <b>photographs</b> are more accurate than that based on hemispherical <b>photographs</b> (Chianucci 2016).|$|R

The unusual cupola-like structure on legs seen above the gable in the old <b>photograph,</b> now gone, was also added by the synagogue, as was the square structure on which it sat. The panel with a large Hebrew inscription over the main doors was added in this period, before the older <b>photograph.</b> The decorations to the upper parts of the central section of the facade survived until at least 1974, as did the tracery to the square windows on the towers; this Gothic ornamentation was removed after it deteriorated.|$|E
