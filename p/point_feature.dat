40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} detecting <b>feature</b> <b>points</b> from an image and locating their matching correspondence points across images. The proposed method leverages a novel rapid LBP <b>feature</b> <b>point</b> detection to filter out texture-less SURF <b>feature</b> <b>points.</b> The detected <b>feature</b> <b>points,</b> also known as Non-Uniform SURF <b>feature</b> <b>points,</b> are used to match corresponding <b>feature</b> <b>points</b> from other frame images to reliably locate positions of moving objects. The proposed method consists of two processing modules: <b>Feature</b> <b>Point</b> Extraction (FPE) and <b>Feature</b> <b>Point</b> Mapping (FPM). First, FPE extracts salient <b>feature</b> <b>points</b> with <b>Feature</b> Transform and <b>Feature</b> <b>Point</b> Detection. FPM is then applied to generate motion vectors of each <b>feature</b> <b>point</b> with <b>Feature</b> Descriptor and <b>Feature</b> <b>Point</b> Matching.

40|$|Map {{labeling}} of <b>point</b> <b>features</b> {{is the problem}} of placing text labels to corresponding <b>point</b> <b>features</b> on a map in a way that minimizes overlaps while satisfying basic rules for the quality. This is a critical problem in the application of cartography and geographical information systems (GIS). In this paper we study the fundamental issues related to map {{labeling of}} <b>point</b> <b>features</b> and develop a new genetic algorithm to solve this problem. We adopt a method called convex onion peeling and utilize it in our proposed convex onion peeling genetic algorithm (COPGA) to efficiently manage map labels of <b>point</b> <b>features.</b> The proposed algorithm takes advantage of a convex onion peeling structure to achieve better map label initialization and to enhance the evolutionary process. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. In experiments with an implementation of our algorithm using OpenMap, the results show that our genetic algorithm, based on convex onion peeling, is an efficient, robust, and extensible algorithm for automated map labeling of <b>point</b> <b>features...</b>|$|R

Also, because <b>point</b> <b>features</b> are typically presented with labels, their generalization should account for the area on the target map required to render the text. This paper presents an example automated workflow for the progressive thinning by selection of mountain summits. The workflow enriches the <b>point</b> <b>features</b> with a geomorphologic measure (prominence) and generalizes using this relative quantity as a ranking. The procedure uses scale-dependent rectangular tessellations to limit point density on the scaled target map such that each retained summit point has ample surrounding space within which to be labeled. The method is applicable to any thematic <b>point</b> map <b>features</b> which require uncluttered labels. 1...|$|R

50|$|With all of {{the type}} in order and {{adequately}} designed, the final step is the correct placement of labels. Placement describes each feature and its subsequent label(s). For area features, {{it is important to}} curve and extend the spaces to properly fill in the areas enough that the audience can discern different areas. As a cartographic convention, labels are usually as horizontal as possible with no upside-down labels. For line features, it is useful to allow the label to conform to the line pattern. Similar to a river (e.g. geographic features), the label should flow around the edges along the line being careful not to have the letters too extended. For point patterns, the minor patterns to follow include keeping labels on/in their respective features (e.g. coastal cities with labels on the land and not ocean). The major pattern for points is the placement along the point itself. The most widely accepted pattern is to start at the center and work outward towards the northeast quadrant from the point. Many studies have been researched to address the correct strategy for the placements. The <b>point</b> <b>feature</b> cartographic label placement (PFCLP) problem offers the solutions when point boxes overlap. Many software features automatically choose label placements for the cartographer, but these are not always a fail-safe option. The use of good judgment and cartographic conventions are important to gain the best placement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} an {{observability}} {{analysis of a}} vision-aided inertial navigation system (VINS) in which the camera is downward looking and observes a single <b>point</b> <b>feature</b> on the ground. In our analysis, the full INS parameter vector (including position, velocity, rotation, and inertial sensor biases) {{as well as the}} 3 D position of the observed <b>point</b> <b>feature</b> are considered as state variables. In particular, we prove that the system has only three unobservable directions corresponding to global translations along the x and y axes, and rotations around the gravity vector. Hence, compared to general VINS, an advantage of using only ground features is that the vertical translation becomes observable. The findings of the theoretical analysis are validated through real-world experiments. I...|$|E

40|$|<b>Point</b> <b>feature</b> label {{placement}} is {{the problem}} of placing text labels adjacent to point features on a map so as to maximize legibility. The goal is to choose positions for the labels that do not give rise to label overlaps and that minimize obscuration of features.

This article proposes a new heuristic for solving the <b>point</b> <b>feature</b> label placement problem based on the application of the POPMUSIC frame. Computational experiments show that the pro-posed heuristic outperformed other recent metaheuristics approaches in the literature. Experiments with problem instances involving up to 10 million points show that the computational time of the proposed heuristic increases almost linearly with the problem size.
