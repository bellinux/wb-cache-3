Firing rates in the <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> are connected {{with the sense of}} familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. Specifically, stimulation at 30–40Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; but it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones — they examined both equally.

40|$|Abstract: The brain {{mechanisms}} that {{enable us to}} form durable associations between different types of information are not completely understood. Although the hippocampus is widely thought to play a sub-stantial role in forming associations, the role of surrounding cortical regions in the medial temporal lobe, including <b>perirhinal</b> and parahippocampal <b>cortex,</b> is controversial. Using anatomically constrained functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed medial temporal contributions to learning arbitrary associations between faces and names. By sorting learning trials based on subsequent performance in associative and item-specific memory tests, we characterized brain activity associated with successful face-name associative learning. We found that right hippocampal activity was greater when correspond-ing face-name associations were subsequently remembered than when only a face or a name, but not both, were remembered, or when single-item information or associative information was not remem-bered. Neither <b>perirhinal</b> nor parahippocampal <b>cortex</b> encoding activity differed across these same con-ditions. Furthermore, right hippocampal activity during successful face-name association learning was strongly correlated with activity in cortical regions involved in multimodal integration, supporting the idea that interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex contribute to associative memory. These results specifically implicate the hippocampus in associative memory formation, in keeping with theo-retical formulations in which contributions to across-domain binding differ among brain structures i...|$|R

25|$|Impairments in impulse {{control in}} binge drinkers, {{which is more}} {{prominent}} in female binge drinkers, is due to dysfunction of the frontal lobe. The findings in humans have been largely concordant with animal studies. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas {{that are involved in}} learning and spatial memory, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex,</b> entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A study in rats found that a heavy 2-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge drinking is known to occur as a result of binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge drinking is done to cause brain damage in humans. One study found that humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a 3-year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol, which occurs in heavy binge drinkers, has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural kindling; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals {{is believed to be the}} mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Neuronal kindling also leads to each subsequent acute withdrawal episode being more severe than previous withdrawal episodes.|$|E

To investigate the neural computations involved in finding visual targets, we recorded neural responses in inferotemporal (IT) and <b>perirhinal</b> (PRH) <b>cortex</b> as macaque monkeys performed a task that required them to find targets within sequences of distractors. We found similar amounts of total task-specific information in both areas, however, information about whether a target was in view was more accessible using a linear read-out (i. e. was more “untangled”) in PRH. Consistent with the flow of information from IT to PRH, we also found that task-relevant information arrived earlier in IT.

2500|$|Recently, new {{evidence}} has been presented {{in support of a}} more precise interpretation of this hypothesis. The hippocampal formation includes, among other structures: the hippocampus itself, the entorhinal cortex, and the <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex.</b> These latter two make up the [...] "parahippocampal cortices". Amnesics with damage to the hippocampus but some spared parahippocampal cortex were able to demonstrate some degree of intact semantic memory despite a total loss of episodic memory. This strongly suggests that encoding of information leading to semantic memory does not have its physiological basis in the hippocampus.|$|E
50|$|The {{researchers}} found that <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> activation was greater for objects recalled, and parahippocampal cortex activation was greater when scenes were recalled. The results provide evidence of distinct encoding activation in the subregions of the medial temporal lobe. The first subregion is the <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex,</b> which encodes item information. The second subregion, the parahippocampal cortex, is involved in source information. The evidence provides support {{for the role of}} the right <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> in attributing an object to the right source. As decreased activation was associated with poorer performance, decreased activation of the right <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> could be a possible mechanism for source confusion.|$|E
50|$|The <b>perirhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> is also {{involved}} in item memory, especially in coding familiarity or recency of items.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} have revealed total loss of colour vision following removal of all inferior temporal cortex, a condition akin to complete cerebral achromatopsia in humans. Whether less extensive ablation genuinely impairs colour perception without abolishing it or retards learning involving coloured stimuli is contested. We therefore tested macaque monkeys, with total removal of temporal areas TEO and TE but sparing rostral and <b>perirhinal</b> temporal <b>cortex</b> {{and the upper}} bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Compared with three monkeys with lateral parietal ablations, the monkeys with TEO/TE lesions were impaired at learning and retention of simultaneous two-choice colour discriminations and with a nine-choice oddity discrimination whether the coloured target was embedded among grey distracters of the same luminance or among isoluminant coloured distracters. However, their performance was superior to that of an achromatopsic human subject and to that previously measured in monkeys with much larger temporal lobe ablation. They were only mildly impaired at nine-choice oddity discrimination for grey stimuli where the grey target was brighter than the grey distracters. The impairment could be exacerbated or alleviated by altering the colour of {{the background of the}} displays and by static and dynamic luminance masking of the entire display in a manner that indicates that the colour deficit reflects a change in perception rather than a disorder of learning and memory.

40|$|The {{effect of}} aging on 5 -HT 1 A {{receptor}} binding in several forebrain areas {{associated with the}} basal forebrain cholinergic system was investigated in rats of 3 -, 24 - and 30 -months-old by receptor autoradiography and biochemical binding assay using [3 H] 8 -OH-DPAT as a ligand. Autoradiographic measurements demonstrated a marked region-specific decline of ligand binding in: (i) regions of the basal forebrain cholinergic cell groups, i. e. the medial septum, diagonal band nuclei and magnocellular nucleus basalis, (ii) the frontal and parietal neocortex and (iii) the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. No change or only a slight decrease of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor density was found in other areas investigated: the CA 1 and CA 3 sectors of hippocampus, the cingular and <b>perirhinal</b> cerebral <b>cortex</b> and the lateral septum. The autoradiographic findings were substantiated by the biochemical binding assay, which revealed a comparable loss of 5 -HT 1 A receptor in the hippocampus and neocortex {{at the age of}} 30 months. The results clearly show that with increasing age the decrement of 5 -HT 1 A receptor binding in the rat forebrain is remarkably region-selective and particularly affects the cholinergic cell groups that innervate cortex and hippocampus. This phenomenon appears to be especially significant in relation to the neuronal substrates underlying the age-related alterations of mood and cognition. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this paper}} is to propose a model of the hippocampal system that reconciles the {{presence}} of neurons that look like "place cells" with the implication of the hippocampus (Hs) in other cognitive tasks (e. g., complex conditioning acquisition and memory tasks).

40|$|A {{number of}} {{studies have shown that the}} <b>perirhinal</b> (PRh) <b>cortex,</b> which is part of the medial {{temporal}} lobe memory system, plays an important role in declarative long-term memory. The PRh cortex contains neurons that represent visual long-term memory. The aim of the present study is to characterize the anatomical organization of forward projections that mediate information flow from visual area TE to memory neurons in the PRh cortex. In monkeys performing a visual pair-association memory task, I conducted an extensive mapping of neuronal responses in anteroventral area TE (TEav) and area 36 (A 36) of the PRh cortex. Then, three retrograde tracers were separately injected into A 36 and the distribution of retrograde labels in TEav was analyzed. I focused on the degree of divergent projections from TEav to memory neurons in A 36, because the highly divergent nature of these forward fiber projections has been implicated in memory function. I found that the degree of divergent projection to memory neurons in A 36 was smaller from the TEav neurons selective to learned pictures than from the nonselective TEav neurons. This result demonstrates that the anatomical difference (the divergence) correlates with the physiological difference (selectivity of TEav neurons to the learned pictures). Because the physiological difference is attributed to whether or not the projections are involved in information transmission required for memory neurons in A 36, it can be speculated that the reduced divergent projection resulted from acquisition of visual long-term memory, possibly through retraction of the projecting axon collaterals. 報告番号: 乙 15724; 学位授与年月日: 2003 - 06 - 18; 学位の種別: 論文博士; 学位の種類: 博士(医学); 学位記番号: 第 15724 号; 研究科・専攻: 医学系研究...|$|R

Multivoxel classifiers were trained to distinguish between retrieval conditions before and after correction for mean signal and response times, to more thoroughly characterize the multivoxel signal associated with memory context. ResultsActivity in <b>perirhinal</b> and parahippocampal <b>cortex</b> dissociated between memory for associated items and memory for their spatiotemporal context, and hippocampal activity was linked to memory for spatial context. However, perirhinal and hippocampal classifiers were, respectively, driven by effects of mean signal amplitude and task difficulty, whereas the parahippocampal classifier survived correction for these effects.

5000|$|Neuropsychology {{has used}} imaging {{techniques}} such as PET (positron emission tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging [...] ) to study brain-injured patients, and has shown that explicit memory relies on {{the integrity of the}} medial temporal lobe (rhinal, <b>perirhinal</b> and parahippocampal <b>cortex),</b> the frontal-basal areas and the bilateral functionality of the hippocampus. The amygdala is mainly responsible for the emotional component in the process of information storage (see Gazzaniga,1999; Mancia, 2000b, 2004, in press), and can modulate both the encoding and the storage of hippocampal-dependent memories (Phelps, 2004).Implicit memory, by contrast, is not conscious and concerns data that can be neither remembered nor verbalized. It presides over the learning of various skills: a) priming, which is the ability of an individual to choose an object to which he has previously been exposed subliminally; b)procedural memory, which concerns cognitive and sensorimotor experiences such as motor skills learning, everyday activities, playing instruments or playing certain sports: c) emotive and affective memory,2, which concerns emotional experiences, as well as the phantasies and defences linked to the first relations of the child with the environment and in particular with the mother.|$|R
40|$|Using {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging, {{the current study}} explored the differential mnemonic contributions of the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortices to explicit recognition memory and configural learning. Using a task that required processing of repeated and novel visuospatial contexts across multiple trials, we examined MTL activation in relation to 3 forms of learning in a single paradigm: 1) context-independent procedural learning, 2) context-dependent configural learning, and 3) explicit recognition memory. Activations in hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex were associated with explicit memory, differentiating between subsequently remembered and forgotten repeated contexts, but were unrelated to context-dependent configural learning. Activations in regions of <b>perirhinal</b> and entorhinal <b>cortex</b> were associated with configural learning of repeated contexts independent from explicit memory for those contexts. Procedural learning was unrelated to activation in any MTL region. The time course of activation across learning further differed in MTL subregions with MTL cortex demonstrating repetition-related decreases and hippocampus repetition-related increases. These repetition effects were differentially sensitive to recognition with only activation in hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex tracking recognized items.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The medial {{temporal}} lobe (MTL), {{a set of}} heavily inter-connected structures including the hippocampus and underlying entorhi-nal, <b>perirhinal</b> and parahippocampal <b>cortex,</b> is traditionally believed {{to be part of}} a unitary system dedicated to declarative memory. Recent studies, however, demonstrated perceptual impairments in amnesic indi-viduals with MTL damage, with hippocampal lesions causing scene discrimination deficits, and perirhinal lesions causing object and face discrimination deficits. The degree of impairment on these tasks was influenced by the need to process complex conjunctions of features: dis-criminations requiring the integration of multiple visual features caused deficits, whereas discriminations that could be solved on the basis of a single feature did not. Here, we address these issues with functional neuroimaging in healthy participants as they performed a version of the oddity discrimination task used previously in patients. Three different types of stimuli (faces, scenes, novel objects) were presented from either identical or different viewpoints. Consistent with studies in patients, we observed increased perirhinal activity when participants distinguished between faces and objects presented from different, compared to identi-cal, viewpoints. The posterior hippocampus, by contrast, showed an effect of viewpoint for both faces and scenes. These findings provide convergent evidence that the MTL is involved in processes beyond long-term declarative memory and suggest a critical role for these structures in integrating complex features of faces, objects, and scenes into view...|$|R
40|$|In {{a review}} of the {{literature}} on the development of the medial temporal lobe region in humans, monkeys, and rodents, Bachevalier and Beauregard indicated that in primates, memory functions subserved by this neural system emerge early in life and increment gradually with further postnatal maturation. Furthermore, they stated that the late-developing memory functions of normal neonates was more likely owing to the slow maturation of the association areas of the cortex than to the slow maturation of the hippocampal formation. This conclusion was based on the limited knowledge concerning the development of hippocampal-dependent memory functions and the maturational events in the medial temporal lobe of monkeys. Over the last decade, however, more information has accumulated about the structural, functional, and behavioral changes occurring throughout ontogeny in monkeys that suggest a refinement of this view. Whereas there is still much to be discovered, we thought it timely to put into perspective the latest findings in hope of shedding light on memory development in general, and particularly, on the role of medial temporal lobe structures in infant and adult memory.
