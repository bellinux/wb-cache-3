40|$|The {{effects of}} temperature, pH, and time {{variations}} on the <b>protective</b> <b>amount</b> and quality of electroless nickel (EN) deposition on cast aluminium alloy (CAA) substrates were studied. The temperature, pH, and plating time were varied while the surface condition of the substrate was kept constant in acid or alkaline bath. Within solution pH of 5. 0 – 5. 5 range, the best quality is obtained in acid solution pH of 5. 2. At lower pH (5. 0 – 5. 1), good adhesion characterised the EN deposition. Within the range of plating solution pH of 7. 0 to 11. 5, the highest {{quantity and quality of}} EN deposition are obtained on CAA substrate in solution pH of 10. 5. It is characterised with few pores and discontinuous metallic EN film. The quantity of EN deposition is time dependent, whereas the adhesion and brightness are not time controlled. The best fit models were developed from the trends of result data obtained from the experiments. The surface morphologies and the chemical composition of the coating were studied using the Jeol JSM- 7600 F field emission scanning electron microscope...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{cancer cells}} were {{isolated}} from tumor specimens of nine glioblastoma patients. Glioblastoma cells, cultured under suitable culture conditions, displayed markers typical of neural stem cells, {{were capable of}} partial multilineage differentiation in vitro, and gave origin to infiltrating tumors when orthotopically injected in NOD/SCID mice. These cells, although resistant to freshly isolated NK cells, were highly susceptible to lysis mediated by both allogeneic and autologous IL- 2 (or IL- 15) -activated NK cells. Indeed, all stem cell-cultured glioblastoma cells analyzed did not express <b>protective</b> <b>amounts</b> of HLA class I molecules, while expressing various ligands of activating NK receptors that triggered optimal NK cell cytotoxicity. Importantly, glioblastoma stem cells expressed high levels of PVR and Nectin- 2, the ligands of DNAM- 1 -activating NK receptor...|$|R
40|$|Type I interferons (IFNs) crucially {{contribute}} to host survival upon viral infections. Robust expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and induction of an antiviral state critically depend on amplification of the IFN signal via the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). A {{small amount of}} type I IFN produced early upon virus infection binds the IFNAR and activates a self-enhancing positive feedback loop, resulting in induction of large, <b>protective</b> <b>amounts</b> of IFN-α. Unexpectedly, we found robust, systemic IFN-α expression upon infection of IFNAR knockout mice with the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV). The IFNAR-independent IFN-α production required in vivo conditions and was not achieved during in vitro infection. Using replication-incompetent THOV-derived virus-like particles, we demonstrate that IFNAR-independent type I IFN induction depends on viral polymerase activity but is largely independent of viral replication. To discover the cell type responsible for this effect, we used type I IFN reporter mice and identified CD 11 b(+) F 4 / 80 (+) myeloid cells within the peritoneal cavity of infected animals as {{the main source of}} IFNAR-independent type I IFN, corresponding to the particular tropism of THOV for this cell type...|$|R
40|$|Although the lipid {{mediator}} sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) {{has been identified}} to induce cell growth arrest of human keratinocytes, the sphingolipid effectively protects these epidermal cells from apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of the anti-apoptotic action induced by S 1 P is less characterized. Apart from S 1 P, endogenously produced nitric oxide (NO???) has been recognized as a potent modulator of apoptosis in keratinocytes. Therefore, it was {{of great interest to}} elucidate whether S 1 P protects human keratinocytes via a NO???-dependent signalling pathway. Indeed, S 1 P induced an activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human keratinocytes leading to an enhanced formation of NO???. Most interestingly, the cell protective effect of S 1 P was almost completely abolished {{in the presence of the}} eNOS inhibitor L-NAME as well as in eNOS-deficient keratinocytes indicating that the sphingolipid metabolite S 1 P protects human keratinocytes from apoptosis via eNOS activation and subsequent production of <b>protective</b> <b>amounts</b> of NO???. It is well established that most of the known actions of S 1 P are mediated by a family of five specific G protein-couple...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Human skin {{is exposed}} to solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation comprising UVB (280 – 315 nm) and UVA (315 – 400 nm) on a daily basis. Within the last two decades, the molecular and cellular response to UVA/UVB and the possible effects on human health have been investigated extensively. It is generally accepted that the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of UVB {{is due to the}} direct interaction with DNA. On the other hand, by interaction with non-DNA chromophores as endogenous photosensitizers, UVA induces formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play a pivotal role as mediators of UVA-induced injuries in human skin. This review gives a short overview about relevant findings concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying UVA/UVB-induced cell death. Furthermore, we will highlight the potential role of cutaneous antioxidants and photolabile nitric oxide derivates (NODs) in skin physiology. UVA-induced decomposition of the NODs, like nitrite, leads not only to non-enzymatic formation of nitric oxide (NO), but also to toxic reactive nitrogen species (RNS), like peroxynitrite. Whereas under antioxidative conditions the generation of <b>protective</b> <b>amounts</b> of NO is favored, under oxidative conditions, less injurious reactive nitrogen species are generated, which may enhance UVA-induced cell death...|$|R

40|$|A 54 {{year old}} woman {{presented}} with symptoms {{resulting from a}} thrombosis of the lateral transverse and sagittal sinuses the day after an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) replacement treatment. She had previously suffered a milder episode after IVIg. Following recurrent bacterial chest infections and sinusitis for more than 40 years, a diagnosis of IgG 1 deficiency had been made two years earlier, after exclusion of other causes. She made a good recovery from the thrombosis but high platelet counts were investigated and primary thrombocythaemia was diagnosed. Investigation of humoral immunity revealed <b>protective</b> <b>amounts</b> of IgG antibodies to pathogens, and because the previous IgG 1 deficiency had resolved IVIg infusions were not restarted. She made a good response to treatment with hydroxyurea, with improvement of the headaches and lowering of the platelet counts. Prophylactic antibiotics {{reduced the number of}} bacterial chest infections and nasal corticosteroids improved the chronic sinusitis. This case is presented to highlight the need to look for other contributing factors for severe recurrent headaches after IVIg treatment, and to consider the risk of thrombosis even when replacement doses of IVIg are used. It is also important to emphasise the need to ensure that an isolated IgG subclass deficiency is not transient; that failure to produce specific IgG antibodies to immunisation and/or exposure antigens is confirmed, thus meeting the criteria for the diagnosis of primary antibody deficiency. A thorough risk-benefit assessment is essential before blood product treatment is started...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the stance}} of the WTO and various RTAs, {{elements}} of trade protectionism remain prevalent. This could {{be understood by}} the divergence between countries’ national interests and international trade protocols, which was reverberated during the recent global financial crises. However, the contradiction has taken new turn following new protectionist instruments. Furthermore, the implication of these instruments on developing countries economy is prevalent. Thus, this study explores the likelihood to engage in trade protection and the implication on developing country, focussing on Africa. The study observes {{that in the first}} quarter of 2012 alone, the number of <b>protective</b> measures <b>amounts</b> to 67, with bail out and trade defence accounting for as much as 74...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis A {{is one of}} {{the most}} common vaccine-preventable {{infectious}} diseases in the world. Effective vaccines against hepatitis A have been available since 1992, and they provide long-term immunity against the infection. However, there is no worldwide consensus on how long protection will last or whether there will be a need for hepatitis A virus (HAV) booster vaccinations in the future. In most countries, booster-vaccination policy is guided by manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 recommendations, national authorities, or both. In June, 2002, a panel of international experts met to review the long-term immunogenicity and protection conferred by HAV vaccine in different population groups. Data have shown that after a full primary vaccination course, <b>protective</b> antibody <b>amounts</b> persist beyond 10 years in healthy individuals, and underlying immune memory provides protection far beyond the duration of anti-HAV antibodies. The group concluded that there is no evidence to lend support to HAV booster vaccination after a full primary vaccination course in a healthy individual. However, further investigations are needed before deciding if boosters can be omitted in special patient-groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} {{chemical}} carcinogenesis involves single, isolated, essentially irreversible molecular events as discrete steps, several of which must {{occur in a}} row to finally culminate {{in the development of}} a malignancy, rather suggests that an absolute threshold for chemical carcinogens may not exist. However, practical thresholds may exist due to saturable pathways involved in the metabolic processing, especially in the metabolic inactivation, of such compounds. An important example for such a pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of epoxides via epoxide hydrolases, a group of enzymes for which the catalytic mechanism has recently been established. These enzymes convert their substrates via the intermediate formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate complex. Interestingly, the formation of the intermediate proceeds faster by orders of magnitude than the subsequent hydrolysis, ie, the formation of the terminal product. Under normal circumstances, this does not pose a problem, since the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the epoxide hydrolases with the best documented importance in the metabolism of carcinogens, is highly abundant in the liver, the organ with the highest capacity to metabolically generate epoxides. Computer simulation provides evidence that the high amount of mEH enzyme is favorable for the control of the steady-state level of a substrate epoxide and can keep it extremely low. However, once the mEH is titrated out under conditions of extraordinarily high epoxide concentration, the epoxide steady-state level steeply rises, leading to a sudden burst of the genotoxic effect of the noxious agent. This prediction of the computer simulation is nicely supported by experimental work. V 79 Chinese hamster cells that we have genetically engineered to express human mEH at about the same level as that observed in human liver are completely protected from any measurable genotoxic effect of the model compound styrene oxide (STO) up to a dose of 100 microM in the cell culture medium (toxicokinetic threshold). In V 79 cells that do not express mEH, STO leads to the formation of DNA strand breaks in a dose-dependent manner with no toxicokinetic threshold observable. Above 100 microM, the genotoxic effect of STO in the mEH-expressing cell line parallels the one in the parental cell line. Thus, the saturable protection from STO-induced strand breaks by mEH represents a typical example of a practical threshold. However, it must be pointed out that even in the presence of <b>protective</b> <b>amounts</b> of mEH, a minute but definite level of STO is present that does not contribute sufficiently to the strand break formation to overcome the background noise of the detection procedure. As pointed out above, absolute thresholds probably do not exist in chemical carcinogenesis...|$|R
25|$|After {{smallpox}} {{was declared}} eradicated by WHO in December 1979, vaccination programs were terminated. A re-emergence {{of the disease}} either by accident or {{as a result of}} biological warfare would meet an unprotected population and could result in an epidemic that could be difficult to control. Mass vaccination would be unethical, as the only efficient vaccines against smallpox include live vaccinia virus with severe adverse effects on rare occasions. As one <b>protective</b> measure, large <b>amounts</b> of vaccine are kept in stock, but an efficient drug against smallpox has high priority. One possible approach would be to use the specificity of the thymidine kinase of poxvirus for the purpose, in a similar way that it is used for drugs against herpesvirus. One difficulty is that the poxvirus thymidine kinase belongs to the same family of thymidine kinases as the human thymidine kinases and thereby is more similar chemically. The structure of poxvirus thymidine kinases has therefore been determined to find potential antiviral drugs. The search has, however, not yet resulted in a usable antiviral drug against poxviruses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Molten Mg alloys {{burn rapidly}} in air if not {{protected}}. In order to handle molten Mg safely, the molten metal {{should be protected}} from oxidation by covering the surface with flux or protective gases. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas is widely used for Mg alloy as a cover gas and {{has proved to be}} a successful inhibitor. However, the use of SF 6 gas is limited because of its high cost and its significant impact on global warming potential (GWP). Therefore, SF 6 gas is being replaced by alternative protection gases such as tetrafluoro ethane (HFC- 134 a) and 3 M Novec TM 612. These gases are less expensive and have lower GWP, compared with SF 6 gas. Recent studies show that there has been another attempt by adding CaO into Mg alloys to manufacture CaO added AZ 31 Mg alloy in terms of increasing ignition temperature and reducing <b>protective</b> cover gas <b>amount</b> during melting and casting. This paper discusses effect of CaO on ignition and oxidation behaviors of AZ 31 Mg alloy as well as on surface roughness and mechanical properties of AZ 31 Mg alloy extruded bars...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{based on}} live viruses are {{attractive}} {{because they are}} immunogenic, cost-effective, and can be delivered by multiple routes. However, live virus vaccines also cause reactogenic side effects such as fever, myalgia, and injection site pain that have reduced their acceptance in the clinic. Several recent studies have linked vaccine-induced reactogenic side effects to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) in humans. Our objective was therefore to determine whether IL- 1 b contributed to pathology after immunization with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine vectors, and if so, to identify strategies by which IL- 1 b mediated pathology might be reduced without compromising immunogenicity. We found that an rVSV vaccine induced local and systemic production of IL- 1 b in vivo, and that accumulation of IL- 1 b correlated with acute pathology after rVSV immunization. rVSV-induced pathology was reduced in mice deficient in the IL- 1 receptor Type I, but the IL- 1 R 2 / 2 mice were fully protected from lethal rechallenge with a high dose of VSV. This result demonstrated that IL- 1 contributed to reactogenicity of the rVSV, but was dispensable for induction of <b>protective</b> immunity. The <b>amount</b> of IL- 1 b detected in mice deficient in either caspase- 1 or the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC after rVSV immunization was not significantly different than that produced by wild type animals, and caspase- 12 / 2 and ASC 2 / 2 mice were only partially protected from rVSV-induced pathology. Those data {{support the idea that}} some of the IL- 1 b expressed in vivo in response to VSV may be activated by a caspase- 1 and ASC-independent mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} of {{the preceding}} communication showed that the therapeutic action of antipneumococcic serum depends to a considerable extent upon a certain non-antibacterial factor. The experiments reported in the present communication had two main objects; the first {{was to determine the}} distribution of the non-antibacterial factor among the various protein fractions of the serum, and incidentally to correlate this property of the factor with that of certain known antibodies, as well as to learn whether or not the protein fractions commonly excluded from refined preparations of antipneumococcic serum, have any therapeutic value; the second was to determine the rôle of the non-antibacterial factor in the therapy of pneumococcus infection, as exemplified by the experimental, dermal, pneumococcus infection in rabbits. To determine the distribution of the non-antibacterial factor, Type I antipneumococcic serum was fractionated with (NH 4) 2 SO 4, and the antibacterial bodies were absorbed by concentrated suspensions of heat-killed pneumococci. The activity of the non-antibacterial factor in the different protein fractions was then tested for by adding varying amounts of the absorbed supernatant liquids to a certain constant, subeffective dose of serum. Even though the method of titration has certain inherent faults it was possible to ascertain that the non-antibacterial factor was apparently associated with all the globulin fractions to a similar degree, and to a certain extent with the albumen as well. In this respect the non-antibacterial factor resembles neither the antibacterial bodies of antipneumococcic serum, nor, for example, the known diphtheria or tetanus antitoxins. The determination of the relative importance of the antibacterial and non-antibacterial factors in the therapy of pneumococcus infection in rabbits, was rendered possible {{by the fact that the}} various globulin fractions differ in their relative content of the two factors. Thus whereas the water-insoluble fraction of the globulin, precipitated when the saturation of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 is raised from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, contains about 90 per cent of the antibacterial (mouse protective) bodies, it apparently contains no more of the non-antibacterial factor than the water-soluble fraction. The minimal effective doses as well as the mouse protective unit content of the different fractions were determined. Before the tests were performed, it seemed that if the therapeutic effect of a given dose were to depend chiefly upon its content of mouse <b>protective</b> antibody, the <b>amounts</b> required for 1 M. E. D. would be determined by the number of mouse protective units it contained; on the other hand, if it depended primarily on the non-antibacterial factor, one would expect the amounts required for 1 M. E. D. to be of approximately the same volume. Actually the therapeutic effect was found not to depend entirely upon either factor, alone; the M. E. D. 's varied both in volume and m. p. u. content, the absolute concentration of either factor being inconstant and almost proportional to the relative concentration of the other. Thus a relative abundance of non-antibacterial factor made up for a scarcity of mouse protective antibody (as in the water-soluble globulin), and vice versa (as in the water-insoluble globulin). It appears, therefore, that when a relatively larger amount of antibacterial bodies are acting, less of the non-antibacterial factor is necessary; conversely, when more of the non-antibacterial factor is available, less of the antibacterial bodies are necessary. The last experiment dealt with the practical question as to whether any protein fraction or combination of fractions is as good a therapeutic agent as the whole, unrefined serum from which it was derived. Two considerations were in mind in making the comparison; one had to do with the quantitative recovery of potency, the other with the qualitative effect of the various fractions as regards the lesion, course, and duration of the experimental disease. The results may be summarized as follows: (a) the total globulin was not only as good, but in this instance, definitely better than the original serum; (b) the total water-insoluble globulin, although almost as potent as the original serum, was qualitatively and quantitatively less effective than the total globulin; (c) the removal of the 30 per cent (NH 4) 2 SO 4 fraction not only diminished the potency of the remaining globulin to a considerable extent (at least 25 per cent), but also seems to have disturbed a certain equilibrium, which resulted in an undesirable zone phenomenon. As a result of this zone phenomenon, which, it is important to note, was not observed in the agglutination or mouse protection tests on the same fractions, the range of effective dosage is very narrowly limited. Although the results of agglutination tests correlated well with those of the mouse protection tests, both of these showed no parallelism with the therapeutic effects of the various fractions on the experimental, dermal, pneumococcus infection in rabbits...|$|R
