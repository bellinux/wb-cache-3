He argued strongly for a <b>promising</b> <b>future</b> {{of all forms of}} aeronautics and especially the aeroplane. However his Army superiors on the committee were against aeronautics in any form. It was decided that only small-scale airship experiments should continue and that aeroplane work should be stopped.

5|$|The {{only known}} {{clinical}} use of osmium {{appears to be}} for synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. It involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide (OsO4), which is a highly toxic compound. The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the osmium compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II) compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo, it indicated a <b>promising</b> <b>future</b> for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs.|$|E

25|$|Thanks to {{the efforts}} of Father David Dillon and {{numerous}} other Mount Carmel faithful, the school emerged stronger than ever in the 1980s and 90s. The already storied athletic program rose to dominance, winning state championships in Basketball, Football, Ice Hockey and Wrestling. In more recent history, the campus has been expanded to include modern facilities that support science, technology, performing arts and continued athletic success. The combination of the school's rich history, generous alumni and popular staff has built a <b>promising</b> <b>future</b> for Mount Carmel.|$|E

25|$|Another {{class of}} methods assesses whether the {{inference}} {{was successful in}} light of the given observed data, for example, by comparing the posterior predictive distribution of summary statistics to the summary statistics observed. Beyond that, cross-validation techniques and predictive checks represent <b>promising</b> <b>future</b> strategies to evaluate the stability and out-of-sample predictive validity of ABC inferences. This is particularly important when modeling large data sets, because then the posterior support of a particular model can appear overwhelmingly conclusive, even if all proposed models in fact are poor representations of the stochastic system underlying the observation data. Out-of-sample predictive checks can reveal potential systematic biases within a model and provide clues on to how to improve its structure or parametrization.|$|E

30|$|Vertically aligned {{molybdenum}} nanowalls can {{be prepared}} on varied substrates by thermal vapor deposition. Their formation undergoes through a four-stage process associated with the production of molybdenum and its dioxide nanorods, molybdenum nanotrees, molybdenum nanoflakes, and molybdenum nanowalls. Atomic arrangement, lattice mismatch relationship, and competition growth all together contribute to the growth mechanism. The nanowalls can sustain a very much larger field emission current density and better emission stability as compared to most of other nanostructures. Moreover, the single nanowall is shown to have a remarkably high electrical conductivity. The results suggest that molybdenum nanowalls should have <b>promising</b> <b>futures</b> {{in the application of}} vacuum electron devices that demand both high current and high current density.|$|R
25|$|<b>Promising</b> <b>future</b> {{applications}} include high-performance smart grid, {{electric power}} transmission, transformers, power storage devices, electric motors (e.g. for vehicle propulsion, as in vactrains or maglev trains), magnetic levitation devices, fault current limiters, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials, and superconducting magnetic refrigeration. However, superconductivity {{is sensitive to}} moving magnetic fields so applications that use alternating current (e.g. transformers) {{will be more difficult}} to develop than those that rely upon direct current. Compared to traditional power lines superconducting transmission lines are more efficient and require {{only a fraction of the}} space, which would not only lead to a better environmental performance but could also improve public acceptance for expansion of the electric grid.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{great deal}} of {{publicity}} and promises, the history of human gene therapy has been characterized by relatively limited success. The effect of introducing a gene into cells often promotes only partial and/or transient relief from the symptoms of the disease being treated. Some gene therapy trial patients have suffered adverse consequences of the treatment itself, including deaths. In some cases, the adverse effects result from disruption of essential genes within the patient's genome by insertional inactivation. In others, viral vectors used for gene therapy have been contaminated with infectious virus. Nevertheless, gene therapy is still held to be a <b>promising</b> <b>future</b> area of medicine, and is an area where there is a significant level of research and development activity.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} {{concern of}} expressionist architects {{was the use}} of materials and how they might be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it monolithic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism {{can be seen in the}} context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more <b>promising</b> <b>future.</b> They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{theme is}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} modern world itself. A world of {{high-speed}} air transport, computers, and space stations is (by any past standard) 'futuristic'; yet the search for alternative and perhaps more <b>promising</b> <b>futures</b> suggests {{a feeling that the}} desired or expected future has failed to materialize. Retrofuturism suggests an alternative path, and in addition to pure nostalgia, may act as a reminder of older but now forgotten ideals. This dissatisfaction also manifests as political commentary in Retrofuturistic literature, in which visionary nostalgia is paradoxically linked to a utopian future modelled after conservative values as seen in the example of Fox News' use of BioShock's aesthetic in a 2014 broadcast.|$|R

Fortunately, a growing number of cities are leading the way with innovative strategies that provide multiple routes to graduation for all students. These efforts include the establishment of one-stop "reengagement centers" for high school dropouts. The centers offer a range of services such as individual academic assessments, opportunities to explore different education options and referrals to appropriate schools or other credential programs...|$|R
