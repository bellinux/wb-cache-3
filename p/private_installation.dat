40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) {{signaling}} and the Intelligent Network (IN) concept can be exploited to support mobility in an ATM-based network with wireless access parts and mobile users. The proposed architecture exploits the enhanced service control processing features offered by the IN technology to support location management. The access signaling protocol structure {{is based on the}} principles of separation between call and bearer channel control, employed in fixed broadband access networks. The design objective is to minimize the changes required to the wired network signaling, by taking advantage of the well-developed capability sets. This allows the easy introduction of the wireless ATM technology (W-ATM) into the real world. It is shown that the proposed signaling protocol model provides cost-effective implementations without degrading the agreed Quality of Service (QoS) and the system's performance. A comparative signaling performance evaluation is carried-out to demonstrate the impact of the proposed signaling protocol architecture onto various performance measures and to quantify the relative gains. The obtained results can be used for network design purposes in a large-scale <b>private</b> <b>installation</b> supporting many users. The signaling protocol architecture aims for private W-ATM networks, but can be readily extended to fulfill the signaling requirements of public environment broadband wireless systems.

He lobbied successfully for the concession by presenting {{plans for a new}}, 140,000 seat stadium, as well as other improvements, notably a sports complex. Construction began on the mammoth Ciudad Deportiva project, and a recreational area consisting of a network of round islands connected by bridges was completed.

5000|$|Estimates for 2012 {{suggest that}} {{almost half the}} {{renewable}} energy capacity in Germany is owned by citizens through energy cooperatives (Genossenschaft) and <b>private</b> <b>installations.</b> [...] Critics worry that the new rules will preclude citizen participation, despite the special provisions for cooperatives and individuals. Preparing tenders is expensive (costing perhaps €50,000-100,000) and that expenditure is sunk if the bid fails. [...] In January 2016 Greenpeace Energy said that renewables auctions would make the Energiewende less fair and that citizen cooperatives and small investors would be at a disadvantage. Germanwatch, WWF-Germany, and Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), three German NGOs, said the proposed reforms do not properly account for small, citizen-owned renewables projects. [...] Citizen participation {{is seen as a}} key reason for the widespread public acceptance of renewable technologies in Germany. That support may lag if the EEG reforms favor large companies over cooperatives and individuals.|$|R

The Maoists also attacked army barracks for the first time. The Maoists attacked Ghorahi in Dang and briefly {{took control of the}} district headquarters. They killed more than two dozen police and army personnel, blew up government offices, freed prisoners from the local jail and stole NPR 64.8 million worth of gold and silver from local banks. This coincided with attacks all over the country the most serious of which was in Syangja where 14 policemen were killed. This was followed two days later by an attack on the headquarters and army barracks in Solukhumbu District. The attack on the headquarters was unsuccessful but they made out with a substantial amount of ammunition and sophisticated weapons from their attack on the army barracks.

5000|$|Cable {{television}} in Taiwan is {{claimed by the}} industry to have begun in 1969 in the Taipei suburb of Shipai, and CATV antennas were subsequently set up in Taiwan's mountainous areas to remedy poor terrestrial reception in those areas. In the 1970s, illegal cable television systems nicknamed [...] "fourth channels" [...] (zh:第四台) to differentiate it from the then-three legal Taiwanese terrestrial channels were set up in every location in Taiwan. These illegal cable television systems, while technically considered to have operated outside the boundaries of Taiwanese law {{because there was no}} provision for cable {{television in}} the Taiwanese Broadcasting Act at that time were, however, popular with the Taiwanese public as they offered more choices in programming compared to those offered by terrestrial television. Fourth channels initially obtained much of their programming from VCR videotapes, which were then played and retransmitted via coaxial cables to connected households with a subscription, and subsequently enjoyed massive growth after the late 1980s when the legalisation of Ku band satellite receptions in 1988 and <b>private</b> <b>installations</b> of C band satellite dishes in 1992 substantially increased the range of available channels. Fourth channels were also popular among Taiwan's then-nascent opposition political parties, who used this medium to communicate pro-democracy views.|$|R

When there are subassociations that belong to master associations, the master association may provide many of the amenities. In general, the larger the association the more amenities that can be provided.Amenities also depend on the type of housing. For example, single-family-home communities may not have a common-area swimming pool, since individual home-owners have the ability to construct their own private pools. A condominium, on the other hand, may offer a community pool, since the individual units do not have the option of a <b>private</b> pool <b>installation.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Security {{can improve}} due to {{centralization}} of data, increased security-focused resources, etc., but concerns can persist about {{loss of control}} over certain sensitive data, {{and the lack of}} security for stored kernels. Security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems, in part because service providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot afford to tackle or which they lack the technical skills to address. However, the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or over a greater number of devices, as well as in multi-tenant systems shared by unrelated users. In addition, user access to security audit logs may be difficult or impossible. <b>Private</b> cloud <b>installations</b> are in part motivated by users' desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information security.|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of Cloud systems {{is a key}} concern, but has typically been assessed by the comparison of relatively few Cloud systems, and often {{on the basis of}} just one or two features of performance. In this paper, we discuss the evaluation of four different Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud systems – from Amazon, Rackspace, and IBM – alongside a <b>private</b> Cloud <b>installation</b> of OpenStack, using a set of five so-called micro-benchmarks to address key aspects of such systems. The results from our evaluation are offered on a web portal with dynamic data visualization. We find that there is not only variability in performance by provider, but also variability, which can be substantial, in the {{performance of}} virtual resources that are apparently of the same specification. On this basis, we can suggest that performance-based pricing schemes would seem to be more appropriate than fixed-price schemes, and this would offer much greater potential for the Cloud Economy.|$|R

50|$|Jon Barlow Hudson {{was born}} in Montana in 1945 and {{has spent much of}} his life {{traveling}} the United States as well as overseas. His father was a hydro-geologist, writer, professional magician, builder, and a violinist. Hudson’s mother was a weaver, writer, teacher, and public activist (she would become Yellow Springs, Ohio’s first female mayor in later years). When Jon was six years old, their family traveled to Saudi Arabia, and through the foreign traveling, Hudson was able to explore many great historical-sculptural sites. He worked at several apprenticeships and gained knowledge from life experience, but also attained his Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees from the California Institute of the Arts. Hudson prefers to work with stone, steel (painted or raw/polished), glass, light, water, and other natural materials. Jon Barlow creates large and small scale public and <b>private</b> sculptures, <b>installations,</b> and corporate sculptures. Hudson has displayed sculptures in over 23 different countries and enjoys working with the space to either reflect or transform the surroundings, according to the criteria for each site-specific sculpture.|$|R
