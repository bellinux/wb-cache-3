The catalyst for the strike was the attempted deportation of Indigenous inmate Albie Geia who committed the offence of disobeying the European overseer. The strike continued for five days and was broken with dawn raids to remove the families involved by boat to the mainland.|$|E
5|$|A round Norman-style apse {{was added}} to the church in 1868, the architects being the Lancaster {{partnership}} of Paley and Austin. The incumbent, the Rev. Thomas Clarke, <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> addition, but died before its construction was complete. Architect J.S.Crowther oversaw further alterations in 1881–83; a baptistery was built, the organ was moved and choir stalls were built in the chancel. Some work was done to the interior of the tower in 1908. Renovations in 1955 included the addition of a central aisle and the removal of some of the church furnishings. The Victorian pulpit was replaced. A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005.|$|E

This edition included a foreword from the author, four illustrations of recommended stage decor, a number of performance guidelines, and a brief outline {{of the state of}} the theatre among the ethnic Chinese. Kwee Tek Hoay <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> printing, a run of 1,000 copies, out of his own pocket and saw large financial losses. The stage play was republished in 2006, using the Perfected Spelling System, as part of the first volume of the Lontar Foundation's anthology of Indonesian stage dramas.|$|E

People from Dalarna rebelled three times in the first ten years of Gustav's reign, as they considered the king to have been too harsh on everyone he perceived as a supporter of the Danish, and as they resented his introduction of Protestantism. Many of those who had helped Gustav in his war against the Danes became involved in these rebellions and <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> several of them with their lives.|$|E
25|$|Once back in France, Beaumarchais {{began work}} on a new operation. Louis XVI, {{who did not want}} to break openly with Britain, allowed Beaumarchais to found a {{commercial}} enterprise, Roderigue Hortalez and Company, supported by the French and Spanish crowns, that supplied the American rebels with weapons, munitions, clothes and provisions, all of which would never be <b>paid</b> <b>for.</b> <b>This</b> policy came to fruition in 1777 when John Burgoyne's army capitulated at Saratoga to a rebel force largely clothed and armed by the supplies Beaumarchais had been sending; it marked a personal triumph for him. Beaumarchais was injured in a carriage accident while racing into Paris with news of Saratoga.|$|E
25|$|Brighton is {{situated}} on the English Channel coast {{at a point where}} several valleys meet the sea. One of these was formed by the flow of the River Wellesbourne, a winterbourne which came to the surface at Patcham. The intermittent flow of the stream created a boggy, marshy area of land around which the old village of Brighthelmstone developed. Just before entering the sea, it formed a small pool. As demand for land grew in the late 18th century during a period of rapid growth, the Wellesbourne was diverted into a culvert and built over: the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Marlborough <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> The pool was hidden under a new road, Pool Valley, in 1792–93.|$|E

500|$|For {{some time}} Wright had urged that a {{navigation}} lectureship be instituted for merchant seamen, and he persuaded Admiral Sir William Monson, {{who had been}} on Cumberland's Azores expedition of 1589, to encourage a stipend to be <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> At the beginning of the 17th century, Wright succeeded Thomas Hood as a mathematics lecturer under the patronage of the wealthy merchants Sir Thomas Smyth and Sir John Wolstenholme; the lectures were held in Smyth's house in Philpot Lane. By 1612 or 1614 the East India Company had taken on sponsorship of these lectures for an annual fee of £50 (about £6,500 as of 2007). Wright was also mathematics tutor to the son of James I, the heir apparent Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, from 1608 or 1609 until the latter's death at the age of 18 on 6 November 1612. Wright was described as [...] "a very poor man" [...] in the Prince's will and left the sum of £30 8s (about £4,300 in 2007). To the Prince, who was greatly interested in the science of navigation, Wright dedicated the second edition of Certaine Errors (1610) and the world map published therein. He also drew various maps for him, including a [...] "sea chart of the N.-W. Passage; a paradoxall sea-chart of the World from 30° Latitude northwards; [...] a plat of the drowned groundes about Elye, Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, [...] ".|$|E

500|$|With Rolling Stone, Clemons {{described}} how he recorded the saxophone solo with Gaga. In January 2011, Clemons was putting together an exercise machine in his Florida house {{when his wife}} told him that Gaga's representatives were on the phone, and {{they wanted him to}} play on her upcoming album. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that {{he would be able to}} record it on the coming week, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It made so much sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on and you just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'". The recording was finished by 3:00 am, after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised for [...] "getting <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> I would have done it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." [...] According to the sheet music [...] published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time. It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span from F3 to F5, and the song follows a basic sequence of F–C–Dm–B as its chord progression.|$|E

2500|$|A single Inverted Jenny {{was sold}} at a Robert A. Siegel auction in November 2007 for $977,500. In December 2007 a mint never hinged example was sold for $825,000. The broker of the sale said the buyer was a Wall Street {{executive}} who had lost the auction the previous month. A block of four inverted Jennys was {{sold at a}} Robert A.

Between January and September 2014, five examples offered at auction sold for sums ranging from $126,000 through $575,100.

2500|$|The {{functional}} drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, {{called a}} TRIAC, {{is able to}} work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, reactive loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the AC power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily inductive motor loads usually {{requires the use of}} a [...] "snubber" [...] circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. Inverse parallel SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off. The [...] "price" [...] to be <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> arrangement, however, is the added complexity of two separate, but essentially identical gating circuits.|$|E

2500|$|In the two-light {{window on}} the north side of the chancel, the left light {{features}} the Raising of Lazarus story (John 11:1–44). The text says [...] "Lazarus come forth" [...] (John 11.43) and [...] "Jesus wept" [...] (John 11.35). The second light illustrates the story of the Raising of the son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7:11–17) This window was dedicated to William Strother by his mother. The Strothers were major landowners in the village area, living locally at Low Hall, Kennel Hall Farm and Westfield. The east window was made by Cox & Son. The design of the central two lights is based on John 20:24–29, the story of Doubting Thomas. In this image, Thomas (shown kneeling at bottom of second light from left) has finally seen the Resurrection and checked the wounds, and he now believes in it. The top part of the window consists of three small rose lights, containing symbols. The left symbol is the Paschal Lamb, a heraldic symbol in which the Lamb of God carries the cross of St. George. The right-hand rose shows a pelican vulning, a heraldic symbol (a crest in this case) of a self-sacrificing pelican feeding her young with the blood from her breast, symbolising the Passion. This medieval symbol was superseded by the Lamb and Flag. The image in the uppermost rose shows the intertwined Alpha and Omega. Thomas Strother, who <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> window, dedicated it to his wife or mother, and died while the church was in process of construction. The two-light {{window on the}} north side of the chancel is dedicated to Thomas Strother (1806–1879) by his widow. The left-hand light represents St Peter, carrying the Keys of Heaven, with his book at his feet, symbolising the Scriptures. The angel below him carries the words, [...] "Rejoice in the lord alway" [...] (Paul's Epistle to the Philippians 4:4). The right hand light shows Paul the Apostle carrying a sword symbolising his martyrdom, with the Scriptures in the form of a book at his feet. The angel below him has the words [...] "The just shall live by faith" [...] (Paul's Epistle to the Romans 1:17).|$|E
