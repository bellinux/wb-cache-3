Underground nuclear tests at Yucca Flat, one of the USDOE test areas at NTS, have affected hydrologic conditions, including groundwater levels. The purpose of this map report, prepared in cooperation with USDOE, is to present selected water-level data collected from wells and test holes through December 1991, and to show potentiometric contours representing 1991 water-table conditions in the Yucca Flat area. The more generic term, potentiometric contours, is used herein rather than ``water-table contours`` because the hydrologic units contributing water to wells and test holes may not accurately represent the water table. The water table is that surface in an unconfined water body at which the pressure is atmospheric. It is defined by the altitude at which non- <b>perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is first found in wells and test holes. <b>Perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is defined as unconfined ground water separated from an underlying body of ground water by an unsaturated zone.

40|$|Distribution {{of total}} and fecal {{coliform}} bacteria in three Atlantic coastal plain soils in Virginia were monitored in situ over a 3 -year period. The soils studied were Varina, Goldsboro, and Beltsville sandy loams. These and similar soils are found extensively along the populous Atlantic seaboard of the United States. They are considered only marginally suitable for septic tank installation because the restricting soil layers {{result in the}} subsequent development of seasonal perched water tables. To determine both horizontal and vertical movement of indicator organisms, samples were collected from piezometers placed at selected distances and depths from the drainfields {{in the direction of}} the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow. Large reductions in total and fecal coliform bacteria were noted in the <b>perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>waters</b> above the restricting layers as distance from the drainfield increased. These restricting soil layers appear to be effective barriers to the vertical movement of indicator organisms. The reduction in the density of the coliform bacteria above the restricting soil layers can probably be attributed to dilution, filtration, and dieoff as the bacteria move through the natural soil systems...|$|R
40|$|Tapejara wellnhoferi, a small azhdarchoid pterodactyloid {{from the}} Early Cretaceous Santana Formation of Brazil, {{provides}} critical {{information about the}} aerodynamic function of its spectacular head crest. The cranial crests in pterodactyloids were sexually dimorphic and {{are thought to have}} evolved in adult males in response to female mate choice. However, the location of cranial crests in front of the center of gravity would create instability in the yaw axis during flight and may seem like a handicap. Vertically aligned webbed feet probably suppressed the yawing rotations and instability from the crest. Here we show that the crest functioned as a front rudder to make agile turn and mediate flight control. A computer simulation model suggests that Tapejara had a large excess of muscle power available above the power required for continuous flapping flight. It could easily takeoff from a <b>perch,</b> <b>ground,</b> or <b>water</b> surface and land safely on the ground. It was an excellent glider with a gliding angle close to 40 and a cruising speed of 27 km/h. Tapejara could soar efficiently on the windward side of cliffs or circle on rising thermals over tropical waters for efficient long-distance flight. Various control surfaces in the wings of Tapejara analogous to the slat, aileron, elevator, fin, rudder, and horizontal stabilizer of an aircraft made pterodactyloids versatile flyers.

Most of the landslides occurring in Sri Lanka are found to be triggered by intense rainfall events. This study was carried out on a landslide that occurred near Gerandiella waterfall, located in Kotmale Divisional secretariat in Sri Lanka.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} climate on the generation of possible geohazards. The rainfall and evaporation changes in Hong Kong {{in the past four}} decades are first reviewed based on records from the Hong Kong Observatory. Then the effect of climates on the generation of emerging geohazrzds is analyzed through a series of transient infiltration analyses taking the climate conditions as initial conditions. Three climate conditions; namely, extreme drought condition, extreme wet condition, and steady-state condition, are studied. Extreme yearly weather variations are shown to be the key to the generation of interchanging extreme hazards such as landslides and floods. The analysis results demonstrate that, in a prior extreme drought condition, an intermediate rainfall process can result in large surface runoff and thus surprising floods. In addition, dissipation of suction only occurs in the shallow soils. Hence, storm water infiltration into a dry ground is likely to cause shallow-seated landslides or debris flows under the combined effect of shallow <b>perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and surface erosion from increased runoff. On the other hand, in extremely wet conditions, the ground water table can rise substantially and failure of some slopes that have been stable for a long time can be triggered even by a moderate rainfall event...|$|E

The landfills involved were the "A" Mountain, Rio Nuevo South, Nearmont, and Rio Nuevo North landfills. Six regional ground water monitor wells were installed {{as part of this}} study. Existing shallow monitor wells were also sampled. Concentrations of chloride, total dissolved solids (TDS), nitrate-nitrogen, and organics, and values of specific conductance (EC) were the indicators used for contaminated ground water. Using these indicators, it was determined that the Rio Nuevo North Landfill is a source of ground water contamination. Leachate is also being generated in the <b>perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> under the Rio Nuevo South and Nearmont landfills, but the regional ground water quality there is so far unaffected. Low levels of organic contaminants were noted across the study area. The source of water for leachate generation at the Rio Nuevo North Landfill was not determined, but a likely source at the Rio Nuevo South Landfill was determined to be major runoff events in the Santa Cruz River. The protocol presented in this thesis was found to be sufficient for determining that leachate was present.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. In {{the course of}} the ERTS investigation in the Cataract Creek Basin of the Coconino Plateau it was recognized that shallow <b>perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> associated with the Kaibab Limestone could be discovered by means of drilling guided by geologic mapping aided by the use of ERTS imagery. At the Globe Ranch, the perched water table is only 5 meters beneath the surface {{at the site of the}} original, hand dug well. Recharge occurs from local runoff and from direct precipitation on the outcrop belt of the sandstone. This well provides water for the ranch at the rate of about 1, 000 gallons a week. In order to explore the possibility of further developing this aquifer, unit 5 was mapped over an area of about 50 square miles in the vicinity of the hand-dug well, with negative results. A new location was then picked for drilling based on the occurrence of unit 5 in a favorable structural setting. This location was along a normal fault, and it was anticipated that water might be structurally trapped within the down-dropped block of the fault. Four shallow testholes were drilled and all encountered water. These four water-bearing holes are currently being monitored and will be tested to determine potential production of water from the local sandstone aquifer...|$|E
40|$|Gully erosion in {{the humid}} Ethiopian {{highlands}} intensified in recent decades. The {{study was conducted}} in the Birr watershed located south west of Bahir Dar the capital of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. We studied 14 gullies having similar morphology at three sub watersheds. The watershed covers a total area of 414 ha. The monitoring continued over the 2013 to 2014 monsoon season to better understand the factors controlling gully erosion and the effectiveness of erosion control structures. <b>Perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> table was measured at the gully heads and erosion pins were installed to monitor the rate of recession from uncontrolled heads. Though soil properties, ground cover, gully morphology had small contribution for the gully development; water fall effect {{at the head of the}} gully and elevated water table depth at both heads and banks played the key role. Therefore the study focused on reducing the water fall and elevated water table effect by applying two low cost gully control approaches. The first approach was regrading the gully heads and banks at 45 o and the second approach follows regrading the gully heads at 45 o and putting a graded type of stone rip rap. Large stones were anchored at the toe of the head maintaining the stable gully bed slope. The result shows that unprotected gully heads retreat an average of 4 m which is equivalent to 37 m 3 volume of soil loss. The maximum and minimum head cut retreat was between 0 and 22. 5 m. The total area damaged by annual gully head retreat was 240 m 2 and total volume of soil lost was 444 m 3. The treated gully heads did not show any retreat during the monitoring period. Compared with simple reshaping of gully heads, integration with Stone rip rap was an effective and low cost measure in the study watershed. Plantation could not stop the upslope migration of heads though it had the potential to trap sediments down slope. Heads with stone rip rap allows fast re vegetation whereas unprotected reshaped heads and banks took longer time to re vegetate and stabilized. Time of reshaping was important for the stability of banks and heads...|$|E
40|$|In slope {{stability}} research a ground water level increase {{is often the}} critical factor for failure. High ground water levels (or more properly stated: high pore water pressures) reduce the internal strength of the slope. It is recognised {{for quite some time}} that fast infiltration of precipitation towards the (<b>perched)</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> table can induce high pore pressures and thus instability within formerly stable slopes. However, deeper located landslides are affected on the long term by a slow but distinct ground water table rise, which may take place a significant time after the occurrence of rainfall. From the above it is clear that hydrological insight in natural slopes susceptible to landsliding, is more than appropriate for the long-term risk assessment in case of land use or climate change. The objective of this thesis is to analyse and quantify the hydrological processes that play a role in landslides within clayey slopes. The following questions are addressed: - What can hydro- and geochemistry add to our knowledge of a hydrological system in a clayey slope? - What processes dominate the ground water recharge in unstable clayey slopes and how can the ground water recharge be quantified? - What is the consequence of a land use or climatic change with respect to unstable clayey slopes? The study of the potential use of hydro- and geochemistry in refining the hydrological knowledge of a site is described in the second part (chapter 3). Analyses have been made to cation exchange capacity and exchangeable cation compostion with NH 4 Ac and NaCl method. It is concluded that geochemistry is a potentially valuable technique for e. g. landslide reserarch, but is recognised that still a lot of work has to be done before this technique can be applied in engineering practice. The hydrological analyses of the Beline study area at Salins-les-Bains shows the importance {{of the role of the}} unsaturated zone in deep-seated landslides. A methodology is presented to model state-dependent ground water recharge. This is basically a precipitation time series that is rescaled as a function of the state of the unsaturated zone. The latter can be calculated on basis of the results of an unsaturated zone model, soil moisture content or even be approximated using a sinusoidal function. The results of the Beline case study showed that clear improvement of the modelling of ground water level fluctuations can be obtained with this focus on the input series. It was made plausible that the Beline slope suffers from creep displacement process. The changing ground water conditions as a result of changes in climate or land use have two important consequences for the creep displacement at the Beline slope. Acceleration of the displacement will occur because of an increased ground water level. Probably more significant is the impact of prolonged periods of high ground water level. This prolonged period of movement is for slopes, which encounter creep features, probably the most important factor for catastrophic failure. In that respect a long-term change in vegetation pattern has much more influence on a clayey slope system than a short-term change in climate input...|$|E

Little Stony Creek water, Hyphus Creek water, Franciscan Complex regional <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> Great Valley Group regional <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> were collected during wet and dry seasons and were analyzed for deuterium, oxygen- 18, temperature, pH, redox potential, conductivity, and major cation and anion concentrations. Turnover in the local flow system is rapid indicating that local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is dependent on recent recharge. Local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is recharged primarily by Little Stony Creek water and Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> In the wet season, Little Stony Creek is the more prominent source of local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and the ratio of Little Stony Creek water to Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> decreases with distance from the channel. In the dry season, Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is the more prominent source of local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and the ratio of Little Stony Creek water to Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> decreases with distance down the valley. Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> discharges to local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> throughout the year, primarily because the local flow system is a regional low that lies perpendicular to the Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flowpath.

40|$|The {{influence}} of geologic factors in controlling flow patterns in hydraulic systems is evaluated by hydraulic models which are constructed as a porous consolidated media that simulates the interstitial geometry of consolidated rocks. Colored inks are {{injected into the}} flow system and are observed through the transparent sides of the model case. Visual analysis of the flow system, leads to salient conclusions concerning fundamental aspects of complex flow systems. Empirical experiments were conducted on the following aspects: Refraction of flow lines across lithologic interfaces: The law of streamline refraction, as described by King Hubbert, {{was found to be}} correct where boundary conditions do not interfere. Continuity of flow around and through highly permeable and impermeable lenses of different lithologies: The flow system around impermeable lenses indicates the nonexistence of stagnant areas where a hydraulic gradient is imposed on a saturated ground water system. Flow net system caused by a single pumping well: Transient changes of individual flow vectors, within the immediate area of influence, were analyzed at the moment pumping began. The absence of a transition phase indicates a rapid adjustment of the flow system to the pumping condition. Flow net system of mutual interference of depression cones caused by pumping multiple wells: This permitted an analysis of the ground water divide. Flow bands divided into flow paths which moved in opposite directions. Effects of emplacing pumping wells in highly permeable media: The increased area of {{influence of}} water movement to wells was clearly illustrated. This analysis demonstrates the capture of partially confined flow from great dths. The relation of the shape of artificial recharge pits to infiltration rate: Variations of flow net systems of rectangular and wedge-shaped pits were analyzed. When all other factors were held constant, the shape of the recharge pit was found to have no important effect upon recharge rate. Flow toward an effluent stream: The potential head of ground water beneath the stream was found to increase with depth. The relationship between hydraulic gradient and flow net configuration: The hydraulic gradient was found to have no effect on the flow net of a confined system, but a definite effect upon unconfined flow systems, in as much as it alters the water table which is the upper flow boundary. Flow pattern through tilted and faulted sedimentary structures: The geometric convergence of the aquifer boundaries caused the convergence of flow lines through a brecciated fault zone. A possible genesis of a hydrothermal vein ore was suggested by this flow pattern. Formation of perched water tables: The mechanisms by which saturated ground water mounds can be formed on a low permeability lens was demonstrated. Evidence was found which indicates that <b>perched</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> probably escapes through the perching body as well as around its extremities. Confluence of gravity water and saturated flow: Unsaturated flow arriving at the water table of the saturated ground water body becomes an integral part of that body which acts as a single hydrodynamic system. Artesian ground water systems: A model illustrating the classic artesian aquifer situation was constructed, andflowing and non-flowing artesian wells were studied. A ground water mound was formed in the water table aquifer by water discharging naturally from the artesian aquifer through a fault in the confining layer. Subsidence around a pumping well: Water was pumped from a simulated artesian well, the piezometric surface {{in the vicinity of the}} well was lowered and the overburden was observed to subside while compressing the artesian aquifer. Cone of depression formed around single and multiple well systems: The drawdown at any point within the area of influence of a multiple well system was shown to be equal to the sum of the individual drawdowns of each well in the multiple well system, provided recharge and evaporation are neglected. Information resulting from these studies will provide guides for scientific development and exploitation of ground water supplies. Contributions were made that will advance the use of hydraulic models as exploratory tools in scientific hydrology. Further, this work brought into focus the importance of hydraulic models as couinunication media for interpreting cause-effect relationships in highly complex flow systems, of the type that so often are involved in regional problems of water resource development and management...|$|E

40|$|Quantification of {{the rate}} of natural <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> {{recharge}} is a pre-requisite for efficient <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> resource management. It is particularly important in regions with large demands for <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> supplies, where such resources {{are the key to}} economic development. However, the rate of aquifer recharge {{is one of the most}} difficult factors to measure in the evaluation of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> resources. Estimation of recharge, by whatever method, is normally subject to large uncertainties and errors. In this paper, an attempt has been made to derive an empirical relationship to determine <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge from rainfall in Upper Ganga Canal command area based upon seasonal <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> balance study carried out for a number of years...|$|R

As hydro-geological conditions of the mine are extremely complicated, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush happened twice during excavation of the ventilation shaft in 2006 and 2009 respectively. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to control the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush and guide the safety production of the mine. Hence, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> state was firstly analyzed through the data of borehole and hydrologic geology. After that, hydro-geological models of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system were built up. According to the hydro-geological models, mathematical models of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> were established. With the help of the software of Processing Modflow for Windows (PMWIN), the numerical model of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> was set up. Then, by using the SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation) iterative method, the numerical equations were solved. Finally, the district <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inflow rate on the main mining levels and the dangerous districts of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush was figured out. The results of the numerical solution are significant to the control of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush in the Baixiangshan iron mine...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>water</b> {{flow regime}} of the Kamenose {{landslide}} area in Osaka Prefecture was investigatedfrom 1964 to 1969 {{as a part}} of a synthetic research of the Kamenose landslide. The results of theinvestigations of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level and the geological structure suggested that the ground waterin this area can be treated as phreatic water. It was also confirmed by the result of the logging ofthe <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow in the boreholes. The distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> storage can be givenfrom a contour map of the water table and a geological map showing the thickness of permeablelayer (mainly weathered andesite). The path of significant <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow was estimatedthrough the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> tracing and the geochemical investigation of land waters. It was foundthat the main <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> vein exists in the zone where the landslide motion was significant. Theresult of the investigation of water balance in the watershed of a brook in the landslide area showedthat the net recharge of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> accounts for about 60 % of the annual precipitation. Thedischarge of the springs and the artificial drainage works, and the base flow of the brook in thewatershed are summed up and compared with the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge. It is shown that about 60 % of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge flows away without appearing on the ground surface in this area. It is generally said that the <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> Flow in landslide areas usually exists as ground waterveins in the underground channels. It is demonstrated that, in such a case, distribution of thepotential of <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> direction of significant flow, and water balance of each part of thewatershed must firstly be investigated to know the fundamental network of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow,and to know, then, its more detailed structure through further investigations...|$|R
