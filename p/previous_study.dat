40|$|The {{relationship}} between fandoms and religion {{has become an}} increasingly popular topic to study {{within the field of}} the sociology of religion. In <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> there have been different views concerning whether or not fandoms should be regarded as religious from a functional perspective. This issue is especially interesting considering the decreasing popularity of traditional religion in some aspects.   The aim of this essay is to study how Harry Potter fandoms are described in <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> The study aims at discerning both the empirical data and how the data is interpreted. The material in this study consists of three <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> about the communities centered around Harry Potter fandoms. These studies were analyzed in relation to Meredith B. McGuire´s (2002) concept “cultic stance” and Matt Hills (2002) concept “neoreligiosity”.  The studies were analyzed through a hermeneutical text analysis. According to the results, the Harry Potter fandoms examined in the <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> somewhat relate to both abovementioned theories. The cultic stance was applicable when the fans described a desire for some kind of god or supernatural power. The neoreligiosity was applicable when the fans described their fandom with religious language. The <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> in my material describe fandoms from different perspectives.

40|$|In most research, linear {{regression}} analyses are performed without {{taking into account}} published results of similar <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> Although the prior density in Bayesian {{linear regression}} could accommodate such prior knowledge, formal models for doing so are absent from the literature. The goal {{of this paper is}} therefore to develop a Bayesian model in which a linear regression analysis on current data is augmented with the reported regression coefficients of <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> Two versions of this model are presented. The first version incorporates <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> through the prior density and is applicable when the current and all <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> are exchangeable. The second version models all studies in a hierarchical structure and is applicable when studies are not exchangeable. Both versions of the model are assessed using simulation studies. Performance for each in estimating the regression coefficients is consistently superior to using current data alone, and is close to that of an equivalent model that uses the data from <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> rather than reported regression coefficients. Overall the results show that augmenting data with results from <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> is viable and yields significant improvements in the parameter estimation...|$|R

25|$|Another study {{concluded}} that fouling degrades performance over time, and determined that although regular brushing was able to remove most of the microbial layer, over time a tougher layer formed {{that could not be}} removed through simple brushing. The study passed sponge rubber balls through the system. It concluded that although the ball treatment decreased the fouling rate it was not enough to completely halt growth and brushing was occasionally necessary to restore capacity. The microbes regrew more quickly later in the experiment (i.e. brushing became necessary more often) replicating the results of a <b>previous</b> <b>study.</b> The increased growth rate after subsequent cleanings appears to result from selection pressure on the microbial colony.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, {{scientists}} in California recovered and sequenced the nuclear DNA of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago. The procedure used genomic DNA extracted {{from one of}} the animal's teeth. Sequencing the DNA directly (rather than first replicating it with the polymerase chain reaction), the scientists recovered 21 cave bear genes from remains that did not yield significant amounts of DNA with traditional techniques. This study confirmed and built on results from a <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> using mitochondrial DNA extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old. Both show that the cave bear was more closely related to the brown bear and polar bear than it was to the American black bear, but had split from the brown bear lineage before the distinct eastern and western brown bear lineages diversified and before the split of brown bears and polar bears. The divergence date estimate of cave bears and brown bears is about 1.2–1.4 Mya.|$|E

A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids. A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor. This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.|$|E
