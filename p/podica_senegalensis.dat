50|$|The African finfoot (<b>Podica</b> <b>senegalensis)</b> is an {{aquatic bird}} {{from the family}} Heliornithidae (the finfoots and sungrebe). The species lives in the rivers and lakes of western, central, and {{southern}} Africa.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the only}} member of the genus Heliornis. The Heliornithidae family, to which it belongs, {{contains}} just two other species: the African finfoot, <b>Podica</b> <b>senegalensis,</b> and the masked finfootHeliopais personatus, which breeds in eastern India down through southeast Asia to the Wallace Line.|$|E
50|$|Other birds include Falco naumanni and Circus macrourus, {{which are}} fairly common on passage, while {{small numbers of}} Phoenicopterus minor have been {{reported}} on Lakes Chamo and Abaya. Species typical of bushland habitats include Phoeniculus somaliensis, Lanius dorsalis and Cisticola bodessa and the open plains support three species that are very unknown elsewhere in Ethiopia: an isolated population of Mirafra albicauda, the endemic Caprimulgus solalaand the rare C. stellatus. The south-western corner of Lake Abaya supports {{one of only two}} Ethiopian populations of Myrmecocichla albifrons. Other species of note include Accipiter ovampensis, Aviceda cuculoides, Gypaetus barbatus, Macheiramphus alcinus, Chelictinia riocourii, Francolinus levaillantii, <b>Podica</b> <b>senegalensis,</b> Crithagra reichardi, Schoutedenapus myoptilus, and Coracina caesia.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA fossil humerus {{from the}} hominid {{fossiliferous}} area of Toros Menalla (ca 7 Ma, Chad, Africa) {{belongs to the}} Heliornithidae (Aves, Gruiformes). It is the second documented fossil record for the family, and {{the first in the}} Old World. It is compared with all the living species: the Sungrebe (Heliornis fulica), the Masked Finfoot (Heliopais personata) and the African Finfoot (<b>Podica</b> <b>senegalensis).</b> It belongs to the genus Heliopais, and is very similar to the only species H. personata. The Masked Finfoot appears to have evolved little morphologically since the Miocene. This poorly known and threatened genus and species is today confined to tropical South-East Asia. Its presence in the Late Miocene of Chad is a further Asian element in the late Neogene African avifaunas. Today the distribution of Heliopais is highly relictual, and some Heliornithidae will certainly be encountered in the Paleogene and the Miocene deposits of the Palearctic region. The African Finfoot is today the Heliornithidae geographically the closest to the site area, and occurs in forested regions south of the Sahelian area. Apparently, this genus was already absent further north, where the Asian genus was present, in the Late Neogene. Palaeoecologically, the presence of this Heliornithidae is indicative for Toros Menalla of a freshwater body with thick overhanging vegetation, and partly forested edges. This kind of precise indication about a component of the palaeoenvironment is critical for the study of hominid sites and early hominid evolution. A growing number of fossil birds from African hominid localities is yielding important clues regarding biogeography and environment...|$|E
