40|$|We {{investigate}} the strategic decision making of <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> in a tendering process. In particular, {{we are interested}} in how <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> behave to acquire audit clients and which audit quality is ensured. Our main findings are manifold. First, if two big <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> are competing, we do not observe that each firm tries to acquire all clients. However, if one big and one small <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> are competing, we find evidence that the big <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> generally apply strategies to acquire all available clients. In contrast, the small <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> uses a clear "Guerilla Strategy" which means that the firm concentrates only on few clients whereas the other clients are almost ignored. Second, small <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> are better off if more clients do exist in the tendering process. Thus, the legislator should ensure that more audit clients are tendered if the competitiveness of smaller <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> should be enhanced. Third, in {{a situation in which the}} competitive advantage of big <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> increases over-proportionally, we do not observe that big <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> are able to decrease the market share of small <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> markedly or are even able to push small <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> out of the market. Fourth, we find that the quality level of an audit is higher if the client is acquired by a small <b>audit</b> <b>firm.</b> This implies that increasing the number of smaller <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> could increase the quality level of the audit market...|$|R

To analyze the data, the technique of event history analysis is applied. There are two key results of the study. First, a higher level of education of the firm's auditors, both at founding and during the lifetime of an <b>audit</b> <b>firm,</b> generally increases <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> performance. Second, the effects of experience at founding and experience during the lifetime of an <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> vary considerably.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple, two-period specialization model {{to analyze the}} effect of start-up costs on <b>auditing</b> competition. <b>Audit</b> <b>firms</b> in the model make strategic specialization and pricing decisions. Through specialization, an <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> achieves a comparative cost advantage over its competitors for all clients whose characteristics are closer to its area of specialization. This comparative cost advantage is further fortified {{by the presence of}} start-up costs. As a result, each <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> obtains some market power and is able to price-discriminate across clients by offering "specialization-and-relationship-specific" audit fee schedules. This paper demonstrates that the practice of "low-balling" is a natural consequence of competition among <b>audit</b> <b>firms.</b> However, low-balling occurs only in a certain market segment where <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> compete fiercely. This paper also shows that a policy of banning low-balling acts as a substitute for the commitment of the <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> to partially collude their pricing policies and results in increased profits for <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> and increased fees. However, it also results in <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> choosing specializations in a more efficient way, thereby reducing total auditing costs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{examines}} IPO {{audit fees}} {{to assess the}} use of industry special-ization as a differentiation strategy by <b>audit</b> <b>firms.</b> We extend existing theory {{on the impact of}} industry specialization on audit fees by incorporating Porters (1985) theory of competition and differentiation. We suggest that market share enables <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> to gain competitive advantages in terms of cost and service. However, the impact of such advantages on fees depends on whether the <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> has successfully differentiated itself from competitors within client industries. Our results indicate that as <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> industry market share increases without a differentiation in market share, the audit fee charged for a given IPO decreases. In the context of Porter (1985), this result suggests that the client is able to bargain for a portion of the auditors cost savings because the <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> has not successfully differentiated itself from competitors. In contrast, we show that <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> that possess significantly higher market shares than their industry competitors earn fee premiums, suggesting that <b>audit</b> <b>firms</b> that have successfully differ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present and test an applied theory of auditor {{industry}} specialization. We use our theory to investigate how <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> industry market share affects fees {{in the market}} for IPO assurance services. Our theory suggests that as an <b>audit</b> <b>firm’s</b> share of a client industry increases, (a) the <b>audit</b> <b>firm’s</b> costs will decrease and (b) service and assurance quality in that industry will increase. Given lower costs and higher quality, the key fee determinant as market share increases is the bargaining power that exists between the <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> and the client. We believe that an <b>audit</b> <b>firm’s</b> industry market share is a reasonable proxy for the firm's ability to differentiate itself from competitors. We further believe that an <b>audit</b> <b>firm's</b> ability to differentiate its services drives its relative bargaining power. Specifically, if a given <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> does not possess significantly greater industry market share than its competitors, economies of scale-based cost savings {{are more likely to be}} passed along to clients. However, if the <b>audit</b> <b>firm</b> dominates an industry it should earn higher fees as the incentives to pass along cost savings dissipate. Our results support these contentions.
