5|$|Hayes {{issued an}} {{executive}} order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. Sherman agreed with Hayes that the three had to resign, but he made clear {{in a letter to}} Arthur that he had no <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> against the Collector. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements but the Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
25|$|Scholars posit that Jesus {{may have}} been a direct {{follower}} in John the Baptist's movement. Prominent Historical Jesus scholar John Dominic Crossan suggests that John the Baptist {{may have been}} killed for political reasons, not necessarily the <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> given in Mark's gospel.|$|E

50|$|Conjuration is a {{very common}} mystical {{practice}} in Mid-West Asia, most commonly found in Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.

Peterson insisted he did not hold a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> against Rae.|$|E
25|$|The gaon of Pumbedita having died, Aḥa was universally {{acknowledged}} {{to be the}} fittest man to succeed him. But a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> entertained by the exilarch Solomon bar Ḥasdai induced the latter to pass over Aḥa, and to appoint Natronai ben Nehemiah, Aḥa's secretary, a man considerably his inferior in learning and general acquirements. Highly incensed at this slight, the eminent scholar left Babylonia and settled in Israel, about 752-753, where he remained until his death. Notwithstanding Steinschneider (Cat. Bodl. s.v.), who erroneously assigns 761 as the year, the exact date of his demise is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of Wicket W. Warrick and his friends on the forest moon of Endor during the years before {{the events of the}} two Ewok films and Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi. Unlike the films, the {{characters}} speak English (called Basic in the Star Wars universe) instead of their native language (though Ewokese phrases and songs are occasionally used). The primary recurring villains are Morag the Tulgah Witch, who had a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> against the tribe's shaman, Master Logray, and the Duloks, a rival species that is related to the Ewoks.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign of 2016 saw the U.S. security officials accuse the Russian government of being behind massive cyber-hackings and leaks that aimed at influencing {{the election and}} discrediting the U.S. political system. The allegations were dismissed by Putin who said the idea that Russia was favouring Donald Trump was a myth created by the Hillary Clinton campaign. The background of tense relationship between Putin and Hillary Clinton was highlighted by U.S. press during the election campaign. Later, in mid-December 2016, Hillary Clinton suggested that Putin had a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> against her due to her criticism of the 2011 Russian legislative election and his opinion that she was responsible for fomenting the anti-Putin protests in Russia that began in December 2011. She partially attributed her loss in the 2016 election to Russian meddling organized by Putin.|$|E
25|$|Various {{characters}} are shown entering the fifth DOA tournament, {{which takes place}} at the platform. Each does it for their own reasons, often to either see once more or to defeat some other character. Usually they join it after either being approached by Zack, who is shown finding, fighting and recruiting them around the world. After Tina decides to return to fighting, her father Bass enters it as well, adopting a ring name of Mr. Strong; eventually, they reunite as a team. While stalking Jann Lee, Leifang eventually confronts him before the tournament and there is sexual tension between them. Hitomi, who still hopes to see Ein (Hayate), advances to the quarterfinals, defeating Mila and then Eliot. During a break, Hitomi meets Hayate, who wishes her good luck. Jann Lee, who had won constructive matches against Leifang and Mr. Strong, defeats her, emerging as the winner from the tournament but not attending the championship award ceremony out of a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> for Rig, whom he lost to in an earlier fight.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{purports to}} be a memoir written in 1900 by Kwasi Boachi, {{one of two}} Ashanti princes taken from their {{homeland}} to the Netherlands in 1837 to receive a Christian education. It is mostly based on historical fact, and set partly in the nineteenth-century Dutch Gold Coast. Kwasi and his fellow Ashanti prince Kwame Poku are pestered at their school in Delft and attract a measure of attention from the royal court, which views the boys as curiosities and, while favoring them for the while, fails to offer them continued support. Kwasi and Kwame grow apart; Kwasi chooses to assimilate himself into Dutch culture and deny his African background, while Kwame is unable to adapt to his new environment. He returns to Africa, but finds himself an outcast there as he has by now forgotten his native language; no longer accepted by his own people, whom he never sees again. Almost three years are spent waiting in Fort Elmina for permission {{to return to his}} people while he slowly appears to sink into delusion, then commits suicide. Meanwhile, Kwasi attempts to seek his fortune in the Dutch East Indies but fails, owing in part to the prevalence of racism and a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> held by one of his former classmates, who is his superior in the East Indies.|$|E

In his pardoning statement, Altgeld said the record of police brutality towards the workers had invited revenge adding, [...] "Capt. Bonfield is the man who is really {{responsible for the deaths of}} the police officers." ...|$|E

The game's featured antagonist is Godot, an eccentric, coffee-loving prosecutor who keeps his identity concealed behind a mask and who seems to harbor a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> against Phoenix.|$|E

Balmunk is introduced in the eleventh chapter, and takes the role of primary antagonist {{for the remainder of}} the series. Balmunk leads a gang made up of criminals with superpowers and weaponry based on traditional circus acts and freak show performances, such as fire swallowing and the box-impalement trick. His magical powers include summoning abilities which allow him to create weapons, call upon henchmen and beasts such as tigers, and, in his most powerful technique, create a giant golem named Amantine from one of [...] his own limbs.

We both put in that little bit extra against Len, and he had to take it time after time... he had a poker face and never expressed either elation or disappointment. I tried my wickedest bumpers, hoping that I would have the satisfaction of seeing him look scared.|$|E
50|$|By far, most of {{the death}} and {{destruction}} in Carter County did not come at the hand of either Union or Confederate troops, but from bands of outlaws known as Jayhawkers and Bushwhackers respectively depending on whether they sympathized with {{the north of the}} south.

2500|$|Before their conquest in {{the fourth}} and third centuries BC, the Qin {{suffered}} several setbacks. Shang Yang was executed in 338 BC by King Huiwen due to a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> harboured from his youth. There was also internal strife over the Qin succession in 307 BC, which decentralised Qin authority somewhat. Qin was defeated by an alliance of the other states in 295 BC, and shortly after suffered another defeat {{by the state of}} Zhao, because the majority of their army was then defending against the Qi. The aggressive statesman Fan Sui (...) , however, soon came to power as prime minister even as the problem of the succession was resolved, and he began an expansionist policy that had originated in Jin and Qi, which prompted the Qin to attempt to conquer the other states.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2006, Rae {{applied for}} {{membership}} in the Liberal Party of Canada.

At his campaign launch he responded to his critics by saying, [...] "I made mistakes before I was in politics, I made mistakes when I was in politics, I made mistakes as premier...

2500|$|In 906, he {{was ordered}} west to the Aegean coast to join forces with the fleet under Himerios, in order to confront a large Arab naval expedition. Andronikos, however, was {{reluctant}} to comply, fearing for his safety: he had received letters from Constantinople warning him that Himerios had been given orders to seize and blind him. In fact, the chroniclers relate that these letters had been sent through the machinations of the eunuch Samonas, Leo's influential Arab-born chamberlain. Samonas bore a <b>personal</b> <b>grudge</b> against the Doukas family ever since Andronikos's son Constantine had seized him during an attempted flight to his native lands a few years earlier. The repeated pleas of Himerios to join him only made Andronikos more suspicious, and he firmly refused to board the former's flagship. In the event, Himerios departed with his own forces and on 6 October secured a major victory over the Arab fleet. At the news of this, Andronikos, fearing punishment for having disobeyed the Emperor's commands, withdrew east {{with his family and}} dependants and seized the fortress of Kaballa, near Iconium.|$|E

In November and December 2007, clashes between Murle and Dinke tribesmen had worsened to revenge attacks, killing over 34 people and injuring over 100. On one outbreak in late November 2007, eight Dinka tribesmen and 7,000 cattle were stole near the village of Padak, about 20 kilometres north-east of Bor. Many fled to the Kakuma Camp in northwestern Kenya, and they amounted to some 85 percent of the total 3,000 or so refugees reaching the camp.|$|R
50|$|In the {{television}} series Smallville The Vigilante Registrations Act (VRA) is proposed {{legislation that would}} require vigilantes to register themselves.

Despite the efforts of Darkseid and his minions to encourage anti-hero propaganda, the actions of the Justice League, Oliver Queen, and the pro-vigilante Senator Martha Kent - ironically aided by an assassination attempt arranged against Martha by a clone of Lex Luthor, which was based around his <b>personal</b> <b>grudges</b> against her son rather than the VRA - result in the Act being repealed and the heroes being permitted to return to their daily lives.|$|R
