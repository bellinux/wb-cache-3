In addition, the support of the use of public transport results in safety improvements through lower crash risks.

30|$|The {{first two}} {{measures}} {{are likely to}} have positive road-safety effects. First, the development of mass transit is likely to increase the use of public transportation over travel by car. This will improve road safety, because crash risk (per distance or per <b>person-trip)</b> is lower for public transportation in comparison with travel by car [5, 21]. Second, infrastructure support for mode-shifting freight from truck to rail or barge is likely to result in lower vehicle exposure on roads, which would have positive safety effects (e.g., [19]).|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{the support}} of bicycling and walking reduces road safety, because the risk of crashes (per {{distance}} or per <b>person-trip)</b> is higher for unprotected road users (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists) [5, 21]. One could assume that, {{in areas where the}} number of bicyclists is high and drivers are used to taking them into account, {{as is the case in}} the Netherlands, the crash risk of bicyclists could be lower if there were a high-standard infrastructure for bicycle use. However, the crash rate of bicyclists is higher than that of car occupants also in the Netherlands [55].|$|E

40|$|The General Aviation Airport Choice model {{developed}} estimates General Aviation (GA) <b>person-trips</b> {{and number}} of aircraft operations given trip demand {{in the form of}} GA person trips from counties.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the methods for {{estimating}} multimodal transportation impacts of urban land use development have improved substantially. One assumption commonly made in these new methods is that overall <b>person-trip</b> rates at similarly-sized establishments {{of the same}} land use do not vary across a region. This is an assumption of convenience to permit the adjustment of ITE Trip Generation vehicle trip rates for use in different urban environments. However, this assumption is inconsistent with theories of urban economics, which recognize that businesses pay a premium to locate in areas {{with high levels of}} accessibility to attract more customers. In addition, most transportation impact analyses have ignored income effects, even though socio-economics are a proven driver of travel behavior. To test this assumption and understand the effects of accessibility and income on levels of activity at the establishment level, we examine transaction counts for 97 grocery and convenience markets in Portland, Oregon. In a multilevel negative binomial regression, we test the relationship of regional accessibility, local accessibility, and income on weekly and daily transaction rates. While there was not enough evidence to suggest a significant relationship between accessibility and transaction rates, the results indicated a significant relationship with median income of the surrounding area. The implications point to the need to consider area-wide socio-demographics in site-level transportation impact analysis. The study also provides some important discussion about the use of transaction as a proxy for <b>person-trip</b> rates...|$|E

Data mining approach is used to systematically identify travel patterns. Aggregate logit model is used to describe the zonal shares of travel patterns, reflecting the stochastic characteristics of travel pattern choices. Structural equation model is adopted to represent not only the correlated structure of unobserved factors related to choice of travel patterns, but also the influence of complex cause-effect relationships in a much more sophisticatedly statistical and practical way. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model is then examined using <b>person-trip</b> data from 10 developing cities collected by JICA. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted in order to explore the similarities and differences among travel patterns in different cities...|$|E

We simulate the possible low carbon city by combining spatially explicit land use equilibrium (LUE) model and agent-based traffic model. First, land use scenarios of a city with different urban forms (compact and dispersed etc.) are created using the LUE model. Then the corresponding transportation is projected under each urban form with a large-scale traffic simulator for a case study city (Yokohama) in Japan. We also simulate the current traffic using the detailed <b>person-trip</b> data. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the urban form and the resulting CO 2 emission both from land use and transportation are estimated.

We developed new research methodologies using GPS and GIS tocollect <b>person-trip</b> data in regions where {{it is difficult to}} use questionnaires. By applyingthe methodology to research conducted in the Vientiane plain, Laos, we have found thatthis new methodology makes it possible to obtain detailed information about people's dailyactivities, specifically: what activities were carried out, at what time, where, and withwhom. The research site was Dongkhuwaai Village, Xaithany District, located about 30 kmby road from Vientiane. The villagers live traditionally, depending on rice crops in therainy season and use various natural resources. We analyzed their daily activities both inthe rainy season and in the dry season. As a result, we found that the daily activities of thevillagers had nature-related constraints.

40|$|There are 3, 091 {{counties}} in TSAM {{serving as the}} zones of travel activity in the continental United States. The trip-generation output {{is made up of}} two 3091 vectors: one for attractions and the other for pro-ductions for each county. Trip distribution fills up the cells between the vectors, creating a <b>person-trip</b> interchange table of demand between the two counties. Mode choice splits the demand between each county by mode of transportation. The mode choice model in TSAM and this paper estimates both the demand by mode between counties and the demand flows in the airport network associated with the counties. This is achieved by embedding an airport choice model in the mode choice model. Hence the model is both a mode choice and a partial trip assignment model. The framework for the process is shown in Figure 1. The modes of transportation considered in the TSAM model are commercial airline, automobile, SATS, and train. However, the focus in this paper is on the baseline model, which has only automobile and commercial airline modes. The trip assignment in TSAM involves converting the airport-to-airport person trips into aircraft operations, generating flights by using a time-of-day profile, and loading the flights on the National Airspace System to estimate the impact of aircraft operations in the system. The complete travel demand model is fully documented elsewhere (1 – 3). NASA is using TSAM to forecast future airport demands and assist the Joint Program Development Office (JPDO) in planning the next-generation air transportation system. NASA is also using TSAM to study demand for supersonic aircraft, tilt rotors, and short take-off and landing aircraft. This shows that the model is relevant and the output is critical to policy makers.

The QRS II model is one example of recent computer models intended for micro-computers, which may be useful for smaller cities with limited planning staff or computer capabilities. The main point {{is to be able to}} forecast the impacts of urban developments on highway traffic and the impacts of highway projects on travel pattern. QRS II determines the total number of <b>person-trips</b> generated by each zone of the study area. It accomplishes this step for three trip purposes: home-based work, home-based nonwork, nonhome-based trips. It then distributes these trips from any given origin zone to any given destination, converts highway <b>person-trips</b> to vehicle-trips and assigns them to the links in the highway network based on travel time, and finally split the number of <b>person-trips</b> between transit and automobiles. QRS II also was used to determine the impact of new construction on the surrounding street system. The purpose of the pro t was not to do a complete transportation study.

40|$|Urban {{transport}} emissions {{generated by}} automobile trips are greatly responsible for atmospheric pollution in both {{developed and developing}} countries. To match the long-term target of sustainable development, {{it seems to be}} important to specify the feasible level of car ownership and travel demand from environmental considerations. This research intends to propose an integrated modeling framework for optimal construction of a comprehensive transportation system by taking into consideration environmental constraints. The modeling system is actually a combination of multiple essential models and illustrated by using a bi-level programming approach. In the upper level, the maximization of both total car ownership and total number of trips by private and public travel modes is set as the objective function and as the constraints, the total emission levels at all the zones are set to not exceed the relating environmental capacities. Maximizing the total trips by private and public travel modes allows policy makers to take into account trip balance to meet both the mobility levels required by travelers and the environmentally friendly transportation system goals. The lower level problem is a combined trip distribution and assignment model incorporating traveler's route choice behavior. A logit-type aggregate modal split model is established to connect the two level problems. In terms of the solution method for the integrated model, a genetic algorithm is applied. A case study is conducted using road network data and <b>person-trip</b> (PT) data collected in Dalian city, China. The analysis results showed that the amount of environmentally efficient car ownership and number of trips by different travel modes could be obtained simultaneously when considering the zonal control of environmental capacity {{within the framework of the}} proposed integrated model.

40|$|Several travel {{indicators}} {{were compared}} between telecommuting (TC) days and non-telecommuting days for {{a sample of}} 72 center-based telecommuters in California. Distance traveled decreased significantly on TC days, with average reductions of 51 person-miles (58 %) and 35 vehicle-miles (53 %). When weighted by telecommuting frequency, average reductions of 11. 9 % in PMT and 11. 5 % in VMT were found over a five-day work week. <b>Person-trips</b> and vehicle-trips increased slightly (but not significantly) on TC days. This was due to statistically significant increases in commute trips by telecommuters (who more often went home for lunch on their TC days), partly counteracted by decreases in non-commute travel. The drive-alone mode share increased on TC days, both for all trips, and for commute trips in particular. Walking and biking shares also increased modestly on TC days, whereas shares of transit and ridesharing declined. Despite the increase in trip rates, TC-day reductions were found for all pollutants analyzed: 15 % for total organic gas emissions, 21 % for carbon monoxide, 35 % for oxides of nitrogen, and 51 % for particulate matter.

30|$|China {{is rapidly}} {{developing}} its urban rail transit (URT) networks. The Beijing URT network alone provides nearly 10, 000, 000 <b>person-trips</b> a day. The development of URT networks is increasing the trip distances and travel times of {{passengers on the}} networks. Consequently, there is a pedestrian congestion due to {{a drop in the}} service levels and increasing security risks. This study investigates the skip-stop operation strategy (SOS) as a means of solving these problems. The SOS can reduce the trip time of most passengers, while also improving the comfort and level of service, which can attract new passengers. More importantly, the problem of unexpected passenger flows needs to be solved for the complex system of popular urban transportation. In particular, the SOS has the ability to evacuate congested stations and temporarily add trains. In other words, the SOS increases the operating speed and the capacity of the URT system while also reducing trip times and the crowding of trains. However, the main issue relating to the SOS is the increased waiting time for passengers intending to board or alight at skipped stations. This is a source of confusion for passengers but the confusion could easily be resolved by providing in-depth information through, for example, broadcasts, guiding signs, and videos. With this background, the present study focuses on minimizing the travel costs for passengers and running trains.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It has {{recently}} been demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, that the average flow and density of some urban traffic networks is related by a unique, reproducible curve known as the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). For networks in which vehicles cannot adaptively re-route to avoid congestion, this relationship is robust only when there are few vehicles on the network. As these types of networks become more crowded, trips are completed {{at a much lower}} rate than predicted by MFD theory. Thus, operating a network in congestion is extremely damaging on these networks. The damage is particularly harmful for networks in which multiple modes operate mixed together because the more efficient modes, such as public transportation, suffer from the congestion created by other vehicles. This tends to happen in cities when infrastructure development has not caught up with economic development; one example that we have observed is Nairobi, Kenya. One way to increase efficiency is to exclusively dedicate more of the limited road space to these efficient modes so they can operate free of congestion. The remaining road space should be rationed by some means so that it does not become overcrowded. We show that segregating modes in this way allows the network to serve the same number of <b>person-trips</b> with fewer vehicles and no delay. We show that this can be accomplished by pricing the modes to ensure that users behave in a way that maximizes the productivity of the network and benefits everyone.

The number of <b>person-trips</b> has increased from 192 million in 1996 to almost 217 million in 2005 (a person trip is one person traveling 50 miles or more away from home, one way). Thus, the number of travelers visiting heritage/cultural events and attractions combined with their propensity to spend more money, make them a very attractive market segment {{for the state of}} North Dakota which is home {{to a wide variety of}} heritage and cultural attractions. The aim of this project was to assess the characteristics of visitors to North Dakota heritage and cultural tourism sites. Intercept surveys were conducted at three heritage/cultural tourism attractions. Visitors to North Dakota Cultural/Heritage tourism sites were most likely to be married, around 50 years old, with moderate incomes and well educated. They were most likely to find out about the attraction through friends or relatives, followed by the North Dakota State Tourism guide. Medora and the International Peace Garden were assumed to be primary destinations, whereas the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center visitors were likely on a trip elsewhere when they stopped by the site. A majority of Medora respondents had previously visited the site, as had the respondents from the International Peace Garden. Site characteristics and the fact that the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center is a newer site, make it less likely to have as many repeat visitors as the other two study locations. Almost all respondents were likely or very likely to recommend all the sites to others and overall respondents were very satisfied with their visit to the study locations. Most visitors learned about and received information about the attraction from friends or relatives. Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center and Medora visitors were more likely to participate in other activities while on their trip. Respondents to Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and Medora most frequently planned to participate in art/cultural attractions and pioneer/frontier history. Visitors to the International Peace Garden were not as likely to participate in other activities as visitors to the other study locations. Respondents had a positive perception of North Dakota. The most positive perception was of the state’s beautiful scenery, which correlates with what respondents indicated was their motivation for traveling. Respondents most frequently indicated they participated in leisure travel to enjoy scenery and for sightseeing.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 84 - 87). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. According to the U. S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, nearly 200 million <b>person-trips</b> over 100 miles one-way were taken by airplane in 1995, a 186 percent increase since 1977 (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 1998). As the popularity of air travel continues to increase, the number of trips to and from the airport will inevitably rise also. Passengers will need accurate information about all modes on a total trip basis. This includes the modes of access to and from the airport in addition to the long distance segment of the trip (Sverdrup & Parcel Consultants, Inc., et al., 1996). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the specific information needs of departing air travelers with regard to the pre-trip and en-route phases of their trip to the airport. Based on the results of this research, effective plans for providing supplementary information in support of ground-side travel can be developed by local, state, and national agencies. To gain an understanding of air passenger information needs, personal interviews were conducted with 216 passengers at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas. One major finding from this research was that in general, passengers are content with the existing types of real-time travel information that are available. Specifically, the survey results showed that passengers currently use and would prefer to have access to flight information including, confirmed schedules, flight delays, and gate assignments. It was also found that most passengers would prefer to receive travel information earlier in their trip (i. e., before beginning their trip). This could possibly be so that they have the information earlier in their decision-making process and thus would have adequate time to evaluate their options. Finally, based on the survey results, air passengers indicated they would prefer to use e-mail, pagers, telephones, and the Internet when making future travel information inquiries. In particular, business travelers were found to have a higher affinity toward e-mail and pagers, while younger travelers simply preferred newer technologies to receive travel information. As a result, these population categories are prime targets for marketing of information services. Overall, each of these findings was similar to and backed up the results from previous studies...|$|R
