50|$|<b>Progabide</b> (INN) (trade name Gabrene, Sanofi-Aventis) is an {{analogue}} and prodrug of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) used in {{the treatment}} of epilepsy. Via conversion into GABA, <b>progabide</b> behaves as an agonist of the GABAA, GABAB, and GABAA-ρ receptors.|$|E
50|$|Agonists: GABA, muscimol, <b>progabide,</b> gaboxadol, etc.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, Bartolini {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} <b>progabide's</b> actions on dopamine to be contradictory, decreasing dopamine release, dopamine receptor density and postsynaptic receptor responsivity to dopamine while reducing striatal cholinergic activity {{so as to}} increase dopaminergic effects. Bartholini and colleagues concluded that it was this that caused Parkinson's patients in human clinical trials to either see an improvement in their Parkinson's with a worsening of L-dopa dyskinesia or an improvement in dyskinesia but with sometimes aggravated Parkinson's symptoms. The cholinergic effect takes only a single injection to achieve in rats; when given with haloperidol, the development of tolerance to haloperidol's cataleptic effects did not develop. It was hoped {{that this would be}} effective for tardive dyskinesia. However, Soares, Rathbone and Deeks wrote in the 2004 issue of The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that [...] "Any possible benefits are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with their agents' use." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to being tested for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia, <b>progabide</b> was itself tested as an antipsychotic; as early as 1979, {{it was obvious that}} it was ineffective for psychosis. While <b>progabide</b> may have been devoid of antipsychotic effects, it did have the effect in schizoaffective and hebephrenic patients of improving environmental responsiveness and social interactions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Progabide</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} for many diseases besides epilepsy, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, clinical depression, anxiety disorder and spasticity with various levels of success.|$|E
50|$|<b>Progabide</b> is {{approved}} in France for either monotherapy or adjunctive {{use in the}} treatment of epilepsy - specifically, generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, partial, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizures - in both children and adults.|$|E
50|$|Tolgabide INN (SL-81.0142) {{is a drug}} {{which was}} {{patented}} by Synthélabo as an anticonvulsant but was never marketed. It is an analogue of <b>progabide</b> and acts similarly {{to it as a}} prodrug of GABA, and therefore as an indirect agonist of the GABA receptors.|$|E
40|$|A three way single blind {{cross-over}} {{comparison of}} <b>progabide,</b> valproate and placebo, as adjunctive therapy, was undertaken in 64 patients with therapy-resistant partial and generalised seizures. The {{study was not}} completed because of the incidence of elevated hepatic enzymes on <b>progabide.</b> Analysis of efficacy showed <b>progabide</b> to be inferior to valproate against all seizure types, particularly against tonic-clonic seizures. Valproate was superior to placebo against all seizure types, partial and tonic-clonic seizures. <b>Progabide</b> {{did not differ significantly}} from placebo in any instance. In addition <b>progabide</b> caused elevation of hepatic enzymes which was symptomatic in one case, and was associated with an interaction with phenytoin which resulted in symptoms of intoxication in some cases...|$|E

When either <b>progabide,</b> THIP or baclofen were adminis-tered with pentobarbital, {{the components of}} this combination interacted additively by the rotorod test. Combinations of pen-tobarbital and <b>progabide</b> or phenobarbital and <b>progabide</b> inter-acted additivaly when subjected to the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) minimal threshold seizure(clonic) test. TH 1 P, even at toxic doses, did not alter the anti-PTZ activity of either pentobarbital or phenobarbital. in contrast, baclofen at toxic doses potentiated the anti-PTZ activity of pentobarbital and phenobarbital.

40|$|<b>Progabide</b> and its {{immediate}} metabolite SL 75102 displace [3 H]gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), [3 H]muscimol and [3 H]isoguvacine from their binding sites to membranes prepared from rat brain or human cerebellum and increase (SL 75102) [3 H]flunitrazepam binding to rat cerebral cortex membranes. In contrast, these compounds have very weak or no effects on alpha or beta noradrenergic, histamine, muscarinic cholinergic or glycine receptors {{or on the}} [3 H]imipramine or [3 H]kainate binding sites. Neither <b>progabide</b> nor SL 75102 inhibit GABA synthesis, metabolism or uptake. Also, the uptake of norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine into synaptosomes of cerebral regions is not affected by <b>progabide.</b> [3 H]GABA release from substantia nigra slices is decreased by SL 75102 and <b>progabide,</b> {{in agreement with the}} hypothesis of a GABAergic autoreceptor controlling GABA release from its nerve terminals.

40|$|The {{effects in}} mice of {{administration}} of the anticonvulsants, <b>progabide,</b> sodium valproate, diazepam, carbamazepine and phenytoin on 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) -induced head-twitch, apomorphine-induced locomotion, clonidine-induced sedation, and beta-adrenoceptor and 5 -HT 2 receptor number have been examined. Repeated <b>progabide</b> administration (400 mg kg- 1, i. p. twice daily for 14 days) enhanced the head-twitch response the effect lasting for over 8 days after the last dose, and also increased 5 -HT 2 receptor number in frontal cortex. <b>Progabide</b> (400 mg kg- 1, i. p.) enhanced the head-twitch response when given once daily for 10 days and when given intermittently (5 times over 10 days) but not after 1 day of administration. Repeated Na valproate (400 mg kg- 1, i. p.) also increased the 5 -HTP-induced head-twitch response and 5 -HT 2 receptor number in the frontal cortex when given twice daily for 14 days, but no behavioural enhancement was seen after 10 days' treatment. Diazepam (1. 25 mg kg- 1, i. p.) twice daily for 14 days increased the head-twitch response and 5 -HT 2 receptor number. Repeated <b>progabide</b> and valproate (but not diazepam) administration attenuated the sedation response to the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0. 15 mg kg- 1) but neither drug altered beta-adrenoceptor number in the cerebral cortex. No changes in apomorphine-induced locomotor behaviour were seen after <b>progabide,</b> valproate or diazepam. Repeated carbamazepine (20 mg kg- 1) or phenytoin (40 mg kg- 1) administration failed to alter any of the biochemical or behavioural parameters listed above. Like repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS), <b>progabide</b> altered the head-twitch response, clonidine-induced sedation response and 5 -HT 2 receptor number. Unlike repeated ECS, it did not alter beta-adrenoceptor number or the apomorphine-induced locomotor response. These data suggest that ECS may produce some changes in monoamine function by altering GABA metabolism as has previously been postulated...|$|E
40|$|Rats discriminating Ro 15 – 1788 (10 mg/kg, i. p.) from vehicle {{completely}} generalized this cue to typical benzodizepines, {{and partially}} generalized it to barbiturates, pentylenetetrazol, CGS 8216, β-CCM and PK 8165. CL 218 872, Ro 5 – 4864, phenytoine, <b>progabide,</b> propranolol, yohimbine and various CNS stimulants predominantly induced vehicle-appropriate responding. Chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, CL 218 872, PK 8165, pentylenetetrazol, CGS 8216 and β-CCM failed {{to block the}} Ro 15 – 1788 cue. Generalization to both anxiolytics/anticonvulsants and anxiogenics/(pro) convulsants suggests that Ro 15 – 1788 has benzodiazepine agonist and inverse agonist properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{description of}} the conformation and tautomerism of the <b>progabide</b> molecule was performed employing the ab initio STO- 3 G and 3 - 21 G basis sets and a quantum chemical reaction field model for the consideration of the solvent influence. The calculations indicated a conformation with planar orientation of the A ring and considerable rotation of the B ring {{with respect to the}} imine bond as the most stable conformation. The consequences for conformation of hydrogen bond formation and breaking were examined. Predominance of the aromatic tautomer in apolar and the quinonoid tautomer in polar solvents is predicted...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that GABA {{is one of the}} {{important}} inhibitory chemical neurotransmitter substances in the central nervous system. Some neurochemical disorders, such as epileptic seizures, have been treated by reinforcement of the GABAergic transmission system. Recently we have studied the action of various GABA receptor modulators on induced seizures in El mice. An intraperitoneal injection of γ-vinyl GABA (a GABA transaminase blocker), 1500 mg/kg, completely inhibited El mouse seizures with significatly increased endogeneous GABA levels in the brain. Administration of 3 mg/kg of muscimol (a GABA agonist), i. p., completely inhibited the seizures with increased glutamine levels in the brain. Administration of 100 mg/kg of <b>progabide</b> (a GABA agonist), i. p., completely inhibited the seizures with no significant chnage in amino acids in the brain. An intraperitoneal injection of 32 mg/kg of diazepam completely inhibited the seizures with significantly increased glutamine levels in the brain. An intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg of baclofen (an agonist for the GABA receptor) blocked the seizures with decreased levels of GABA, glutamic acid and alanine in the brain. These results suggest that inhibition of E 1 mouse seizures may depend on an increased GABA level in the case of γ-vinyl GABA, on the action of a GABA receptor agonist in the case of muscimol and <b>progabide,</b> on the reinforcement of GABA receptor binding through benzodiazepine receptor in the case of diazepam, and on the action of a GABA(B) receptor agonist in the case of baclofen...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to study the {{relationship}} between different neurotransmitter systems and seizure susceptibility in Mongolian gerbils with genetically determined epilepsy. In these animals, generalized tonic-clonic seizures were induced by stim-ulation with a blast of compressed air. A variety of drugs that specifically manipulate inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitter systems proved capable of dose dependently blocking these seizures, i. e., the anticholinergic drug biperiden (EDro 12 mg/kg i. p.), the excitatory amino acid antagonist (±) - 2 -amino- 7 -phos-phonoheptanoic acid (1 20 mg/kg), the ‘y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists muscimol (0. 66 mg/kg), 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisox-azolo(5, 4 -c) pyridine- 3 -ol (1. 3 mg/kg), <b>progabide</b> (50 mg/kg) and its acidic metabolite SL 751 02 (45 mg/kg), the GABA aminotrans-ferase inhibitors aminooxyacetic acid (0. 9 mg/kg), y-acetylenic GABA (2. 1 mg/kg) and ethanolamine-O-sulfate (1 000 mg/kg) ...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{administration}} of the beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor ligand FG 7142 produces sensitization to its effects so that full seizures develop (chemical kindling); initially it is only pro-convulsant. The present study investigated alterations in the function of drugs which act at the different sites at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptor complex, after repeated {{administration of}} FG 7142. In FG 7142 kindled mice decreased anticonvulsant and hypothermic effects of the GABA agonist muscimol were observed. The hypothermic effects of the GABA agonist <b>progabide</b> were reduced. In contrast a small increase in the hypothermic effect of pentobarbitone was seen. The convulsant effects of bicuculline and picrotoxin were unaltered when they were given intravenously but marginally increased when they were given by the intraperitoneal route. No changes were seen in the hypothermic effects of these drugs. No significant changes were seen in the convulsant or hypothermic effects of pentylenetetrazol. These results suggest that kindling with FG 7142 may alter GABA receptor function...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} baclofen, the GABAB-agent, on the potassium-evoked release of {{endogenous}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) from slices of mouse frontal cortex has been investigated. The release of endogenous 5 -HT evoked by addition of K+ (35 mM) was inhibited by (+/-) -baclofen in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 0. 1 microM. Inhibition of K+-evoked release of 5 -HT {{was produced by}} (+/-) - and (-) -baclofen but not (+) -baclofen. This action of the (-) -enantiomer was not altered {{by the presence of}} the (+) -enantiomer. Addition of GABA (0. 1 - 10 microM) also induced a dose-dependent inhibition of 5 -HT release. This effect was neither enhanced by flurazepam (1 microM) nor antagonized by bicuculline (10 microM). The <b>progabide</b> metabolite, 4 -[((4 -chlorophenyl) (5 -fluoro- 2 -hydroxyphenyl) methylene]amino) butyric acid (SL 75. 102) (1 microM) inhibited the K+-evoked release of 5 -HT by 61 %. These data suggest that baclofen is a potent inhibitor of the K+-evoked release of endogenous 5 -HT from the cortex and further indicate that the release of 5 -HT may be controlled by a GABAB-receptor located presynaptically...|$|E
40|$|Systemic (s. c.) {{administration}} of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) in mice triggered clonic convulsions with a CD 50 (convulsive dose) of 68 mg/kg (range 54 - 86). AOAA also induced clonic convulsions in mice subjected to intracerebroventricular {{administration of}} the drug with a CD 50 of 0. 04 -mu-mol (range 0. 028 - 0. 06). At the onset of convulsions induced by systemic AOAA (CD 97; 150 mg/kg), the GAD activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was not affected. GABA mimetic drugs, <b>progabide</b> and gabaculine, {{had no effect on}} convulsions induced by AOAA. Convulsions induced by systemic administration of AOAA were blocked by diazepam, phenobarbital, and valproate. Ethosuximide, trimethadione, acetazolamide, diphenylhydantoin, and carbamazepine remained ineffective. L-Phenylisopropyladenosine was also found to protect mice against AOAA-induced convulsions, whereas atropine and baclofen had no effect. the seizures induced by intracerebroventricular administration of AOAA (CD 97; 0. 1 -mu-mol) were blocked by coadministration of preferential N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, D-(-) - 2 -aminophosphonoheptanoic (AP 7), 3 -((+/-) - 2 -carboxypiperazin- 4 -yl) -propyl- 1 -phosphonic (CPP), and kynurenic acid (KYNA); preferential quisqualate/kainate antagonists, 6 -cyano- 7 -nitro-quinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione and gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulphonic acid, remained inactive in the range of dosages sufficient to block seizures induced by quisqualic acid or kainic acid. The antagonistic action of antiepileptic drugs effective against seizures induced by excitatory amino acids (diazepam and valproate), and drugs acting on excitatory amino acid receptors (AP 7, CPP, and KYNA) upon seizures induced by AOAA suggests an involvement of excitatory neurotransmission in the convulsant action of the drug.

40|$|This {{systematic}} review aimed to collate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of various interventions {{used to treat}} tardive dyskinesia (TD) and, where appropriate, to combine the data for mete-analysis, Clinical trials were identified by electronic searches, handsearches and contact with principal investigators. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, for outcomes related to improvement, deterioration, side-effects and drop out rates. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio (fixed effect model). For treatments that had significant effects, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. From 296 controlled clinical trials, data were extracted from 47 trials. For most interventions, we could identify no RCT-derived evidence of efficacy. A meta-analysis showed that baclofen, deanol and diazepam were no more effective than a placebo. Single RCTs demonstrated a lack of evidence of any effect for bromocriptine, ceruletide, clonidine, estrogen, gamma linolenic acid, hydergine, lecithin, lithium, <b>progabide,</b> seligiline and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol. The meta-analysis found that five interventions were effective: L-dopa, oxypertine, sodium valproate, tiapride and vitamin E; neuroleptic reduction was marginally significant. Data from single RCTs revealed that insulin, alpha methyl dopa and reserpine were more effective than a placebo. There was a significantly increased risk of adverse events associated with baclofen, deanol, L-dopa, oxypertine and reserpine. Metaanalysis {{of the impact of}} placebo (n= 485) showed that 37. 3 % of participants showed an improvement. Interpretation of this {{systematic review}} requires caution as the individual trials identified tended to have small sample sizes. For many compounds, data from only one trial were available, and where meta-analyses were possible, these were based on a small number of trials. Despite these concerns, the review facilitated the interpretation of the large and diverse range of treatments used for TD. Clinical recommendations for the treatment of TD are made, based on the availability of RCT-derived evidence, the strength of that evidence and the presence of adverse effects.
