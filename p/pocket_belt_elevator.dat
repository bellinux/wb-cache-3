40|$|The Automated Product Delivery System (APDS) was {{developed}} to address a need in industrial manufacturing for {{a simple way to}} transfer materials between areas of a manufacturing environment. At the moment, most equipment used for such a task consist of some type of fixed system, such as conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>elevators,</b> etc. While adequate, they are not easily adaptable to any changes in their environment. Therefore, an automated unit would seem to be more successful in such an application...|$|R

It was operated {{in conjunction with the}} original elevator. Both elevators went to the Alberta Wheat Pool in 1972. There was a fourth elevator at Raley, an Alberta Pool Elevator 40,000 bushel house built in 1929. This elevator disappears from the records by the late 1930s. The Sunny belt and A.g. Robertson elevators were demolished sometime after 1972.|$|R
5000|$|Material {{transport}} elevators generally {{consist of}} an inclined plane {{on which a}} conveyor belt runs. The conveyor often includes partitions {{to ensure that the}} material moves forward. These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications. When such mechanisms (or spiral screws or pneumatic transport) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos, the entire structure is called a grain <b>elevator.</b> <b>Belt</b> <b>elevators</b> are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal, iron ore and grain into the holds of bulk carriers ...|$|R

50|$|In its {{original}} form, {{it was common}} issue to soldiers from the 16th century to the 18th century, and contained either pre-packed chargers, small containers of wood, metal or cloth containing the measured amount of gunpowder for a single shot with muzzle-loading muskets or other guns, or early forms of cartridges also containing a ball. It might also carry grenades or other accessories for shooting. Any bag worn in the same style may also {{be described as a}} bandolier bag; similarly, ammunition holding <b>pocketed</b> <b>belts</b> worn round the waist may also be called bandoliers.|$|R

50|$|The Alberta Pacific {{elevator}} at Raley was {{the first}} of a number of elevators operating by 1911. It {{is the only one that}} has survived, probably because it is now in private hands. By 1911 there were two other elevators at Raley, one was a 30,000 bushel elevator built by A.G. Robertson and the other a 15,000 bushel elevator operated by Sunny <b>Belt</b> Grain <b>Elevator</b> Co. Ltd. This was upgraded to a 30,000 bushel house in 1917.|$|R

50|$|The {{new plant}} also {{included}} two elevators of steel construction and a 30 feet by 4 feet picking belt. The picking belt {{was used to}} facilitate the removal, by hand, of rock from the coal. Oversized pieces of coal could also be manually crushed with hammers. Elsewhere, skip haulage and hand-picking became obsolete but at Acland these methods continued to be used until the mine's closure. The elevators were used to convey the processed coal {{to the top of}} the hoppers for loading into train wagons. The picking <b>belt</b> and <b>elevators</b> survive intact at the mine.|$|R

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have paid considerable {{attention to the}} dynamics of mechanical structures due to rain, wind, earthquake, machines and traffic-induced vibrations. These vibrations in mechanical structures are of great importance because of their impact on our life. The Tacoma Narrow suspension bridge is a well-known example of a structural collapse because of wind. The motion of mechanical structures, such as the vibrations of suspension bridges, overhead transmission lines, dynamically loaded helocal springs, conveyor <b>belts</b> and <b>elevator</b> cables, can be expressed as initial-boundary value problems for wave or beam equations. The main objective of this poster is to study boundary reflection and damping properties of waves in semi-infinite strings. Research focus: understanding of how waves are damped and reflected by these boundaries, and how much energy is dissipated at the boundary...|$|R
