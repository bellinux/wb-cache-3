25|$|Games of hurling {{were played}} every weekend until 1914 and {{received}} frequent coverage from Argentina's Spanish language newspapers, such as La Nación. After {{the outbreak of}} World War I, it became almost impossible to obtain hurleys from Ireland. An {{attempt was made to}} use native Argentine mountain ash, but it proved too heavy and lacking in <b>pliability.</b> Although the game was revived {{after the end of the}} war, the golden age of Argentine hurling had passed. World War II finally brought the era to its close.|$|E
25|$|However, many growers, traders, and {{consumers}} reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic {{method of sampling}} batches of threads for taste, aroma, <b>pliability,</b> and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters. However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.|$|E
25|$|When {{friction}} ridges {{come into}} contact with a surface that will take a print, material that is on the friction ridges such as perspiration, oil, grease, ink or blood, will be transferred to the surface. Factors which affect the quality of friction ridge impressions are numerous. <b>Pliability</b> of the skin, deposition pressure, slippage, the material from which the surface is made, the roughness of the surface and the substance deposited {{are just some of the}} various factors which can cause a latent print to appear differently from any known recording of the same friction ridges. Indeed, the conditions surrounding every instance of friction ridge deposition are unique and never duplicated. For these reasons, fingerprint examiners are required to undergo extensive training. The scientific study of fingerprints is called dermatoglyphics.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{struggle}} between Protestant factions injured the advancement of their mutual interests, and Bucer, encouraged by Philip, was accordingly occupied {{in the attempt to}} bring Protestants together on a common religious platform, the result being the Wittenberg Concord. The emperor's fears as to the political purpose of the league were, for the time being, set aside, {{but at the same time}} a council which would include representatives of the pope was rejected and measures were taken to secure the permanence of the Protestant cause in the future. In 1538–39 relations between Roman Catholics and Protestants became strained almost to the breaking-point, and war was averted only by the Frankfort Respite. The Protestants, however, failed to avail themselves of their opportunities, largely through the extreme docility and <b>pliability</b> of Philip.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, a {{football}} {{of the kind}} used at Rugby School was exhibited at the first World's Fair, the Great Exhibition in London. This ball can still be seen at the Webb Ellis Rugby Football Museum {{and it has a}} definite ovoid shape. In 1862, Richard Lindon introduced rubber bladders and, because of the <b>pliability</b> of the rubber, balls could be manufactured with a more pronounced shape. As an oval ball was easier to handle, a gradual flattening of the ball continued over the years as the emphasis of the game moved towards handling and away from dribbling. In 1892, the RFU included compulsory dimensions for the ball {{for the first time in}} the Laws of the Game. In the 1980s, leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials.|$|E
25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail {{pull out of the}} frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and <b>pliability,</b> giving it the highest possible strength.|$|E

2500|$|The {{succession}} of wardens {{added to the}} low morale of both guards and prisoners. [...] Appointed by the Governor of Montana for their <b>pliability,</b> ease of placement, and political stature, the wardens of the prison rarely had law enforcement experience, and none had penal institution experience. [...] Unfortunately, due to Conley's aggressive control of the facility, most of {{the administration of the}} prison rested {{in the hands of the}} warden, including the hiring and firing of guards, requests for new building permits from the state, and most of the parole functions of the institution. [...] In fact, a parole board was not instituted until 1955. [...] Many of the wardens, like A.B. Middleton, tried to better the facility, but those who did often failed. [...] Middleton, who held the position from 1925 to 1937, oversaw all the new construction, but he did little to ease the strain of overpopulation and low morale. [...] Possibly the least effective warden to hold the office was Faye O. Burrell, who was warden from 1953 to 1958. [...] Burrell had been a Ravalli County sheriff before his tenure, and was a man who prided himself on his frugality. [...] The state actually increased funding to the prison during his time, but Burrell decreased his implementation of funds, allowing money slated for updating facilities to go back into general state funds. [...] His wardenship of the prison weathered two riots, and he resigned under heavy controversy.|$|E

There must in every machine be a part that moves and a part that stands still; there must be in everything that changes a part that is unchangeable.

Much of what is called her subservience, and even her <b>pliability,</b> is merely the subservience and <b>pliability</b> of a universal remedy; she varies as medicines vary, with the disease.

60|$|Some persons prepare {{bread for}} the oven by simply mixing {{it in the}} mass, without kneading, pouring it into pans, and {{suffering}} it to rise there. The air-cells in bread thus prepared are coarse and uneven; the bread is as inferior in delicacy and nicety to that which is well kneaded as a raw Irish servant to a perfectly educated and refined lady.

60|$|It {{was this}} sense of not being free, of having gained {{everything}} but freedom that was at times galling in the extreme: {{this sense of}} living with a woman for whom I had long ceased to care, {{a woman with a}} baffling will concealed beneath an unruffled and serene exterior. At moments I looked at her across the table; she did not seem to have aged much: her complexion was as fresh, apparently, as the day when I had first walked with her in the garden at Elkington; her hair the same wonderful colour; perhaps she had grown a little stouter. There could be no doubt about the fact that her chin was firmer, that certain lines had come into her face indicative of what is called character. Beneath her <b>pliability</b> she was now all firmness; the <b>pliability</b> had become a mockery. It cannot be said that I {{went so far as to}} hate her for this,--when it was in my mind,--but my feelings were of a strong antipathy. And then again there were rare moments when I was inexplicably drawn to her, not by love and passion; I melted a little in pity, perhaps, when my eyes were opened and I saw the tragedy, yet I am not referring now to such feelings as these.

60|$|The {{effect of}} this freshly-important ridicule on the {{sensitive}} mind of Cass might have been foretold by Blazing Star had it ever taken that sensitiveness into consideration.

He had at first affected amusement over his own vanished day dream--hiding his virgin disappointment in his own breast; but {{when he began to}} turn upon his feelings he turned upon his comrades also. Cass was for a while unpopular. There is no ingratitude so revolting to the human mind as that of the butt who refuses to be one any longer.

You, my dear sister, are the noblest of women, and your place in my heart is still what it always was; but I feel that this dear little creature, while she fills a place no other has ever entered, will yet be a new bond to unite us. She will love us both; she will gradually come into all our ways and opinions, and be insensibly formed by us into a noble womanhood. Her extreme beauty, and the great admiration that has always followed her, have exposed her to many temptations, and caused most ungenerous things to be said of her.|$|E

Munificent without assumption, successful without pride, he obliged {{with grace and}} shone with safety. People enjoyed his hospitality, for they {{knew that it was}} disinterested; and admired his acquirements, for they felt that they were unobtrusive. Sometimes (as in his dialogue with the Cynic) the whim of the moment, or the sting of a sarcasm, drew from him a hint at his station, or a display of his eccentricities; but, as he was always the first soon afterwards to lead the laugh at his own outbreak, his credit as a noble suffered nothing by his infirmity as a man. Gaily and attractively he moved in all grades of the society of his age, winning his social laurels in every rank, without making a rival to dispute their possession, or an enemy to detract from their value.|$|E

No one, who has deeply seated opinions of right and wrong, will ever abandon them, even in the courtesies of polite intercourse: they may be silent but never acquiescent: in short, my dear, the dread of offending our Maker ought to be so superior to that of offending our fellow creatures, that we should endeavor, I believe, {{to be even more}} unbending to the follies of the world than we are." ...|$|E

In his nature, there is the fatal <b>pliability</b> which finds companionable qualities in bad friends. In this aspect of his character, he is a dangerous man--and he may be (forgive me!) a bad husband. It is a thankless task to warn you to any good purpose. A wife--and a loving wife more than another--feels the deteriorating influence of a husband who is not worthy of her. His ways of thinking are apt to become, little by little, her ways of thinking.

60|$|But if {{the case}} was modern what it held was not. Within, on a cushion of cloth of gold as fine as silk, and with the {{peculiar}} softness of old gold, rested a mummy hand, so perfect that it startled one to see it. A woman's hand, fine and long, with slim tapering fingers and nearly as perfect as when {{it was given to}} the embalmer thousands of years before. In the embalming it had lost nothing of its beautiful shape; even the wrist seemed to maintain its <b>pliability</b> as the gentle curve lay on the cushion. The skin was of a rich creamy or old ivory colour; a dusky fair skin which suggested heat, but heat in shadow. The great peculiarity of it, as a hand, was that it had in all seven fingers, there being two middle and two index fingers. The upper end of the wrist was jagged, {{as though it had been}} broken off, and was stained with a red-brown stain. On the cushion near the hand was a small scarab, exquisitely wrought of emerald.|$|E

But before she could attenuate in any way the crudity of her collapse he gave an impatient jerk which took him to the window. She heard a vehicle stop; Beale looked out; then he freshly faced her. He still said nothing, but she knew the Countess had come back. There was a silence again between them, but with a different shade of embarrassment from that of their united arrival; and it was still without speaking that, abruptly repeating one of the embraces of which he had already been so prodigal, he whisked her back to the lemon sofa just before the door of the room was thrown open. It was thus in renewed and intimate union with him that she was presented to a person whom she instantly recognised as the brown lady.|$|E

He was a strong-made fellow, with a bright, intelligent, good-humoured face, like that of his father. Next to him sat little Matt Quintal, rather heavy and stupid in expression, but quiet and peaceable in temperament, like his mother. Next came Daniel McCoy, whose sharp sparkling countenance seemed the very embodiment of mischief, in which quality he resembled his father. Fortunately for little Dan, his mother was the gentlest and most unselfish of all the native women, and these qualities, transmitted to her son, were the means of neutralising the evil which he inherited from his father. After him came Elizabeth Mills, whose pretty little whitey-brown face was the counterpart of her mother's in expression. Indeed, all of these little ones inherited in a great degree that sweet <b>pliability</b> of character for which the Otaheitan women were, and we believe still are, famous.

One {{afternoon}} in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, {{because she had}} a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing <b>pliability</b> on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to her [...] "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.

60|$|Never {{was the old}} {{conventional}} maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly contradicted--never was {{the fair}} promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the face and head that crowned it. The lady's complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her upper lip was almost a moustache. She had a large, firm, masculine mouth and jaw; prominent, piercing, resolute brown eyes; and thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead. Her expression--bright, frank, and intelligent--appeared, while she was silent, to be altogether wanting in those feminine attractions of gentleness and <b>pliability,</b> without which {{the beauty of the}} handsomest woman alive is beauty incomplete. To see such a face as this set on shoulders that a sculptor would have longed to model--to be charmed by the modest graces of action through which the symmetrical limbs betrayed their beauty when they moved, and then to be almost repelled by the masculine form and masculine look of the features in which the perfectly shaped figure ended--was to feel a sensation oddly akin to the helpless discomfort familiar to us all in sleep, when we recognise yet cannot reconcile the anomalies and contradictions of a dream.|$|E
