5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical {{evidence}} for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E

In the sixth chapter she <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> in order to love we must let go of obsessions with power and domination as a culture. In the seventh chapter she <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> we must place love above materialism. In the eighth chapter she <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> a sense of community and belonging is essential to feel loved and desire to give love.

40|$|Abstract We <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> {{cognition}} is {{more than}} a collection of independent processes operating in a modular cognitive system. Instead, we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> cognition emerges from dependencies between all of the basic systems in the brain, including goal management, perception, action, memory, reward, affect, and learning. Furthermore, human cognition reflects its social evolution and context, as well as contributions from a developmental process. After presenting these themes, we illustrate their application to the process of anticipation. Specifically, we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> anticipations occur extensively across domains (i. e., goal management, perception, action, reward, affect, and learning) in coordinated manners. We also <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> anticipation is central to situated action and to social interaction, and that many of its key features reflect the process of development...|$|R
30|$|PCI is {{a disease}} that forms {{gas-filled}} cysts in the submucosa and subserosa of the intestinal tract [1]. The disease was first reported by Du Vernoi et al. in 1730 [2]. The etiology, however, remains unknown. Four major hypotheses have currently been proposed: (1) the mechanical theory, <b>proposing</b> <b>that</b> gas enters the digestive tract walls through mucosal injury in association with increased luminal pressure [3]; (2) the bacterial theory, <b>proposing</b> <b>that</b> gas-producing bacteria may cause intramural gas-filled cysts [4]; (3) the chemical theory, <b>proposing</b> <b>that</b> chronic exposure to chemicals, such as trichloroethylene, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, or steroids, may impair {{the integrity of the}} mucosa [5]; and (4) the lung theory, <b>proposing</b> <b>that</b> the intramural bowel gas may originate from pneumomediastinum caused by alveolar rupture in cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [6].|$|R

5|$|In 1974 RobertA.Martin <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> {{the large}} North American wolf C.armbrusteri (Armbruster's wolf) was C.lupus. Nowak, Kurten, and Annalisa Berta <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> C.dirus was not derived from C.lupus. In 1987, a new {{hypothesis}} <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> a mammal population could {{give rise to}} a larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciationa process by which a new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of C.dirus in North America and, judging from the similarities in their skull shapes, that C.lupus had given rise to the C.dirus hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.|$|E
40|$|We <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> {{cognition}} is {{more than}} a collection of independent processes operating in a modular cognitive system. Instead, we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> cognition emerges from deep dependencies between all of the basic systems in the brain, including goal management, perception, action, reward, affect, and learning. We also believe that human cognition greatly reflects its social evolution and context, as well as major contributions from a developmental process. After presenting these themes, we illustrate their application to the process of anticipation. Specifically, we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> anticipations occur extensively across domains (i. e., goal management, perception, action, reward, affect, and learning) in highly coordinated manners.

5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests.
