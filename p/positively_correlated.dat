5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and {{some argue that}} the opposite {{seems to be the}} case. A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S. Paul found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with social ills like crime. The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how an individual’s {{religion}} relates to their time orientation. Specifically, we hypothesized a) intrinsic orientation would <b>positively</b> <b>correlate</b> with future orientation, b) extrinsic orientation would <b>positively</b> <b>correlate</b> with present hedonistic orientation, c) quest orientation would <b>positively</b> <b>correlate</b> with present hedonistic and future orientations, d) orthodox orientation would <b>positively</b> <b>correlate</b> with past positive orientation, and e) secularism would <b>positively</b> <b>correlate</b> with past negative orientation, present-fatalistic and future orientations. Participants (n = 150) completed an online survey of time orientation and religious orientation. The results showed that perceptions of the past are strongly linked to religious orientation, with more positive perceptions being linked to the more traditional orientations, and less positive perceptions linked to the looser and secularist orientations...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings {{during times of}} economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not {{come into contact with}} the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes to}} test the {{following}} three hypotheses: perceived political efficacy <b>positively</b> <b>correlates</b> with self-esteem; self-esteem <b>positively</b> <b>correlates</b> with perceived democratic parental attitude; and, lastly, self-esteem negatively correlates with perceived protective-demanding and perceived authoritarian parental attitudes. Two questionnaires (Q 1 and Q 2), each measure perceived political efficacy, selfesteem,and perceived parental attitudes. In Q 2, the items of self-esteem and perceived parental attitude scales have been kept in their original forms whereas in Q 1, the items of those scales have been modified to fit questionnaire design. Two groups each have been selected {{as a result of}} multi-stage stratified sampling of the Sabancı University undergraduate population. Participants (G 1 and G 2) are composed of those who have responded to the e-mail invitations sent to the two groups to complete the web-based questionnaires (Q 1 or Q 2). The results reveal that perceived political efficacy <b>positively</b> <b>correlates</b> with self-esteem for both G 1 and G 2. Concerning the relation of self-esteem to perceived parental attitudes, the findings show that perceived democratic parental attitudes <b>positively</b> <b>correlate</b> with self-esteem for both G 1 and G 2. Perceived protective-demanding mother’s attitude significantly and negatively correlates with self-esteem for only G 2. Furthermore, perceived authoritarian mother’s and father’s attitudes also negatively and significantly correlate with self-esteem for only G 2. The attempt to look for a connection between a certain political attitude and a personality quality, in addition to the connection between a personality quality and perceived parental attitudes, indicates a two-step approach to political socialization which combines personality approach to political behavior with the social-cognitive approach to personality...|$|R
