40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{development}} of a graphical user interface for real-time monitoring of electrocardiographic signals. Our main goal was to design, implement and evaluate the graphical user interface. We developed a graphical user interface which allows us to browse, add, edit and delete patients in the patient's database. It also allows us to assign the measurement devices to the patients. It supports real-time displaying of electrocardiographic curves and alarm notifications in case of patient's critical states. For best visibility we used bright vivid colors and flashing background. Past measurements can be viewed and printed. <b>Past</b> <b>alarms</b> are stored and accessible for examination. Development took place in several iterations of the spiral user interface design model. In our work we followed basic principles and guidelines for user interface design, especially 10 Nielsen's design principles. Subset of functionalities for each iteration has been validated against usability heuristics. The developed graphical user interface was submitted to user testing in a real clinical environment in Dr. Franc Derganec general hospital in Nova Gorica. We updated the graphical user interface {{in collaboration with the}} medical staff. The graphical user interface was developed in Qt 3. x programming environment. It runs on several platforms and operating systems and was developed and tested in KDE graphical environment of LINUX OS...|$|E

60|$|Here, then, {{there was}} a {{cessation}} from toil, from hunger, and <b>alarm.</b> <b>Past</b> ills and dangers were forgotten. The hunt, the game, the song, the story, the rough though good-humored joke, made time pass joyously away, and plenty and security reigned throughout the camp.|$|R
60|$|Two figures stood {{under the}} window. Mr. Kendal, {{who was holding}} the little inanimate form in his arms for the doctor to examine, looking up as she entered, cast on her a look of mute, pleading, despairing agony, that was as the {{bitterness}} of death. She sprang forward herself to clasp her child, and her husband yielded him in broken-hearted pity, {{but at that moment}} the little limbs moved, the features worked, the eyes unclosed, and clinging tightly to her, as she strained him to her bosom, the little fellow proclaimed himself alive by lusty roars, more welcome than any music. Partly stunned, and far more terrified, he had been in a sort of swoon, without breath to cry, till recalled to himself by feeling his mother's arms around him. Every attempt of Mr. Bowles to ascertain whether he were uninjured produced such a fresh panic and renewal of screams, that she begged that he might be left to her. Mr. Kendal took the doctor away, and gradually the terror subsided, though the long convulsive sobs still quivered up through the little frame, and as the twilight darkened on her, she had time to realize the <b>past</b> <b>alarm,</b> and rejoice in trembling over the treasure still her own.|$|R

The Ottoman {{government}} was uninterested in Süleyman's <b>past,</b> but was <b>alarmed</b> on who the perpetrators were {{and if they}} would continue. It was quickly determined that it was Spiro Crne who had formed a band and killed Süleyman. A powerful manhunt was sent, but the band had disappeared without traces.|$|R
50|$|The first scroll {{is hidden}} inside a statue in the Brooklyn Museum. The foursome sneaks <b>past</b> mortal <b>alarm</b> systems, magical wards and a late-night wedding to {{retrieve}} the scroll. Their cover is blown when the scroll bursts into flames, a griffin escapes from a frieze and evil spirits attack the wedding guests. Jaz imprisons the spirits in the Duat (a supernatural world that exists beneath the physical world) but uses too much magic and slips into a coma. One of the spirits tells Carter that his friend Zia will die if he continues the quest. Zia is a magician from the House of Life, which is an ancient society that dates {{to the time of}} the pharaohs.|$|R
5000|$|Commodities trader Raymond Learsy, {{author of}} Over a Barrel: Breaking the Middle East Oil Cartel, contends that OPEC has trained {{consumers}} {{to believe that}} oil {{is a much more}} finite resource than it is. To back his argument, he points to <b>past</b> false <b>alarms</b> and apparent collaboration. He also believes that peak oil analysts have conspired with OPEC and the oil companies to create a [...] "fabricated drama of peak oil" [...] to drive up oil prices and profits; oil had risen to a little over $30/barrel at that time. A counter-argument was given in the Huffington Post after he and Steve Andrews, co-founder of ASPO, debated on CNBC in June 2007.|$|R

Ever since the troubles had began, she had felt the loneliness of her position as a Protestant, and she would have, long before, made her way with her daughter to Dublin, {{had it not been}} that she thought that, so long as she continued in the house, it might be respected by the Catholic peasantry, while, were she to desert it, it would probably be plundered, perhaps burned to the ground. Still, the position was a very trying one, especially since the Jacobite army began to gather in force round Limerick.|$|R

40|$|In the <b>past</b> five years, <b>alarm</b> fatigue—desensitization to alarms—has {{consecutively}} been {{ranked as}} one of the top safety hazards for patient care. Alarm fatigue often leads to the failure to recognize the alarm due to constant exposure as well as a 2 ̆ 2 cry wolf 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon in which a large majorette are false positives. Using Lewin 2 ̆ 7 s Change Theory and Orlando 2 ̆ 7 s Deliberative Nursing Process Theory, a change in the approach toward alarm management is necessary for the safety and wellbeing of the patient. Evidence suggests the importance of patient specific alarm parameters, daily electrode changes and proper electrode care, daily evaluations of monitor parameters, inclusion of inaudible text messages, and delays in vital sign parameters. A policy should be implemented and a formal educational program should be instilled at hospital institutions in order to decrease alarm desensitization amongst nurses and the safety concerns that ensue...|$|R
5000|$|The Jolly Roger {{continued}} {{as a popular}} dancehall and restaurant. It was designated a Seattle Historic Landmark in 1979. On 19 October 1989, the restaurant, located at 8721 Lake City Way (formerly Bothell Way) burned in an arson fire. The fire was somewhat suspicious, but only relative to its storied past. [...] Police had neither motive nor suspects. Investigators {{were not able to}} determine how the arsonist got inside <b>past</b> a burglar <b>alarm,</b> with no signs of forced entry. At the time, the building had just been purchased the week before from the previous owner, with whom the buyer was entangled in legal and financial red tape. The previous owner was in the building removing his possessions the day before the fire. When firefighters arrived hours after the fire had begun in the basement, a man directed them. He seemed so sure of where the fire began that they assumed he was an employee. After the fire was extinguished, the man could not be found. The owners stated that he was not an employee.|$|R

Annoyed at the publication of the new treaty with [...] France in the Belgian papers, it being part of the scheme of his [...] finance measure. Feb. 8.—Gladstone drove out to-day; bent on [...] speaking the day after to-morrow. Ferguson allows him. I again [...] protested. Feb. 9.—Saw Gladstone; he is better.

40|$|The world’s {{biodiversity}} is in crisis. With this, our highly diverse {{land snails}} {{are of particular}} extinction concern globally. Pacific Island land snail diversity is significant because of its high levels of endemism and also it’s <b>alarming</b> <b>past</b> extinction record. We examined the widely scattered literature relating to Fiji’s native land snails. From the resulting information we determined priority snail groups {{that are likely to}} be in need of conservation action to prevent extinction. One of these groups is the relatively large placostylid snails which are not only endemic to the Oceania region but have several regional members that are already IUCN red-listed as endangered or extinct. Based on existing literature dating back over 100 years we have determined that Fiji has fourteen recorded endemic species of Placostylus snails, of which eight are recorded only on a single island. All species are closely associated with forest habitats, none of which has ever been studied ecologically or assessed for its conservation status. We are currently in the process of finalizing IUCN redlisting assessments for these fourteen species and are about to begin a study to assess, current species distributions and population genetics which will assist prioritization of any future conservation actions. We have also found some evidence of historic cultural linkages between Placostylus snails and Fijian people and these aspects will soon be further explored in cooperation with our local community collaborators...|$|R
