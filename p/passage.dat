Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the <b>passage</b> were guardrooms.

40|$|Defective RNA {{molecules}} (D-RNAs) {{are being}} studied in several plant RNA virus groups. In the genus Bromovirus, D-RNAs {{have been described}} for Broad bean mottle virus (BBMV), they are formed by a single internal deletion in the RNA 2 and have been generated de novo by serial <b>passages.</b> In contrast, in Brome mosaic virus (BMV) D-RNAs are generated by a single or double internal deletion in the RNA 3 without serial <b>passages</b> in their hosts. In this work the external effects of the host and the growth temperature in the generation and accumulation of D-RNAs in BBMV, BMV and Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) are studied. The BBMV and BMV D-RNAs were generated and accumulated with or without serial <b>passages</b> of the viruses in different hosts and cultivars. Plants grown at 12, 16, 20 and 24 °C in a growth chamber and in a greenhouse (22 ± 5 °C) generated D-RNAs after being inoculated with virus-free D-RNAs, with and without <b>passages.</b> The D-RNAs observed in BBMV and BMV presented some common characteristics: both were formed de novo after serial <b>passages</b> or without <b>passages,</b> their deletion borders had short repeated and palindrome sequences that favour recombination. In addition, growing inoculated plants at lower temperatures greatly facilitated the generation and accumulation of D-RNAs.
