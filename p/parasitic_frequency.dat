The cavity was a high-Q round silver-plated copper [...] "can", with the internal diameter of 0.775 in (19.7 mm) and about 11/16 in (17.5 mm) long, with inductance of about 10 nanohenry.

However, these large stroke flexure hinges typically lose stiffness in supporting direction during deflection. The lowest natural frequency is a commonly used measure for this property. Therefore, in shape and topology optimization, the decrease of this first <b>parasitic</b> <b>frequency</b> is often minimized.

In this paper, a method is presented for determining stroke-dependent frequencies of large stroke flexure hinges. This method makes use of derivatives of mode shapes with respect to modal coordinates. Therefore, geometrical nonlinearities can be taken into account. Using these modal derivatives, frequency derivatives can be determined, making it possible to determine natural frequencies for any given deflection without having to linearize for every load step. For demonstration, the method is used to determine the first <b>parasitic</b> <b>frequency</b> of a single leaf spring {{as a function of the}} deflection.

30|$|Micro-strip filter {{is a very}} {{important}} component of wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes, which is used to select useful signals and suppress clutter interference signals. Multi-frequency micro-strip filters are required to effectively pick up the signals of each separate frequency band and prevent signal crosstalk between adjacent channels, which requires higher frequency selectivity and out-of-band rejection of the filters [4 – 6]. In recent years, scholars in various countries have carried out in-depth research and proposed various design methods to solve the two core problems in the design of multi-band micro-strip filters [14 – 20]: Firstly, multi-point frequency selection can be realized, multi-frequency can work in parallel, and each central frequency point has a certain capacity bandwidth; secondly, the signals in adjacent frequency bands must be effectively isolated and can not interfere with each other, and the out-of-band rejection performance of the filter is reliable. There are two main methods for designing multi-band filters [21 – 35]: Firstly, based on the combination of multi-band filters, including the cascade of broadband filters and notch filters, and the parallel connection of multiple filters in different frequency bands; secondly, based on the <b>parasitic</b> <b>frequency</b> of resonators, a multi-band filter is designed.|$|E

Linearly polarized 408 -nm light interacts with Yb atoms in crossed E- and B-fields. The probability of the 408 -nm transition contains a parity violating term, proportional to (Elight. B) [(E x Elight). B], arising from interference between the parity violating amplitude and the Stark amplitude due to the E-field (Elight is the electric field of the light).

40|$|Atomic parity {{violation}} {{has been}} observed in the 408 nm 1 S 0 [...] 3 D 1 forbidden transition of ytterbium. The parity violating amplitude is 8. 7 (1. 4) e- 10 ea 0, two orders of magnitude larger than in cesium, where the most precise experiments to date have been performed. This is in accordance with theoretical predictions and constitutes the largest atomic parity violating amplitude yet observed. This also opens the way to future measurements of neutron skins and anapole moments by comparing parity-violating amplitudes for various isotopes and hyperfine components of the transition. We present {{a detailed description of}} the observation. Linearly polarized 408 nm light interacts with ytterbium atoms in crossed electric (E) and magnetic fields (B). The probability of the 1 S 0 [...] 3 D 1 transition contains a parity-violating term, proportional to E'B [(E' x E B], arising from interference between the amplitudes of transitions induced by the electroweak interaction and the Stark effect ((E' is the optical electric field). The transition probability is detected by measuring the population of the metastable 3 P 0 state, to which 65 % of the atoms excited to the 3 D 1 state spontaneously decay. The population of the 3 P 0 state is determined by resonantly exciting the atoms with 649 nm light to the 3 S 1 state and collecting the fluorescence resulting from its decay. Systematic corrections due to imperfections in the applied electric and magnetic fields are determined in auxiliary experiments. The statistical uncertainty is dominated by <b>parasitic</b> <b>frequency</b> excursions of the 408 -nm excitation light due to imperfect stabilization of the optical reference with respect to the atomic resonance. The present uncertainties are 9 % statistical and 8 % systematic. Methods of improving the accuracy for the future experiments are discussed. We further present a measurement of the dynamic scalar and tensor polarizabilities of ytterbium's 3 D 1 state. The polarizabilities were measured by analyzing the spectral lineshape of the 1 S 0 [...] 3 D 1 transition. Due to the interaction of atoms with the standing wave, the lineshape has a characteristic polarizability-dependent distortion. A theoretical model was used to simulate the lineshape and determine a combination of the polarizabilities of the ground and excited states by fitting the model to experimental data. This combination was measured with a 13 % uncertainty, only 3 % of which is due to uncertainty in the simulation and fitting procedure. By comparing two different combinations of polarizabilities, the scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the state $ 3 D 1 $ were measured to be 0. 151 (36) Hz/(V/cm) ^ 2 and - 0. 205 (53) Hz/(V/cm) ^ 2, respectively. We show that this technique can be applied to similar atomic systems. Finally, we propose two methods for improving future measurements of atomic parity violation using two-photon transitions. The first method is characterized by the absence of static external electric and magnetic fields. Such measurements can be achieved by observing the interference of parity-conserving and parity-violating two-photon transition amplitudes between energy eigenstates of zero electronic angular momentum. General expressions for induced two-photon transition amplitudes are derived. The two-photon scheme using the 1 S 0 [...] 1 P 1 [...] 3 P 0 transition in ytterbium (399 nm and 1280 nm) is proposed as a crosscheck of the APV experiment which uses the single-photon 408 nm 1 S 0 [...] 3 D 1 transition. We estimate that the signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed experiment is comparable to that achieved in the 408 nm system. The second method allows for measurement of nuclear spin dependent atomic parity violation without nuclear spin independent background. Such measurements can be achieved by driving parity violating two-photon J= 0 [...] 1 transitions driven by identical photons in the presence of an external static magnetic field. We discuss two promising applications: the 462 nm 5 s^ 2 1 S 0 [...] 5 s 9 p 1 P 1 transition in strontium- 87, and the 741 nm 7 s^ 2 1 S 0 [...] 7 s 7 p 3 P 1 transition in unstable radium- 225...|$|E
