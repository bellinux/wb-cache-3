25|$|Quantitative {{psychological}} research {{lends itself}} to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data. These include the Pearson <b>product–moment</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling. The measurement and operationalization of important constructs {{is an essential part}} of these research designs.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of non-parametric statistics {{as opposed to the}} parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.|$|E

25|$|Rank {{correlation}} coefficients, such as Spearman's {{rank correlation}} coefficient and Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (τ) measure {{the extent to}} which, as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase, without requiring that increase to be represented by a linear relationship. If, as the one variable increases, the other decreases, the rank correlation coefficients will be negative. It is common to regard these rank correlation coefficients as alternatives to Pearson's coefficient, used either {{to reduce the amount}} of calculation or to make the coefficient less sensitive to non-normality in distributions. However, this view has little mathematical basis, as rank correlation coefficients measure a different type of relationship than the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient, and are best seen as measures of a different type of association, rather than as alternative measure of the population correlation coefficient.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{field of}} {{statistics}} {{emerged in the}} late 19th and early 20th century in three stages. The first wave, {{at the turn of}} the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics – height, weight, eyelash length among others. Pearson developed the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient, defined as a product-moment, the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things. Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.|$|E

[...] Karl Pearson developed the coefficient from a similar but slightly different idea by Francis Galton.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{estimate}} heritabilities and sire breeding values for stayability and reproductive traits in a composite multibreed beef cattle herd using a threshold model. A GFCAT set of programmes was used to analyse reproductive data. Heritabilities and <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlations</b> between predicted breeding values for stayability at 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 months of age, calving success and longevity were estimated. The estimated heritabilities on the underlying scale for these traits were 0. 06, 0. 10, 0. 06, 0. 03, 0. 11, 0. 03 and 0. 08 respectively. <b>Product-moment</b> <b>correlations</b> between breeding values for stayability traits were low. The highest correlation of 0. 22 was obtained between the ages of 36 and 48 months. Heritability estimates and correlations between traits appear to be of such a low magnitude that selection for these characteristics would result in limited genetic improvement, and also indicate that sires had little influence on the stayability, longevity or calving success of their daughters.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{phenotypic}} correlations may be {{suggestive of}} underlying changes in genetic covariance among life-history, morphology, and behavioural traits, and their detection is therefore relevant to many biological studies. Two new statistical tests are proposed and their performances compared with existing methods. Of all tests considered, the existing approximate test of homogeneity of <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlations</b> provides the greatest power to detect heterogeneous correlations, when based on Hotelling’s z-transformation. The {{use of this}} transformation and test is recommended under conditions of bivariate normality. A new distribution-free randomisation test of homogeneity of Spearman’s rank correlations is described and recommended for use when the bivariate samples are taken from populations with non-normal or unknown distributions. An alternative randomisation test of homogeneity of <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlations</b> is {{shown to be a}} useful compromise between the approximate tests and the randomisation tests on Spearman’s rank correlations: it is not as sensitive to departures from normality as the approximate tests, but has greater power than the rank correlation test.

2500|$|As we go {{from each}} pair to the next pair x increases, and so does y. This {{relationship}} is perfect, {{in the sense that}} an increase in x is always accompanied by an increase iny. This means that we have a perfect rank correlation, and both Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients are 1, whereas in this example Pearson <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient is 0.7544, indicating that the points are far from lying on a straight line. In the same way if y always decreases when x increases, the rank correlation coefficients will be −1, while the Pearson <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient {{may or may not be}} close to −1, depending on how close the points are to a straight line. [...] Although in the extreme cases of perfect rank correlation the two coefficients are both equal (being both +1 or both −1), this is not generally the case, and so values of the two coefficients cannot meaningfully be compared. For example, for the three pairs (1,1) (2,3) (3,2) Spearman's coefficient is 1/2, while Kendall's coefficient is1/3.|$|E
2500|$|Internal consistency, which {{addresses}} the homogeneity {{of a single}} test form, may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test, which is termed split-half reliability; {{the value of this}} Pearson <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient for two half-tests is adjusted with the Spearman–Brown prediction formula to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. [...] Perhaps the most commonly used index of reliability is Cronbach's α, which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients.

30|$|Finally, {{if there}} is range {{variability}} among subgroups and if <b>product-moment</b> <b>correlations</b> are estimated for each subgroup, correlations may differ because {{of the change in}} variability across the subgroups. Correlations are based on the covariance between two variables, which {{is a function of the}} variances of the two variables. When there is less variance, and all else being equal, the covariance, and thus the correlation, is attenuated or reduced. Another similar factor is the presence of measurement error, which similarly attenuates correlations. Corrections exist for adjusting correlations due to range restriction and measurement error (see, for example, Hunter & Schmidt, 2004; Sackett & Yang, 2000). Such corrections help to justify comparative inferences.|$|R
