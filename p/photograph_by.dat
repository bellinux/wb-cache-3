5|$|Released in six formats {{featuring}} a <b>photograph</b> <b>by</b> JFKK, A Ballads received favorable reviews from music critics. Many praised the collection for {{including some of}} Hamasaki's best vocal work, and commended the songwriting. Minor criticism was aimed on the newer renditions of the original songs. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, reaching {{number one on the}} Oricon Albums Chart, making it Hamasaki's second compilation and eighth album to reach the top spot. It was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is a portrait in tempera grassa on paper on panel. Elizabeth is depicted wearing the red robes of the Order of the British Empire. 18 sittings were held over eight months between the Queen and Annigoni; {{the first eight}} sittings resulted in a large oil and pastel study that was later bought from Annigoni's family by Elizabeth in 2006. A <b>photograph</b> <b>by</b> Cecil Beaton in which Elizabeth wears the red Order of the British Empire robes has been considered {{as a source for}} the portrait.|$|E
5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a <b>photograph</b> <b>by</b> Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. The dining room was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. Today the dining room together with its frieze forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E

25|$|Collage {{made from}} photographs, {{or parts of}} photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a {{composite}} <b>photograph</b> <b>by</b> cutting and joining {{a number of other}} photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as compositing.|$|E

25|$|In José Manuel Susperregui's 2009 book Sombras de la Fotografía ("Shadows of Photography"), {{he concludes}} that the {{photograph}} was not taken at Cerro Muriano, but at another location about 30 miles (48km) away. Susperregui determined {{the location of the}} <b>photograph</b> <b>by</b> examining the background of other photographs from the same sequence as the Falling Soldier, in which a range of mountains can be seen. He then e-mailed images to librarians and historians in towns near Córdoba, asking if they recognized the landscape, and received a positive response from the Spanish town of Espejo.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first half-tone photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-Édouard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr. On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the Canadian Illustrated News which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page half-tone image of His Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a <b>photograph</b> <b>by</b> Notman. Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the New York Daily Graphic in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.|$|E
25|$|Rushmore {{uses the}} unique style of {{cinematography}} that Wes Anderson has become well known for. The film has a singular sense of colour, focusing mainly on blues, greens, and reds {{in order to}} create a heightened reality. The montage sequence in the beginning of the film is strongly influenced by the rapid transitions used by French New Wave filmmakers. The shot of Max in the go-cart also resembles a <b>photograph</b> <b>by</b> Jacques Henri Lartigue. This montage sequence was almost cancelled by Disney executives as it was not believed that these short singular shots were required in regard to the budget and time frame the film was restricted by. Therefore, the sequence was shot quickly whenever the crew were at a suitable location.|$|E
