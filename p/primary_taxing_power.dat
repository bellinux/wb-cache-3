First, {{the history of the}} tax, and then the status of the tax in the tax system of both countries is described. Further on, I deal with the role of the tax and its legal arrangement. The last chapter focuses on the <b>primary</b> differences (<b>tax</b> administrator, <b>powers</b> of <b>tax,</b> rate of taxation, tax exemption, tax matu-rity) and their assessment.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the actual constitutional, legislative and collecting <b>tax</b> <b>powers</b> {{in the hands}} of the Union. It proceeds first to unpack the very idea of <b>tax</b> <b>power,</b> and to distinguish its elements. On such a basis, I proceed to consider European norms and practices, and to reconstruct on such a basis the <b>tax</b> <b>powers</b> of the Union. It is then found that the Union’s <b>tax</b> <b>powers</b> are far wider than commonly asserted, especially on what concerns to the influence exerted on national and regional <b>taxing</b> <b>powers</b> by the Union’s constitutional and legislative <b>tax</b> <b>powers.</b> However, the Union still presents most of the features characteristic of a regulatory entity. Having said that, a dynamic reconstruction of these same powers indicates that the Union is moving towards a rights-based polity, also on what concerns its <b>taxing</b> <b>powers.</b> There are clear indications that the problem-solving conception of the Union is insufficient to explain and ground the <b>powers</b> to <b>tax</b> {{in the hands of}} the Union.

40|$|Background. Tax Increment Financing (TIF) {{has become}} an {{important}} tool for local governments to attract economic development projects, create jobs, foster infrastructure investment and redevelop blighted areas. TIF is a technique for financing a qualifying capital project, or its related infrastructure, from a stream of revenue generated within the geographic area defined as a TIF district. <b>Primary</b> governments with <b>taxing</b> <b>powers</b> often utilize TIF Districts, but redevelopment agencies may also be party to a TIF project. When a redevelopment agency utilizes TIF, the agency will share in property or other taxes imposed by other taxing entities. TIF districts are currently used in more than 40 states. TIF districts generally rely upon incremental property taxes generated in a specific area, but can also apply to other taxes, including sales taxes. TIF’s can include {{a number of different}} concepts including tax increment districts, urban renewal districts, general improvement districts, special improvement districts, metro districts, and utility districts. The basic principles outlined herein are applicable to any type of TIF. Most states have established laws and eligibility requirements to designate an area as a TIF district (i. e., blight, dilapidation or deterioration, age of structures, etc). Once an area is legally designated as a TIF district, the amount of the base valuation is “frozen. ” 1 Improvements to vacant or dilapidated properties within the boundaries of the TIF then generate additional real estate valuation or “increment”, which is captured through augmente...|$|R

40|$|Background. Tax {{incremental}} financing (TIF) can be {{an important}} tool for local governments to attract economic development projects, create jobs, foster infrastructure investment, and/or redevelop blighted areas. TIF is a technique for funding a qualifying capital project, its related infrastructure, or maintenance of the project 1 from a stream of revenue generated within the geographic area defined as a TIF district. Depending on state and provincial regulations, <b>primary</b> governments with <b>taxing</b> <b>powers</b> can often use TIF, but redevelopment agencies may also be party to a TIF project. When a redevelopment agency uses TIF, the agency may share or redirect property or other taxes imposed by other taxing entities. TIF generally relies on incremental property taxes generated in a specific area, but it can also apply to other taxes, including sales taxes. Any organization considering the use of TIF {{should be aware of the}} risks involved. As demonstrated in previous economic downturns, TIF can significantly constrain an organization’s ability to generate tax revenues, once a TIF is crafted, it can be very difficult to change the terms or cancel the agreement, especially if bonds have already been issued and the various interests in the flow of funds have been established. As a result, there is a need to focus on the long-term nature of TIF, and the long-term forecasts of the tax revenues that support it. The basic principles outlined herein are applicable to any type of TIF. While TIF laws differ among states or provinces, most states have established laws and eligibility requirements t...|$|R

40|$|The recent policy {{literature}} on fiscal federalism in China has {{concentrated on the}} large “vertical fiscal gap” resulting in inadequate local provision of public goods and services. Thus there is an evident interest in giving local governments more <b>taxing</b> <b>powers.</b> After a brief historical survey, the article discusses a 1993 State Council directive that centralized <b>taxing</b> <b>power.</b> This has led local governments {{to make use of}} their control over tax administration to alter effective tax rates, and to the practice of “refund after collection”, whereby local governments disguise tax cuts as expenditures, following a logic opposite to tax expenditures. This study concludes, firstly, that the allocation of <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> is still done outside the framework of the law, and secondly, that the government {{has not been able to}} settle on a stable allocation.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2012 decision in National Federation of Business v. Sibelius (NFIB). That case held that the individual mandate penalty in the Obamacare legislation will be a tax and not a penalty, and that the penalty will therefore be constitutional under the Taxing Clause of the Constitution, even though {{a majority of the}} Court held that the mandate itself-the requirement to acquire insurance or pay the tax/penalty-was not a valid exercise of the commerce power. The result in the case was not necessarily a surprise, but the reliance on the <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> was. This article discusses the understanding of the <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> reflected in NFIB; describes what Chief Justice Roberts did not say about the scope of that power; and considers what the decision means for future exercises of congressional power; concluding that NFIB is unlikely to cause Congress to abuse the <b>taxing</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Constitutional {{framework}} for the <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> is coherent. The prior reference in the literature to a “flaw” in the apportionment of income taxes is an ancillary issue. A Summary Table of the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Power</b> is provided here with examples that differentiate various tax levy methods from tax types. The individual mandate penalty at issue in Sebelius is categorized as a “capitation”-type tax. A Federal capitation tax is barred by Article 1, Section 2. The mention of capitation taxes in Section 9 merely clarifies that direct taxes must be apportioned according to the Census. The mandated purchase of insurance is also a new category of “tax” separate from the penalty. Following the holding in Sebelius, future cases {{will be needed to}} further clarify the limits of the <b>taxing</b> <b>power.</b> Given the trend in tax policy toward increased rates of Federal taxation of wage earnings, the issue of whether the Congressional <b>taxing</b> <b>power</b> is solely a matter of Federalism or whether taxes levied on persons also limit individual liberty is likely to be of major significance going forward. Since the Affordable Care Act did not provide specifics on the penalty qua tax, many of the details were left to the Internal Revenue Service to determine in practice, albeit with some restrictions placed on its method of collections. If history is any guide, the Internal Revenue Service is unlikely to administer the mandate in a way that safeguards individual liberty...|$|R
