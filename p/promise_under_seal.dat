5000|$|At {{common law}} not all {{promises}} were enforceable. One {{way in which}} a promise is enforceable is the modern law of contract, which arose from the old action of assumpsit, and concepts of motive and reliance. In Australia, the bargain theory prevails, under which the exchange of promises, referred to in the Latin term quid pro quo, is an essential element. A <b>promise</b> made <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> was enforceable <b>under</b> the old action on the covenant, which has developed into the modern law in relation to deeds. [...] Promises may now also be enforceable as negligent mis-statement, promissory estoppel, misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of the Australian Consumer Law. In Australia, the law of equity has also played an increasing part in changing the laws regarding contracts, and the remedies that may be available when contractual promises are breached.|$|R
