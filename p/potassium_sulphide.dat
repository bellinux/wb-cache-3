50|$|Restoration work {{took place}} in August 2008, {{removing}} dirt and a coat of black wax which had been previously applied to the bronzework. This changed the colour of the statue from black to a more natural brown, and <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> was applied in order to even out the colour of both Cromwell and the lion. It was coated in a clear wax {{in order to ensure}} that the natural finish remained. The conservation work was completed in time for the 350th anniversary of Cromwell's death on 3 September 2008.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new principle for {{the synthesis of}} thiophene from diketone. Thiophene is a five-membered heterocyclic aromatic compound containing one sulphur atom. The thiophene structure {{can be found in}} certain natural products and is also incorporated in several pharmacologically active compounds. The procedure described in the thesis uses the combination of graphite and metallic potassium. When they are reacted together they form an interesting compound, potassium graphite, in which the metal atoms are intercalated between the sheets of the graphite. If the potassium graphite then is treated with elemental sulphur (flowers of sulphur), <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> is formed {{on the surface of the}} potassium graphite. The thiophene molecule is formed by heating the <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> with a 1, 4 -diketone followed by the addition of a dehydrating (water adsorbing) reagent. Unfortunately, the procedure has so far given only moderate chemical yield, but the results show that the principle works. Further development may give a practically useful method...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of imidazole- 2 -thione derivative 1 with 2 -chloro-N-p-tolylacetamide afforded the cor-responding 2 -(1 H-imidazol- 2 -ylthio) -N-p-tolylacetamide 2. Reaction compound 2 with different reagents such as p-chlorobenzaldehyde and p-chlorophenyl diazonium chloride afforded the cor-responding arylidene derivative 3 and hydrazone derivative 6. Reactions of 2 with carbon disul-fide in dimethylformamide (DMF) in one equivalent potassium hydroxide afforded intermediate <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> salt 8, which treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid and phenacyl bromide afforded the corresponding 2 -[p-tolylcarbamoyl]ethanedithioic acid 9 and 3 -[benzo-ylmethylth-io]-N-p-tolyl- 3 -thioxo-propaneamide 10. While the reaction 2 with carbon disulphide in the pres-ence of two equivalent potassium hydroxide in DMF gave non-isolated potassium salt 11, which {{was allowed to}} react with halogenated compounds namely ethyl chloroacetate and methyl iodide afforded the corresponding 3, 3 -bis[(ethoxycarbonyl) methylthio]-N-p-tolylacrylamide 12 and 3, 3 -bis-(methylthio) -N-p-tolylacrylamide 13 respectively. Reaction 2 with phenyl isothiocyanate in ba-sic DMF yielded the intermediate <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> salt 18. Acidification 18 with dilute hydro-chloric acid afforded the corresponding thiocarbamoyl derivative 19. Treatment of intermediat...|$|E
25|$|In 1709 a German {{druggist}} and pigment maker named Johann Jacob Diesbach accidentally {{discovered a}} new blue while experimenting with <b>potassium</b> and iron <b>sulphides.</b> The new colour was first called Berlin blue, but later became known as Prussian blue. By 1710 it was {{being used by the}} French painter Antoine Watteau, and later his successor Nicolas Lancret. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{chemiluminescence}} flow injection {{procedure for}} {{the determination of}} As(III) in aqueous samples is described. The method involves injection of As(III) samples into a 1 % (m/v) sodium hexametaphosphate in 0. 02 M H 2 SO 4 carrier stream, which then merges at a Y-piece with a reagent stream consisting of potassium permanganate (5. 0 × 10 − 5 M) made up in the acidic sodium hexametaphosphate carrier solution. The chemiluminescence intensity of the resulting reaction mixture was measured at a photomultiplier tube operated at a voltage of 0. 93 kV. Under optimized conditions, the method is characterised by a linear range from 0. 5 to 5. 0 μg l − 1, a detection limit of 0. 3 μg l − 1 and a sampling frequency of 150 h − 1. The effects of common anionic and cationic interferences were investigated, and {{it was found that}} the only ions to cause serious interference were those which react with <b>potassium</b> permanganate, namely <b>sulphide,</b> iodide and ferrous. <br /...|$|R
40|$|In group II A. Analysis {{two methods}} {{are used to}} {{dissolve}} precipitated Mercury Sulphide – potassium chlorate and concentrated hydrochloric acid or aqua regia. These methods are essentially the solution of mercury sulphide by means of nascent chlorine. A third method has been described whereby mercury sulphide is dissolved in a sulphuric acid solution of potassium iodide. This mixture liberates hydrogen iodide which is the dissolving agent. From the equations [complicated equations here] is seems possible that the dissolving action is due to complex formation. It will be seen from equation (1) that the lower the concentration of the sulphideions the greater will be tendency for mercury sulphide to dissolve. This furnishes an explanation why potassium iodide alone cannot be used with same success as hydrogen iodide. With potassium iodide <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> instead of hydrogen sulphide will be formed during the solution reaction. As <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> is the salt of a strong base there will remain in solution {{a high concentration of}} sulphideions which must promote the back reaction shown in equation (1) and an equilibrium is all that can be attained. It is not possible to reduce the sulphide ion concentration by boiling as it is with hydrogen sulphide since <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> is non volatile. If the ordinary methods and this new method are compared it is seen that whereas nascent chlorine converts mercury sulphide into mercury chloride, the action of hydrogen iodide is to form a complex salt which has a very low concentration of mercury ions. It is possible therefore that this new method may not give so sensitive a test for mercury. The object of this portion of the work is to ascertain the possibility of testing for mercury in Group II analysis by using the hydrogen iodide method of dissolving the precipitated mercury sulphide and to compare the sensitivity of the test with that of the methods usually employed...|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of copper sulphide and copper oxides originated during artificial tarnishing of copper is studied using potentiodynamic potential/current density experiments. Six copper surface treatments are considered: mechanical polishing; indoor exposure for 7 days; chemical etching in 1. 6 M nitric acid; chemical etching and heating at 160 °C; and chemical etching and dipping in a 9 × 10 - 4 M or 0. 9 M <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> (K 2 S) solution at 70 °C. Cuprite (Cu 2 O) and chalcocite (Cu 2 S) {{are the main}} compounds formed. A linear relationship with the square root of the scan rate (v) is obtained by plotting the potentiodynamic potential/current density for the tarnish dissolution processes. A relationship between potential and current density cathodic peaks is not obtained, according to Müller's model, showing a proportionality factor with the dimensions of a resistance. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Aiming {{to develop}} a cost {{effective}} means to store large amounts of electric energy, NiFe batteries were produced and tested under galvanostatic conditions at room temperature. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to develop predictive equations that establish a link between hydrogen evolution and electrode manufacturing conditions, {{over a wide range}} of electrode/electrolyte systems. Basically, the intent was to investigate the incidence of lithium hydroxide and <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphide</b> as electrolyte additives on cell performance. With this in mind, in-house built Fe/FeS based electrodes were cycled against commercially available nickel electrodes on a three electrode cell configuration. A 3 × 4 full factorial experimental design was proposed to investigate the combined effect of the aforementioned electrolyte additives on cell performance. As a consequence, data from 144 cells were finally used in conducting the analysis and finding the form of the predictive equations. Our findings suggest that at the level of confidence alpha = 0. 05, the presence of relatively large amounts of the soluble bisulphide would enhance the performance of the battery by reducing electrolyte decomposition...|$|E
