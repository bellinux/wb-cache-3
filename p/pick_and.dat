40|$|In {{this study}} we present an {{analytical}} approach for integration of order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sortation operations which are the most important, labour intensive and costly activity for warehouses. Main aim is to investigate order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sorting efficiencies under different design issues {{as a function of}} order wave size. Integrated analytical model is proposed to estimate the optimum order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> order sortation efficiency. The model, which has been tested by simulations with different illustrative examples, calculates the optimum wave size that solves the trade-off between <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sorting operations and makes the order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sortations efficiency maximum. Our model also allow system designer to predict the order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sorting capacity for different system configurations. This study presents an innovative approach for integrated warehouse operations. ...|$|R

In addition, in contrast with fountain solutions, printing speed had greater influence on the phenomena of wet <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> wet repellence of offset papers...|$|R
