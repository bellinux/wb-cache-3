It started sales of jewel bearings for {{watches and clocks}} and began to manufacture cap jewel, hole jewel, impulse jewel and <b>pallet</b> <b>stone.</b> In 1980, it started manufacturing ferrules for the optical communication industry utilizing injection molding engineering and polishing techniques.|$|E

50|$|The {{critical}} {{virtue of}} the Daniels Escapement is the virtual elimination of the sliding friction component; i.e., the sliding of the <b>pallet</b> <b>stones</b> over {{the teeth of the}} escape wheel. What little sliding friction remains is due to the impossibility of maintaining an exact tangential geometry throughout the duration of an impulse.|$|R
5000|$|An {{automatic}} winding, twenty-one (21) jewel movement, the 2892 {{is available}} in three executions or grades: Elaborated, Top and Chronometer. The key components which differ {{at the line of}} demarcation between Elaborated and Top are the <b>pallet</b> <b>stones,</b> balance wheel & hairspring, and the regulator mechanism. The degree of decoration on the movement's parts also increases with the grade. To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} is an automatic winding, twenty-five (25) jewel movement, {{which can be}} fitted {{with a variety of}} features including the triple date (day, date, month and moon phase) or a variety of two and three register models with totalizers or counters for minutes, seconds and hours. It is available in three executions or grades: Elaborated, Top and Chronometer. The key components which differ at the line of demarcation between Elaborated and Top are the <b>pallet</b> <b>stones,</b> balance wheel & hairspring and the regulator mechanism. To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications: ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{workhorse}} of the ETA mechanical {{line is the}} ETA 2824-2, The 2824 is {{an automatic}} winding, twenty-five jewel movement, available in four executions or grades: Standard, Elaborated (improved), Top and Chronometer. The key components which differ {{at the line of}} demarcation between Elaborated and Top are the barrel spring, shock protection system, <b>pallet</b> <b>stones,</b> balance wheel & hairspring and the regulator mechanism. In contrast, since the addition of the [...] "-2" [...] {{at the end of the}} movement number, there has been no difference between the standard and the chronometer grades in terms of the regulator mechanism, both being Etachron. To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications: ...|$|R
5000|$|Until about 1850, the watchmaker’s ébauche {{consisted}} of two plates with pillars and bars, the [...] barrel, [...] fusée, [...] index, [...] pawl and ratchet-wheel, {{along with a few}} assembling screws. These parts were all roughly [...] filed and [...] milled. The steel and brass were manufactured in a special workshop. The ébauche was finished by watchmakers in a finishing shop. The [...] (literally [...] "assortment" [...] in English) are the parts of a watch other than the ébauche, in particular the regulating organs and include the balance, hairspring or spiral, escape wheel, anchor lever and <b>pallet</b> <b>stones</b> or jewels. The modern ébauche is a jeweled watch movement, without its regulating organs, mainspring, dial, or hands.|$|R
50|$|Valentinis became {{bedridden}} in 1455 after fracturing {{both her}} femurs {{in a fall}} and she preferred a <b>pallet</b> of <b>stones</b> and straw to an actual bed. Her declining health led to her death on the Saturday evening of 23 April 1458. On her deathbed Mass was celebrated and friars from a convent {{not too far from}} her came to sing psalms. Her remains were interred in Santa Lucia but later moved to the Udine Cathedral in 1845.|$|R
6000|$|The upper {{story was}} a perfect museum of antique relics, very {{entertaining}} to examine. Having finished these, Hoffman, who acted as guide, led them into a little gloomy room containing a straw <b>pallet,</b> a <b>stone</b> table with a loaf and pitcher on it, and, kneeling before a crucifix, where the light from a single slit in the wall fell on him, was {{the figure of a}} monk. The waxen mask was life-like, the attitude effective, and the cell excellently arranged. Amy cried out when she first saw it, but a second glance reassured her, and she patted the bald head approvingly, as Karl explained.-- ...|$|R
