50|$|Two {{variations}} of the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> have been developed over time: the Montana flume and the Short Section (USGS / Portable) <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kilpatrick {{notes that}} the {{discharge}} for this modification of the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> is slightly greater than for a standard <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> of the same size. This {{has been attributed to}} potential manufacturing tolerance variations rather than the actual operation of the flume itself and users are cautioned to verify the flume's dimensions before proceeding with data collection. As with any <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume,</b> flumes varying from the standard dimensions flumes should be individual rated.|$|E
5000|$|Lacking the {{extended}} throat and discharge {{sections of the}} <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume,</b> Montana flumes are not intended for use under submerged conditions. Where submergence is possible, a full length <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> should be used. [...] Should submergence occur, investigations have been made into correcting the flow.|$|E
50|$|Smaller <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> {{tend to be}} {{fabricated}} from fiberglass and {{galvanized steel}} (depending upon the application), while larger <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> tend to fabricated from fiberglass (sizes up to 144") or concrete (160"-600").|$|R
50|$|By the 1960's several {{different}} companies began to commercially offer <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes.</b> These manufacturers have typically produce flumes from {{one type of}} material only (typically fiberglass/grp or steel), although currently a few, such as Openchannelflow, offer <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> {{in a variety of}} materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{calibration}} {{of small}} <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> for measuring flows ranging in magnitude from 0. 1 to 1. 1 {{cubic feet per}} second (cfs) was accomplished by A. R. Robinson (1960) at Colorado State University. The purpose of Robinson’s investigation was to accurately calibrate and standardize the design of small <b>Parshall</b> measuring <b>flumes.</b> The rated flumes were constructed of galvanized sheet metal. Data was collected for <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> having throat widths of 1 -, 2 -, and 3 - inches. Calibration tables or curves were prepared for both free and submerged flow. The dimensions of the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> rated by Robinson are shown in Figure 1. The study reported herein was made to illustrate that the analysis of submergence developed at Utah State University (Hyatt, 1965) for trapezoidal flumes is applicable to small <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes.</b> The data reported by Robinson (1960) is analyzed by the submergence parameters reported by Hyatt (1965) and the resulting equations and calibration curves are listed in this report...|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} version of the Venturi flume is the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume.</b> Named after it creator, Dr. Ralph L. Parshall of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> is a fixed hydraulic structure used in measuring volumetric flow rate in surface water, wastewater treatment plant, and industrial discharge applications. The <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> accelerates flow though a contraction of both the parallel sidewalls and a drop in the floor at the flume throat. Under free-flow conditions the depth of water at specified location upstream of the flume throat can be converted to a rate of flow.|$|E

50|$|For the <b>Parshall</b> <b>Flume</b> {{equation}} used {{to calculate}} the flow rate, both empirical values C and n are known constants (with various values for each <b>Parshall</b> <b>Flume</b> size) leaving Ha (depth upstream) as the only variable needing to be measured. Likewise, in the energy conservation equation, y1 (or the depth of flow) is needed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} are used to make <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes,</b> including: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> below 3-inches in size {{should not}} be used on {{unscreened}} sanitary flows.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> below 3 {{inches in}} size {{should not be}} used on {{unscreened}} sanitary flows, due to the likelihood of clogging.|$|R
50|$|A Montana flume, is {{a popular}} {{modification}} of the standard <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume.</b> The Montana flume removes the throat and discharge sections of the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume,</b> resulting a flume that is lighter in weight, shorter in length, and less costly to manufacture. Montana flumes are used to measure surface waters, irrigations flows, industrial discharges, and wastewater treatment plant flows.|$|E

50|$|A {{total of}} 22 {{standard}} sizes of <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> have been developed, covering flow ranges from 0.005 cfs l/s to 3,280 cfs l/s.|$|R
50|$|Under {{laboratory}} conditions <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> can {{be expected}} to exhibit accuracies to within +/-2%, although field conditions make accuracies better than 5% doubtful.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{continued}} research project for the Utah Water Research Laboratory and the State of Utah, a study of flow measurement devices is being conducted throughout the state. Initially the project included only measurement devices associated with high-risk dams, but has since been broadened to any measurement structure of interest for water users in the state. The physical dimensions, relative elevations, and flow accuracy were documented for each included device. After visiting sixteen sites, {{it was found that}} fourteen of the measuring devices had incorrect geometries. Of these fourteen, thirteen of them were originally <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes.</b> A large percentage of <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> with geometry inaccuracies was also found from previous data collected for this project. One reoccurring issue was that the flumes had not been well maintained and had damage to the walls or floor. Some of these <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> did not have a diverging downstream section and are referred to as Montana flumes. In these cases, a standard Parshall rating curve was used to determine flow where it did not apply. Some of the flumes that were tested operated regularly under submerged conditions, and no adjustments were made for submergence. The objective of this research is to determine if Montana <b>flumes</b> (<b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> without a diverging section) operate similarly to fully constructed <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> under both free-flow and submerged conditions. Laboratory tests were performed in the Utah Water Research Laboratory to determine corrections for submergence. Flow 3 D, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software program, was also used to develop corrections for a submerged Montana flume. The laboratory results were compared to the computational fluid dynamics results. By using Flow 3 D, a reliable numerical process was developed to determine the flow rate in a submerged Montana flume in an effort to expand the results to other seized flumes...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume,</b> an {{open channel}} flow {{metering}} device, was developed to measure the flow of suface waters and irrigation flows. The most recognized and commonly used flume today, the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> is a fixed hydraulic structure. It is used to measure volumetric flow rate in industrial discharges, municipal sewer lines, and influent/effluent flows in wastewater treatment plants. The <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> accelerates flow through a contraction of both the parallel sidewalls and {{a drop in the}} floor at the flume throat. Under free-flow conditions the depth of water at specified location upstream of the flume throat can be converted to a rate of flow. Some states specify the use of Parshall flumes, by law, for certain situations (commonly water rights).|$|E

50|$|The {{submergence}} transition {{values for}} Cutthroat flumes are generally {{better than those}} for similarly sized <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> - an advantage in flat gradient channels where downstream hydraulics may increase the submergence ratio in the flume.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> {{require a}} drop in {{elevation}} through the flume. To accommodate the drop in an existing channel either the flume must be raised above the channel floor (raising the upstream water level) or the downstream channel must be modified.|$|R
50|$|Submergence {{transitions}} for <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> {{range from}} 50% (1”-3” sizes) to 80% (10’-50’ sizes), beyond which point level measurements {{must be taken}} at both the primary and secondary points of measurement and a submergence correction must {{be applied to the}} flow equations.|$|R

50|$|As {{with the}} <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume,</b> the initial {{applications}} for Cutthroat flumes were envisioned to be measuring flows in irrigation channels and other surface waters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> {{are widely}} used for {{measuring}} flow in canals, domestic water supply and sewage systems, and to a limited extent in natural streams. Normally, the device operates like a weir, the flow being contracted and passing through a critical depth. This condition is termed free flow and only one depth measurement, h,, in the con-verging section is required to determine the flow. The discharge is given by the general relationship, Q = K (1) in which K and it are constant for...|$|R
50|$|These {{final two}} {{equations}} {{are very similar}} to the Q = CHan equations that are used for <b>Parshall</b> <b>Flumes.</b> In fact when looking at the flume tables, n has a value equal to or slightly greater than 1.5, while the value of C is larger than (3.088 b2) but still in a rough estimation. It {{should be noted that the}} derived equations above will always underestimate actual flow since both the derived C and n values are lower than their respective chart values.|$|R
50|$|When used {{to measure}} open channel flows, {{packaged}} metering manholes most commonly integrate a flume or weir (flumes being most common due {{to their ability to}} pass solids, low head loss, and wide operating ranges). <b>Parshall</b> <b>flumes</b> are most commonly integrated, followed by Palmer-Bowlus flumes, although Cutthroat, Montana, Trapezoidal, and H Type flumes can also be integrated. Weirs are less commonly integrated due to their poor solids handling characteristics as well as the inability to develop a sufficiently large upstream weir pool.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume</b> is {{standardized}} under ASTM D1941, ISO 9826:1992, and JIS B7553-1993. The flumes are not patented and the discharge tables are not copyright protected.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the <b>Parshall</b> <b>flume,</b> the {{secondary}} point of measurement, Hb, in the Cutthroat flume is {{located away from}} the throat section, making {{the determination of the}} level relatively easy.|$|E
