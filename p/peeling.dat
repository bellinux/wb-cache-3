5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread <b>peeling</b> and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and <b>peeling</b> paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E
5|$|Side effects include {{increased}} skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness {{and occasional}} <b>peeling.</b> Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of some citrus fruits. The contents of dietary fibre, total polyphenols, essential phenolics, ascorbic acid and some trace elements of lemons, oranges and grapefruits were determined and compared with their total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP). There {{were no significant differences in}} the contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in the studied <b>peeled</b> fruits or their <b>peels.</b> The contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in <b>peels</b> were significantly higher than in <b>peeled</b> fruits (P< 0. 05 in all cases).

The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by <b>peeling</b> of the skin.

50|$|The {{nutritional}} value of banana <b>peel</b> {{depends on the}} stage of maturity and the cultivar; for example plantain <b>peels</b> contain less fibre than dessert banana <b>peels,</b> and lignin content increases with ripening (from 7 to 15% dry matter). On average, banana <b>peels</b> contain 6-9% dry matter of protein and 20-30% fibre (measured as NDF). Green plantain <b>peels</b> contain 40% starch that is transformed into sugars after ripening. Green banana <b>peels</b> contain much less starch (about 15%) when green than plantain <b>peels,</b> while ripe banana <b>peels</b> contain up to 30% free sugars.|$|R

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{prosecutors}} began {{claiming the}} building was a national headquarters for a multimillion-dollar racketeering operation. On April 20, 1988, the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $6million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair, with paint <b>peeling</b> and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor.|$|E

5|$|The flavour {{has been}} {{described}} as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. Fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. <b>Peeling</b> and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of enzyme activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several {{studies have shown that the}} fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium. Bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures: chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens, and for long-term radioecological monitoring of polluted areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white <b>peeling</b> bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell and {{her parents}} lived in Lula, until 1936 when she was three years old; Blackwell's father left the {{plantation}} on which he worked, and fled to Memphis, Tennessee, fearing for his life after he confronted his boss about speaking to his wife. Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her mother left the plantation to live with him. Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work. On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so {{that she had the}} opportunity to receive an education. A quality education in Mississippi was not an option for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system. While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton. Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and <b>peeling</b> tomatoes in Florida. She was 14 when she finished the eighth grade, the final year of school at Westside, a school in West Helena for black children. Blackwell had to quit school to earn for her family.|$|E

5|$|He never {{attended}} {{school and was}} illiterate for some years of his early life. He learned {{to read and write}} reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of KalimÃ¡n and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno GonzÃ¡lez said that as a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like KalimÃ¡n did in the comics. He said {{he wanted to be a}} hero like the comic characters. As a child, he was accustomed to seeing gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to ApatzingÃ¡n and made a living by selling matches, <b>peeling</b> onions, working at a melon field, and throwing out the trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno GonzÃ¡lez migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno GonzÃ¡lez then fled back to Mexico.|$|E
