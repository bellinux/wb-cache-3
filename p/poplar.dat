30|$|Compared to the {{wild-type}} <b>poplars,</b> {{the less}} biomass of the transgenic <b>poplars</b> in field condition was {{in contrast to}} artificial environment conditions (growth chamber and greenhouse) [1, 9]. The disparity in growth performance between field and artificial condition like the transgenic <b>poplars</b> overexpressing AaXEG 2 has been reported, for example, for transgenic <b>poplars</b> down-regulating lignin biosynthesis genes [8, 22]. The multiple stresses to which <b>poplars</b> were exposed in the field likely caused these disparities in growth performance.|$|R

50|$|The balsam <b>poplars</b> — {{also known}} as Populus sect.

They are large deciduous trees, 30 - 60 m tall, with leaves with a rounded base, pointed apex, and a whitish waxy coating {{on the underside of the}} leaf; this latter distinguishes them from most other <b>poplars.</b> The name is derived from the pleasant balsam smell of the opening buds and leaves in spring, produced by a sticky gum on the buds which also helps protect the buds from insect damage. The balsam <b>poplars</b> are light-demanding trees that require considerable moisture but are tolerant of very cold conditions, occurring further north than other <b>poplars</b> except for the aspens.|$|R

30|$|An Arabidopsis mutant lacking {{detectable}} xyloglucan exhibited aberrant {{root hairs}} and produced smaller plants [21]. Transgenic <b>poplars</b> constitutively overexpressing AaXEG 2 grown {{in a field}} also had reduced xyloglucan content and had fewer root hairs than wild-type <b>poplars</b> (Kaida et al., unpublished data). Root hairs are important for plant to uptake nutrients and water from soil. Therefore, reduction of {{the growth rate of}} the transgenic <b>poplars</b> in the field trial is thought to be associated with decreased root hairs. The ratio of branch mass to aboveground mass of the transgenic lines was significantly lower than that of wild-type trees in the present study (Table  2). These lower ratios of branch mass might be also associated with the low growth capacity of transgenic <b>poplars.</b>|$|R
