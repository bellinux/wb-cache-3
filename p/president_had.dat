5|$|Johnson {{notified}} Congress of Stanton's {{suspension and}} Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed Lorenzo Thomas to replace him.|$|E
5|$|When {{a federal}} court {{released}} former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.|$|E

5|$|When {{the news}} that sitting United States president, Barack Obama was to visit Cuba was released—marking {{the first time a}} sitting <b>president</b> <b>had</b> visited the island nation in 88 years—the concert was rescheduled from 20 March 2016 to 25 March 2016.|$|E
5|$|By July 1990 the {{government}} began to distribute weapons to civilians in turn, to Krahn and Mandingo who wished to protect themselves. These hastily enlisted civilians became known as '1990 soldiers.' A '1990 soldier' which the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> personally picked, Tailey Yonbu, led a massacre of refugees, mostly Gio and Mandingo civilians, {{on the night of}} July 29/30, 1990 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Sinkor, Monrovia. Some 600 were killed. Because of the previous ethnic purges carried out by Doe's forces, the conflict took on characteristics of an ethnic pogrom.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{political}} advisers {{had given}} him a physically demanding schedule, even though the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> ordered it cut back. In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in Hutchinson, Kansas, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt. Harding had become a supporter of the World Court, and wanted the U.S. to become a member. In addition to making speeches, he visited Yellowstone and Zion National Parks, and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others.|$|E

25|$|After careful consideration, {{including}} {{a review of}} my recommendation, the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> concluded that given a number of factors, {{including a}} documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation {{should be subject to}} a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The <b>President</b> <b>has</b> also concluded that Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional. Given that conclusion, the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> instructed the Department not to defend the statute in such cases.|$|R
5|$|Helm was {{a presidential}} elector for Winfield Scott in the 1852 presidential election. After this he took twelve years off from politics. As early as 1836, Helm had {{advocated}} {{the construction of}} the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. On October 2, 1854, he became the railroad's second president. The previous <b>president</b> <b>had</b> been forced out of that position after a disagreement with Louisville's board of aldermen, and construction of the line had almost been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled {{over the}} {{question}} of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The <b>President</b> <b>had</b> Attorney General Henry Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate <b>President,</b> <b>had</b> crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, {{to see if he could}} capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. There was no evidence of Harnden's men being there yet.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Tribunal, which {{consisted}} of the Chief Justice Yong Pung How and Judges of Appeal M. Karthigesu and L.P. Thean, held that although Article 5(2A) was in abeyance, it represented the will of Parliament and therefore {{had to be taken}} into consideration. The Tribunal concluded that the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> no power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A).|$|E
5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} to Republican {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E

5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except {{for a pair of}} interviews in April, he complied.|$|E
5|$|Upon Presidents {{return to}} port, the U.S. Navy {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the incident. Gathering testimony from Presidents officers and crewmen, they determined that Little Belt had fired the first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation, Captain Bingham insisted that <b>President</b> <b>had</b> fired the first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually insisted that the other ship had fired the first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{thought so}} highly of Williams that in 1792, when Daniel Morgan refused {{the rank of}} Brigadier General of the American Army, the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> Henry Knox, the United States Secretary of War, write Williams asking him to accept the {{position}}. The position would have made Williams the second {{in command of the}} American Army, but citing poor health and no ambition for the position, Williams declined the appointment. However, on December 21, 1792, Williams accepted the Maryland State Legislature's invitation for him to serve as an Associate Justice for Baltimore County.|$|E

50|$|Several United States <b>presidents</b> <b>have</b> made presidential {{visits to}} Australia and New Zealand. The first visit by an {{incumbent}} to these Australasian nations {{was made in}} 1966 by Lyndon B. Johnson. His three-day five-city visit to Australia {{was intended as a}} show of gratitude to the Australian nation for its then emphatic support for the Vietnam War. Four <b>presidents</b> <b>have</b> traveled there since. Prior to arriving in Australia, Johnson visited New Zealand. He went primarily to shore up support for the war in Vietnam. Only one sitting <b>president</b> <b>has</b> visited since.|$|R

5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice <b>President</b> <b>had</b> an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> trust in her actions.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} <b>President</b> <b>had</b> the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E
