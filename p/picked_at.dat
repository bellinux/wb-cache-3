5|$|There were 31 {{compensatory}} selections {{distributed among}} 16 teams during rounds three through seven, with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills receiving 4 picks each. The University of Miami was the college {{with the most}} players selected in the first round, with Dan Morgan, Damione Lewis, Santana Moss and Reggie Wayne all <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> that stage. Across the whole draft, however, Florida State University had the most players selected, a total of nine compared to Miami's seven.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Sterling was <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> halfback {{in a poll}} {{to judge}} the best Australian team since the {{introduction}} of the limited-tackle rule in 1967. He won eight of fourteen votes, with the remainder going to Billy Smith, Ricky Stuart and Allan Langer.|$|E

25|$|Semiripe or turning-colour olives are <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> the {{beginning}} of the ripening cycle, when the colour has begun to change from green to multicolour shades of red to brown. Only the skin is coloured, as the flesh of the fruit lacks pigmentation at this stage, unlike that of ripe olives.|$|E
25|$|Ta'if rose plantation. In {{the month}} of April, the rose fields are filled with these small {{fragrant}} pink roses that are <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> dawn and later distilled into expensive Ta'if rose oil. The famous rose of Ta'if is the 30-petal damask rose which has a scent so robust, spicy, and dizzyingly complex, {{that it has been}} used in several luxury perfumes including Ormonde Jayne Perfumery, Chanel and Guerlain.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Parramatta Eels were <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> the {{beginning}} of the year by many leading betting agencies to take out the premiership for 2010 following their surge of form which took them to the Grand Final in 2009. But, after a relatively poor to the season, and then a 4-game winning streak, the Parramatta Eels once again returned to the inconsistent form of past seasons. This inconsistent form, recognised by all Rugby League fans, saw them miss out on the Top 8 in 2010.|$|E

25|$|On February 9, Kansas, Louisiana, and Washington {{held their}} contests. In the Kansas caucuses, Paul {{finished}} third, with 11% and no delegates. In the Louisiana primary, Paul finished third among current candidates (fourth overall, as Romney {{was still on}} the ballot) with 5%, though no delegates were at stake. In the Washington state caucuses, Paul placed third, with 22%, behind Huckabee (24%) and McCain (26%). Nearly half of Washington's delegates are <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> this caucus and the rest in the primary February 19, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{predominantly}} male {{environment in which}} she found herself, she never renounced her femininity, and would carry on dyeing her hair blonde, sending her friend Inna Pasportnikova {{to the hospital to}} fetch hydrogen peroxide for her. She would fashion scarves from parachute material, dyeing the small pieces in different colours and stitching them together and would not hide her love of flowers, which she <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> every available occasion, favouring red roses. She would make bouquets and keep them in the cockpit, which were promptly discarded by the male pilots who shared her aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Four {{subjects}} are <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> AS Level. Most year 11 students study General Studies AS, although several in each year group are selected to study Film Studies, or Environmental studies (both AS level). Options exclusive to A Level studies are: Economics, Government & Politics, Classical Civilisation, Sport Studies, Psychology and Philosophy {{as well as}} courses from down the school. There is also a Further Maths option, which enables a candidate to take two A Levels, one in Mathematics, one in Further Maths, over the two years. From 2013, the school no longer offers IB courses.|$|E

25|$|Production {{costs for}} this area's botrytized wines are {{comparatively}} high. The evaporation and fungus produce low yields, {{five to six}} times less than in other Bordeaux regions. The grapes are normally harvested individually from the bunch with pickers going through the vineyards several times between September and November {{to ensure that the}} grapes are <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> their optimal points. The wine is then fermented in small oak barrels, further adding to the cost. Even with half bottles of the First Growths priced at several hundred dollars, these wines still have difficulties turning a profit and in the mid 20th century a string of bad vintages drove many growers in the region out of business.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{synchronization}} can {{be turned}} off in favor of manually copying individual songs or complete playlists. iTunes supports copying music to an iPod; however, only music and videos purchased from the iTunes Store can be transferred from the iPod back to iTunes. This functionality was added after third-party software was written which allowed users to copy all content back to their computer. It is also possible to copy from the iPod using ordinary Unix command line tools, or by enabling hidden file viewing in Windows Explorer, then copying music from the iPod drive to a local disk for backup. Doing this can be confusing because the files are arranged {{in such a way}} that their folders and (depending on iPod and iTunes versions) file names are seemingly <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> random as they are put on the iPod. It is worth noting, however, that the files (along with their embedded title and artist information) remain unchanged. It is therefore less confusing to let iTunes reimport, reorganize, and rename all of the files after they are backed up.|$|E
25|$|One major storyline {{during this}} period was the {{discovery}} of Batch SW6, a group of clones of the early Legion (from their Adventure Comics days), created by the Dominators. Giffen's original conclusion for the storyline was that the clones would eventually have been revealed {{to be the real}} Legion, and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were actually the clones. The adult Legion's secret programming would kick in, forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death in which Legionnaires on both teams would die, with the victimsâ€™ names being <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> random. Afterwards, the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th-century version of the Omega Men in a new series while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth. Giffen's other conclusion was for several of the younger and older Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion. The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of defense for the United Planets as the Omega Men.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the album was recorded at Miraval Studios, France, <b>picked,</b> <b>at</b> keyboardist Cian Ciaran's request, because of its large live room which enabled all the band {{to set up and}} play as a group. The Super Furries wanted to [...] "go somewhere new and have a cultural experience" [...] while they recorded what is their eighth album together. Recording in France also enabled the band to get away from distractions such as [...] "clean the house". Additional recording took place at Rockfield Studios, Monmouth while string instruments were recorded at Metropolis Studios, London.|$|E
500|$|Scalia concurred in the 1990 case of Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, {{in which}} {{the family of a}} woman in a {{vegetative}} state sought to have her feeding tube removed so she would die, believing that to have been her wish. The Court found for the State of Missouri, requiring clear and convincing evidence of such a desire. Scalia stated that the Court should have remained away from the dispute and that the issues [...] "are [...] better known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are known to nine people <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> random from the Kansas City telephone directory".|$|E
500|$|From 1941, {{the regime}} became {{significantly}} more repressive. This was partly {{a result of}} the increasing demands on the German economy created by the invasion of the Soviet Union, as well as the decision to implement Nazi racial policies. From August 1941, the Military Government announced that for every German murdered by the resistance, five Belgian civilian hostages would be executed. Although the German military command, the [...] (OKW), had advised a ratio of 50 civilians for every one German soldier killed, von Falkenhausen moderated the policy and decreed that the hostages be selected from political prisoners and criminals rather than civilians <b>picked</b> <b>at</b> random. The systematic persecution of minorities (such as Jews, Roma and Freemasons) began from 1942, and was also coupled with much stricter repression of Belgian political dissent.|$|E
