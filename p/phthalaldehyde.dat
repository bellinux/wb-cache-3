40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{analysis}} of reaction products of <b>phthalaldehyde</b> with selected amino acids using {{the combination of}} high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Only one product with dihydroisoindole structure is formed {{in the case of}} simple amino acids (glycine, glycine ethyl ester, alanine, α-aminobutyric acid, valine, leucine and isoleucine). Reactions of <b>phthalaldehyde</b> with amino acids with two amino groups (lysine, asparagine, glutamine and arginine) yield different types of compounds. Main products are formed by the interaction of both of the amino groups with one molecule of <b>phthalaldehyde.</b> Apart from this type of product, these reactions also result in formation of the expected analogous structures of dihydroisoindoles. Moreover, the formation of products containing one molecule of amino acid and two molecules of <b>phthalaldehyde</b> is not excluded. The products were structurally analysed by the use of high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Reaction products of <b>phthalaldehyde</b> with α-aminobutyric acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine and lysine were isolated and further analyses such as electron ionisation with double focusing sector analyser and nuclear magnetic resonance were performed.

40|$|Cationic polyimines {{polymerized}} through aromatically conjugated bis-imine linkages and intra-molecular cross-linking {{were found}} to be a new class of effective transfection materials for their flexibility in structural optimization, responsiveness to intracellular environment, the ability to facilitate endosome escape and cytosol release of the nucleic acids, as well as self-metabolism. When three <b>phthalaldehydes</b> of different substitution positions were used to polymerize highly branched low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI- 1. 8 K), the product through ortho-phthalimines (named PPOP) showed significantly higher transfection activity than its two tere- and iso-analogues (named PPTP and PPIP). Physicochemical characterization confirmed the similarity of three polyimines in pH-responded degradability, buffer capacity, as well as the size and Zeta potential of the polyplexes formed from the polymers. A mechanistic speculation may be that the ortho-positioned bis-imine linkage of PPOP may only lead to the straight trans-configuration due to steric hindrance, resulting in larger loops of intra-polymer cross-linking and more flexible backbone...|$|R
40|$|Self-immolative polymers, which degrade by an {{end-to-end}} depolymerization {{mechanism in}} response to the cleavage of a stabilizing end-cap from the polymer terminus, are of increasing interest {{for a wide variety of}} applications ranging from sensors to controlled release. However, the preparation of these materials often requires expensive, multi-step monomer syntheses and the degradation products such as quinone methides or <b>phthalaldehydes</b> are potentially toxic to humans and the environment. We demonstrate here that polyglyxoylates can serve as a new and versatile class of self-immolative polymers. Polymerization of the commercially available monomer ethyl glyoxylate, followed by end-capping with a 6 -nitroveratryl carbonate provides a poly(ethyl glyoxylate) that depolymerizes selectively upon irradiation with UV light. Via ozonolysis of corresponding fumaric or maleic acid derivatives, a series of different glyoxylates were synthesized and polymerized, providing polyglyoxylates with different physical properties. Furthermore, using a multifunctional end-cap that is UV-responsive and also enables the conjugation of another polymer block via an azide-alkyne 2 ̆ 2 click 2 ̆ 2 cycloaddition, amphiphilic self-immolative block copolymers were prepared and self-assembled into light responsive micelles for drug delivery. Lastly, stimuli-responsive end-caps other than those responsive to UV light were also installed at the termini of poly(ethyl glyoxylate) to achieve polyglyoxylates responsive to other stimuli. Overall, these strategies are expected to greatly expand the utility of self-immolative polymers by providing access for the first time to self-immolative polymers with tunable properties that can be readily obtained from simple monomers and which depolymerize into non-toxic products...|$|R

However, if the {{reaction of}} <b>phthalaldehyde</b> with S-methyldithiocarbazate is carried out in the presence of nickel(II) and zinc(II) acetate salts, stable metal complexes of empirical formula, [M(phthalsme) ] (M = Ni, Zn; phthalsme = doubly deprotonated form of the Schiff base, <b>phthalaldehyde</b> bis(S-methyldithiocarbazonate) are obtained. Likewise, the reaction of N-methyl- 3 -thiosemicarbazide with phthaladehyde in the presence of nickel(II) acetate also yields a crystalline nickel(II) complex, [Ni(phthaltsc) ] (phthaltsc = doubly deprotonated form of the teradentate phthaladehyde bis(N-methyl- 3 -thiosemicarbazone) ligand.

In these complexes, the ligands are coordinated to the metal ion as dinegatively charged tetradentate chelating agents via the two thiolate sulfur atoms and the azomethine nitrogen atoms. The nickel complexes, [Ni(phthalsme) ] and [Ni(phthaltsc) ] exhibit a distorted square-planar geometry whereas the zinc complex, [Zn(phthalsme) (DMF) ] is five-coordinate and square-pyramidal with the dianionic Schiff base occupying the basal plane of the square-pyramid and the oxygen atom of dimethylformamide in the apical coordination site...|$|E

It was found that this salt, on acidification with ion exchange resin, afforded a mixture of 2 -nitro-indandiol- 1, 3 and 2 -nitroindenol- 3, which were separated by fractional crystallisation. The structures of the compounds obtained were established by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hence, the applicability of <b>phthalaldehyde</b> in the condensation with nitromethane, to form a five-membered carbocyclic ring, was nitromethane, to form a five-membered carbocyclic ring, was shown. On the other hand, when the reaction between <b>phthalaldehyde</b> and nitromethane was carried out without solvent, in the presence of sodium carbonate, the hemiacetal of 2 -(1 -hydroxy- 2 -nitroethyl) -benzaldehyde was exclusively formed. The structure of the latter was proved by means of chemical transformations leading to the isoquinoline system. For the study concerning the closure of a seven-membered ring, adipic aldehyde was chosen. Under all conditions investigated, no formation of a seven-membered carbo-cyclic ring was noticed.

40|$|Two major {{technical}} advances {{introduced by}} Brenner et al [l, 2] {{have been responsible}} for recent breakthroughs in understanding the process of glomerular ultrafiltration at the single nephron level. These are the development of a method for directly measuring glomerular capillary pressure [1] and the microadaptation of the colorimetric protein method of Lowry et al [2, 3] to estimate changes in colloid osmotic pressure between the afferent and efferent ends of the glomerular vasculature [4]. The good correlation between colloid osmotic pressure as calculated from the arterial protein concentrations and direct measurement of the colloid osmotic pressure has established the usefulness of the protein method to accurately measure intravascular oncotic forces [5]. Because the colorimetric Lowry microprotein method is both time consuming and necessitates the use of a frequently unstable, relatively high intensity colorimetric scale for sample reading, {{attempts have been made to}} use other microprotein techniques as substitutes for the Lowry method [6 – 9]. Viets et al [7] have compared the usefulness of two fluorescent microprotein methods in micropuncture studies. Of these, the <b>phthalaldehyde</b> fluorescent microprotein method was preferable and appeared to be equally as useful as the Lowry method, with certain minor limitations. Our laboratory has spent the last 2 years evaluating the applicability of the <b>phthalaldehyde</b> technique to microprotein analysis in micropuncture studies. Although we have found the method to have the advantage of being less time consuming than the Lowry technique, we have noted certain limitations and potential errors that could artificially lower the estimate of protein content in plasma samples. Spuriously low protein concentrations could result in under-estimations of afferent and efferent arteriolar oncotic pressures and overestimates of single nephron filtration fractions. This report is designed to describe the limitations of <b>phthalaldehyde</b> fluorescent protein technique and point out its potential errors in measuring protein concentration while comparing its usefulness to that of the colorimetric micro-Lowry method...|$|E

On the other hand, structurally related aldehydes such as 2 -methoxybenzaldehyde (21), 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde, and vanillin (23) were not active at {{the concentration of}} 1000 mg/L. By liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry the re{{activity of}} tested aldehydes against a synthetic peptide resembling the nematode cuticle was characterized. At the test concentration of 1 mM, the main adduct formation was observed for 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde (22), 2 -methoxybenzaldehyde (21), and 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde. Considering that 2 -methoxybenzaldehyde (21) and 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde were not active against M. incognita in in vitro experiments led us to hypothesize a different mechanism of action rather than {{an effect on the}} external cuticle modification of nematodes. When the toxicity of the V-ATPase inhibitor pyocyanin (10) was tested against M. incognita J 2 nematodes, an EC(50) at 24 h of 72 ± 25 mg/L was found. The redox-active compounds such as <b>phthalaldehyde</b> (1) and salicylaldehyde (2) may share a common mode of action inhibiting nematode V-ATPase enzyme. The results of this investigation reveal that aromatic redox-active aldehydes can be considered as potent nematicides, and further investigation is needed to completely clarify their mode of action...|$|E

The N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed domino Stetter-aldol-Michael dimerization of o-formyl chalcone derivatives 36 affords spiro bis-indane homo-dimers 38 in good yields and moderate to high diastereomeric ratios. Three carbon-carbon bonds, including the hindered quaternary center at the spiro ring junction, form at a remarkable rate under mild reaction conditions.

40|$|The {{molecular}} recognition properties exhibited by molecular containers have inspired supramolecular chemists to generate diverse and specialized macrocycles. The family of hosts known as cucurbiturils (CB[n]) {{have become a}} popular platform for {{molecular recognition}} due to their high binding affinities and selectivity in water. As CB[n] branch into increasingly complex applications it becomes important to find efficient pathways to prepare monofunctionalized CB[n] derivatives bearing reactive functional groups. Chapter 1 presents a literature review of the synthesis, properties, mechanism of formation, and applications of the CB[n] family. We use this background information to explain our key hypothesis, that templated reactions offer potential routes to obtain glycoluril oligomer building blocks that allow the preparation of monofunctionalized CB[n] compounds. Chapter 2 describes the templated synthesis of glycoluril hexamer (6 C) in a one step synthetic procedure on the gram scale using the p -xylylenediammonium ion (II- 11). Hexamer 6 C undergos cyclization with (substituted) phthalaldehdyes II- 12, II- 14, II- 15, II- 18 under acidic conditions at room temperature to deliver monofunctionalized CB[6] derivatives II- 13, II- 15, II- 16, and II- 19. Furthermore, the reaction kinetics for CB[6] cyclization between hexamer and formaldehyde or <b>phthalaldehyde</b> {{is influenced by the}} size and shape of ammonium ion templates. The larger size of the p - xylylenediammonium ion (II- 11) allows it to act as a negative template by discouraging transformation of hexamer and paraformaldehyde to form CB[6]. However, II- 11 and hexanediammonium ion (II- 20) act as positive templates during the reaction of 6 C and <b>phthalaldehyde</b> II- 12 by giving (±) - II- 21 as an intermediate along the mechanistic pathway to CB[6] derivative II- 13. Finally, a fluorescence turn-on assay was investigated using the fluorophore and metal-ion binding (e. g., Eu 3 +) of naphthalene- CB[6] derivative II- 19. The synthesis of monofunctionalized CB[6] derivatives in high yields has broad implications toward tailor-made approaches to CB[n] derived functional systems in the future. Chapter 3 describes the high yield synthesis of glycoluril pentamer (5 C) by the 3, 5 - dimethylphenol induced fragmentation of bis-ns-CB[10] under acid conditions. The access to large quantities of 5 C and 6 C and previously reported tetramer III- 4 allowed for a comparison of host-guest recognition properties of acyclic CB[n]-type receptors toward alkaneammonium ions in water...|$|E

Co-ZIF- 9 selectively oxidized the substrates and thus represents a promising heterogeneous {{catalyst for the}} oxidation of small aromatic substrates. Phthalan was converted to three different products, i. e. phthalide, <b>phthalaldehyde,</b> and small amounts of phthalic acid. In addition to phthalan, the alcohol functionality of vanillyl alcohol, veratryl alcohol, and cinnamyl alcohol was also similarly oxidized to yield the corresponding aldehydes in high yields and excellent selectivity. The effect of solvent, temperature and NaOH addition on the Co-ZIF- 9 catalytic system has been studied. The presence of NaOH in the solution greatly enhanced the oxidation activity. The structure and stability of the heterogeneous catalyst was probed by UV–vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy, confirming the coordination geometry of cobalt in the catalyst framework, thermal gravimetric analysis, establishing the thermal stability of the structure, and XRD to monitor crystallinity of the catalyst. The heterogeneous nature of the catalyst was established by a hot filtration experiment, ICP analysis of the liquid phase, and by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy on the hot filtered reaction mixture...|$|E
40|$|An {{introduction}} {{is presented}} {{to the nature of}} polarized and non-polarized transient spin resonance signals, produced by flash-photolysis e. s. r., followed by a description of the equipment used for experimental work. Theories of Chemically Induced Dynamic Electron Spin Polarization are reviewed and various models introduced to illustrate these concepts. A description is given of the first thorough investigation into the effect of CIDEP polarization transfer down a free radical chain and expands upon the consequences of hyperfine-dependent relaxation and the relative signs of coupling constants in various radical species. It concludes with an account of two methods of kinetic analysis which are the first practical demonstrations of their kind, and employ extension of expressions developed in earlier chapters. Studies are made of the CIDEP behaviour of radicals in high viscosity paraffins. A reassessment of previous published work is made: anomalous polarization behaviour was found to have been over-compensated for. A new method of extracting values for T 1 and T 2,/sub> is demonstrated for strong transient e. s. r. signals. A collection of experimental data relating to the previously unexplained absorptive polarization observed in the spectrum of ketyl radicals and the longer-time phase inversion of hyperfine-dependent CIDEP is given. The operation of Triplet Mechanism CIDEP in the ketyl radical systems is ruled out and a division of radicals into geminately formed and free-encounter pairs is shown to be incapable of explaining the observed phase changes. In its place a cross-relaxational mechanism, drawing upon simultaneously generated nuclear spin polarization is advanced. Conclusions are drawn that this may account for both anomalies. Lastly a photochemical application of CIDEP is demonstrated; two different reaction intermediates are identified upon photolysis of ortho <b>phthalaldehyde,</b> depending upon the quenching conditions. A reaction scheme consistent with all experimental data is proposed. A brief comment upon the photo-chemistry of indan 2 -one concludes this work. </p...|$|E
