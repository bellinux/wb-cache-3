40|$|Measurements of the {{differential}} pressures on two navy air-speed nozzles, {{consisting of a}} Zahm type <b>Pitot-Venturi</b> <b>tube</b> and a SQ- 16 two-pronged Pitot-static tube, in a tunnel air stream of fixed speed at various angles of pitch and yaw between 0 degrees and plus or minus 180 degrees. This shows for a range over - 20 degrees to + 20 degrees pitch and yaw, indicated air speeds varying very slightly over 2 per cent for the Zahm type and a maximum of about 5 per cent for the SQ- 16 type from the calibrated speed at 0 degree. For both types of air-speed nozzle the indicated air speed increases slightly as the tubes are pitched or yawed several degrees from their normal 0 degrees altitude, attains a maximum around plus or minus 15 degrees to 25 degrees, declines rapidly therefrom as plus or minus 40 degrees is passed, to zero {{in the vicinity of}} plus or minus 70 degrees to 100 degrees, and thence fluctuates irregular from thereabouts to plus or minus 180 degrees. The complete variation in indicated air speed for the two tubes over 360 degree pitch and yaw is graphically portrayed in figures 9 and 10. For the same air speed and 0 degree pitch and yaw {{the differential}} pressure of the Zahm type Pitot-Venturi nozzle is about seven times that of the SQ- 16 type two-prolonged Pitot-static nozzle...|$|E
