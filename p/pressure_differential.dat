5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} large <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate not exceeding 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E

Wind blowing directly toward a side of a structure may cause an increase in pressure at the structure wall in order to conserve {{the change in the}} momentum initiated by the change of wind velocity from the free stream area to almost zero at the wall side. A mechanistic model has been developed to predict <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> generated in response to different configurations of wind movements around a structure. Parametric analysis has been performed to characterize <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> generated from different wind configurations. The effect of wind-induced <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> on indoor radon entry and removal were characterized using general approach to entry and ventilation modeling and applied using constant values exhibited by the University of Florida Radon Research House.

40|$|At various time {{concerns}} have been expressed that rapid decompressions of compartments of gas pockets and thermal blankets during spacecraft launches {{may have caused}} <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> across their walls sufficient to cause minor structural failures, separations of adhesively-joined parts, ballooning, and flapping of blankets. This paper presents a close form equation expressing the expected <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> across {{the walls of a}} compartment {{as a function of the}} external to the volume pressure drops, the pressure at which the rates occur and the vent capability of the compartment. The pressure profiles measured inside the shrouds of several spacecraft propelled by several vehicles and some profiles obtained from ground vacuum systems have been included. The equation can be used to design the appropriate vent, which will preclude excessive <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials.</b> Precautions and needed approaches for the evaluations of the expected pressures have been indicated. Methods to make a rapid assessment of the response of the compartment to rapid external pressure drops have been discussed.

40|$|A Chandler 7600 Ultra HPHT Viscometer was setup {{to imitate}} well bore {{conditions}} of high pressure, high temperature wells, {{and the research}} objective {{was to investigate the}} reaction of Class H cement with 35 % silica and 0. 5 % nylon fiber to cyclic loading. This experimental setup facilitated the cyclic loading of the cement sheath by maintaining a constant confining pressure while the casing pressure was cycled. The fatigue endurance limit was found for 1, 000 psi and 2, 000 psi cyclic <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> for the Class H with added fiber and the results were compared with that of Class H cement without fiber. At 1, 000 psi <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials,</b> the cement with fiber remained intact until 15 cycles, whereas the cement without fiber failed at 14 cycles. At 2, 000 psi <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> the cement without nylon failed at 14 cycles, whereas the cement without nylon fiber failed at 13 cycles. These results clearly show that the cement with 0. 5 % nylon maintained integrity for one cycle longer for both 1, 000 and 2, 000 psi differentials tests when compared to the same cement without nylon fiber. The cement with added nylon therefore exhibits an increased tolerance to cyclic loading...|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a cargo hold with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms.

It appeared {{in this case that}} a short circuit caused an uncommanded rotation of the latch cams, which forced the weak locking sectors to distort and allow the rotation, thus enabling the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> and aerodynamic forces to blow the door off the fuselage, ripping away the hinge fixing structure, the cabin floor and side fuselage skin, causing the explosive decompression.|$|E

Methods:The hospital records of 108 patients with carotid subclavian transposition were retrospectively reviewed for preoperative symptoms, Doppler examination, arteriography, blood <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> and postoperative complications. Long-term patency and symptoms were determined during a follow-up examination including a history, physical examination, blood <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials,</b> Doppler examinations and arteriography in selected cases. Results:The indication for SCT were subclavian steal (78 %), upper extremity ischaemia (59 %), rest pain or acral necrosis (5 %), vertigo (6 %). There was no mortality, blood <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> were equalised in all patients without any early reocclusions. The complication rate was 15 % with a permanent morbidity of 3 %. Eighty-four patients (77 %) could be re-examined during follow-up. For them the overall patency after a mean observation period of 70 months (1 – 144 months) was 100 %. Conclusions:Subclavian carotid transposition is an excellent method for the treatment of proximal subclavian occlusive disease because of its exceptional long-term patency and low morbidity...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the mill water pumping systems at a North American manufacturing facility was conducted late las year and the following issues were observed: 1. Overpumping ? Both systems were overpumped to a significant degree against their calculated design conditions. As observed, each system was running + 1 pump more than required to meet the requirement. System 1 was overpumped by 25 %, or 1100 GPM, and System 2 was overpumped by 37 %, or 1850 GPM. Both systems may provide adequate heat rejection while operating three pumps each. 2. Check Valve induced Pump Failure ? While attempting to take readings, both systems exhibited check valve failure to hold. This failure causes significant short-circuiting of water to the cold well, causing flow instabilities, surging, and low pressure alarms. Finally, water flow reversals cause significant and premature damage to vertical turbine pumps not equipped with non-reversing ratchets. It is advisable to revise operational sequence to eliminate pump staging to minimize future pump failures. 3. High <b>Pressure</b> <b>Differentials</b> ? Observed end of system <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> were in excess of 50 PSIG with adjacent equipment served requiring 15 - 17 PSIG <b>differential.</b> High <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> will result in velocity erosion and premature valve/heat exchanger failure, {{and should be addressed}} immediately to minimize additional equipment damage and potential system shutdown...|$|R
