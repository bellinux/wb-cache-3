40|$|AbstractObjectivesPediatric {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass {{involves the}} creation of a large obligatory priming reservoir. <b>Packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> are {{an essential part of the}} cardiopulmonary bypass priming solution in children. The storage media in <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> might cause significant acid-base, glucose, and electrolyte imbalances, which have been associated with severe complications. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of fresh (≤ 5 days) versus old (> 5 days) stored <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> added to the priming solutions of pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. MethodsBlood samples were drawn from cardiopulmonary bypass priming of 30 consecutive pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Fresh (≤ 5 days old) stored <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> were added to the priming solution in group 1, and old (> 5 days old) stored <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> were added to the priming solution in group 2. In each group blood samples were drawn from the <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> on arrival to the operating room and from the priming solution immediately after <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> were added and after 20 minutes of prime circulation. Samples were also collected at the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass and after 30 minutes. The last sample was collected on arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit. The levels of potassium, glucose, and lactate and the acid-base balance were analyzed in each sample. ResultsThere was a linear increase in potassium levels in <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> samples with increasing <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> age, ranging from 5. 4 to 18. 4 mEq/L. Significant differences in the concentrations of potassium, glucose, and lactate and the acid-base balance were found when comparing old and fresh <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> in samples taken during the <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> and early prime time. Those differences resolved after 20 minutes of reconstitution of the priming solution. The age of the <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> had no effect on the samples taken during bypass and those taken in the pediatric intensive care unit. ConclusionThe significantly higher concentration of potassium and lactate and lower pH in old stored <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> has a minimal effect on the final constitution of priming solution before and during cardiopulmonary bypass in children undergoing corrective cardiac surgery...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This article {{summarizes}} the current data on <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> transfusion in the pediatric {{intensive care unit}} setting to help providers make evidence-based decisions regarding <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> transfusions.

CONCLUSIONS: The use of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> transfusions is common in the pediatric intensive care unit setting. However, until recently there have been little data to guide providers in this practice. Studies in adult intensive care units have shown less favorable outcomes in patients who received <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> transfusions.

5000|$|Hematocrit is also {{sometimes}} called {{packed cell volume}} (PCV), volume of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> (VPRC), or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF). The term hematocrit comes from the Ancient Greek words haima (αἷμα, [...] "blood") and kritēs (κριτής, [...] "judge"). Together, hematocrit means [...] "to separate blood". It was coined by Magnus Blix at Uppsala in 1891 as haematokrit, modeled after lactokrit, which was used in dairy farming.|$|E
50|$|While known {{hematocrit}} {{levels are}} used in detecting conditions, it may fail at times due to hematocrit being the measure of concentration of red blood cells through volume in a blood sample. It {{does not account for}} the mass of the red blood cells, and thus the changes in mass can alter a hematocrit level or go undetected while affecting a subject's condition. Additionally, there have been cases in which the blood for testing was inadvertently drawn proximal to an intravenous line that was infusing <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> or fluids. In these situations, the hemoglobin level in the blood sample will not be the true level for the patient because the sample will contain a large amount of the infused material rather than what is diluted into the circulating whole blood. That is, if <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> are being supplied, the sample will contain a large amount of those cells and the hematocrit will be artificially very high. On the converse, if saline or other fluids are being supplied, the blood sample would be diluted and the hematocrit will be artificially low.|$|E

50|$|In 1964, IBM {{received}} {{a grant from}} the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This was a result of an IBM engineer, George T. Judson, requesting to work on a continuous-flow blood centrifuge. He had observed the need for such a machine when visiting NCI in 1962 after his son was diagnosed with leukemia. As a result of this work, IBM developed the NCI-IBM Blood Cell Separator which was announced in 1965. At that announcement, Judson and his co-worker Alan Jones were approached by Dr. James R. Pert, Director of the American Red Cross Blood Research program in Washington, DC. He told them of the need for a machine to separate <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> from glycerol. The glycerol is added to the red cells to protect the cells during freezing. The Processor was announced in September 1972 at the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) in Washington, DC.|$|E
50|$|Safe and {{effective}} alternative treatment often exists so that FFP {{is no longer}} the therapy of choice in many conditions. Cryoprecipitate should be used when fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor is needed. For treatment of hemophilia A, cryoprecipitate or factor VIII concentrates, heated or unheated, are available. For treatment of severe hemophilia B, factor IX complex is preferable. Both of these concentrates are prepared from pooled plasma, and the risk of virus transmission is negligible as there hasn't been an infection since 1985 when techniques were developed to kill off viruses including HIV. The factor IX concentrate carries the additional hazard of thrombogenicity.Crystalloid, colloid solutions containing human serum albumin or plasma protein fraction, hydroxyethyl starch, and dextran are preferable to FFP for volume replacement. The practice of administering both <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> and FFP to the same patient should be discouraged, as this adds to the cost and doubles the infection rate.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{roots of}} IBM's {{development of the}} IBM 2997 Blood cell Separator lay in the personal tragedy of one of IBM's development engineers, George Judson. In 1962, Judson's son, Tom, was diagnosed with leukemia. His physician was able to have Tom admitted to the Clinical Center of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). On admission, they showed Judson a procedure to remove white blood cells from a patient. It was laborious. They would remove two units (450 ml) of blood, spin them in a bucket centrifuge, express the plasma into a satellite bag, and the white cells into another satellite bag. The <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> and the plasma would be recombined and administered to the patient. This would be repeated over and over. Judson, being an engineer, suggested {{that this could be}} done on a continuous-flow basis. He was sent to see Dr. Emil J. Freireich who expressed enthusiasm for the project. Judson returned to IBM and asked for a year's leave of absence to work on his ideas. IBM gave him the one-year leave with pay and provided engineering assistance. His work {{led to the development of}} the NCI Blood Cell Separator and later to the IBM 2990 Blood Cell Separator which could harvest white blood cells from blood donors, to support leukemia patients to keep them alive. The subsequent development of the machine as the IBM 2997, essentially a continuous centrifuge which separated the blood into red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood plasma (used in plasmapheresis), was picked up by IBM's Systems Supplies Division (SSD) which was already ready marketing the IBM 2991 Blood cell Processor. The (disposable) supplies element represented a large part of the revenue stream.The IBM 2997 machine was developed in USA in the 1970s, but the most remarkable applications were in Italy Milan, they were by Girolamo Sirchia, MD and Dr. Marconi in Centro TRasfusionale & Transplant North Italy.

In this setting, receipt of blood transfusions seems to be {{associated}} with a higher risk of acute kidney injury, as measured using serum creatinine values. We examined this association further by using urinary biomarkers of kidney injury. MethodsA total of 1210 adults underwent cardiac surgery and were divided into 3 groups {{on the basis of the}} receipt of intraoperative <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> units: no blood (n =  894), 2 or less <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> units (n =  206), and more than 2 <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> units (n =  110). Acute kidney injury was defined as (1) doubling of serum creatinine from the preoperative value; (2) first postoperative urinary interleukin- 18 in the fifth quintile; and (3) first postoperative urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in the fifth quintile. We determined the relative risk for acute kidney injury outcome according to <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> units group after adjusting for 12 preoperative and surgical variables. By using the Sobel test for mediation analysis, we also evaluated the role of biomarkers in causing acute kidney injury through alternative pathways. ResultsAcute kidney injury was more common in those who received more than 2 <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> units.  In patients receiving more than 2 <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> units, the adjusted relative risks were 2. 3 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 4. 4, P. 01), 1. 36 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 1. 9, P. 05), and 1. 34 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 1. 8, P. 06) for doubling of serum creatinine, urinary interleukin- 18 in the fifth quintile (> 60 pg/mL), and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in the fifth quintile (> 102 ng/mL), respectively. Furthermore, the effect of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> units transfusion on acute kidney injury was partially mediated by interleukin- 18.

The results are as follows. (1) The count of erythrocytes begin to increase rapidly from the late stage of pregnancy and the count reaches maximum level at the 25 th day of pregnancy. But thereafter the count of them very decrease and reaches minimum level at parturiton. It recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition. The amount of hemoglobin does not show a marked change during pregnancy, parturition and lactation, but it decreases slightly from before to after parturition. The hematocrit, volume of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> decrease rapidly from the late stage of pregnancy and the volume reaches minimum level at parturition, but thereafter it increases gradually and recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition. The mean corpuscular diameter and volume become small gradually from the late stage of pregnancy and it reaches minimum level at the 25 th day of pregnancy, but thereafter it becomes large in size and recovers to a nomal value on one month after parturition. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin decrese gradully from the late stage of pregnancy and it reaches minimum level at the 25 th day of pregnanancy, but thereafter it increases and recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration increase rapidly from the late stage of pregnancy and it reaches maximum level atparturion, but thereafter it decreases and recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition.

40|$|Aim : This {{study was}} {{designed}} to find out the factors influencing mortality in trauma patients receiving massive blood transfusion (MBT). Materials and Methods : Records of all patients admitted during December 2007 to November 2008 at a Level I Trauma Center emergency and who underwent massive transfusion (&# 8805; 10 units of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> in 24 h) were retrospectively analyzed. Death during the hospital stay was considered as the study outcome and various demographic, laboratory, and clinical parameters were included as its potential determinants. Statistical Analysis : Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to identify the risk factors associated with mortality. Results : Of the 4054 transfused patients who were admitted to the trauma center during the study period, 71 (1. 8 &#x 0025;) patients underwent massive transfusion. Of this, there were 37 survivors and 34 nonsurvivors (48 &#x 0025;). The median overall ISS was 27 (22 - 34). The patients who died had shorter mean length of hospital stay, shorter mean duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and low admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) compared to the survivors (P < 0. 01). The mean prothrombin time (PT) and the mean activated partial thromboplastin time was significantly high (P < 0. 01) among nonsurvivors. Total leukocyte count (TLC &# 8805; 10, 000 cells/cubic mm), GCS &# 8804; 8, the presence of coagulopathy and major vascular surgery were the four independent determinants of mortality in multivariate logistic regression analysis.
