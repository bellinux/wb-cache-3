5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding <b>prima</b> facie rights, and some <b>prima</b> facie rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily <b>prima</b> facie rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground <b>prima</b> facie rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These <b>prima</b> facie rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E

50|$|<b>Primas</b> {{was raised}} in Camden, New Jersey {{as a member of}} one of the city's most {{prominent}} families. He earned a bachelor's degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C., in 1971. <b>Primas</b> then joined the Black People's Unity Movement when he returned to Camden. Before becoming mayor, <b>Primas</b> was the Vice President of Burger King Entities, an economic-development program sponsored by the Black People's Unity Movement.|$|R
2500|$|In 1981, Randy <b>Primas</b> {{was elected}} mayor of Camden, but was {{unfortunately}} [...] "haunted by the overpowering legacy of financial disinvestment". Following his election, {{the state of}} New Jersey closed the $4.6 million deficit that <b>Primas</b> had inherited, but also decided that <b>Primas</b> should lose budgetary control until he began providing the state with monthly financial statements, among other requirements. When he regained control, <b>Primas</b> had limited options regarding how to close the deficit, and so {{in an attempt to}} renew Camden, <b>Primas</b> campaigned for the city to adopt two different nuisance industries: a prison and a trash-to-steam incinerator. While these two industries would provide some financial security for the city, the proposals for them did not go over well with residents, who overwhelmingly opposed both the prison and the incinerator.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, the Filipino Associated Broadcasting Company leased its airtime to the Malaysian {{broadcaster}} Media <b>Prima</b> (through {{the local}} subsidiary MPB Primedia) similar to an LMA – with MPB Primedia providing entertainment programming, and ABC handling news programming and operations. Soon afterward, ABC and Media <b>Prima</b> were sued by rival media company GMA {{for attempting to}} use the partnership to skirt laws requiring domestic ownership of broadcasters. In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run. The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media <b>Prima</b> announced it would divest its ownership in the network to PLDT's broadcasting subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no <b>prima</b> facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a <b>prima</b> facie right not to be made to suffer and a <b>prima</b> facie right not to be killed.|$|E
5|$|Given {{there is}} no {{standardized}} format {{for the creation of}} text-based walkthroughs, guides exist that contain extensive examples and step-by-step instructions on how to write text-based walkthrough content. <b>Prima</b> Games and Computer and Video Games have produced walkthroughs. <b>Prima</b> Games produces official, dedicated text-based video game walkthroughs and strategy guides for a variety of video games in both print and digital formats. Computer and Video Games (CVG) published both text and video based walkthroughs of video games on their website and official YouTube channel until their closure by Future in February of 2015 in asset consolidation between various Future brands. IGN also creates and publishes video game walkthroughs in both text and video formats.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} Kampoeng Rawa emerged in 2004, {{when a group}} of farmers and {{fishermen}} from the Rawa Pening area received a billion rupiah grant from the Artha <b>Prima</b> Credit Union. They decided to establish a tourist attraction through which they could sell their wares (later extended to include arts and crafts) while raising awareness of and protecting the Rawa Pening ecosystem. In preparation for the 2013 Visit Jateng campaign, in 2011 they began planning a complex which would include culinary tourism and water activities. Artha <b>Prima</b> trained some locals as wait staff, cashiers, and security guards.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of the Presbytery of Paisley the Scottish Privy Council set up a {{commission}} to investigate the case.

5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina <b>Prima</b> province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire.

However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.|$|E

5|$|Controversy hit the Championship in the 1921–22 season {{which saw}} the major clubs (including Pro Vercelli, Bologna and Juventus) in {{dispute with the}} FIGC. The best 24 teams had asked for a {{reduction}} in the number of clubs in the top division in accordance with a plan drawn up by Vittorio Pozzo, the Italian national team coach. Pozzo's plan was dismissed and the CCI (Italian: Confederazione Calcistica Italiana) was founded and organised a 1921–22 CCI league (<b>Prima</b> Divisione) to run concurrently with the 1921–22 season (<b>Prima</b> Categoria) organised by the FIGC. Therefore, that season saw two champions: Novese (FIGC) and Pro Vercelli (CCI). The schism ended when FIGC accepted to reduce the Northern Championship 1922–23 to only 36 clubs ("Compromesso Colombo/Colombo compromise"); from 1923–24 the Northern Championship was reduced to 24 clubs divided into two groups.|$|E
5|$|During the Samaritan {{revolt of}} 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its {{walls and the}} Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I.

A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.|$|E

5|$|The First Crusade {{was also}} an {{inspiration}} to artists in later centuries. In 1580, Torquato Tasso wrote Jerusalem Delivered, a largely fictionalized epic poem about the capture of Jerusalem. George Frideric Handel composed music based on Tasso's poem in his opera Rinaldo.

5|$|The {{specimen}} NIGP127587 was preserved {{with the}} remains of a lizard in its gut region, indicating that small, fast-moving animals made up part of the diet of Sinosauropteryx <b>prima.</b> Numerous lizards of this type have been found in the same rocks as Sinosauropteryx. These lizards have been interpreted as most likely belonging to the genus Dalinghosaurus. Dalinghosaurus was probably a fast-running lizard adapted to living in open habitats, much like Sinosauropteryx itself.|$|E
