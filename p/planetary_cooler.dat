40|$|The {{very limited}} amount of global {{contraction}} observed on Mercury's surface poses severe constraints on models of the planet's thermo-chemical evolution and current models rely on a very refractory, Thorium rich composition to slow <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling.</b> However, a refractory composition appears to be incompatible with evidence for pyroclastic eruptions, which require {{a substantial amount of}} volatiles to be present in the planetary interior. Furthermore, volcanic activity appears to have been ongoing for a considerable part of the planet's history, while current models predict an early cessation of crustal production. To address these inconsistencies we have reinvestigated the thermo-chemical evolution of Mercury using a non-refractory compositional model, taking the presence of a thermally insulating regolith layer into account. We find that models with a stiff mantle rheology satisfy the observational constraints if the regolith layer is at least 2 km thick. In these models, inefficient mantle convection and thermal insulation significantly slow <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> and prolong the phase of crustal production to 2. 5 Gyr after core formation, allowing the volume increase associated with mantle differentiation to offset some of the radial contraction caused by <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling.</b> Models furthermore predict substantial core sulfur contents above 6 wt. %, average crustal thicknesses between 10 and 40 km, and secular cooling rates of 30 K/Gyr...|$|R

The smaller extent of the smooth and very smooth plains units, {{compared with that of}} older plains materials, suggests considerable heterogeneity of mercurian crustal materials.

Ridges of domical cross section cut some c4 craters and, at places, flank areas of young, very smooth plains material. Thus, possible volcanic extrusions associated with tectonic activity may have continued into the period of formation of c4 craters and the oldest very smooth plains material.|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time, the direct {{radiative}} effect (DRE) of aerosols on solar radiation is computed {{over the entire}} Mediterranean basin, {{one of the most}} climatically sensitive world regions, by using a deterministic spectral radiation transfer model (RTM). The DRE effects on the outgoing shortwave radiation at the top of atmosphere (TOA), DRETOA, on the absorption of solar radiation in the atmospheric column, DREatm, and on the downward and absorbed surface solar radiation (SSR), DREsurf and DREnetsurf, respectively, are computed separately. The model uses input data for the period 2000 – 2007 for various surface and atmospheric parameters, taken from satellite (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, ISCCP-D 2), Global Reanalysis projects (National Centers for Environmental Prediction – National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCEP/NCAR), and other global databases. The spectral aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical depth, AOD, asymmetry parameter, gaer and single scattering albedo, &omega;aer), are taken from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and they are Supplemented by the Global Aerosol Data Set (GADS). The model SSR fluxes have been successfully validated against measurements from 80 surface stations of the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) covering the period 2000 – 2007. A <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> is found above the Mediterranean on an annual basis (regional mean DRETOA = − 2. 4 Wm− 2 ). Though <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> is found over most of the region, up to − 7 Wm− 2 , large positive DRETOA values (up to + 25 Wm− 2 ) are found over North Africa, indicating a strong planetary warming, as well as over the Alps (+ 0. 5 Wm− 2 ). Aerosols are found to increase the absorption of solar radiation in the atmospheric column over the region (DREatm = + 11. 1 Wm− 2 ) and to decrease SSR (DREsurf = − 16. 5 Wm− 2 and DREnetsurf − 13. 5 Wm− 2 ) inducing thus significant atmospheric warming and surface radiative cooling. The calculated seasonal and monthly DREs are even larger, reaching − 25. 4 Wm− 2 (for DREsurf).

Even this modicum of warming may never be realized, however, for it could be negated by a number of <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> forces that are intensified by warmer temperatures and by the strengthening of biological processes that are enhanced by the same rise in atmospheric CO 2 concentration that drives the warming. Several of these cooling forces have individually been estimated to be of equivalent magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the typically predicted greenhouse effect of a doubling of the air's CO 2 content, which suggests to me that little net temperature change will ultimately result from the ongoing buildup of CO 2 in Earth's atmosphere.

A secondary aim was to put constraints on the age of features controlling hydrothermal circulation in off-axis setting.

The age of the system was determined using several different methods. Traditional stratigraphic analysis was accompanied by crater counting of units that overlap the thrust system and by using the buffered crater-counting technique, allowing us to determine an absolute model age for the tectonic feature. These complementary methods give consistent results, implying that activity on the thrust ended between 3. 5 and 3. 7 Ga, depending on the adopted absolute-age model.

40|$|Convection in an {{isolated}} planet is characterized by narrow downwellings and broad updrafts—consequences of Archimedes’ principle, the cooling required by the second law of thermodynamics, {{and the effect of}} compression on material properties. A mature cooling planet with a conductive low-viscosity core develops a thick insulating surface boundary layer with a thermal maximum, a subadiabatic interior, and a cooling highly conductive but thin boundary layer above the core. Parts of the surface layer sink into the interior, displacing older, colder material, which is entrained by spreading ridges. Magma characteristics of intraplate volcanoes are derived from within the upper boundary layer. Upper mantle features revealed by seismic tomography and that are apparently related to surface volcanoes are intrinsically broad and are not due to unresolved narrow jets. Their morphology, aspect ratio, inferred ascent rate, and temperature show that they are passively responding to downward fluxes, as appropriate for a cooling planet that is losing more heat through its surface than is being provided from its core or from radioactive heating. Response to doward flux is the inverse of the heat-pipe/mantle-plume mode of <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling.</b> Shear-driven melt extraction from the surface boundary layer explains volcanic provinces such as Yellowstone, Hawaii, and Samoa.

In this work we show that an area of smooth plains including a buried 500 -km-diameter impact basin experienced two different stages of deformation. The younger deformation stage {{is characterized by a}} set of NW–SE oriented wrinkle ridges affecting the smooth plains and having the same approximate orientation as the wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps deforming the surrounding terrains. The older set of tectonic structures consists of NE–SW oriented, closely spaced, subparallel, quasi-rectilinear and low-relief ridges, partially buried by the smooth plains material and crossed by the wrinkle ridges. Therefore, our results suggest that several events occurred between both deformation stages: at least one stage of basin filling; a change in stress orientation, an increasing in the avelength and amplitude of deformation, and maybe an increasing of the thickness of the deformed layer. Our observations imply a complex stress history for compressive deformation, maybe influenced by the internal and/or orbital/rotational history of Mercury, and are illustrative of the complexity of tectonic history likely to have affected many or most other regions of the planet...|$|R

Incoming irradiation directly heats just their thin outer layer, down to pressures of similar to 0. 1 bars. In standard irradiated evolution models of hot Jupiters, predicted transit radii are too small. Previous {{studies have shown}} that deeper heating-at {{a small fraction of the}} heating rate from irradiation-can explain observed radii. Here we present a suite of evolution models for HD 209458 b, where we systematically vary both the depth and intensity of internal heating, without specifying the uncertain heating mechanism(s). Our models start with a hot, high-entropy planet whose radius decreases as the convective interior cools. The applied heating suppresses this cooling. We find that very shallow heating-at pressures of 1 - 10 bars-does not significantly suppress cooling, unless the total heating rate is greater than or similar to 10 % of the incident stellar power. Deeper heating, at 100 bars, requires heating at only 1 % of the stellar irradiation to explain the observed transit radius of 1. 4 R(Jup) after 5 Gyr of cooling. In general, more intense and deeper heating results in larger hot-Jupiter radii. Surprisingly, we find that heat deposited at 10 (4) bars-which is exterior to approximate to 99 % of the planet's mass-suppresses <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> as effectively as heating at the center.

Our data confirm the presence of genetically admixed individuals in the Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic, and temperate Eastern Atlantic regions, suggesting introgressive hybridization upon secondary contact following the initial species divergence. Conservative substitution rates fitted to an Isolation with Migration (IM) model indicate a likely species divergence time of 2. 34 Ma, using the mitochondrial sequence DNA, which in conjunction with the geographic distribution of admixtures and Pacific signatures likely indicates speciation associated with processes other than the closing of the Isthmus of Panama. This time span coincides with further <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> in the early Quaternary period followed by the onset of oscillating glacial-interglacial cycles.

40|$|The present {{infrared}} {{brightness of}} a planet originates partly from the accretion energy that the planet gained during its formation and hence provides important constraints to the planet formation process. A planet cools down from a hot initial state to the present state by losing energy through radiative emission from its atmosphere. Thus, the atmospheric properties affect the <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> rate. Previous theories of giant planet cooling assume that the atmospheric composition is unchanged throughout evolution. Planet formation theories, however, suggest that the atmospheres especially of ice giants are rich in heavy elements in the early stages. Those heavy elements include condensable species such as water, ammonia, and methane, which {{are expected to have}} a great impact on atmospheric temperature and, thus, radiative emission through latent heat release. In this study we investigate the effect of such condensation on the planetary emission flux and quantify the impact on the cooling timescale. We then demonstrate that the latent heat of those species keeps the atmosphere hot and thus the emission flux high for billions of years, resulting in acceleration of the cooling of ice giants. This sheds light on the long-standing problem that Uranus is much less bright than theoretically predicted and is different in brightness from Neptune in spite of similarity in mass and radius. Also, we find that young ice giants with highly enriched atmospheres are much brighter in mid-infrared than those with unenriched atmospheres.

Our analytical treatment is a generalization of a previous analysis of localized "point sources". We model the deposition profile as a power law in the optical depth and find that <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> and contraction halt when the internal luminosity (i. e. cooling rate) of the planet drops below the heat deposited in the planet's convective region. A slowdown in the evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources which do not extend to the planet's center.

Our model can account for the observed radii of most inflated planets which have equilibrium temperatures ≈ 1500 K- 2500 K, and are inflated to a radius ≈ 1. 6 R_J. However, some extremely inflated planets remain unexplained by our model. We also argue that Ohmically inflated planets have already reached their equilibrium phase, and no longer contract. Following Wu & Lithwick who argued that Ohmic heating could only suspend and not reverse contraction, we calculate the time it takes Ohmic heating to re-inflate a cold planet to its equilibrium configuration.

We report the discovery of K 2 - 97 b, a 1. 31 ± 0. 11 R_J, 1. 10 ± 0. 11 M_J planet orbiting a 4. 20 ± 0. 14 R⊙, 1. 16 ± 0. 12 M⊙ red giant star with an orbital period of 8. 4 days. We precisely constrained stellar and planetary parameters by combining asteroseismology, spectroscopy, and granulation noise modeling along with transit and radial velocity measurements. The uncertainty in planet radius is dominated by systematic differences in transit depth, which we measure to be up to 30 % between different light-curve reduction methods. Our calculations indicate the incident flux on this planet was 170 ^(+ 140) _(- 60) times the incident flux on Earth, while the star was on the main sequence. Previous studies suggest that this incident flux is insufficient to delay <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> enough to explain the present planet radius.

40|$|The {{decline of}} Mars' global {{magnetic}} field some 3. 8 - 4. 1 {{billion years ago}} is thought to reflect {{the demise of the}} dynamo that operated in its liquid core. The dynamo was probably powered by <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> and so its termination is intimately tied to the thermochemical evolution and present-day physical state of the Martian core. Bottom-up growth of a solid inner core, the crystallization regime for Earth's core, has been found to produce a long-lived dynamo leading to the suggestion that the Martian core remains entirely liquid to this day. Motivated by the experimentally-determined increase in the Fe-S liquidus temperature with decreasing pressure at Martian core conditions, we investigate whether Mars' core could crystallize from the top down. We focus on the "iron snow" regime, where newly-formed solid consists of pure Fe and is therefore heavier than the liquid. We derive global energy and entropy equations that describe the long-timescale thermal and magnetic history of the core from a general theory for two-phase, two-component liquid mixtures, assuming that the snow zone is in phase equilibrium and that all solid falls out of the layer and remelts at each timestep. Formation of snow zones occurs {{for a wide range of}} interior and thermal properties and depends critically on the initial sulfur concentration, x 0. Release of gravitational energy and latent heat during growth of the snow zone do not generate sufficient entropy to restart the dynamo unless the snow zone occupies at least 400 km of the core. Snow zones can be 1. 5 - 2 Gyrs old, though thermal stratification of the uppermost core, not included in our model, likely delays onset. Models that match the available magnetic and geodetic constraints have x 0 ~ 10 % and snow zones that occupy approximately the top 100 km of the present-day Martian core...|$|R
40|$|The intense {{irradiation}} {{received by}} hot Jupiters suppresses convection {{in the outer}} layers of their atmospheres and lowers their cooling rates. "Inflated" hot Jupiters, i. e., those with anomalously large transit radii, require additional sources of heat or suppressed cooling. We consider the effect of forced turbulent mixing in the radiative layer, which could be driven by atmospheric circulation or by another mechanism. Due to stable stratification in the atmosphere, forced turbulence drives a downward flux of heat. Weak turbulent mixing slows the cooling rate by this process, as if the planet was irradiated more intensely. Stronger turbulent mixing buries heat into the convective interior, provided the turbulence extends to the radiative-convective boundary. This inflates the planet until a balance is reached between the heat buried into and radiated from the interior. We also include the direct injection of heat due to the dissipation of turbulence or other effects. Such heating is already known to slow <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling.</b> We find that dissipation also enhances heat burial from mixing by lowering the threshold for turbulent mixing to drive heat into the interior. Strong turbulent mixing of heavy molecular species such as TiO {{may be necessary to}} explain stratospheric thermal inversions. We show that the amount of mixing required to loft TiO may overinflate the planet by our mechanism. This possible refutation of the TiO hypothesis deserves further study. Our inflation mechanism requires a deep stratified layer that only exists when the absorbed stellar flux greatly exceeds the intrinsic emitted flux. Thus it would be less effective for more luminous brown dwarfs and for longer period gas giants, including Jupiter and Saturn. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|Energy sources {{involved}} {{in the early stages}} of planetary formation can cause partial or even complete melting of the mantle of terrestrial bodies leading to the formation of magma oceans. Upon <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling,</b> solidification is expected to take place from the bottom upwards because of the steeper slope of the liquid adiabat with respect to the liquidus (Elkins-Tanton, 2012; Solomatov, 2015). Fractional solidification, in particular, can lead to the formation of a compositional layering that can play a fundamental role for the subsequent long-term dynamics and evolution of the interior (Tosi et al., 2013; Plesa et al., 2014). In order to assess to what extent primordial compositional heterogeneities generated upon magma ocean solidification can be preserved, we investigate the cooling and solidification of a whole-mantle magma ocean along with the conditions that allow solid-state convection to start mixing the mantle before solidification has completed. To this end, we run 2 -D numerical simulations in cylindrical geometry using the finite-volume code GAIA (Hüttig et al., 2013). We treat the liquid magma ocean in a parametrized fashion while we self-consistently solve the conservation equations of thermochemical convection in the growing solid mantle accounting for pressure-, temperature- and melt-dependent rheology. We consider two end-member cases: fractional crystallization, where melt is instantaneously extracted into the overlying liquid leaving beneath a differentiated mantle, and batch crystallization where melt remains in contact with the silicate matrix throughout solidification causing no differentiation. By testing the effects of different cooling rates and Rayleigh numbers, we show that for a lifetime of the liquid magma ocean between 1 and 10 Myr (Lebrun et al., 2013), the onset of solid state convection prior to complete mantle crystallization is possible and that part or even all of the compositional heterogeneities generated upon fractionation can be erased by efficient mantle stirring (Figure 1). We discuss the consequences of our findings in relation to the early and long-term evolution of compositional heterogeneities generated via fractional crystallization of magma oceans in terrestrial bodies with emphasis on Mars' thermochemical history...|$|R

40|$|Two {{remarkable}} {{aspects of}} the population of impact craters on Venus are that craters at all sizes are indistinguishable from a random population and that most craters have not been significantly modified by tectonic strain or by volcanic flows external to the crater rim, despite evidence from Magellan images that volcanic and tectonic features are widespread on Venus. One interpretation of these observations {{is that most of the}} surface dates from the end of a catastrophic global resurfacing event that ceased about 500 My ago, and that a small fraction of craters volcaniclly embayed or modified by deformation indicate that volcanic and tectonic activity subsequent to that time has been at much lower levels. A competing scenario, in which resurfacing occurs episodically in patches a few hundred kilometers in extent and there is a wider spectrum of surface ages, also appears to be consistent with the characteristics of impact craters on Venus. While geological and statistical studies of the crater population on Venus offer some promise for distinguishing between these two hypotheses, consideration of the possible mechanisms of catastrophic episodic resurfacing provides an independent perspective. Potential mechanisms for catastrophic resurfacing of Venus range from geologically sudden convective destabilization of the global lithosphere to strongly time-dependent heat flux and melt generation in the underlying mantle. For most of these mechanisms, resurfacing occurs implicitly or explicitly by volcanism. An alternative hypothesis is that, at least in the geologically recent history of Venus, the primary resurfacing mechanism has been tectonic deformation rather than volcanism. Because the rate of surface strain should be controlled by the temperature-dependent strength of the lower crust, a geologically rapid transition in surface strain rates should be the natural result of <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling.</b> This transition would occur at comparable times for areas of similar crustal thickness and heat flow, but would be delayed for regions of thicker or hotter crust. The end of the era of high rates of tectonic resurfacing could thus appear as a 'catastrophe' over the 80 % of the planet with an elevation within 1 Km of the mean, while continued deformation would give rise to 'episodic' resurfacing to much younger times in the highlands, a result consistent with lower crater densities seen in highland regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of stars and}} planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} exoplanets close to their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as a function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. The model is shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more sophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It naturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the opacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I further show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T 4) is conserved in the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This implies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as outer boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models pertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant to the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day models yield deep temperatures that are ~ 1000 K too cold to explain the present size of planet HD 209458 b. A tenfold increase in the infrared to visible opacity ratio would be required to slow the <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> and contraction sufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not conserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, {{or in the case of}} non-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night side or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep levels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the inflated sizes of giant exoplanets...|$|R

40|$|A decadal-scale {{trend in}} the {{tropical}} radiative energy budget has been observed recently by satellites, which however is not reproduced by climate models. In the present study, we have computed the outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) {{at the top of}} atmosphere (TOA) at 2. 5 ° longitude-latitude resolution and on a mean monthly basis for the 17 -year period 1984 - 2000, by using a deterministic solar radiative transfer model and cloud climatological data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) D 2 database. Anomaly time series for the mean monthly pixel-level OSR fluxes, {{as well as for the}} key physical parameters, were constructed. A significant decreasing trend in OSR anomalies, starting mainly from the late 1980 s, was found in tropical and subtropical regions (30 ° S- 30 ° N), indicating a decadal increase in solar planetary heating equal to 1. 9 ± 0. 3 Wm - 2 /decade, reproducing well the features recorded by satellite observations, in contrast to climate model results. This increase in solar planetary heating, however, is accompanied by a similar increase in <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling,</b> due to increased outgoing longwave radiation, so that there is no change in net radiation. The model computed OSR trend is in good agreement with the corresponding linear decadal decrease of 2. 5 ± 0. 4 Wm - 2 /decade in tropical mean OSR anomalies derived from ERBE S- 10 N non-scanner data (edition 2). An attempt was made to identify the physical processes responsible for the decreasing trend in tropical mean OSR. A detailed correlation analysis using pixel-level anomalies of model computed OSR flux and ISCCP cloud cover over the entire tropical and subtropical region (30 ° S- 30 ° N), gave a correlation coefficient of 0. 79, indicating that decreasing cloud cover is the main reason for the tropical OSR trend. According to the ISCCP-D 2 data derived from the combined visible/infrared (VIS/IR) analysis, the tropical cloud cover has decreased by 6. 6 ± 0. 2 % per decade, in relative terms. A detailed analysis of the inter-annual and long-term variability of the various parameters determining the OSR at TOA, has shown that the most important contribution to the observed OSR trend comes from a decrease in low-level cloud cover over the period 1984 - 2000, followed by decreases in middle and high-level cloud cover. Note, however, that there still remain some uncertainties associated with the existence and magnitude of trends in ISCCP-D 2 cloud amounts.

40|$|The near “one-plate” planet {{evolution}} of Mars {{has led to}} the edification of long-lasting giant shied volcanoes. Unlike the Earth, Mars would have been a transient convecting planet, where plate tectonic would have possibly acted only during the first hundreds of million years of its history. On Earth, where plate tectonic is active, most of them are regenerated and recycled through convection. However, the Nubian and Antarctic plates could be considered as poorly mobile surfaces of various thicknesses that are acting as conductive lids on top of Earth’s deeper convective system. Many geodynamical features of the young volcanism (less than 30 Myr old) of these motionless intraplate oceanic island environments resemble those of Mars, where plate tectonic plays no meaningful role in shaping planetary geodynamics. As observed on Mars, in these environments, volcanoes do not show any linear age progression (at least for the last 30 Ma), but constitute the sites of persistent, focused long-term magmatic activity, rather than a chain of volcanoes as observed in fast-moving plate plume environments. Here, the near stationary absolute plate motion probably exerts a primary control on volcanic processes, and more specifically, on the melting ones. The residual depleted mantle, that is left behind by the melting processes, cannot be swept away from the melting locus. Over time, the thickening of this near-stationary depleted layer progressively forces the termination of melting to higher depths, reducing the melt production rate. Such a process gradually leads both to decreasing efficient melt extraction and increasing mantle lithospheric-melt interactions. The accumulation of this refractory material also causes long-term fluctuations of the volcanic activity, in generating long periods of quiescence. The presence of this residual mantle keel induces over time a lateral flow deflection, which translates into a shift of future melting sites around it. This process gives rise to the horseshoe-like shape of some volcanic islands on slow-moving plates (e. g. Cape Verde, Crozet). Finally, the pronounced topographic swells/bulges observed in this environments may also be supported both by large scale mantle upwelling and their residual mantle roots. Most of these processes are likely similar to those observed on Martian giant shield volcanoes. The goal of this presentation will be to describe the essential characteristics of intra-oceanic plumes on slow moving plates on the Earth and to point out their similarities with those of the large shield volcanoes from the Tharsis region. Mars can effectively be considered as a one-plate planet, where geodynamics processes occur within a stagnant-lid regime. Several features of volcanism both on Earth and Mars can be related to the (near-) absence of plate tectonic motion (Table 1). The dividing into several distinct chemical mantle provinces, as observed on Mars and over Antarctic and Nubian plates on Earth, reflects a more efficient intracell rather than cross-cell convection mixing, allowing preservation of large-scale mantle chemical heterogeneities. Such a pattern reflects a mantle flow regime dominated by laminar flow, as expected in the (near-) absence of plate tectonic motion. In these geodynamical environments, poor residual mantle lateral flowing traction from the melting site will lead to the formation of a near-stationary depleted layer, which will thicken with time. The low buoyancy of upwelling in enhancing conductive heat loss during mantle rising will also lead to the formation of a thicker lithosphere relative to that of overlying higher-buoyancy plumes such as Hawaii. These two thickening effects add to that due to <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> (Baratoux et al. 2011). Both <b>planetary</b> <b>cooling</b> and depleted lid formation will lead to a cessation of melting, progressively forced toward greater depths over time, while the average extent of melting will be reduced. In both environments, low melt supply will lead {{to the development of a}} two-level fractionation architecture of the plumbing system, with most of the fractionation occurring in the uppermost mantle. The widespread distribution of the Tharsis volcanoes, as well as the horseshoe-like shape of some volcanic islands on slow-moving plates (e. g. Cape Verde, Crozet), could be inherited from lateral flow deflection induced by the presence of a residual mantle keel, shifting future melting loci around the keel. The pronounced topographic swells/bulges observed in this environments may also be supported both by large scale mantle upwelling and their residual mantle roots. Another similarity between volcanoes on slow-moving plates and those in Tharsis is their great longevity, which is due to their stationary position relative to the melting source. Both volcanoes also have a history of protracted activity punctuated by long periods of quiescence. The accumulation of refractory material at the rim of their melting zone might play a role in the fluctuations of their long-term volcanic activity. Until now, volcanism on Mars was defined as predominantly of tholeitic composition. However, recent in situ analyzes at Gale Crater have identified a mugearite-like rock. This raises the possibility that both intraplate volcanism on Earth at slow-moving plates and that on Mars would be instead of an alkali nature. Our knowledge of terrestrial volcanoes from motionless plates can thus help us to better understand the nature and significance of large-scale melting and differentiation processes at Mars volcanoes. However, the extent of this knowledge is still insufficiently detailed in many respects, and requires further investigation. New data from the Martian planetary record will help to provide new perspective on the processes and evolution at volcanoes on near-stationary plates. On Mars, the great range of scales of upwelling, the influence of crustal and lithospheric thicknesses in space and time are thus relevant to studies of hotspots on motionless plates...|$|R

This finding may support either tidal despinning or residual mantle convection on ruling the nucleation and development of lobate scarps, although within the general framework of <b>planetary</b> contraction and <b>cooling.</b> In addition, the presence of faults with a clear strike-slip kinematic component may possibly affect future estimates of the hermean radius shortening...|$|R
