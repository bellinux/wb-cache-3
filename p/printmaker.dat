5|$|Wintjiya's {{involvement}} in contemporary Indigenous Australian art began in 1994 at Haasts Bluff, when she {{participated in a}} group painting project and {{in the creation of}} batik fabrics. She has also been a <b>printmaker,</b> using drypoint etching. Her paintings typically use an iconography that represents the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma) and hair-string skirts (nyimparra). Her palette generally involves strong red or black against a white background.|$|E
5|$|Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and <b>printmaker</b> Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of {{the physical and emotional}} effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.|$|E

5|$|Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance <b>printmaker</b> {{who made}} {{important}} contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in Underweysung der Messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E
5|$|Dürer's Rhinoceros is {{the name}} {{commonly}} given to a woodcut executed by German painter and <b>printmaker</b> Albrecht Dürer in 1515. The image {{is based on a}} written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an Indian rhinoceros that had arrived in Lisbon in 1515. Dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since Roman times. In late 1515, the King of Portugal, Manuel I, sent the animal as a gift for Pope Leo X, but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516. A live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen, named Abada, arrived from India at the court of Sebastian of Portugal in 1577, being later inherited by Philip II of Spain around 1580.|$|E
5|$|The Disasters of War (Spanish: Los desastres de la guerra) is {{a series}} of 82 prints created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and <b>printmaker</b> Francisco Goya (1746–1828). Although Goya did not make known his {{intention}} when creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808–14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. During the conflicts between Napoleon's French Empire and Spain, Goya retained his position as first court painter to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers. Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath. He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons. In total over a thousand sets have been printed, though later ones are of lower quality, and most print room collections have {{at least some of the}} set.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the print}} {{portfolios}} produced by One/Off <b>Printmakers</b> were The Beastiary Portfolio,The Abstract Portfolio, The Landscape Portfolio , One/Off <b>Printmakers</b> 8 x 10, and a memorial portfolio in honor of Richmond Printmaking Workshop founder Nancy David.

50|$|Protective {{clothing}} {{is very important}} for <b>printmakers</b> who engage in etching and lithography (closed toed shoes and long pants). Whereas in the past <b>printmakers</b> put their plates in and out of acid baths with their bare hands, today <b>printmakers</b> use rubber gloves. They also wear industrial respirators for protection from caustic vapors. Most acid baths are built with ventilation hoods above them.|$|R

5000|$|The California Society of Etchers (CSE) {{merged with}} Bay <b>Printmakers</b> Society in 1968 {{when the current}} name, California Society of <b>Printmakers</b> (CSP), was adopted. Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s short {{histories}} of the society penned by various elected officers always referred to CSE/CSP as [...] " [...] the second oldest" [...] continuous operating club in the United States. However, these historians failed to mention what the oldest society was. A little research revealed that the oldest American society of <b>printmakers</b> was the Chicago Society of Etchers. The California Society of Etchers was very aware of its Chicago predecessor, as the Chicago founder Bertha Jaques encouraged <b>printmakers</b> to establish their own local societies. Jaques also joined the California Society of Etchers in 1913, when non-resident members were first admitted. The Chicago Society of Etchers ceased operations in 1956, leaving California Society of <b>Printmakers</b> as the longest lived printmakers' society in the U.S.|$|R
