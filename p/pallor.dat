5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, <b>pallor,</b> coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E
5|$|Makeup artist Jack Pierce {{and special}} effects {{supervisor}} John P. Fulton worked together closely, especially on Holden's make-up design. They combined special lighting with a greyish-green make-up for Holden's final scenes, creating a <b>pallor</b> that {{contrasted with the}} more normally flesh-toned make-ups of {{the others in the}} scene. Heinz Roemheld composed the score and Albert S. D'Agostino redressed Charles D. Hall's set of Dracula's castle and created new sets including a London bridge, the moor where Dracula's body is burned and Countess Zaleska's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard <b>pallor</b> of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.|$|E
25|$|Nociception {{can also}} cause {{generalized}} autonomic responses before or without reaching consciousness to cause <b>pallor,</b> diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, lightheadedness, nausea and fainting.|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{abnormalities}} of CDG-Ia include: myopia, infantile esotropia, delayed visual maturation, low vision, optic disc <b>pallor,</b> and reduced rod function on electroretinography.|$|E
25|$|Acute Type II Fasciolosis: {{infectious}} dose is 1000-5,000 ingested metacercariae. As above, sheep die but briefly show <b>pallor,</b> loss of {{condition and}} ascites.|$|E
25|$|Acute Type I Fasciolosis: {{infectious}} dose is {{more than}} 5000 ingested metacercariae. Sheep suddenly die without any previous clinical signs. Ascites, abdominal haemorrhage, icterus, <b>pallor</b> of membranes, weakness may be observed in sheep.|$|E
25|$|When {{exposed to}} cold temperatures, {{the blood supply}} to the fingers or toes, {{and in some cases}} the nose or earlobes, is {{markedly}} reduced; the skin turns pale or white (called <b>pallor)</b> and becomes cold and numb.|$|E
25|$|In some {{versions}} of the sewer alligator urban legends, the alligators supposedly became albinistic due to mutation (which is implausible due to the short time scale) and/or lack of exposure to sunlight (which erroneously conflates <b>pallor</b> {{due to lack of}} exposure to sunlight with albinism).|$|E
25|$|The troops worst {{affected}} had intense cyanosis and frothy exudation {{from the}} mouth and nose; some of the severe casualties who reached casualty clearing stations, had a <b>pallor</b> and collapse associated with phosgene poisoning. In a few cases cyanosis gave place to <b>pallor</b> before the victim died. The troops who died rapidly in the front line, about ninety minutes after {{the beginning of the}} attack, showed deep cyanosis and copious frothing, with paroxysmal coughing prominent in the early stages. The clinical evidence suggested that the gas cloud contained a low proportion of phosgene to chlorine. About twenty civilians were affected by the gas, though none severely, as they had been instructed in gas precautions and had been issued with respirators. The civilians had also protected themselves by closing windows and doors and by filling cracks with wet cloths; many also wore anti-gas helmets indoors.|$|E
25|$|Variable {{degrees of}} {{hemolysis}} and intermittent episodes of vascular occlusion resulting in tissue ischemia and acute and chronic organ dysfunction; complications include anemia, jaundice, predisposition to aplastic crisis, sepsis, cholelithiasis, and delayed growth. Diagnosis suspected in infants or {{young children with}} painful swelling of the hands and feet, <b>pallor,</b> jaundice, pneumococcal sepsis or meningitis, severe anemia with splenic enlargement, or acute chest syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms of}} falciparum malaria {{are produced by}} the rupture of schizont and destruction of erythrocytes. Most of the patients experience fever (>92% of cases), chills (79%), headaches (70%), and sweating (64%). Dizziness, malaise, muscle pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, mild diarrhea, and dry cough are also generally associated. High heartrate, jaundice, <b>pallor,</b> orthostatic hypotension, enlarged liver, and enlarged spleen are also diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|After the insulin {{injection}} {{patients would}} experience various symptoms of decreased blood glucose: flushing, <b>pallor,</b> perspiration, salivation, drowsiness or restlessness. Sopor and coma—if the dose was high enough—would follow. Each coma would last {{for up to}} an hour and be terminated by intravenous glucose or via naso-gastric tube. Seizures sometimes occurred before or during the coma. Many would be tossing, rolling, moaning, twitching, spasming or thrashing around.|$|E
25|$|Anemia {{dominates the}} early course. Most {{symptomatic}} patients complain of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea, and <b>pallor,</b> {{but at least}} half the patients are asymptomatic and their MDS is discovered only incidentally on routine blood counts. Previous chemotherapy or radiation exposure is an important fact in the person's medical history. Fever and weight loss should point to a myeloproliferative rather than myelodysplastic process.|$|E
25|$|Their {{meeting is}} the {{opposite}} of what he had hoped for in his dreams; she is unattractive (due to her weight and <b>pallor),</b> foolish, and insipid. After a sullen day, she slyly proposes marriage to him at dinner, as they believe they are the last man and the last woman on Mars. Gripp flees, driving across Mars to another tiny town to spend his life happily alone, avoiding all contact with Genevieve and ignoring any phone he hears ringing.|$|E
25|$|Though uncommon, {{potentially}} fatal adverse effects are stroke, myocardial infarction, GI bleeding, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and anaphylaxis. A less serious and more common (>10%) side effect is drowsiness. Infrequent (<1%) side effects are paresthesia, prolonged bleeding time, injection site pain, purpura, sweating, abnormal thinking, increased tearing (eyes), edema, <b>pallor,</b> dry mouth, abnormal taste, urinary frequency increased liver enzymes, itching and others. Ketorolac can cause premature constriction of the ductus arteriosis in an infant {{during the third}} trimester of pregnancy. The practice of restricting treatment with ketorolac is due to its potential to cause kidney damage. Platelet function is decreased related {{to the use of}} ketorolac.|$|E
25|$|Abdominal pain due to hypersplenism and splenic {{infarction}} and right-upper quadrant pain {{caused by}} gallstones are major clinical manifestations. However, diagnosing thalassemiæ from symptoms alone is inadequate. Physicians note these signs as associative {{due to this}} disease's complexity. The following associative signs can attest to {{the severity of the}} phenotype: <b>pallor,</b> poor growth, inadequate food intake, splenomegaly, jaundice, maxillary hyperplasia, dental malocclusion, cholelithiasis, systolic ejection murmur in the presence of severe anemia and pathologic fractures. Based on symptoms, tests are ordered for a differential diagnosis. These tests include complete blood count; hemoglobin electrophoresis; serum transferrin, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity; urine urobilin and urobilogen; peripheral blood smear, which may show codocytes, or target cells; hematocrit; and serum bilirubin.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Harlow's final film Saratoga, co-starring Clark Gable, was {{scheduled}} to begin in March 1937. However, production was delayed when she developed septicemia {{and had to be}} hospitalized after a multiple wisdom tooth extraction. After she recovered, shooting began on April 22. On May 20, 1937, while shooting Saratoga, Harlow began to complain of illness. Her symptoms—fatigue, nausea, water weight and abdominal pain—did not seem very serious to her doctor, who believed she was suffering from cholecystitis and influenza. However, he was apparently unaware that Harlow had been ill during the previous year with a severe sunburn and influenza. Her friend and co-star Myrna Loy noticed Harlow's grey <b>pallor,</b> fatigue, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of TTP is variable. The initial symptoms, which force {{the patient to}} medical care, are often the consequence of lower platelet counts like purpura (present in 90% of patients), ecchymosis and hematoma. Patients may also report signs and symptoms {{as a result of}} (microangiopathic) hemolytic anemia, such as (dark) beer-brown urine, (mild) jaundice, fatigue and <b>pallor.</b> Cerebral symptoms of various degree are present in many patients, including headache, paresis, speech disorder, visual problems, seizures and disturbance of consciousness up to coma. The symptoms can fluctuate so that they may only be temporarily present but may reappear again later in the TTP episode. Other unspecific symptoms are general malaise, abdominal, joint and muscle pain. Severe manifestations of heart or lung involvements are rare, although affections are not seldom measurable (such as ECG-changes).|$|E
25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent <b>pallor</b> of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 2 years, a {{girl had}} an {{autonomic}} status epilepticus during sleep. This was characterized by <b>pallor,</b> progressive impairment of consciousness, and vomiting that lasted 45 minutes. A second episode occurred after 11 months, during sleep, and consisted of impairment of consciousness, hypotonia, deviation of the eyes to the right, hypersalivation, and right-sided clonic convulsions. It was terminated after 45 minutes with rectal diazepam. Treatment with carbamazepine was initiated. After 6 months, she had a third episode similar to the previous ones, but shorter. At the age of 4 years 9 months, during an ambulatory EEG, she had another autonomic seizure with marked ictal EEG abnormalities, but again, the interictal did not show any spikes. Carbamazepine was replaced with phenobarbital. All 12 interictal EEGs during the active seizure period, 6 of them during sleep, were normal. At last follow-up {{at the age of}} 16 years, she was well, a good student, unmedicated, and seizure-free for 11 years.|$|E
25|$|Gyges {{asks the}} Queen {{to join in}} the dancing. She takes a cup and empties it as if to drown her thoughts. She dances in a trance and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly <b>pallor</b> steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E
500|$|The venom of this cobra is a postsynaptic neurotoxin and bites {{result in}} severe neurotoxicity. Ernst and Zug et al. 1996 list {{a value of}} 0.225mg/kg SC. According to Brown and Fry of the Australian Venom and Toxin Database, the murine {{intraperitoneal}} [...] value is 0.324mg/kg. The average venom yield per bite is 571mg and the maximum venom yield is 1102mg. This snake can be highly dangerous due to the quantity of venom it can inject in a single bite and its aggressive nature when defending. Death can occur rapidly, within 30 to 120 minutes in severe cases of envenomation. Signs and symptoms of envenomation include , drowsiness, limb paralysis, hearing loss, inability to speak, dizziness, ataxia, shock, hypotension, abdominal pain, fever, <b>pallor,</b> and other neurological and respiratory symptoms.|$|E
500|$|The {{legend of}} the green {{children}} of Woolpit concerns two children of unusual skin colour who reportedly appeared {{in the village of}} Woolpit in Suffolk, England, some time in the 12th century, perhaps during the reign of King Stephen. The children, brother and sister, were of generally normal appearance except for the green colour of their skin. They spoke in an unknown language, and would only eat raw broad beans. Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green <b>pallor,</b> but the boy was sickly and died soon after he and his sister were baptised. The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be [...] "rather loose and wanton in her conduct". After she learned to speak English, the girl explained that she and her brother had come from Saint Martin's Land, a subterranean world inhabited by green people.|$|E
500|$|Chronic {{poisoning}} usually presents {{with symptoms}} affecting multiple systems, but {{is associated with}} three main types of symptoms: gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neurological. Central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods. Signs of chronic exposure include loss of short-term memory or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A [...] "lead hue" [...] of the skin with <b>pallor</b> and/or lividity is another feature. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children with chronic poisoning may refuse to play or may have hyperkinetic or aggressive behavior disorders. Visual disturbance may present with gradually progressing blurred vision {{as a result of}} central scotoma, caused by toxic optic neuritis.|$|E
500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that [...] "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect <b>pallor.</b> Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". She {{might have been a}} little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|The Destroying Angel is {{a visionary}} work, {{depicting}} a wholly imaginary scene {{rather than a}} scene from history, literature or mythology. It measures 127.8cm by 101.9cm (50in by 40in), and depicts an ornate imaginary classical temple. [...] The temple and its occupants are under attack from a destroying angel {{and a group of}} daemons, who {{are in the process of}} abducting its human occupants. The angel itself is wreathed in smoke in the centre of the image. Having destroyed one side of the temple, it is poised to hurl a thunderbolt. Below the angel, daemons attack a group of around 25 semi-naked human figures. Each human is shown in a different position and expresses terror in a different way, and each is deliberately painted in paler tones than those Etty typically used in an effort to suggest death and <b>pallor.</b> As with most of Etty's works, the figures are a collection of depictions of models in studio poses, later arranged for dramatic effect, rather than painted as a group.|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the <b>pallor</b> of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Virtual reality {{sickness}} {{occurs when}} {{exposure to a}} virtual environment causes symptoms {{that are similar to}} motion sickness symptoms. [...] The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, <b>pallor,</b> sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physiological}} {{correlations of}} intense limerence can include seizure-like trembling, <b>pallor,</b> flushing, heart palpitations, pupil dilation and general weakness. Awkwardness, stuttering, shyness, and confusion predominate at the behavioral level. Less common effects include insomnia, loss of appetite, [...] and passing out.|$|E
2500|$|Melinoë may {{derive from}} Greek mēlinos (μήλινος), [...] "having {{the color of}} quince", from mēlon (μῆλον), [...] "tree fruit". The fruit's yellowish-green color evoked the <b>pallor</b> of illness or death for the Greeks. A name derived from melas, [...] "black", would be melan-, not melin-.|$|E
2500|$|The {{symptoms}} can {{be linked}} to inflammation in the gut stimulated by feeding hookworms, such as nausea, abdominal pain and intermittent diarrhea, and to progressive anemia in prolonged disease: [...] appetite, pica (or dirt-eating), obstinate constipation followed by diarrhea, palpitations, thready pulse, coldness of the skin, <b>pallor</b> of the mucous membranes, fatigue and weakness, shortness of breath and in cases running a fatal course, dysentery, hemorrhages and edema. The worms suck blood and damage the mucosa. However, the blood loss in the stools is not visibly apparent.|$|E
2500|$|... "Your {{favourite}} Awkward Davies can {{be positively}} dogged, if crossed {{by a new}} hand: but in a boarding-party, or storming a shore-position, he is worth his weight in gold, heavy though he is. His huge bulk, his terrifying strength and activity, the awful <b>pallor</b> {{of his face and}} his way of foaming at the mouth when he is stirred, all make him a most dreadful opponent. What Stephen calls his berserker rage fairly clears the enemy's decks before him. He also howls. But he has other sides: not only is he very useful when you must sway up the mast short-handed, but in sudden emergencies too." [...] (p. 98-99).|$|E
