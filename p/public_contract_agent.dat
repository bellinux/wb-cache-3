40|$|This paper {{examines}} firms' {{incentives to}} commit to a transparent behavior (that precludes bribery) in a competitive procedure modeled as an asymmetric information beauty contest managed by a corrupt agent. In his evaluation of firms' offers for a <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> the <b>agent</b> has some discretion to favor a firm in exchange of a bribe. It is shown that a conditional commitment mechanism can eliminate corruption when it is pure extortion. Otherwise, when corruption can affect allocation and the market's profitability is small, a low quality firm may prefer not to commit. In that situation, {{the existence of a}} separating equilibrium in which only the high quality firms commit is guaranteed when commitment decisions are kept secret, but requires some conditions on firms' beliefs when commitment decisions are publicly announced. Generally, a unilateral commitment mechanism that rewards commitment with a bonus performs less well. A mechanism combining both conditional commitment and a bonus has the potential to fully eliminate corruption. commitment; bribery; competitive procedures; transparency...|$|R

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>contracts</b> were {{traditionally}} {{conceived as}} instruments of domestic public law and used within markets {{confined to the}} territory of the state party to the contract.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} typical {{decisions}} made by contracting entities which restrict the competition among economic operators. The thesis analyses the typical mistakes which are made by the contract entities in awarding procedures. The causes of mistakes being made by contracting entities can be summarized into three groups. Into the first group belong conscious mistakes. For these mistakes shall be <b>contracting</b> entities` <b>agents</b> held responsible. Into the second group belong mistakes in planning. Mistakes from the third group are made {{as a consequence of}} lack of professional skills. None of these mistakes can be prevented just by an amendment to the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts.</b> Any proposal of an amendment solving the lack of professional skills shall consider also all connected negative effects; mainly additional time demands, financial costs and the risk of underfinanced praxis turning into formalism. Professionally skilled agents are usually more careful when they apply the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> because they are aware of legal risks. Considering current limited budget resources it should be decided whether to put stress on cooperation with internal or external experts. The author recommends internal experts because external experts do not do their best if they are aware of the fact being not controlled effectively by internal experts. However the current Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> is not perfect, the duties laid by it are enforced successfully. Considering a new amendment also the legal theory shall be taken into account. The author presumes similarity of preventing of breaches against the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> and of preventing of crimes. The most important factor preventing from criminality is to be aware that the punishment is inescapable, not its rates. The author points out also the opinion of the general theory of law according to which a new act is to be passed only if there is an objective necessary need. It should not to be passed by a fortuity or because of subjective views. There should be also a time space between the amendments. There was an amendment to Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> approved in 2010 and European Union currently prepares amending of awarding directives. The author therefore prefers improving the praxis of awarding in the Czech Republic by granting additional human resources to the Office for the Protection of Competition to passing of another amendment to the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts.</b> The scope of the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> is also not convenient for amending a list of contract clauses which are not allowed to be concluded by contracting entities. There are two reasons. Contracting entities are constituted by various groups of subjects and contracts selling their property are outside the scope of the Act on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts.</b> Contracting entities should use standard awarding procedure to promote competition among economic operators. They should concentrate on exactness of tender conditions. A good prevention to mistakes in awarding procedure is also good planning and skilled human recourses of contracting entities...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{institute}} of public procurement a considerable volume of financial resources is allocated. It is therefore {{in the interest of}} contracting entities to seek ways of how to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. Some public contract-awarding entities, along with some public-administration authorities in the Czech Republic, believe that the use of a single evaluation criterion (the lowest bid price) results in a more efficient tender for a <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> It was found that contracting entities in the Czech Republic strongly prefer to use the lowest bid price criterion. Within the examined sample, 86. 5 % of public procurements were evaluated this way. The analysis of the examined sample of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> proved that the choice of an evaluation criterion, even the preference of the lowest bid price criterion, does not have any obvious impact on the final cost of a <b>public</b> <b>contract.</b> The study concludes that it is inappropriate to prefer the criterion of the lowest bid price within the evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> that are characterised by their complexity (including <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> for construction works and <b>public</b> service <b>contracts).</b> The findings of the Supreme Audit Office related to the inspection of <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> indicate that when using the lowest bid price as an evaluation criterion, a <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> may indeed be tendered with the lowest bid price, but not necessarily the best offer in terms of supplied quality. It is therefore not appropriate to use the lowest bid price evaluation criterion to such an extent for the purpose of evaluating work and services. Any improvement to this situation requires a corresponding amendment to the Law on <b>Public</b> <b>Contracts</b> and mainly a radical change in the attitude of the Office for the Protection of Competition towards proposed changes, as indicated within the conclusions and recommendations proposed by this study...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{feature of}} private contracting is its relational nature. When faced with unforeseen or unexpected circumstances, private parties, {{as long as}} the relation remains worthwhile, adjust their required performance without the need for costly renegotiation or formal recontracting. <b>Public</b> <b>contracting,</b> on the other hand, seems to be characterized by formalized, standardized, bureaucratic, rigid procedures. Common wisdom sees <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> as generally more inflexible, requiring more frequent formal renegotiation, having a higher tendency to litigate, and providing weaker incentives. In sum, <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> are perceived to be less "efficient. " In this paper I develop a theory of <b>public</b> <b>contracting</b> that accommodates these stark differences between private and <b>public</b> <b>contracting.</b> The thrust of the paper is that these differences arise directly because of the different hazards present in public and purely private contracts, which directly impact the nature of the resulting contractual forms. A fundamental corollary of this result is that the perceived inefficiency of <b>public</b> or governmental <b>contracting</b> is simply the result of contractual adaptation to different inherent hazards, and as such is not directly remediable. Finally, I apply the main insights from the general framework developed here to understand the characteristics of concession contracts. ...|$|R
