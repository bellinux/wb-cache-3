2500|$|In general, MBA {{programs}} are structured around core courses (an essentially standard curriculum) and elective courses that can {{allow for a}} subject specialty or concentration. Thus, often in the program's first year (or part), students acquire both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills required for these. After the first year, many full-time students seek internships. Often {{in the second year}} (part), students pursue elective courses, which may count towards a specialization, dependent on program. [...] (Topics in business ethics may also be included at the generalist or specialist level.) The degree culminates with coursework in business strategy, the program capstone. A dissertation or major project is usually a degree requirement after the completion of coursework. [...] For Executive MBA programs, the core curriculum is generally similar, but may seek to leverage the strengths associated with the more seasoned and <b>professional</b> <b>profile</b> of the student body, emphasizing leadership, and drawing more from the specific experience of the individual students. Many MBA programs end with a comprehensive exit examination (see below).|$|E
