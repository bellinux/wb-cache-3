In pasture systems, cows graze in fields and are required to walk to the milking parlour.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} variations in milk yield and its chemical composition arise mainly from changes in feeding {{of the cattle}} in different seasons of the year. A constant quantity of production and a similar quality of the raw material supply farms, where the feeding of cows is uniform throughout the year (TMR and PMR). The study included 1211 samples of milk obtained in the summer season (663) and in the winter season (548) from cows maintained in traditional and intensive (TMR) system of production. Following parameters were determined: content of fat, protein, casein, lactose and dry matter; acidity (pH value); heat stability; rennet coagulation time; content of α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, lactoferrin, lysozyme and fatty acid profiles. Cows fed in the TMR system produced significantly (P≤ 0. 01) more milk and of a better chemical composition regardless of the season of production. Milk obtained from cows fed traditionally had the most profitable protein to fat ratio (0, 90) and the shortest time of rennet coagulation (3 : 26 min). It contained significantly (P≤ 0. 01) more whey proteins and had better fatty acid profiles for health. In addition the differences were usually larger in the summer season than in the winter season. It is possible to state that in summer season, when the animals are maintained on the <b>pasture,</b> <b>milk</b> obtained from cows fed traditionally is more suitable for processing and contains more biologically active substances.

40|$|Grazing {{management}} {{is a key}} factor in pasture-based dairy systems, which can be improved given advanced knowledge of the effects of pregrazing pasture mass (PM) on the performance of dairy cows. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the effects of PM on the <b>pasture</b> intake, <b>milk</b> production, milk composition, and grazing behavior of strip- or rotational-grazing dairy cows, based on a meta-analysis of published research papers. A database was created that included experiments in which the effects of PM on <b>pasture</b> intake and <b>milk</b> production of dairy cows were studied. Papers were selected only if at least 2 PM were compared under similar experimental conditions, particularly the same pasture allowance (SPA). The final database included 15 papers with 27 PM comparisons. For analytical purposes, the database was subdivided into 3 subsets that varied according to the estimation height at which pasture allowance was determined; that is, where PM were compared at the SPA above ground level (SPA 0 subset), above 2 to 3 cm (SPA 3 subset), and above 4 to 5 cm (SPA 5 subset). Statistical analyses were conducted on the entire database (global analysis) and within each subset using linear model procedures. An interaction between PM and estimation height was found for <b>pasture</b> intake and <b>milk</b> production in the global analysis. On the basis of the predictive equations, pasture intake increased by 1. 58 kg of dry matter/d per tonne increase in PM when PM were compared at SPA 0, was not affected by PM when PM were compared at SPA 3, and decreased by 0. 65 kg of dry matter/d per tonne increase in PM when PM were compared at SPA 5. This is consistent with the effect of PM on milk production, which was positive and negative (1. 04 and − 0. 79 kg/t of PM, respectively) when PM were compared at SPA 0 and SPA 5, respectively. Grazing time was only slightly affected by PM, irrespective of estimation height, because the effect of PM on pasture intake was mainly dependent on the variation in pasture intake rate. Pasture intake rate increased with increasing PM at SPA 0 but decreased with increasing PM at SPA 5. This meta-analysis clearly demonstrates that the effects of PM on <b>pasture</b> intake, <b>milk</b> production, and behavior of strip-grazing dairy cows depend largely on the height at which the PM and pasture allowance are measured. These results have methodological implications for future grazing research because it can be recommended that PM be compared at similar levels of pasture availability (i. e., at the same pasture allowance above 2 to 3 cm) to avoid possible misinterpretations of results. They also reveal the benefits of improving grazing management and intake prediction through modeling in pasture-based dairy systems...|$|R

Lifetime dairy production, {{reproduction}} and growth traits of 75 females sired by Holstein, Jersey or Brown Swiss bulls and Hol-stein-Friesian x Gir dams of 1 / 2 to 3 / 4 Holstein-Friesian fractions were compared. The animals {{were in a}} single herd under the same manage-ment. Milk, fat and protein yields, concentrates fed, reproduction, and weights were recorded throughout the lifetime of the cows. The data were analyzed by least squares techniques under models including the fixed effects of breed of sire, Bos taurus fraction and year of birth. Herd lifes for Holstein, Jersey and Brown Swiss crosses were 6. 006 ± 0. 812, 8. 129 ± 0. 863 and 7. 247 ± 0. 777 years. Milk yields per day of herd life were 7. 150 ± 0. 266, 6. 757 ± 0. 282 and 6. 249 ± 0. 254 kg. Weights of cull cows sold were 458 ± 15, 415 ± 15 and 457 ± 13 kg. Based on these and on previously reported results of the same experiment, intakes of roughage and pasture were estimated from energy requirements.

40|$|AbstractDaily pasture {{allowance}} (PA) {{is defined}} as the product of pregrazing pasture mass and offered area, and is the major grazing management factor determining pasture utilization per unit area and daily performance of grazing dairy cows. The objective {{of the present study was}} to perform a meta-analysis reviewing the effect of PA on <b>pasture</b> intake, <b>milk</b> production, milk composition, and grazing behavior of dairy cows. Experiments studying the effect of PA on <b>pasture</b> intake or <b>milk</b> production, which eventually included milk composition or grazing behavior data, or both, were selected to create a database. Papers were selected only if at least 2 PA were compared under the same experimental conditions, particularly the same pasture mass (i. e., where PA levels were only obtained through changes in daily offered area). The final database included 97 PA comparisons reported in 56 papers. For analytical purposes, the database was subdivided into 3 subsets that varied according to the estimation height (EH) at which PA was determined; that is, PA above ground level (PA 0 subset), PA above 2. 5 to 3. 5 cm (PA 3 subset), and PA above 4 to 5 cm (PA 5 subset). Statistical analyses were conducted independently on the PA 0, PA 3, and PA 5 subsets and on the whole database (global analysis) by using linear and nonlinear mixed-model procedures. The curves, either exponential, quadratic, or linear, describing the effects of PA on <b>pasture</b> intake, <b>milk</b> production, or grazing behavior of dairy cows are conceptually similar, whatever the EH. The equations describing these curves are, however, specific for each EH. Accordingly, from typical low to high PA, the increase in pasture intake (0. 13 vs. 0. 21 vs. 0. 28 kg/kg of PA), milk production (0. 11 vs. 0. 17 vs. 0. 24 kg/kg of PA), and milk solids production (0. 008 vs. 0. 010 vs. 0. 013 kg/kg of PA) per kilogram of increase in PA was lower for PA 0 than for PA 3, and for PA 3 than for PA 5. Grazing time increased from low to medium PA and did not vary from medium to high PA. Pasture intake rate seemed to increase from low to medium PA because of greater bite mass, whereas it increased from medium to high PA because of greater biting rate. The present meta-analysis demonstrated that the general relationship between PA and any dependent variable is quite strong and independent of EH. This suggests no specific relationship for some parts of the world or methodology approach, with a high portability of the global equations calculated here. These results are useful for improving grazing management and modeling on pasture-based dairy systems...|$|R

Non conventional species belonging to the Compositae family such as (Chrysanthemum coronarium L.) seem interesting for sheep feeding when other herbages decrease in quality (late spring- early summer).
