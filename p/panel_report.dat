The Virginia Tech Review <b>Panel</b> <b>report,</b> also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication and therapy. In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the 'emotional disturbance' classification. He was excused from oral presentations and participation in class conversation and received 50 minutes a month of speech therapy. He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until his junior year, when Cho rejected further therapy.|$|E

25|$|At the 11th {{special session}} of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in May 2009 {{seventeen}} countries attempted to get the UNHRC to investigate war crimes in Sri Lanka. They put forward a resolution that deplored abuses by both the Sri Lankan government forces and the Tamil Tigers, urged the government to co-operate fully with humanitarian organisations and to provide protection to civilians and displaced persons, and made {{an appeal to the}} Sri Lankan government to respect media freedom and investigate attacks against journalists and human rights defenders. This was thwarted after the Sri Lankan government received support from China, Russia, India and developing countries. The UNHRC instead passed resolution S-11/1 on 27 May 2009 which commended the Sri Lankan government's actions, condemned the Tamil Tigers and ignored allegations of violations of human rights and humanitarian law by government forces. This resolution was passed by 29 votes to 12 votes with 6 abstentions.

500|$|The Virginia Tech Review <b>Panel</b> <b>report</b> {{shed light}} on {{numerous}} efforts by Cho's family to secure help for him as early as adolescence. However, when Cho reached 18 and left for college, the family lost its legal authority over him, and their influence on him waned. Cho's mother, increasingly concerned about his inattention to classwork, his classroom absences and his asocial behavior, sought help for him during summer 2006 from various churches in Northern Virginia. According to Dong Cheol Lee, minister of One Mind Presbyterian Church of Washington (located in Woodbridge) Cho's mother sought help from the church for Cho's problems. Lee added that [...] " [...] problem needed to be solved by spiritual power... that's why she came to our church– because we were helping several people like him." [...] Members of Lee's church even told Cho's mother that he was afflicted by [...] "demonic power" [...] and needed [...] "deliverance." [...] Before the church could meet with the family, however, Cho returned to school to start his senior year at Virginia Tech.|$|E
