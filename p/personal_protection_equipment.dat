40|$|Abstract: Welding is an {{important}} process used in the iron based industries. About {{two percent of the}} working population is engaged in some type of welding. The procedure of welding is simple but its health implications are complex. Welding generates enormous amounts of gases and metal fumes. Depending on the substrate and welding type, the composition of resultant gases and fumes changes. Therefore, welders are exposed to a number of complex mixtures of compounds which pose a serious threat to their health. Various studies have shown the effect of welding process on the health of the workers. These studies include the analysis of blood and urine for different parameters like micronucleus test, comet assay, trace metal analysis (Pb, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn etc.), chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges. These studies give evidences about the serious occupational risk posed to the welders which should be minimized using <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>equipments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: In India, {{hydrogen}} cyanamide (Dormex &#x 00 AE;) is a {{plant growth}} regulator used mainly for the bud-breaking of grapevines. The use of this chemical may result in severe cutaneous reactions simulating erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Methods: Studies were conducted on four seasonal grapevine workers who developed severe cutaneous reactions following the unprotected use of Dormex &#x 00 AE; (hydrogen cyanamide). Results: Two of the patients had EM-like skin lesions {{and the other two}} developed SJS-TEN-like skin lesions. A latent period of 5 - 7 days existed between the contact with the chemical and the development of the skin lesions. The histopathological picture was suggestive of EM. All the patients responded to systemic steroids and antihistamines. Conclusions: Hydrogen cyanamide may act as a hapten, initiating cytotoxic immunological attack on keratinocytes, resulting in EM- and SJS-TEN-like clinical picture. Awareness regarding such severe cutaneous reactions due to the inappropriate handling of Dormex &#x 00 AE; is required.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{infection}} control measures and concerns {{in primary care}} practices, {{and the effects of}} SARS on primary care consultation using the Leicester Assessment Package (LAP) criteria during the SARS episode in Hong Kong. Design: A postal survey using a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of three parts on the demographic data, infection control precautions taken and concerns of the respondents, and the effect of SARS on consultations. Subjects: Full members and fellows of the HKCFP. Main outcome measures: Infection control precautions including performance of initial screening/triage, by whom and how these were carried out, actions for the triaged patients, use of <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>equipments</b> (PPE), organisation and format of infection control training of staff and decontamination practice; perceptions of adequacy of protection and areas of concern; and proportion and degree to which consultation skills were affected using the LAP criteria. Results: The response rate was 60 %. 71. 4 % respondents triaged their patients. 85. 9 % took temperatures of their patients. All respondents wore a mask during consultations. 69. 8 % organised training for their staff and clinic. Most respondents regularly decontaminated their clinic. 56 % felt adequately protected by their infection control precautions and use of PPE but 44 % did not. The major concerns were the variable clinical presentations of SARS, the practicability of wearing full protection, and the lack of early and reliable diagnostic tests. The type of practice was found to be a factor affecting the choice of infection control precautions. Consultation skills were found to be affected in ≤ 25 % of consultations. History taking, physical examination, management and problem solving were found to be more difficult but relationship with patients and anticipatory care became easier. Conclusion: Choice of infection control precautions was related to the type of practice.

Subjects and method: 99 male styrene exposed workers were examined. During their lamination activities the average styrene concentrations in air ranged between 30 to 60 ppm (maximum: 205 ppm). The laminators were followed during an usual workweek from Monday to Thursday. The external styrene exposure was measured by means of passive active carbon badges. The excretion of mandelic acid (MA) and phenyl glyoxylic acid (PGA) in endof-shift urine samples was used to quantify the internal styrene load. During the work shift some laminators did not use respiratory protection masks. The majority used either a half face mask with active carbon filter or an air purifying respirator. Results: The respiratory masks were worn during an average between 31 % and 72 % of the work time. The styrene concentrations of the ambient air were-depending on the activity- in the range of 30 to 60 ppm. The end-ofshift concentrations of MA and PGA in urine samples varied considerably, their means range from 153 to 606 mg/g creatinine. The comparison shows that workers with air purifying respirators experience the lowest internal styrene body burden in spite of high external exposures...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 48) This {{study was}} concerned with the pesticide practices followed {{by a group of}} selected poultrymen in the Yucaipa area of San Bernardino County. The pesticide practices involved the handling, applying, storing, and disposing of pesticides. The specific purposes of this study were to: (1) determine if poultrymen followed good pesticide practice habits and (2) to determine if pesticide container labels were an effective means of influencing pesticide safety. A questionnaire was constructed which listed 2 7 questions concerning pesticide safety practices. The questions were grouped into the areas of <b>personal</b> preparation, <b>personal</b> <b>protection,</b> education, <b>equipment</b> and usage, storage and disposal. Each question, was answered by a response of do, sometimes, and don't. The questions were administered by personal interviews and direct observations of pesticide practices. The questionnaire was administered to 45 poultrymen during the summer of 1971. The data was analyzed and the responses were found to be statistically significant. The questionnaire was also submitted to seven experts concerned with pesticide usages and they were asked to evaluate the importance of each question in terms of contribution to pesticide safety. Two major conclusions may be drawn from the study: (1) that many of the poultrymen tended to follow poor pesticide safety practices in their personal handling, applying, storing and disposing of pesticides and (2) that labels on pesticide containers were not effective in influencing good pesticide habits because many of the poultrymen did not always read the label or utilize the consultative and educational services available to them prior to using pesticides...|$|R
