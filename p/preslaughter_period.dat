40|$|The {{objective}} of the present experiment {{was to investigate the}} effects of transportation, lairage, and preslaughter stressor treatment on glycolytic potential and pork quality of the glycolytic longissimus and the oxidative supraspinatus (SSP) or serratus ventralis (SV) muscles. In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, 384 pigs were assigned randomly either to short (50 min) and smooth or long (3 h) and rough transport, long (3 h) or short (< 45 min) lairage, and minimal or high preslaughter stress. Muscle samples were taken from the LM at 135 min and from the SSP at 160 min postmortem for determination of the glycolytic potential and rate of glycolysis. At 23 h postmortem, pork quality was assessed in the LM and the SV. Effects of transport and lairage conditions were similar in both muscle types. Long transport increased (P < 0. 01) the glycolytic potential and muscle lactate concentrations compared with short transport. Both long transportation and short lairage decreased (P < 0. 01) redness (a* values) and yellowness (b* values) of the LM and SV. In combination with short lairage, long transport decreased (P < 0. 05) pork lightness (lower L* values), and electrical conductivity was increased (P < 0. 05) after long transport. Several interactions between stress level and muscle type (P < 0. 001) were observed. High preslaughter stress decreased (P < 0. 001) muscle glycogen in both the LM and SSP, but this decrease was greater in the LM. Lactate concentrations were increased (P < 0. 001) only in the LM by high preslaughter stress. Increases in ultimate pH (P < 0. 001) and decreases in a* values (P < 0. 01) were greatest in the SV, whereas increases in electrical conductivity (P < 0. 001) were greatest in the LM. The lack of interactions among transportation, lairage, and muscle type was attributed to the relatively minor differences in stress among treatments. It was concluded that, in glycolytic muscle types such as the LM, the high physical and psychological stress levels associated with stress in the immediate <b>preslaughter</b> <b>period</b> have a greater effect on the water-holding capacity of the meat and may promote PSE development. Conversely, oxidative muscle types tend to have higher ultimate pH values and produce DFD pork in response to intense physical activity and/or high psychological stress levels preslaughter...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present experiment was to study physiological changes elicited in response to stress in the immediate <b>preslaughter</b> <b>period</b> and to link them to pork quality characteristics. Crossbred, halothane-free pigs (n = 192) were processed in eight groups (24 pigs per group) on various days at one of two commercial processing plants operating different stunning systems (electrical and CO 2 stunning in Plants A and B, respectively). In each group, half the pigs were exposed to either minimal or high preslaughter stress. Blood samples were taken at exsanguination, and lactate, cortisol, and catecholamines, as well as blood pH and temperature, were assessed and linked to various longissimus muscle quality attributes. Additionally, muscle pH and temperature were measured 30 min postmortem, and muscle glycolytic potential was determined 22 h postmortem. At both processing plants, high preslaughter stress resulted in higher (P < 0. 05) blood cortisol and lactate; however, the effects of preslaughter stress on catecholamines and blood pH {{were believed to be}} biased by the different stunning methods employed at the plants. High preslaughter stress increased (P < 0. 05) blood temperature at Plant A but not at Plant B. At both plants, high stress increased (P < 0. 05) 30 -min muscle temperature and decreased (P < 0. 05) 30 -min muscle pH. Ultimate pH was increased (P < 0. 05) and muscle glycolytic potential was decreased (P < 0. 05) by high preslaughter stress. At both plants, high stress resulted in inferior pork quality attributes (P < 0. 05), including reflectance, electrical conductivity, filter paper moisture, drip loss, and L* value. The effect of stress was greater on water-holding capacity than on pork color, with drip losses increased by 56 %. Of all stress indicators measured at exsanguination, only blood lactate was strongly correlated with pork quality attributes. Regression analyses revealed that blood lactate and glycolytic potential accounted for 52 and 48 % of the variation in drip loss and L* value, respectively. In combination with high preslaughter stress, high glycolytic potentials were related to increased drip losses. We conclude that high preslaughter stress leads to impaired pork quality, with high muscle energy levels aggravating the negative effects of preslaughter stress. Monitoring stress level by blood lactate measurement in combination with strategies to control muscle energy present at slaughter may help to improve meat quality...|$|E
40|$|Crop is a known {{source of}} Salmonella {{contamination}} during broiler carcass processing. The effect {{of drinking water}} acidification by lactic acid or citric acid {{or a combination of}} those with cupric sulfate and dlimonene in the reduction of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) recovered from the crop of broilers was evaluated. Treatments were administered during 8 hours of <b>preslaughter</b> fasting <b>period</b> (Experiments I and II) and during the last 32 hours of preslaughter (Experiment III). It was observed that acidification reduced water intake when treatments began at preslaughter feed withdrawal, and affected the possible reducing effect of these acids on SE recovering (Experiments I and II). Water intake during preslaughter feed withdrawal was not affected when treatment began 32 hours before slaughter (Experiment III). Treatments reduced SE recovering from crop (p< 0. 05). In Experiment III, 0. 470 % of lactic acid reduced the number of recovered SE in 99 %. This study suggested that the addition of organic acids in the drinking water 24 hours before beginning the preslaughter feed withdrawal might reduce crop SE colonization and might be an important strategy to reduce SE contamination of broiler products during processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) since the 1993 - 94 epidemic in southern Africa holds major {{implications for the}} export of ostrich products from this region. A challenge experiment with this field strain was conducted in open-air feedlot facilities under strict biosecurity measures. The experiment was designed to follow vaccination and preslaughter quarantine regulations currently enforced in South African export ostrich facilities {{in order to determine}} the viremia period and immune response under these specific circumstances. One hundred forty-three slaughter ostriches were allocated into three test groups, according to the time period between pretrial vaccination and challenge (1 - 2 mo, 2 - 4 mo, 4 - 6 mo), and an unchallenged control group. All birds in the test groups were challenged by oral, tracheal, and ocular routes with a field isolate of NDV. They were slaughtered over the next 4 wk on nine separate occasions and bled on 12 occasions. Virus isolation was attempted from seven sets of pooled samples from each bird to determine the viremia period and the serum antibody concentrations were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods to establish an immune response curve. NDV could be back-isolated only up to day 9 postinfection and from only six ostriches with poor immune response titers and corresponding to a rise in antibody levels above an indirect ELISA optical density reading of 0. 33. Virus could be recovered only from brain and respiratory tract tissue. The HI test was less sensitive than the ELISA. Immune response curves did not differ significantly between the groups and peaked on day 14 postinfection. From these data, ELISA titers would appear to be a good indicator of the probability that an ostrich will be clinically infected after velogenic NDV challenge. These results also suggest that the current vaccination schedule enforced by the South African Veterinary Authorities results in protective immunity in up to 95 % of slaughter ostriches from export approved facilities. The standard 30 -day <b>preslaughter</b> quarantine <b>period</b> introduced as part of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus control measures also appears sufficient to encompass the determined NDV viremia period of 9 - 11 days in slaughter ostriches...|$|R

New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 31 (1 - 2), 4 - 6 A plug sampling technique based on a modified muscle biopsy instrument, was developed for the measurement of muscle pH without mutilation of the carcase. It was found possible to routinely obtain muscle tissue samples weighing approximately 2 g and when these were incubated for 24 hours under liquid paraffin at room temperature, followed by homogenisation in a 'Colworth Stomacher', the pH of the solution {{was found to be}} an accurate measurement of the ultimate pH of the muscle. Both the sample method and a direct probe method were found to be well suited for measuring the ultimate pH of muscles. However, the sample method had a higher degree of precision as compared to the probe method when used for measuring pre-rigor pH values. In a longitudinal survey, in which 1536 lamb carcases were examined, 85. 2 % of carcases were found to have ultimate pH values below 5. 80. Highly significant associations were found between season (summer period) and breed (Perendales) and unsatisfactorily high values of ultimate pH. There was also a highly significant direct correlation between the duration of holding periods of lambs and the ultimate pH of meat, whereas there was a highly significant inverse correlation between wool score and ultimate pH. It was concluded that nutrition {{plays an important role in}} the development of high ultimate pH values. Studies at the meat works indicated that there is a highly significant linear relationship between the number of times lambs are washed prior to slaughter and the ultimate pH of the longissimus muscle. Subsequent resting of animals for varying periods prior to slaughter has no apparent effect on repletion of glycogen stores and may, in some cases, exacerbate the problem of high pH meat. It was also found that washing of lambs is associated with a highly significant increase in bruising of carcases and that such washing may not necessarily result in a decrease in carcase contamination. Investigations of the changes of body weights and the weights and nature of ruminoreticular contents during the <b>preslaughter</b> holding <b>period</b> indicated that the ideal time to slaughter lambs, in terms of potential carcase contamination, is 18 to 24 hours after removal from pasture. It was found that stunning by a 'head-to-leg' electrical method significantly increased the rate of pH decline compared to other methods of slaughter. A further increase in the rate of pH decline was achieved by low voltage stimulation at the time of slaughter. It was concluded that the combined effects of low voltage and high voltage stimulation can cause irreversible contraction and associated toughness in a large proportion of carcases. Studies of the occurrence of haemorrhages in carcases and organs indicated that these defects are related to the method of stunning. Although blood splash has been reported to be associated with prolonged one stage prothrombin times in lambs, no statistical association was found between this parameter and speckling. It was found that there is a two to threefold increase in arterial pressure following 'head-only' stunning whereas there was only a moderate increase in venous pressure. On the other hand, stunning by the 'head-to-back' method was followed by a decrease in arterial pressure, but venous pressure increased to levels above 50 mm Hg. Electromyographic studies indicated that there is a significant increase in the intensity of muscular activity following 'head-to-back' stunning as compared to 'head-only stunning and that there is a correlation between the increased muscular activity and the increase in venous pressure. It is concluded that these events may lead to pressure changes in the microcirculatory bed which are likely to be associated with the occurrence of haemorrhagic defects following stunning by electrical methods...|$|R
