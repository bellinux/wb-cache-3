He broke the previous record for receiving yards in a game (208, by Jim Morse in a 1955 game vs. USC), more than doubled the old record for receiving yards in a season and scored 19 more receptions in one season than any previous Notre Dame player.

50|$|Away {{from the}} plane in those regions where {{only one or two}} {{relatively}} narrow CO lines are found, frequency-switching by 10-20 MHz at a rate of 1 Hz was often used instead of <b>position</b> <b>switching.</b> Since spectral lines remain within the range of the spectrometer in both phases of the switching cycle, data could be obtained twice as fast as with <b>position</b> <b>switching,</b> although higher order polynomials, typically 4th or 5th order, were required to remove the residual baseline. A telluric emission line from CO in the mesosphere, variable in both intensity and LSR velocity, is detected in frequency-switched spectra; because the LSR velocity of the line could be predicted exactly, blending with Galactic emission could be avoided by appropriate scheduling of the observations. In a few cases of large surveys (e.g., Taurus and Orion) a model of the telluric line was fit daily to spectra free of Galactic emission and used to remove the line from all spectra.|$|R
40|$|Improvements in {{performance}} on visual tasks due to practice are often specific to a retinal position or stimulus feature. Many researchers suggest that specific perceptual learning alters selective retinotopic representations in early visual analysis. However, transfer {{is almost always}} practically advantageous, and it does occur. If perceptual learning alters location-specific representations, how does it transfer to new locations? An integrated reweighting theory explains transfer over retinal locations by incorporating higher level location-independent representations into a multilevel learning system. Location transfer is mediated through locationindependent representations, whereas stimulus feature transfer is determined by stimulus similarity at both location-specific and location-independent levels. Transfer to new locations/positions differs fundamentally from transfer to new stimuli. After substantial initial training on an orientation discrimination task, switches to a new location or position are compared with switches to new orientations in the same position, or switches of both. <b>Position</b> <b>switches</b> led to the highest degree of transfer, whereas orientation switches led to {{the highest levels of}} specificity. A computational model of integrated reweighting is developed and tested that incorporates the details of the stimuli and the experiment. Transfer to an identical orientation task in a new position is mediated via more broadly tuned location-invariant representations, whereas changing orientation in the same position invokes interference or independent learning of the new orientations at both levels, reflecting stimulus dissimilarity. Consistent with single-cell recording studies, perceptual learning alters the weighting of both early and midlevel representations of the visual system...|$|E
40|$|This {{investment}} project {{was dedicated to}} the development of models for low-noise garbage truck retrofitting in accordance with the acoustic requirements established through guideline RAL-UZ 59 for the award of environmental quality seals. Carrier trucks (MB 1613 KO) were retrofitted to meet low-noise chassis requirements in accordance with annex XXI, section 49, paragraph 3 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The noise of a newly designed low-noise lifting and tipping unit was reduced by 16 dB (A) as compared to the conventional ones. New covers were designed for bulk garbage containers. Noise reduction was 6 dB (A) during simulated lifting and tipping and 9 dB (A) during the transport phases. The cylinders of the presss plate were provided with <b>position</b> <b>switches</b> to slow the cylinders down before reaching the final position. The dumping body was noise-insulated for a noise reduction of 3 dB (A). The overall sound level A of garbage trucks operating state B was reduced by 5 dB (A) to 97 dB (A) in accordance with RAL-UZ 59. The guideline's acoustic requirements were fulfilled. New garbage trucks are manufactured meanwhile considering the developed noise reduction model.

40|$|Introduction The COSTIS {{system is}} a commercially {{available}} target station for the irradiation of solid targets. Up to 3 targets can be provided for irradiation by a slot system. In standard setup the target can be ejected via a pneumatically driven piston system. The target is then allowed to drop down into an open lead container, which can be closed remotely afterwards. The described procedure is well established and reliable. But the concept is limited to low dose targets and environments. The required entering of the cyclotron vault for manual pick up of the container at the cyclotron and the light 18 mm Pb lead shielding of the container itself cause exposure risk for the personnel after long term irradiations with highly activated cyclotron parts and target. The purpose of this work was the design of an alternative for the pickup and the transport of irradiated targets to minimize the radiation dosage of the personnel during manual handling of the COSTIS-lead container. Principle The new designed transport system still uses the software controlled target ejection function of the COSTIS/IBA-system. With ejection the target capsule is allowed to fall into a PTFE-container. To assure a safe target drop into the PTFE container, {{the gap between the}} target guiding plate and the PTFE container is smaller than d/ 2 of the target capsule. After target ejection the PTFE-container can be transferred remotely from target ejection position (1) to the loading station (2) with a target slide. The loading station allows the transfer of the PTFE container remotely into a lead container (60 mm Pb). Now the vault door is used as carrier of the Pb-container. For this purpose a proper fixture for the Pb-container is mounted at the front side of the vault door and via opening the vault door the container is safely transported out of the vault. Outside the container will be finally closed with a lid and transferred to a trolley for further handling. Due to positioning of the container at a certain altitude together with the deep positioning of the target coin inside of the container, the subsequent closing of the container does not cause significant dosage, a more complicated automatic closing system is not mandatory. After replacement of the lead container further transfers can be executed without entering the vault. For this purpose the exchanged Pb-container is placed at the loading station by closing the vault door and a new PTFE-container will be transferred remotely from a magazine onto the target slide, which again can be re-motely positioned at target ejection position. The magazine of PTFE-Containers holds two replacements in accordance with the maximal capacity of the target slot system of the COSTIS station. The remote system of the transport unit uses redundant feedback signals for a reliable and safe operation. Results and Conclusion The newly implemented transport system allows a significant reduction of the radiation dose during pickup and transport of the irradiated solid targets. No entering of the vault is needed after irradiation. The system is highly reliable due to its redundant and straightforward design (2 -fold <b>position</b> <b>switches</b> and photoelectric barriers). Due to fixed attachment points in the vault and at the BTL the mobile unit can be easily removed or mounted. The system is maintenance free and all parts easy accessible. For further handling of the targets lead containers were design to fit in the transfer locks of hot cells. The transfer can be carried out directly from the trolley. Container lid and PTFE container are suited for manipulator handling in hot cells...|$|E
