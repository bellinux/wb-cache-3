5|$|The Shogunate {{also was}} {{preparing}} for further conflict by modernizing its forces. In line with Parkes' designs, the British, previously the Shogunate's primary partner, proved reluctant to <b>provide</b> <b>assistance.</b> The Tokugawa thus came to rely mainly on French expertise, comforted by the military prestige of Napoleon III at that time, acquired through his successes in the Crimean War and the War of Italy.|$|E

When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to <b>provide</b> <b>assistance).</b>|$|E
5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted {{to get in touch}} with him to <b>provide</b> <b>assistance.</b> A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A.

Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E

5|$|Tensions were renewed at the {{beginning}} of 1995 as Croatia sought to put increasing pressure on the RSK. In a five-page letter on 12 January Franjo Tuđman formally told the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that Croatia was ending the agreement permitting the stationing of UNPROFOR in Croatia, effective 31 March. The move was purportedly motivated by actions by Serbia and the Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> to the Serb occupation of Croatia and allegedly integrate the occupied areas into Yugoslav territory. The situation was noted and addressed by the UN General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> in combat against enemies.

5|$|The queen only lays 10–20 eggs in {{the very}} early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers <b>provide</b> <b>assistance.</b>|$|E

5|$|Up {{until early}} 1705, Peter's efforts {{were focused on}} Livonia and Ingria, and there were few direct {{confrontations}} against the Swedish main army in Poland. After the initial outcomes in the Polish theater however, Peter assembled his army closer to the Commonwealth in order to <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> to Augustus against Charles, and {{to put pressure on}} the local nobility in an attempt to restore Augustus to the Polish throne. The Swedish army in turn, spent {{the first half of the}} year close to Rawicz in order to secure the coronation of Stanisław Leszczyński.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ship}} unable to {{decrease}} speed below warp 5, and the warp core reaching dangerous levels, Columbia and Commander Tucker rendezvous to <b>provide</b> <b>assistance.</b> However the crew realise that the transporter {{cannot be used}} at warp, so the ships will need to maneuver in close proximity in order for Tucker to be transferred. Captain Archer releases Lieutenant Reed from the brig to perform the transfer. Once on Enterprise, Tucker successfully performs a rapid non-standard cold boot on the warp engine, which purges the Klingon subroutines.|$|E
5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their {{colleagues in the}} United States sought to <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions, Bryn Mawr College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.|$|E
