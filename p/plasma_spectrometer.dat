5|$|On September 12, 2013, NASA officially {{confirmed}} that Voyager 1 {{had reached the}} interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause; {{a new model of}} the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found. A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1s <b>plasma</b> <b>spectrometer</b> had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space.|$|E

25|$|Cassini <b>Plasma</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (CAPS): The CAPS is {{a direct}} sensing {{instrument}} that measures the energy and electrical charge of particles that the instrument encounters (the number of electrons and protons in the particle). CAPS measured the molecules originating from Saturn's ionosphere and also determine the configuration of Saturn's magnetic field. CAPS also investigated plasma in these areas {{as well as the}} solar wind within Saturn's magnetosphere. CAPS was turned off June 2011 due to an electrical short circuit that occurred in the instrument. The instrument was powered on in March 2012; after 78 days a second short circuit forced the instrument to be again shut down.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 the MESSENGER probe's Fast Imaging <b>Plasma</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (FIPS) {{discovered}} several molecular {{and different}} ions {{in the vicinity}} of Mercury, including H2O+ (ionized water vapor) and H2S+ (ionized hydrogen sulfide). Their abundances relative to sodium are about 0.2 and 0.7, respectively. Other ions such as H3O+ (hydroxonium), OH (hydroxyl), O2+ and Si+ are present as well. [...] During its 2009 flyby, the Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVVS) channel of the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) on board the MESSENGER spacecraft first revealed the presence of magnesium in the Mercurian exosphere. The near-surface abundance of this newly detected constituent is roughly comparable to that of sodium.|$|E

A power-law spectrum is obtained in this frequency range. The extension of the power-law density spectrum based on direct observations to these higher frequencies is consistent with previous extrapolations of both spacecraft and interplanetary scintillation observations and with the dominance of large-scale turbulence in the solar wind.
