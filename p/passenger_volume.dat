5|$|By 1994, EVA Air was {{providing}} regular service to 22 destinations worldwide, and carrying over 3 million passengers annually. In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased <b>passenger</b> <b>volume</b> was boosted by its safety record, {{in contrast to}} its primary competitor, China Airlines. In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification {{in the areas of}} Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services.|$|E

By 2010, the Port of Split recorded 18,000 ship arrivals each year. The port is managed by the Port of Split Authority (PSA).

50|$|Bus stops is a {{designated}} place where buses stop for passengers to board or leave a bus. There are four bus stop types {{which is used}} throughout Queensland. The type of bus stop used is depended {{on the number of}} passengers that will use the bus stop. These bus stop types include regular, intermediate, premium and signature. 'Regular' bus stops is used for low frequency bus services with low <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes</b> and are located in outer suburban or non-urban areas. 'Intermediate' bus stops is used by moderate frequency bus services with moderate <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes</b> and are located in suburban areas. 'Premium' bus stops serviced by high frequency bus services with moderate to high <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes</b> and are located at major attractions (e.g. shopping centres). Premium bus stops may be located near bus priority measures such as bus queue jumps, bus lanes or transit lanes. 'Signature' bus stops are located on busways, interchanges and streets in Brisbane CBD. The bus stop is used by high frequency bus services with moderate to high <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes.</b> These bus stops have adequate space for indented or off-road bus bays and standing room for three or more buses.|$|R
5|$|With {{increasing}} {{competition from}} trucks and automobiles in the 1920s, <b>passenger</b> <b>volume</b> {{began to decline}} along with less-than-carload freight, such as milk from the many dairy farms along the Ma and Pa's pastoral route. The Ma and Pa substituted more economical, self-propelled gas-electric passenger cars for steam-powered passenger trains in 19271928. Carload freight volume increased in the 1920s, however, as more industries located along the line, and earnings were strong enough {{for the company to}} declare dividends in 1930 and 1931. The Ma and Pa's relative prosperity ended with the economic downturn during the Great Depression, which cut the railroad's gross revenues by half from 1932 to 1935.|$|E
5|$|Moncton {{is served}} by the Greater Moncton International Airport (YQM). A new airport {{terminal}} with an international arrivals area was opened in 2002 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

25|$|In 1973 {{the airport}} was {{expanded}} again to handle bigger aircraft. The main runway was lengthened to 2500m, taxiways were widened and aprons enlarged.

50|$|Despite {{the sparse}} {{population}} of the region, the line had a high density of stations. This was {{the main reason for}} the low <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes</b> at each station, which ultimately led to the closure of sections.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{the airport}} served more than 26.8 million passengers, an {{increase}} of 24% over 2009 and <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes</b> were 31% in excess of its capacity rated at 20.5 million per year at its present configuration.|$|R

25|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>volume</b> did not {{decrease}} immediately. During World War II, {{the station}} was used heavily by military troops. After the war, with a growth in automobile ownership, people used trains less frequently for vacation or other travel. Service was cut back and passenger traffic became so low that {{the owners of the}} station attempted to sell the facility in 1956 for , one-third of its original 1913 building cost. Another attempted sale in 1963 failed for lack of buyers. In 1967, maintenance costs were seen as too high relative to the decreasing <b>passenger</b> <b>volume.</b> The restaurant, arcade shops, and main entrance were closed, along with much of the main waiting room. This left only two ticket windows to serve passengers and visitors, who used the same parking-lot entrance as railroad employees working in the building.|$|E
25|$|Upon completion, the {{terminal}} {{was able to}} process up to five Boeing 747 aircraft per hour and accommodated a peak <b>passenger</b> <b>volume</b> of 6,000 passengers per hour.

25|$|The {{terminal}} was {{an architectural}} and engineering marvel of its time, designed with ramps to allow pedestrian traffic to flow {{in and out}} of the station quickly and easily. The station was served by two single-track tubes connected by a loop to speed train movements. The loop included five tracks and 3 platforms (2 center island and one side) and was somewhat similar to the current arrangement. By 1914, <b>passenger</b> <b>volume</b> at the Hudson Terminal had reached 30,535,500 annually. Volume nearly doubled by 1922, with 59,221,354 passengers that year.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, {{upgrading}} {{work was}} carried out at Jurong East to cater to rising <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes.</b> Six existing openings between the concourse level and platform level were covered to make the platform more spacious.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the economic impact}} of the code-sharing agreement between ATA and Southwest Airlines, the first time Southwest has chosen to enter markets via a code-share alliance rather than direct entry. We examine the impact of complementary code-sharing on incumbent airline's fares and <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes</b> and also the overall impact on consumer welfare in Denver airline markets. Empirical results show that air fares decreased and <b>passenger</b> <b>volumes</b> increased for incumbent carriers operating on code-shared routes. Further, we find evidence that this code-sharing arrangement increased both consumer and producer surplus. Thus, the well-known "Southwest Effect" is observed not only when Southwest enters a route directly, but also when it enters a route via a code-share agreement with another airline.

25|$|These are <b>passenger</b> <b>volume</b> {{statistics}} for the line from the years beginning April 2002 to April 2013. The large increases in the year beginning April 2006 were due to travelcards for National Rail journeys being made available from stations with London Underground ticket offices, and also using a different methodology to estimate likely journeys made from National Rail stations in Zone 1. The large increases in the year beginning April 2010 were due to increased train frequencies helped {{by the introduction of}} new rolling stock.

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Fernandes {{unveiled}} a five-year plan to further enhance AirAsia's presence in Asia. Under the plan, AirAsia proposed enhancing its route network by connecting all of its existing destinations throughout the region and expanding further into Vietnam, Indonesia, Southern China (Kunming, Xiamen, Shenzhen) and India. Through its sister companies, Thai AirAsia and Indonesia AirAsia, the plan called for a focus on developing its hub in Bangkok and Jakarta.
