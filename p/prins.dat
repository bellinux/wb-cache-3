5|$|Where You Go I Go Too was {{released}} by Smalltown Supersound on August 18, 2008 in the United Kingdom, and August 19 in the United States. A special edition was issued on December 23, 2008. The album featured a bonus disc with edited versions of the original tracks by frequent Lindstrøm collaborator <b>Prins</b> Thomas. Lindstrøm toured in Austria, Germany, Spain, and the United States that fall.|$|E
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS <b>Prins</b> Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected {{to be in a position}} but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened fire on the battery with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|After the shipwreck, Grill {{remained}} in Canton as resident supercargo for seven years. As such {{he was the}} company's representative in Canton, contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships. He was supercargo {{for the arrival of}} three more ships of the SIOC: the Stockholms Slott (outward journey) in 1762, the Stockholms Slott (resident supercargo in Canton) in 1765 and the Cron <b>Prins</b> Gustaf (journey home) 1768. One of his tasks in Canton was {{to make sure that the}} Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained. The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well, but the one on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building. Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight into life in Canton at that time.|$|E
40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis of German survey data from 1981 to 2006 yielded four main trend components accounting for 60 % of variance of the demersal fish assemblage on the Greenland shelf. The leading principal component (<b>prin</b> 1) accounted for 22. 5 % of total variance of abundance and {{was positively correlated}} with deep-sea and golden redfish> 17 cm (Sebastes mentella and S. marinus, respectively). <b>Prin</b> 2 accounted for 16. 7 % of total variance of abundance and was corre-lated to juvenile redfish < 17 cm. <b>Prin</b> 3 and <b>prin</b> 4 accounted for 12. 9 % and 7. 5 % of total variance, respectively. American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) was attributed to <b>prin</b> 3. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was almost equally assigned to <b>prin</b> 3 and <b>prin</b> 4. <b>Prin</b> 1 and <b>prin</b> 4 were significantly correlated with air temperature anomalies from Nuuk (p < 0. 01), representing the climate effect on the demersal assemblage. <b>Prin</b> 2 and <b>prin</b> 3 were significantly correlated with the July–August phy-toplankton colour index for East Greenland representing ocean productivity and fishing mortality from cod VPA analysis, the latter indicating fishing pressure effects on the ecosystem. About 30 % of total variance can be explained by climate. For East Greenland, strong bottom-up forcing (climate, productivity) and effects of fisheries were identified, whereas for West Greenland both bottom-up (climate) and top-down forcing (community interactions) were effective. With respect to Atlantic cod, fisheries in the case of <b>prin</b> 3 and climate in the case of <b>prin</b> 4 were equally important to explain long-term dynamics...|$|R

30|$|The {{cellulose}} signals {{found in}} the loading plots were the signals at 898 (Β-D-cellulose), 1, 030, and 1, 050 (intense polysaccharide), and 1, 090  cm- 1 (cellulose II and amorphous cellulose) [10],[22]. These points were perceived in <b>PRIN</b> 1 and <b>PRIN</b> 2 loading plots; in <b>PRIN</b> 1, 898 and 1, 090  cm- 1 were minimums, while 1, 030 and 1, 050  cm- 1 were maximums, which is an opposite behavior compared with <b>PRIN</b> 2. These signals showed large values in the <b>PRIN</b> 2 than <b>PRIN</b> 1, which represents the importance of <b>PRIN</b> 2 for the cellulose signals explanation. The most significant lignin signal in the loading plots was the signal at 1, 514  cm- 1 which is related with the aromatic skeletal vibration and CH deformation. In the same way, the most influential hemicellulose signal in the loading plot was the 1, 732  cm- 1, this signal was a minimum in both cases and relates the modifications in the esters {{found in the}} hemicellulose.|$|R
5|$|In February 1942, A, B and C Troops were {{dispatched}} to the Outer Hebrides {{under the command of}} Captain Lord Lovat for extra training. Returning to Troon in March, they were immediately sent to Dartmouth, Devon where they embarked on HMS <b>Prins</b> Albert. Once on board they were informed about Operation Bludgeon and started mission training. The objective of this raid was a large building that was a short distance inland from the Dutch coast, and that was used by senior German officers. For the duration of the operation BTroop were issued with flamethrowers to set the building on fire. After several days training, the commandos moved around the coast and anchored in the Thames waiting for the order to go. The operation was eventually cancelled, due to the increased German E-Boat activity {{in the area of the}} landing.|$|E
5|$|Most of Denmark's top legal {{courts and}} {{institutions}} {{are based in}} Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (Københavns Byret), {{it is the largest}} of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør and Tårnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (Sø- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (Højesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on <b>Prins</b> Jørgens Gård in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron <b>Prins</b> Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
40|$|Activation of the plastid-encoded RNA {{polymerase}} is {{tightly controlled}} and involves {{a network of}} phosphorylation and, as yet unidentified, thiol-mediated events. Here, we characterize PLASTID REDOX INSENSITIVE 2, a redox-regulated protein required for full PEP-driven transcription. <b>PRIN</b> 2 dimers can be reduced into the active monomeric form by thioredoxins through reduction of a disulfide bond. Exposure to light increases the ratio between the monomeric and dimeric forms of <b>PRIN</b> 2. Complementation of <b>prin</b> 2 - 2 with different <b>PRIN</b> 2 protein variants demonstrates that the monomer is required for light-activated PEP-dependent transcription and that expression of the nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes {{is linked to the}} activity of PEP. Activation of PEP during chloroplast development likely is the source of a retrograde signal that promotes nuclear LHCB expression. Thus, regulation of <b>PRIN</b> 2 is the thiol-mediated mechanism required for full PEP activity, with <b>PRIN</b> 2 monomerization via reduction by TRXs providing a mechanistic link between photosynthetic electron transport and activation of photosynthetic gene expression...|$|R
50|$|Electorally, the <b>PRIN</b> abstained in the 1964 and 1966 presidential votes. After the {{military}} coup of 1964, the <b>PRIN</b> was forced underground. It was also weakened because Juan Lechín was deported to Paraguay by {{the military}} junta, he spent many years in exile between 1965 and 1978.
