40|$|Abstract. During oil {{wellbore}} drilling processes, {{filter cake}} is formed on the sidewalls {{of the well}} hole due to filtration of drilling fluid particles. The filter cake {{is crucial to the}} drilling process, since it helps to maintain the wellbore hole, protects the drilling bit from jamming and facilitates the subsequent phases of the well development. The most important parameter for filter cake formation is its thickness and its variation due to drilling conditions. In this paper, the drilling fluid <b>particles</b> <b>filtration</b> process was simulated at conditions mimicking deep wellbore drilling. The drilling fluid was simulated as a non-Newtonian two-phase fluid of liquid and particles, utilizing an Eulerian-Eulerian approach.

25|$|The {{most common}} type of filter is a rapid sand filter. Water moves {{vertically}} through sand which often has a layer of activated carbon or anthracite coal above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute to taste and odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended <b>particles,</b> so simple <b>filtration</b> is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand <b>particles.</b> Effective <b>filtration</b> extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.|$|R

40|$|Clogging of {{channels}} by complex {{systems such as}} mixtures of colloidal and biological particles is commonly encountered in different applications. In this work, we analyze and compare the clogging mechanisms and dynamics by pure and mixture suspensions of polystyrene latex particles and Escherichia coli by coupling fluorescent microscopic observation and dynamic permeability measurements in microfluidic filters. Pure <b>particles</b> <b>filtration</b> leads to arches and deposit formation in the upstream side of the microfilter while pure bacteria form streamers in the downstream zone. When mixing particle and bacteria, an unexpected phenomenon occurs: the clogging dynamics is significantly delayed. This phenomenon is related to apparent “slippery” interactions between the particles and the bacteria. These interactions limit the arches formation at the channels entrances and favour the formation of dendritic structures on the pillars between the channels. When these dendrites are eroded by the flow, fragments of the deposit are dragged towards the channels entrances. However, these bacteria/particles clusters being lubricated by the slippery interactions are deformed and stretched by the shear thus facilitating their passage through the microchannels...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{optical sensor}} was {{designed}} to measure the fine solid particles concentration contained in a fluid flow. This sensor is composed of four light-emitting diodes and four associated light-dependent resistors, allowing the measurement of fluid transparency. Given the small device dimensions, it can be placed close to the particles exit from the specimen. The optical sensor is able to instantaneously measure a large range of clay or silt concentrations in the effluent, without a significant influence of flow rate. The presence of sand grains in fluid flow can be detected. The use of this sensor with a specific triaxial device allows precise characterization of the initiation {{and development of the}} suffusion process on clayey sand specimens. It is shown that suffusion of clay particles induces a decrease of hydraulic conductivity, which is due to a diffuse process of eroded <b>particles</b> <b>filtration.</b> Clay suffusion and filtration processes are influenced by grain-size distribution and also by grain shape of the coarse fraction. Under a high hydraulic gradient, clay suffusion can be accompanied by sand erosion. The critical value of mean pore velocity to initiate clay suffusion was determined for the types of soils...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a microfiltration filter for separation of biological microparticles from body fluids, including peripheral blood. The model used a single membrane filter with a homogeneous 2 D transmission structure. In the model, the individual sieve with a uniform transmission structure in 2 D space was applied. Because of the required survival of biological particles, the presented model was limited to the narrow filtration conditions that guarantee biological activity of these particles. In this model, the filtration process proceeds in the gravitational field without the involvement of external forces forcing or inhibiting the filtration process. Based on this model there were given basic dependencies describing the required filtration process conditions, such as filtration time and internal forces for particle migration in the filtered body fluid. The basic relationships between the height of the filtered column, duration of the process, and average fluid expenditure of the filtration process for different shapes of the channels molecular drainage lines filter have been determined.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{methods of}} chemical analysis are those measuring chemical elements without {{respect to their}} form. Elemental analysis for oxygen, as an example, would indicate a concentration of 890,000 milligrams per litre (mg/L) of water sample because water is made of oxygen. The method selected to measure dissolved oxygen should differentiate between diatomic oxygen and oxygen combined with other elements. The comparative simplicity of elemental analysis has produced {{a large amount of}} sample data and water quality criteria for elements sometimes identified as heavy metals. Water analysis for heavy metals must consider soil particles suspended in the water sample. These suspended soil particles may contain measurable amounts of metal. Although the particles are not dissolved in the water, they may be consumed by people drinking the water. Adding acid to a water sample to prevent loss of dissolved metals onto the sample container may dissolve more metals from suspended soil <b>particles.</b> <b>Filtration</b> of soil <b>particles</b> from the water sample before acid addition, however, may cause loss of dissolved metals onto the filter. The complexities of differentiating similar organic molecules are even more challenging.Making these complex measurements can be expensive. Because direct measurements of water quality can be expensive, ongoing monitoring programs are typically conducted by government agencies. However, there are local volunteer programs and resources available for some general assessment. Tools available to the general public include on-site test kits, commonly used for home fish tanks, and biological assessment procedures.|$|R

50|$|Similar to TOC, SEM {{particle}} analysis {{represents a}} lower cost alternative to the expensive online measurements and therefore it is commonly a method of choice in less critical applications. SEM analysis can provide particle counting for particle size down to 50 nm, which generally is in-line with the capability of online instruments. The test involves installation of the SEM capture filter cartridge on the UPW sampling port for sampling on the membrane disk with the pore size equal or smaller than the target size of the UPW particles. The filter is then transferred to the SEM microscope where its surface is scanned for detection and identification of the particles. The main disadvantage of SEM analysis is long sampling time. Depending on the pore size and the pressure in the UPW system, the sampling time can be between one week and one month. However, typical robustness and stability of the <b>particle</b> <b>filtration</b> systems allow for successful applications of the SEM method. Application of Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) provides compositional analysis of the particles, making SEM also helpful for systems with on-line particle counters.|$|E

A preformulatory study was performed to study the influence of the experimental parameters on the production of monoglyceride-based disperse systems. In particular the effects of (1) stirring speed, (2) type and concentration of monoglyceride mixture, and (3) type and concentration of surfactant were investigated on the recovery, fraction of larger particles, mean diameter, and shape of smaller particles (so called nanosomes). Dispersions were first characterized by optical microscopy and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The mean diameter of standard nanosomes, analyzed by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) after elimination of larger <b>particles</b> by <b>filtration,</b> was 193. 5 nm.
