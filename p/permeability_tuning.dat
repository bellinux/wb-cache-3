50|$|Around 1947, {{the company}} {{introduced}} their first amateur radio receiver, the 75A-1 (called the 75A). This set achieved excellent stability {{for the time}} due to high build quality {{and the use of}} a <b>permeability</b> <b>tuned</b> oscillator (PTO) in its second conversion stage. It {{was one of the few}} double conversion superheterodynes on the market and covered only the amateur bands.|$|R
50|$|Both radios used {{vacuum tubes}} and {{employed}} Collins innovations including mechanical filters and <b>permeability</b> <b>tuned</b> oscillators. The latter alters the resonant frequency of a circuit by moving a sintered powder core {{in and out}} of the tuning coil using a lead screw. The KWS-1 final amplifier use a pair of 4X150 power tubes and operated at a power input of one kilowatt, the maximum allowed under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations at the time. The transmitter appearance matched the receiver, but its high voltage power supply was packaged in a separate pedestal.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{produce a}} {{transmitter}} {{to match the}} 2B, Drake designed {{a new line of}} equipment beginning with an SSB transceiver, the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a <b>permeability</b> <b>tuned</b> oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a multi-conductor cable. The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency). The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{bottom-up}} synthetic biology approach to engineering vesicles with programmable permeabilities. Exploiting the concentration-dependent relationship between constitutively active pores (alpha-hemolysin) and blockers allows blockers {{to behave as}} molecular regulators for <b>tuning</b> <b>permeability,</b> enabling us to systematically modulate cargo release kinetics without changing the lipid fabric of the system...|$|R
40|$|The ensemble-based history {{matching}} {{technique has}} been successfully applied to simultaneously estimate multiple petrophysical parameters for hydrocarbon reservoirs. The tuning petrophysical properties include horizontal and vertical permeability, porosity and three-phase relative permeability curves. Four scenarios with different combination of the tuning parameters have been evaluated. The ensemble-based history matching technique {{is found to be}} capable of estimating multiple petrophysical parameters by conditioning the reservoir geological models to production history. The uncertainty range of production data generated from the updated models is reduced compared to that of initial models. However, the history-matched models may not always provide good production prediction results, especially when absolute permeability and relative <b>permeability</b> are <b>tuned</b> simultaneously. This further illustrates the non-uniqueness of the history matching solutions. In addition, three-phase relative permeability curves are found to be estimated with good accuracy when absolute permeability fields are known.

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} Ginzburg-Landau formalism {{is applied}} to analyze the vortex states and vortex dynamics in superconducting spherical nanoshells, subjected to mutually perpendicular strong dc and weak ac magnetic fields. We demonstrate that nonuniformity of the shell thickness can dramatically affect the ac magnetic response of a 3 D array of superconducting nanoshells. Remarkably, this response is strongly influenced {{not only by the}} relevant geometric and material parameters and the ac-field frequency but also by the magnitude of the applied dc field: by changing this field the real part of the effective ac magnetic <b>permeability</b> can be <b>tuned</b> from positive values significantly larger than one down to negative values...|$|R
30|$|At present, {{chemical}} flooding is one {{of essential}} enhanced oil recovery methods. In this study, three core flooding experiments (brine flooding, Alkaline, and Alkaline + Ionic Liquid slug flooding) were selected for history matching using CMG-STARS. Depending on {{the composition of the}} chemical slug, two pore volumes were injected into the porous medium to enhance the RF of heavy oil (14 ° API). We observed that the most challenging part of building up the model was relative permeability curves. So, the relative <b>permeability</b> values were <b>tuned</b> to end up with a successful match of cumulatively produced oil and water cut. Finally, history matching is significant to apply a wide range of assumptions and upscale the experimental results.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogels {{are being}} {{actively}} investigated as encapsulation devices for cell transplantation therapies, as they provide structural stability and protection against harsh chemical and mechanical stimuli, and host immune system. In addition, chemical moieties, mechanical stiffness, and minerals presented in hydrogels act as insoluble signals to regulate {{a variety of}} cellular function. However, the conventional hydrogel design is plagued by complex dependencies between hydrogel properties; stiffness, permeability, density of cell adhesion molecules, and mineralization capacity. The objective {{of this research is}} to decouple or tune the intricate dependencies between these hydrogel properties, in order to better understand and regulate cellular activities in a 3 D matrix. The hydrogel system is created by the assembly of three functional modules that contribute to the overall hydrogel properties: (1) The dependency between stiffness and <b>permeability</b> was <b>tuned</b> by incorporating pendant polymeric chains into a poly(ethylene glycol) -based hydrogel system; (2) Incorporation of alginate into a hydrogel system by co-polymerization allowed the control of hydrogel stiffness without affecting permeability; (3) The hydrogel was modified with cell adhesion proteins independent of other hydrogel properties using an amine-reactive polyaspartamide linker enabling single-step protein conjugation. Furthermore, mineralization capacity of the hydrogel was controlled independently by modulating hydrophobicity, charge density, and porosity. The efficacy of the hydrogel system developed in this research was evaluated by encapsulating two different cell types, fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells, and exploring the effects of hydrogel properties on the viability and growth factor expression of the encapsulated cells...|$|R
40|$|Perfect lensing and {{cloaking}} {{based on}} complementary media are possible applications of negative refractive index materials. Metamaterials represent the natural candidates to realize such property by tailoring the effective dielectric permittiviy and magnetic <b>permeability.</b> The fine <b>tuning</b> of $n< 0 $ of metamaterials {{is limited by}} coarse grained inclusions which give discreteness to the electromagnetic parameters {{as a function of}} their density. We study the negative refractive index of a metamaterial {{as a function of the}} linear density of the lattice period at microwave frequency. The negative refractive index is obtained by a waveguide filled with a split ring resonator array in a frequency band below the cut off frequency of the waveguide. The special value of $n=- 1 $ typical of perfect lensing is maintained by tuning the density on a bandwidth of 1 GHz. A cut-off density above which the metamaterial operates is observed. A second critical density above which the transmission saturates is found close to the Pendry limit. Such results on the density of negative refractive index metamaterials open new paths towards the fine tuning of constitutive parameters at wanted values by means of transformation optics.

40|$|An {{inorganic-organic}} hybrid monolithic {{capillary column}} was synthesized via thermal free radical copolymerization {{within the confines}} of a capillary using a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) reagent as the inorganic-organic hybrid cross-linker and a synthesized long carbon chain quaternary ammonium methacrylate of N-(2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl) -dimethy-loctadecylammonium bromide (MDOAB) as the organic monomer. The preparation process was as simple as pure organic polymer-based monolithic columns instead of using POSS as the nanosized inorganic-organic hybrid blocks (cross-linker) of the monolithic matrix. The pore properties and <b>permeability</b> could be <b>tuned</b> by the composition of the polymerization mixture. The characterization and evaluation results indicated that the synthesized MDOA-POSS hybrid monolith possessed the merits of organic polymer-based monoliths and silica-based monoliths with good mechanical and pH (pH 1 - 11) stabilities, which may be attributed to the incorporation of the rigid nanosized silica core of POSS. Column efficiencies of 223 000 and 50 000 N/m were observed in capillary electro-driven chromatography (CEC) and mu-HPLC, respectively. Peptides and standard proteins were baseline separated by this hybrid column in CEC and mu-HPLC, respectively, as well. The separation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) tryptic digest was also attempted to show its potential application in proteome analysis...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) are {{interesting}} membrane materials for CO 2 separation. In {{order to increase}} the flexibility in tailoring the permeability and selectivity of PIL-based membranes for flue gas separation and natural gas purification, this work explores the use of PILs with mixtures of counter-anions employing a straightforward strategy. A new family of PIL random copolymers having pyrrolidinium cation pendant units combined with different counter-anion mixtures was synthesized and characterized. A simple and quantitative anion exchange procedure was successfully applied to the commercially available poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride as confirmed by NMR, FTIR and titration experiments. Composite membranes of the copolymers with 20 wt% of free ionic liquid ([pyr(14) ][NTf 2]) were prepared and their CO 2, CH 4 and N- 2 permeation properties were measured at 20 degrees C using a time-lag apparatus. In addition, their tensile mechanical properties were also assessed. The {{results show that the}} permeability of all gases in the composite membranes is related to their gas diffusivities which are strongly dependent on the second counter-anion. The prepared membranes exhibit permselectivities ranging from 10. 8 to 29. 3 for CO 2 /CH 4 and from 21. 4 to 32. 0 for CO 2 /N- 2. Furthermore, their CO 2 separation performance as a function of <b>permeability</b> can be <b>tuned</b> by using PILs with different counter-anion mixtures, which opens new possibilities for designing the CO 2 separation of these materials...|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} {{experimental}} methods for {{the measurement of}} relative permeability are steady-state and unsteady-state experiments. In the steady-state method, two immiscible fluids are injected co-currently at a specific ratio through the core until the same production ratios are achieved from the outlet of the core. In this method, the relative permeability values can be calculated directly using Darcy’s law. Although a steady-state test facilitates the direct determination of kr curves, {{it is a very}} time-consuming and costly method with some limitations such as neglecting capillary effects, one-dimensional flow in the core, and isothermal and incompressible fluid (Cinar et al. 2007). Moreover, the ratio of the injected fluids is not technically allowed to be less than a certain value, hence the relative permeability at low saturations cannot be measured. An alternative technique for determining the relative permeability values is the unsteady-state method which is much quicker than the steady-state test. In the unsteady-state test, one fluid (which is immiscible with the fluid in the core) is injected through the core to displace the resident fluid inside the core. Then the fluid production and pressure across the core are measured against time. Since the flow in the porous media is occurring under the unsteady-state condition, the relative permeability data cannot be obtained directly from Darcy’s equation. Hence, two general methods have been devised for the measurement of relative permeability from unsteady-state tests: the analytical (explicit) method and the optimization (implicit) method. In the analytical method, the Buckley–Leverett theory (Buckley and Leverett 1942) is used to derive the relative permeability from the production and pressure profile (Johnson et al. 1959). However, in the optimization technique, the relative <b>permeability</b> curve is <b>tuned</b> in a simulation–optimization procedure to reach an acceptable match between the laboratory results of fluid production and pressure with the corresponding values calculated by the model (Shahverdi et al. 2011). These methods are described in detail later in this manuscript.|$|R
40|$|Steam-assisted gravity {{drainage}} (SAGD) is an in-situ bitumen extraction technique that significantly increases ultimate oil recovery from oil sand reservoirs. Because SAGD {{is one of}} the newest proven thermal oil recovery techniques, laboratory test and field pilot efforts are in progress to enhance oil recovery by using less energy and water for steam generation. These efforts are simplified with the contribution of numerical simulations to optimize the oil recovery of SAGD projects. Several critical parameters determine the reliability of numerical simulation for SAGD, and wettability {{is one of the}} most crucial parameters defining the microscopic displacement efficiency with the change in relative permeabilities, interfacial tension, and capillary pressure. In this work, relative permeability as a function of temperature are determined during SAGD for bitumen extraction from oil sand reservoirs numerically. Three SAGD experiments are used to validate the accuracy of simulation studies. The effect of injection temperature and clay type in the formation on SAGD performance were investigated experimentally. Cumulative oil recovery, cumulative water production, and temperature distribution in time for each experiment are used as history-matching parameters of the numerical simulation. Contact angle, zeta potential, interfacial/surface tension, residual fluid saturation, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements are conducted on produced oil, produced water, and spent rock samples to determine the relative permeability endpoint changes with temperature and with clay type in the formation. Three experimental results are combined with the experimental analyses on produced samples to numerically obtain the relative permeability change at each experimental condition. Numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental findings. History-match is obtained in all three experiments by only changing the relative permeability endpoints, which proves the reliability of the numerical model and the relative permeability assumptions. For the case in which temperature is the only variable, relative permeabilities are adjusted to represent water-wet behavior at higher temperatures. For the case in which clay type is the only variable, relative <b>permeability</b> endpoints are <b>tuned</b> to better represent different wettability characteristics observed for each clay type...|$|R
