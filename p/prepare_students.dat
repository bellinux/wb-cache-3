40|$|Presented at {{the annual}} Association of Institutional Research (AIR) forum, Toronto, Canada, May 25, 2011. This study {{compared}} the outcomes for less prepared and well prepared first year college students enrolled in learning communities at the University of Minnesota. Less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> were retained at the same rate, though their first year grades were significantly lower. In a second study the less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> were compared to an earlier cohort of matched pairs. The matched pairs had similar rates of retention and similar grades. A third study compared the responses of less prepared and well <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> to items on the SERU survey. Less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> reported more gains in items related to the learning outcome communicating effectively. Less prepared and more <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> reported similar gains on the outcome appreciating diversity. Less <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> were as satisfied as well <b>prepared</b> <b>students</b> with their {{sense of belonging to}} the institution and were as likely to say they would choose to attend the same institution again, but they were less satisfied with their grades, social experience and academic experience...|$|R

5|$|After the {{founding}} of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education. The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903. Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927. The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to <b>prepare</b> <b>students</b> for leadership in diplomacy and foreign commerce. The School of Dentistry became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956. The School of Business was separated from the SFS in 1957. In 1998 it was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.|$|E

5|$|Harper was an {{accomplished}} scholar (Semiticist) {{and a member}} of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to <b>prepare</b> <b>students</b> for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community. As per this commitment, he brought the University of Chicago's Seminary to Hyde Park which had remained continually in operation after the loss of the Bronzeville campus through the Baptist Theological Union in Morgan Park. This became the Divinity School in 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to <b>prepare</b> <b>students</b> for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E

Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive {{one of the highest}} levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E
5|$|While the {{vocational}} proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools {{for gifted students}} or those wishing to study a specific subject. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk to <b>prepare</b> <b>students</b> for a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, {{and by the time}} he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills.

Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To <b>prepare</b> <b>students</b> for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a design studio and a cafe staffed by students. The school also produces book compilations of thoughts written by students, conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made by students, to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism events such as the WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism care with about 560 delegates.|$|E
