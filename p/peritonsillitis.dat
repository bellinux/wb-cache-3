5000|$|PTA usually arises as a {{complication}} of an untreated or partially treated episode of acute tonsillitis. The infection, in these cases, spreads to the peritonsillar area (<b>peritonsillitis).</b> This region comprises loose connective tissue and is hence susceptible to {{formation of an}} abscess. PTA can also occur [...] Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be causative. Commonly involved aerobic pathogens include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Haemophilus. The most common anaerobic species include Fusobacterium necrophorum, [...] Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella species, and Bacteroides.|$|E
40|$|The "hot potato voice" {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a symptom of peritonsillar cellulitis or abscess; yet {{there have been no}} studies assessing the resonance characteristics of the vocal tract in <b>peritonsillitis.</b> Analysis was undertaken of formant frequencies in the articulation of the vowels /i:/. /a:/ and /u:/ in six subjects with <b>peritonsillitis</b> and compared with articulation once the <b>peritonsillitis</b> had settled. Significant variation was found in F 1 when articulating /i:/ and in F 2 when articulating /a:/, which are explainable by dyskinesis of the peritonsillar musculature. These findings were compared with six subjects articulating the same vowels with and without a hot potato in their mouth. Variation was found in both F 1 and F 2 when articulating /i:/, which can be related to interference of the potato with movement of the anterior tongue. The changes in the vocal tract differ in these two cases and the title "hot potato voice" in <b>peritonsillitis</b> is a misnomer...|$|E
40|$|Quinsy is {{a common}} {{encounter}} in family physician practice. It {{is defined as a}} collection of purulent material in the peritonsillar space, giving appearance of unilateral palatal bulge. Presenting symptoms include trismus, muffled voice, odynophagia, and ipsilateral otalgia. When the diagnostic needle aspiration reveals no pus, the diagnosis is changed into peritonsillar cellulitis or also known as perintonsillitis. <b>Peritonsillitis</b> is sufficiently treated with antibiotics unlike a quinsy which warrants surgical incision and drainage...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{management}} of patients with tonsillitis and its complications. When considering the aspects of the treatment, the {{attention was paid to}} the problem of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and it was recommended to combine the use of antibiotics with probiotic preparations. There are presented the data of a study on the possibilities of Â­using living microbial cells of Bacillus subtilis (drug Subalin) as an addition to antibiotic therapy of <b>peritonsillitis,</b> peritonsillar abscess to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to improve the efficiency of the treatment...|$|E
40|$|Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) {{is a very}} {{frequent}} {{reason for}} urgent outpatient consultation and otolaryngological hospital admission. Early, correct diagnosis and therapy of peritonsillar abscess are important to prevent possible life-threatening complications. Based on physical examinations, a reliable differentiation between peritonsillar cellulitis and peritonsillar abscess is restricted. A heterodimeric complex called calprotectin consists of the S 100 proteins A 8 and A 9 (S 100 A 8 /A 9) and is predominantly expressed not only in monocytes and neutrophils but also in epithelial cells. Due to its release by activated phagocytes at local sites of inflammation, we assumed S 100 A 8 /A 9 to be a potential biomarker for peritonsillar abscess. We examined serum and saliva of patients with <b>peritonsillitis,</b> acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and healthy controls and found significantly increased levels of S 100 A 8 /A 9 in patients with PTA. Furthermore, we could identify halitosis, trismus, uvula edema, and unilateral swelling of the arched palate to be characteristic symptoms for PTA. Using {{a combination of these}} characteristic symptoms and S 100 A 8 /A 9 levels, we developed a PTA score as an objective and appropriate tool to differentiate between <b>peritonsillitis</b> and peritonsillar abscess with a sensitivity of 92 % and specificity of 93 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{and clinical}} properties of bacampicillin in three dosage groups were studied in 66 hospitalized patients with unilateral acute <b>peritonsillitis</b> in a comparison with ampicillin. Bacampicillin {{is a new}} semisynthetic aminopenicillin which is rapidly converted to ampicillin but is better absorbed. Both drugs were given orally. The mean individual peak serum levels achieved with 200, 400, and 800 mg of bacampicillin in the first morning dose were 4. 9, 6. 8, and 11. 9 mg/liter, respectively, with an almost linear dose response. The peak level of 800 mg of bacampicillin {{was significantly higher than}} the 6. 8 mg/liter noted after a nearly equimolar dose of 500 mg of ampicillin. A linear relationship was also seen between dose and area under the serum concentration-time curve. Preliminary antibiotic concentration studies in five patients indicated therapeutic levels in peritonsillar pus. Beta-streptococci alone or in combination with anaerobes were isolated from about half of the abscesses, whereas anaerobes were isolated from the other half. Treatment was supplemented by surgical procedures in the majority of cases. The clinical effect was good in all treatment groups, with only one relapse. All beta-streptococci were eliminated during therapy. The total number of gastrointestinal side effects was significantly lower in patients treated with bacampicillin, although the difference in frequency of diarrhea alone was not significant...|$|E
