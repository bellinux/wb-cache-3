It was also found that measuring the EV 24 hours post mortem is as informative as a pH sufficient for 24 hours after slaughter. This method was used to assess the influence of the length of <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> and rest before slaughter on the occurrence of PSE defects, where the highest incidence of this defect occurred in slaughter pigs to transport distances of up to 20 km and rest prior to slaughter up to 2 hours.

40|$|Objective The {{death of}} animals during {{transport}} <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> {{is a major}} factor indicating the level of welfare in transported animals. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess mortality related to the commercial transport of finisher <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> in the Czech Republic. Methods The inspectors of the State Veterinary Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the numbers of finisher pigs transported to processing plants in the Czech Republic <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> and the mortality in these pigs in relation to transport in the period from 2009 to 2014. Results Our results show that the likelihood of death losses in transported pigs increases with increasing transport distance. The transport-related mortality ranged from 0. 049 % in <b>pigs</b> transported <b>for</b> distances below 50 km to 0. 145 % in <b>pigs</b> transported <b>for</b> distances exceeding 300 km. The impact of external air temperature on the transport-related mortality found in our study clearly shows that current transport practices fail to ensure the welfare of pigs transported under other than moderate weather. Particularly cold temperatures below − 2 °C were associated with increased death losses in winter transport. Conclusion Despite a decreasing trend in the mortality of finisher <b>pigs</b> transported <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> in Europe, our study suggests that current transport conditions are not efficient at ensuring the welfare of <b>pigs</b> during transport <b>for</b> longer distances and the protection of pigs against the negative impact of extreme ambient temperatures.

40|$|Despite of the {{increasing}} production and consumption of white meats, pig breeding {{is still one of}} the most important animal husbandry sectors Worldwide and in the European Union as well. In Hungary over the past decades, the pig sector has undergone significant changes. The livestock has sharply decreased from more than 8. 5 million in 1989 to 3. 3 million in present. After the post 1989 increase of herd size bred in family farms, their share diminished, at present two-thirds of output is produced by corporate farms. It appears that small scale farming has major difficulties, they must consider all cost reducing alternatives to improve their competitiveness. With pressure on purchase prices from the downstream market levels, and considering that fodder represents about 50 - 60 % within total production costs, in this paper we analyse the influence of these two factors upon pig breeding farmers' supply response.

Production systems can have a significant impact on growth performance and carcass and meat quality of pigs. This effect arises from the interaction between housing conditions, the amount and composition of food and used pig genotype. The choice of a production system depends on local production conditions, pig genotype, consumer demand (market) for a given product quality, and other factors. Due to their quality, the traditional Slavonian meat products can become a recognizable Croatian brand in both domestic and international markets.

Serological testing for additional infectious agents, as well as the need to consider the effect of disease clustering at the herd level, required a re-analysis of the data. Our re-analysis used a representative sample of 4800 pigs originating from 623 Danish herds. Each <b>pig</b> was examined <b>for</b> the presence of CP and progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR).

The project herd is a traditional Danish 500 sow herd with weaned pigs on the same site. 1 / 3 of the pigs are kept until slaughter on an adjacent farm and remaining pigs are sold to local finishing producers. Before initiation of the project, the herd had a consumption of antibiotics around 50 % of the threshold given by the Danish authorities. However, the farmer took the challenge to produce pigs without any antibiotics at all, with the initial goal to deliver 50 % antibiotic-free <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> The measures implemented were a stronger focus on management and vaccination against Lawsonia intracellularis on top of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and PCV 2 vaccination.

From Virginia south to Florida Panhandle. and west to the Mississippi River south to Louisiana, the favored meat in Southern, Cajun, Appalachian, and Creole cooking is pork and has been since colonial times: pigs did not require any special handling or maintenance and could be sent {{off into the woods}} and rounded up again when supplies ran low, and thus were the prime choice for meat for small farmers and plantation owners, and for men living up in the mountains, the tradition was to drive their pigs to market every fall, fattening them up on the many nuts and acorns that proliferated in the area.

40|$|Modern pig {{production}} {{is facing a}} number of diseases where control strategies, if available, are voluntary. An example could be {{the adoption of a}} vaccination program against Swine Influenza. Although such a vaccine currently is unavailable in Denmark, an economic analysis of application under typical Danish slaughter {{pig production}} conditions serves well to illustrate the conceptual aspects of such a decision problem. The efficacy of a vaccine can be established under experimental conditions, while the value of a vaccination program needs modeling of the specific conditions of the production system in which the vaccine should operate. A model where the control strategy for a Swine Influenza-like disease and the delivery policy are optimized simultaneously is developed in Toft et al. (2001). The optimal policy will consist of decisions at multiple time scales. The optimal delivery policy at the finishing time for a batch of pigs will be contingent upon the chosen vaccination policy adopted {{at the beginning of the}} current fattening period. Using this model we explore the cost-benefit relationship of vaccines with efficacy less than 1 applied to Danish conditions. We adopt 2 different interpretations of imperfect efficacy taken from Halloran et al. (1992). A leaky vaccine that offer reduced susceptibility to all pigs, and an all-or-nothing vaccine where a fraction of pigs are offered complete immunity while the remaining pigs are left fully susceptible to the disease. Using these 2 efficacy interpretations we explore the optimal policy of delivering <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> and controlling disease. The problem serves as an illustration of the potential shortcomings of the rather crude efficacy measure usually adopted for vaccines, as well as an introduction to the possibilities of model based decision support...|$|R
40|$|European {{food safety}} {{legislation}} {{allows for a}} new type of meat inspection in swine. This ‘risk-based meat inspection without incision’ or ‘supply chain meat inspection’ (SCMI) uses food chain information to derive a veterinary prognosis on the pigs’ health prior to delivery to the slaughterhouse and allows for visual inspection of pig carcasses. Slaughter companies who want to implement SCMI must develop their risk-based system and have it approved by the competent authority. In the Dutch-German border region, slaughter companies implementing SCMI and suppliers delivering pigs in such a system have to consider the prerequisites of a number of competent authorities. In turn competent authorities have to cope with the special conditions and requirements of a cross border economic region. Within the INTERREG-IV-A project SAFEGUARD issues were addressed that arise from the conduct of SCMI in a cross border context. The main objective was to elaborate an up-to-date comparison between Germany and the Netherlands. We used an iterative approach of collecting information from project partners, external experts and scientific literature and providing feedback to the project group during a number of meetings and workshops. We discovered, among others, important differences in ‘involvement of private parties’, ‘data exchange and communication’ and ‘use of epidemiological data’. We conclude that the existence of SCMI systems using different ‘epidemiological data’ from the holding is a barrier to inter-company acceptance of finishing <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Further, current systems of data exchange fail to give a complete picture of a farm’s health if farms switch deliveries between slaughterhouses.

40|$|Animal welfare during {{transport}} has {{for a long}} time been a problem around the world. Many animals are transported in stressful environments <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Even during Roman and Antiquity times wild animals were transported from Africa to the amusement parks in Rome. The aim of our work was to compare how well Sweden and Denmark are performing their inspections of transports of cattle and <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Today, overloaded transports and poor treatment is not uncommon in Europe and every year 22 million animals are transported between countries. To ensure that animals are transported in a manner that leaves no unnecessary suffering, the EU has established a Council Regulation No 1 / 2005, which applies in all EU member countries. Each country will then supplement this with their own laws and regulations. Probably the best thing for the animals had been to use the so-called mobile slaughterhouses, so that the killing can be done on the farm. But so far the standard of the mobile slaughterhouses are inadequate. If this should work it would mean that the meat will be transported frozen and that the animals {{do not have to be}} stressed before slaughter. Sweden and Denmark have two different systems for checking animal transports. In Sweden this is the responsibility of animal welfare inspectors at the county administration, whereas in Denmark the police are the responsible part. The number of inspections differs in the two countries and Denmark makes more inspections per year. A reason why Denmark performs more inspections is because of their geographic location, and many transports are just passing through while in Sweden there are more domestic transports. There is a lot that the two countries can learn from each other. Denmark has a much simpler checklist to follow during an inspection, but in Sweden, for example, they have a better education of animal welfare inspectors, who also judge harder during an inspection. However, it is better that less advanced checks are done than none at all. Sweden today has not as hard sanctions as Denmark; this means that Denmark can provide higher sanctions for infringements. The conclusion is that Sweden has a better education while Denmark has a better statistic result of number of inspections per year...|$|R

40|$|Background: Leptospirosis, a spirochetal zoonosis, is {{considered}} an occupational disease of persons engaged in agriculture, sewage works, forestry, and butchery. Objective: To determine the environmental sources and the knowledge, attitude and practices for leptospirosis among butchers and slaughterhouse workers, {{as well as the}} seroprevalence of leptospirosis among cattle and <b>pigs</b> presented <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Methods: Using an interviewer administered questionnaire, all 110 butchers and other slaughterhouse workers in the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew, Jamaica were surveyed. In addition, 179 blood samples from animals presented <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> were tested <b>for</b> anti- Leptospira antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Results: Analyses indicated that people with the studied occupations are at risk for developing leptospirosis due to several environmental risk factors that exist in slaughterhouses. Among the risk factors, limited knowledge of the disease and its transmission, lower educational level attained, younger age and unhealthy behaviors (e. g., hand washing and improper or lack of use of personal protective gears), presence of stray dogs and rodents, and inadequate maintenance of physical plants, were found to be important. Of the total number of animal samples tested, 20 (11 %) were positive. Canicola and Hardjo (among cattle) and Bratislava (among pigs) were the major seroreactors.

40|$|PURPOSE. Consumption of undercooked {{pork meat}} {{products}} {{has been considered}} a major risk factor for contracting toxoplasmosis in humans. Indoor farming and improved hygiene have drastically reduced Toxoplasma infections in pigs over the past decades. Whether introduction of animal-friendly production systems {{will lead to a}} reemergence of Toxoplasma infections in pigs is not yet known. Investigating this possibility was the purpose of this study. METHODS. Blood was obtained from <b>pigs</b> raised <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> and tested <b>for</b> Toxoplasma antibodies by using latex agglutination and indirect immunofluorescence testing, with confirmation by immunoblotting. RESULTS. None of the slaughter pigs (n = 621) from conventional farms (n = 30) were positive, whereas 38 (2. 9 %) of 1295 animals from animal-friendly systems tested positive (n = 33 farms; 13 [39 %] farms positive). CONCLUSIONS. The following conclusions may be derived from this study: Conventionally (indoors) raised pigs are free from Toxoplasma infection, and (2) animal-friendly production systems may lead to a reemergence of Toxoplasma infections, although many of these farms remain Toxoplasma free. Slaughterhouse monitoring of pigs from animal-friendly production systems combined with on-farm prevention strategies should be applied to ensure safety for consumers of the meat products obtained from these animals...|$|R

According to Katarína Nádaská of the Department of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology at Comenius University in Bratislava, the traditional period <b>for</b> <b>pig</b> <b>slaughters</b> usually started on 21 December, the feast day of St. Thomas. There was a special magical importance attached to the date and farmers believed that the meat of a pig slaughtered on St. Thomas Day would last longer. A second traditional pig slaughtering period began around Mardi Gras.|$|R
50|$|Agricultural {{production}} of Changsha has shied from traditional mode to modern mode. The four industrial belts of grains, tea, flowers and aquatic products {{have formed a}} certain scale. Changsha is committed to giving full play to the advantages of rice industry, aiming to build international rice capital. In the whole year of 2016, the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery of Changsha realized on increase of RMB 58,360,000,000. The grain planting area of the whole year was 3730 km2 of which the planting area of paddy was 3360 km2. The planting area of high quality paddy accounted for 78.8%, that of vegetables was 1720 km2, that of oil plants was 5600 km2, a rise of 1.1%, {{and the number of}} <b>pigs</b> ready <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> was 737,680,000. The yields of its major agricultural products remained stable. The were 5689 agricultural product processing enterprises in Changsha, of which 76 were state-level or provincial-level enterprises. There were 7,273 farmers' specialized cooperative organizations, the number of the farmers registered in organizations was 167,200, and the number of the farmers that got involved was 331,900. The total power of agricultural machinery reached 595.9 kilowatts, the total cost of agricultural machinery was RMB 2,998,000,000 and the machanized planting and harvest for rice accounted for 75.7%.|$|R
40|$|Pork carcasses’ {{direct or}} {{indirect}} contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli (hygiene criterions), mainly by bacteria present in intestinal or skin faecal material, can occur {{at different stages of}} the slaughter line. In this study it was determined the level of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli contamination on the skin of 100 pigs and in the corresponding carcasses. It also was analysed, <b>for</b> each <b>pig,</b> the skin visible level of faecal contamination (VLFC), recorded the holding time in lairage and the slaughter order (beginning or ending). In each animal, sponge swabs were performed on the skin and in the respective carcasses (approximate 1000 cm 2). A total of 200 samples were microbiologically analyzed according to ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004 (Enterobacteriaceae) and ISO 16649 - 2 : 2001 (E. coli). The achieved results showed that there was no significant correlation (p-value 3 ̆e 0, 05) between VLFC in the skin´s pig and its level of bacteria contamination which could be due to the shower, used before stunning, that maybe had a different effect on the removal of VLFC and bacteria from the skin (that could still adhered to the skin after shower). Increasing holding time in lairage leaded to a highly significant increasing level of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 001), both on swines’ skin and in the respective carcasses. Achieved results also showed that pigs mean time in lairage was significantly higher <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> <b>slaughtered</b> at the beginning than <b>for</b> those ones <b>slaughtered</b> {{at the end of the}} session (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), which could help to explain why the average level of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli on pigs skin´s and in carcasses was significantly higher <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> <b>slaughtered</b> at the beginning than <b>for</b> those <b>slaughtered</b> at the end. The results allows to underline lairage logistic and showers efficiency before slaughter as important processes that should be efficiently controlled in order to improve hygiene level of pork carcasses...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on the {{occurrence}} of Salmonella on pork {{on the island of}} Ireland and an assessment of the risk factors contributing to its transmission. It included microbiological studies to track the Salmonella status of individual pigs through the pork chain from farm to primal cuts. Studies on the Salmonella status of pork cuts in boning hall, and on raw pork cuts at retail were also undertaken. A quantitative microbial risk assessment model was developed for Salmonella on pork cuts covering the chain from slaughter to boned-out cuts. The study observed that <b>pigs</b> presented <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> on the island of Ireland are frequently infected with Salmonella. During the slaughter process the pathogen can be transferred to the meat. Categorising the pig herd based on a historical serological testing for the presence of Salmonella was not shown to be a good predictor of the bacteriological Salmonella status of individual pigs at the time of slaughter. However, it is acknowledged that serological testing does help in giving a rough estimate of the overall Salmonella status of a pig herd and the risk model showed a linear correlation between prevalence of Salmonella in caecal contents and on pork cuts at factory level. Therefore if the number of herds presented <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> with high levels of Salmonella (Category 3) was reduced, there would be less potential for contamination of the lairage, equipment etc and so less Salmonella contamination on pork. The impact of cross contamination during transport, lairage, processing and distribution cannot be ignored and measures to reduce this would significantly reduce the dissemination of Salmonella in the chain and the risk posed...|$|R
