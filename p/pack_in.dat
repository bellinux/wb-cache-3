5|$|As {{is common}} for non-dominant wolf males, OR-7 left the Imnaha <b>Pack</b> <b>in</b> the Wallowa Mountains near Joseph in September 2011, presumably {{in search of a}} mate. In November, he became the first wolf {{detected}} in western Oregon in more than 60 years when he was photographed east of Butte Falls by an automatic trail camera. This marked the first known wild wolf presence in southwestern Oregon since 1946.|$|E

5|$|New mixes will {{be added}} {{regularly}} to DJ Hero through downloadable content that can be purchased on the console's respective online stores; content was made available {{on the day of}} the game's release. Unlike Guitar Hero games' downloadable content, which costs approximately US$2 per track, each mix costs approximately $3 to download because of the additional effort needed to create the mixes. Furthermore, mixes are provided only as bundles for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users; the Wii's storefront prevents the selling of bundled packages; instead, each track is offered individually. Critics viewed the lack of individual song selection on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms as a way of limiting consumers' choice, as previous downloadable songs for games such as Guitar Hero allow players on these systems to select individual tracks to purchase from a bundle. The long time between the second downloadable <b>pack</b> (<b>in</b> November 2009) and the third <b>pack</b> (<b>in</b> March 2010) was also believed to be the result of a last-ditch effort by Activision to support the game, and that the few packs released did not meet expectations for the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Binary uniformly <b>packed</b> <b>in</b> {{the narrow}} sense codes were {{introduced}} in 1971 by Semakov, Zinoviev and Zaitsev. Later more general definitions were proposed by Bassalygo, Zaitsev and Zinoviev (uniformly <b>packed</b> <b>in</b> the wide sense codes) and by Goethals and Tilborg (uniformly packed codes). We consider binary uniformly <b>packed</b> <b>in</b> the wide sense codes. These codes are well known for their remarkable properties and have been intensively studied. In this paper we give an upper bound {{on the number of}} distinct uniformly <b>packed</b> <b>in</b> the wide sense codes of length n with constant odd minimum distance d and fixed parameters of <b>packing.</b> <b>In</b> particular, we give nontrivial upper bounds on the numbers of Preparata codes with d = 5, primitive BCH codes with d equal to 5 or 7, Goethals codes with d = 7, et al. The result obtained generalizes the upper bound for the number of perfect codes with d = 3 that was derived by Avgustinovich in 1995. I...|$|R

5|$|The adult {{wolves and}} their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group the Rogue Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf <b>pack</b> <b>in</b> Oregon. By July, wildlife biologists {{found evidence that}} OR-7 and his mate had produced a second litter of pups. A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total of wolves in this pack to seven. By 2016, the pack size had grown to nine.|$|E
5|$|Wolves were reintroduced {{into the}} Northern Rocky Mountains in the 1990s. In February 2011, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{attached}} radio collars to several wolves in the Imnaha <b>Pack</b> <b>in</b> northeastern Oregon to allow study of their migration. The pack was Oregon's first since wolves {{returned to the}} state. The wolves were numbered; one of them, a year-old male from the pack's second litter, was given the code OR-7 as the seventh wolf to be collared.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen {{fertilization}} {{is useful}} and widespread to obtain higher growth {{and quality of}} productions. To evaluate the influence of nitrogen-rich fertilizers on the quality characteristics, shelf-life tests of celery grown with two levels (80 - 120 kg ha- 1) of two different nitrogen fertilizers were performed. Celery plants were selected and <b>packed</b> <b>in</b> two plastic films (anti-fog polyolefin and micro-perforated polypropylene). Nitrate contents, weight loss, hardness, changes in colour parameters and total phenols, were studied in both packaging solutions during storage. Results showed that celery fertilized with organic nitrogen and <b>packed</b> <b>in</b> anti-fog polyolefin reached a shelf-life of 37 days.

5|$|By 2014, OR-7 {{had settled}} in the Rogue River {{watershed}} in the southern Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon, with a mate. It is not known when the two wolves met, but DNA tests of fecal samples showed that she is related to wolves {{in two of the}} eight packs in northeastern Oregon. In early 2015, officials designated the two adult wolves and their offspring as the Rogue Pack, the first wolf <b>pack</b> <b>in</b> western Oregon and the state's ninth overall since wolves returned to Oregon from Idaho in the 1990s. The batteries in OR-7's tracking collar expired in October 2015, and monitoring the pack since then has depended on trail cameras and live sightings. Meanwhile, other wolves have migrated into the mountainous cross-border region, and relatives of OR–7 have formed two packs in northern California.|$|E
5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash.

The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
