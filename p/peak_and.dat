Similarly, a calendar year series whose monthly analogue lags 6 months behind business at large should reach its <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> troughs in the calendar years following the fIscal years (years end-ing June 30) when business cycle <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> troughs are recorded.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new hybrid method in {{non-uniform}} sampling coding that uses adaptive filters as like zero-crossing and correlation. In speech signals, the modified zero-crossing rate method {{refers to the}} number of times in which the signal crosses zero in frame, the rate is high in noisy parts but low in voiced signal or unvoiced signal. And the correlation is high in voiced signals, low in noise. Also the non-uniform sampling uses the <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> valleys, we consider that <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> valleys is high in correlation. The method proposed in this paper uses the number of <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> valleys in determining the threshold values of voiced, unvoiced signal and noise. Therefore, by decreasing the number of samples from sections with noise and voiceless sounds which have a high number of <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> valleys, and by creating a signal that has little effect on the recognized signals, we may get higher compression rates...|$|R
