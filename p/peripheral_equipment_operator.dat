40|$|The {{features}} {{of information and}} network economy influence {{on the nature of}} employment are being analyzed. With the development of the fifth technological mode, mechanical movement of the labour forces from one industry to another one is impossible. This is prevented by a broad restructuring of the occupational structure of employment, the disappearance of many "old" professions and the emergence of the ones, which require special educational training. There is a growing share of employment mainly in mental labour and decrease of the proportion of persons employed in manual labour, which includes workers of all skill levels. The reduction of productive employment, partly related to labour productivity growth, is offset by its growth in non-manufacturing "computer" occupations - among various administrative support staff servicing computers, creators of <b>peripheral</b> <b>equipment</b> and programmers, <b>operators</b> of local networks etc. New information technologies make it possible to extend flexible forms of employment that do not require steady jobs. In this process, the information economy can provide a number of issues in employment related to the erosion of traditional social and labour relations, weakening of the legal protection of employees in the information business that requires adequate response of the society and the state...|$|R

40|$|Struck-by {{fatalities}} involving {{heavy equipment}} such as trucks and cranes accounted for 24. 6 % of the fatalities between 1997 - 2007 in the construction industry. Limited visibility due to blind spots and travel in reverse direction are the primary causes of these fatalities. Blind spots are spaces surrounding an equipment that are invisible to the <b>equipment</b> <b>operator.</b> Thus, a hazard is posed to the ground personnel working in the blind spaces of an <b>equipment</b> <b>operator.</b> This research presents a novel approach to intelligently identify potential hazards posed to workers operating near an equipment by determining the visible and blind space regions of an <b>equipment</b> <b>operator</b> in real-time. A depth camera is used to estimate the head posture of the <b>equipment</b> <b>operator</b> and continuously track the head location and orientation using Random Forests algorithm. The head posture information is then integrated with point cloud data of the construction equipment to determine both the visible and the blindspots region of the <b>equipment</b> <b>operator</b> using Ray-Casting algorithm. Simulation and field experiments were carried out to validate this approach in controlled and uncontrolled environment respectively. Research findings demonstrate the potential of this approach to enhance safety performance by detecting hazardous proximity situations. Ph. D...|$|R
