40|$|The main {{advantage}} of induction cooking is the pan heating without thermal inertia. However to obtain best efficiency, {{it is essential}} to have an inductor geometry that gives a homogeneous temperature on the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom.</b> In this paper, we will first model the magneto thermal phenomena of the system by a finite element method (FEM) {{in order to determine the}} distribution of temperature on the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom</b> taking into consideration the nonlinearity of the system. This study shows that the temperature is not homogeneously distributed. Then, in the aim to have homogeneous temperature distribution in the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom,</b> we propose an inductor structure with four throats containing the coils and we will use Neural Networks to determine the optimal throats distribution and their dimensions. The optimized structure permits us to achieve our goal. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As for the {{phenomenon}} of the bottom thermal inward convex distortion of the Composite <b>Bottom</b> <b>Pan</b> (CBP) on the condition of heating, the mechanism of the bottom distortion was researched on the basis of ANSYS 10. 0 considering the structural characteristic and the heating conditions of the composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan.</b> The results showed that the thicker the bottom of the composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan,</b> the smaller its thermal deformation amount. The thicker the junction of the pot and wall was, the smaller its deformation. And it was helpful for reduction of deformation to use a big rounded transition. The increase of rings number of magnetic conductive sheet would lead to a less bottom thermal inward convex distortion of the CBP. The larger the area of the additional stainless steel sheet (or ring), the smaller the deformation amount. Consequently, the research laid a solid theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of the structure of composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan...</b>|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{reported}} for the bulk motion induced in a bed of granular matter contained in a cylindrical pan with a flat bottom subjected to simultaneous vertical and horizontal vibrations. The motion in space of the moving pan is quantified. A number of distinct bulk dynamical modes are observed in which the particle bed adopts different shapes and motions. At the lowest pan excitation frequency ω, the bed forms a "heap," and rotates about the cylinder axis. As ω is increased, a more complex "toroidal" mode appears in which the bed takes {{the shape of a}} torus; in this mode, circulation occurs both about the cylinder axis, and also radially, with particles moving from {{the outer edge of the}} pan to the centre on the top surface of the bed, and back to the outer edge along the <b>pan</b> <b>bottom.</b> At the highest ω, surface modulations ("surface waves" and "sectors") of the toroidal mode occur.

The dimensionless segregation distance has been correlated with other dimensionless groups relating the various system parameters viz. ratio of the density of jetsam particles to that of flotsam, initial static bed height, height of layer of particles above the <b>bottom</b> <b>grid,</b> superficial gas velocity and average density of the mixture on the basis of dimensional analysis approach for both un-promoted and promoted beds. Correlations have also been developed with the above system parameters by using Artificial Neural Network approach for different types of fluidized beds and thus the findings with respect to both the approaches have been compared with each other.

40|$|Abstract. Laboratorial {{studies were}} carried out to characterise the {{influence}} of different cutting systems (grab shredder and cutting mill) on the physical processing efficiency of spent Zn-MnO 2 batteries. The grab shredder operate based on an indented cutting rotor which applies shear and abrasion stresses with a moderate rotation speed, while the cutting mill operation is based on shear and impact stresses at higher rotation speed. After shredding with the grab shredder, two fractions of material were obtained (above and below the 6 mm discharge grid), which allows a previous separation of the scrap. With the cutting mill, all the grinded material passed the <b>bottom</b> <b>grid</b> (with the same 6 mm opening). Results obtained showed that alkaline batteries were more efficiently shredded than saline batteries, mainly with the grab shredder. Average diameters (d 50) for saline and alkaline batteries fragmented with the grab shredder were 2. 29 and 1. 47 mm respectively, while with the cutting mill were 3. 09 and 1. 54 mm respectively. Chemical analyses {{were carried out}} for different size fractions allowing identifying metals distribution through size categories. In general chemical composition was not substantially different using both shredding systems. Zinc distribution was almost constant with the grain size while manganese distribution decreased with particle size.
