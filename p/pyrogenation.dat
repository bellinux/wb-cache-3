40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the law of low-temperature oxidation and <b>pyrogenation</b> well, thermal analyzer is used to study the oxidation and <b>pyrogenation</b> of coal in Yangquan below 150 °C. Through the TG-DSC curves, the heat release of two kinds of experiments is compared. Combining with the curve, the polynomial form of the mechanism is set up to analyze the function of its dynamic characteristics. It shows that the process of low-temperature oxidation is a clear exothermic oxidation process contrasted with the <b>pyrogenation</b> process and the oxidation of coal needs smaller activation energy than <b>pyrogenation</b> in nitrogen atmosphere. The mechanism is different from the oxidation at ordinary low-temperatures and the process of <b>pyrogenation</b> is the function of polynomial. The mechanism function is applied to the TG and DSC curves...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{presents}} the thermodynamic {{model of a}} heat, power and gas cogeneration system. The energy utilization coeffi cient m, which is {{the ratio of the}} sum of gas calorifi c value and heat supplied to the boiler to the low calorifi c value of coal, is used as a criterion to evaluate the performance of the multi-production system. The emphasis was placed on the vaporization of the coal and the combustion in the boiler. For gas output 10, 000 m 3 ·h− 1 and boiler steam load 130 t·h− 1, the change of gross coal consumption and energy available coeffi cient m of the cogeneration system is calculated at different <b>pyrogenation</b> temperatures with three types of coals. The results show that the energy available coeffi cient has a maximum value for the cogeneration system, and the gross coal consumption of the cogeneration system is lower than that of two separation systems. In a large range of feeding coal to the boiler, the system gross coal consumption reaches its minimum value and the energy available coeffi cient m reaches maximum when <b>pyrogenation</b> temperature is 700 °C. And the optimal is realized at a higher temperature.

40|$|The viscous {{characteristics}} of the liquefaction system play a crucial rule during liquefaction, and these {{characteristics of}} the coal oil slurry (COS) have been studied. In this paper, the viscosity of the coal biomass oil slurry (CBOS) at three stages while not systematically studied by forerunners was investigated by the torque current in the autoclave during coliquefaction of coals and cornstalk. The results, therefore, show that, at the thermal calefaction stage, the torque current of the CBOS system, predicted with the exponential decay model, was larger {{than that of the}} COS. At the <b>pyrogenation</b> and hydrogenation stage, the torque current of COS varies slightly in the Shengli coal system compared to the Shendong coal system, which presents a maximum. At the cooling stage, the torque current of the COS system, increasing with the quantity of the CS, was greater than that of the CBOS system. The study, thus, in the thesis indicates three aspects for industrial practices as well as fundamental research: the pumpablility of feedstock in the calefaction stage, the anticarbonization in the <b>pyrogenation</b> and hydrogenation stage, and the kinetic foundation in coliquefaction...|$|E

At the same time, {{there are still a}} series of problems associated with these technologies that need to be solved or further improved, such as problem of further reducing tar and impurity content of the fuel gas. In succession, it is estimated for commercialization operational capability of the central gas supply system, loss case and profitable case are calculated by using cost-benefit method. The conclusions are that the gas station must be managed commercially and marketability must be enhanced stage by stage with the large-scale development of the gas supply system for the future...|$|E
40|$|Foam SiC was {{prepared}} by macromolecule <b>pyrogenation</b> combined with reaction bonding method. The osteoblast-like cells MG 63 were seeded and cultured in vitro on the foam SiC and observed under both SEM and TEM to further evaluate the cytocompatability of this novel material. The feasibility of the foam SiC as a bone replacement material for clinical treatment was also studied by establishing an animal model for repairing mandibular criticalsized defects in rabbits, and by using general observation, histological observation and bone histomorphometry. The {{results show that}} MG 63 cells attach and grow well {{on the surface of}} the foam SiC, which indicates that the foam SiC is non-toxic and possesses good cytocompatibility. The 26 tested rabbits are all in healthy conditions and the wounds are healed completely. The different degree of osteogenesis is observed on both periphery and inner mesh of the foam SiC at each time point, and the foam SiC shows no adverse effect to the process of bone repair. It is found that both the rate of tetracycline fluorescence labeling and the new bone area on the foam SiC are lower than those of hydroxyapatite (HA) after 4 w implantation, but there are no statistical differences after both 8 w and 24 w implantations, indicating that the foam SiC should be similar to HA in osteo-conduction ability judging from the long-term repair effect to mandibular defects...|$|E
