5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which <b>propagate</b> as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity <b>propagate</b> at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not <b>propagate</b> {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, {{different}} types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) <b>propagate</b> is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E

5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected.

5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires.

5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation.
