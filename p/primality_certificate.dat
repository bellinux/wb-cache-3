50|$|In 1975, Vaughan Pratt {{showed that}} there existed a {{certificate}} for primality that was checkable in polynomial time, and thus that PRIMES was in NP, and therefore in NP ∩ coNP. See <b>primality</b> <b>certificate</b> for details.|$|E
50|$|In our example, we can {{say with}} {{certainty}} that 2 and 3 are prime, and thus we have proved our result. The <b>primality</b> <b>certificate</b> is the list of pairs, which can be quickly checked in the corollary.|$|E
5000|$|Given , if [...] and [...] can {{be found}} that satisfy the {{conditions}} of the theorem, then [...] is prime. Moreover, the pair ( [...] , [...] ) constitute a <b>Primality</b> <b>certificate.</b> They can be quickly verified to satisfy {{the conditions of the}} theorem, confirming [...] as prime.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>primality</b> <b>certificates</b> was {{historically}} {{introduced by the}} Pratt certificate, conceived in 1975 by Vaughan Pratt, who described its structure and proved it to have polynomial size and to be verifiable in polynomial time. It {{is based on the}} Lucas primality test, which is essentially the converse of Fermat's little theorem with an added condition to make it true: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Primality</b> <b>certificates</b> lead {{directly}} to proofs that {{problems such as}} primality testing and the complement of integer factorization lie in NP, the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time given a solution. These problems already trivially lie in co-NP. This was the first strong evidence that these problems are not NP-complete, since if they were it would imply NP = co-NP, a result widely believed to be false; in fact, {{this was the first}} demonstration of a problem in NP intersect co-NP not known (at the time) to be in P.|$|R
5000|$|We would falsely {{conclude}} that 85 is prime. We don't {{want to just}} force the verifier to factor the number so {{a better way to}} avoid this issue is to give <b>primality</b> <b>certificates</b> for each of the prime factors of n&minus;1 as well, which are just smaller instances of the original problem. We continue recursively in this manner until we reach a number known to be prime, such as 2. We end up with a tree of prime numbers, each associated with a witness a. For example, here is a complete Pratt certificate for the number 229: ...|$|R
50|$|Leonard Adleman and Ming-Deh Huang {{presented}} an errorless (but expected polynomial-time) {{variant of the}} elliptic curve primality test. Unlike the other probabilistic tests, this algorithm produces a <b>primality</b> <b>certificate,</b> and thus {{can be used to}} prove that a number is prime. The algorithm is prohibitively slow in practice.|$|E
50|$|While the {{algorithm}} is of immense theoretical importance, {{it is not}} used in practice. For 64-bit inputs, the Baillie-PSW primality test is deterministic and runs many orders of magnitude faster. For larger inputs, {{the performance of the}} (also unconditionally correct) ECPP and APR tests is far superior to AKS. Additionally, ECPP can output a <b>primality</b> <b>certificate</b> that allows independent and rapid verification of the results, which is not possible with the AKS algorithm.|$|E
5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and computer science, a <b>primality</b> <b>certificate</b> or primality proof is a succinct, formal proof {{that a number}} is prime. Primality certificates allow the primality of a number to be rapidly checked without having to run an expensive or unreliable primality test. By [...] "succinct", we usually mean that we wish for the proof to be at most polynomially larger {{than the number of}} digits in the number itself (for example, if the number has b bits, the proof might contain roughly b2 bits).|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} is {{introducing}} the reader {{to some of the}} algori- thms for proving primality along with practical usage of some of these algorithms. The main objective of the thesis is a presentation of Goldwasser-Killian primality test, which can be used to produce <b>primality</b> <b>certificates,</b> which can be verified very quickly. For better understanding of the test the thesis also includes an in- troduction to elliptic curves, which are the basis of the test. The thesis also shows how is a group of points on elliptic curves constructed and how to use this infor- mation for construction of algebraic formula for a sum of two points on a curve.

40|$|In 1975, Pratt {{introduced}} a proof system for certifying primes [1]. He {{showed that a}} number p is prime iff a <b>primality</b> <b>certificate</b> for p exists. By showing a logarithmic upper bound {{on the length of}} the certificates in size of the prime number, he concluded that the decision problem for prime numbers is in NP. This work formalizes soundness and completeness of Pratt’s proof system as well as an upper boun...|$|E
