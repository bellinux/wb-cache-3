5|$|Beryllium {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and <b>phosphors</b> for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light.

40|$|<b>Phosphor</b> {{converted}} LED {{is commonly}} used as the white light source in solid state luminaires. Among the packaging processes involved, <b>phosphor</b> deposition is a critical step, which controls the overall optical performance of LEDs. There are several <b>phosphor</b> deposition methods, among which disperse dispensing and conformal coating methods are widely used. In these two methods, <b>phosphor</b> materials are applied directly {{on top of the}} LED chip. The <b>phosphor</b> materials are heated up by the LED chip during the operation. The behavior of <b>phosphor</b> materials highly depends on their temperature. The emission efficiency decreases as temperature increases. High <b>phosphor</b> temperature may also introduce reliability problems. The situation can be improved by adopting a remote <b>phosphor</b> method. Some high power LEDs packages utilize silicone lens to increase the light extraction efficiency. It is difficult to apply a remote <b>phosphor</b> layer on the convex surface using a regular dispensing process. In this paper, an innovative multilayer remote <b>phosphor</b> deposition method is proposed for the packages with silicone lens. <b>Phosphor</b> slurry was dispensed directly on the silicone lens with steps. The slurry flowed and spread on the dome, and stopped when it reached the edge of the step. The unique step feature stopped the <b>phosphor</b> slurry from overflowing. A package with multilayer remote <b>phosphor</b> layer was fabricated. The <b>phosphor</b> material in each layer was different. This method provides a simple and flexible platform for adopting different types of <b>phosphor</b> materials in one package, and hence to achieve the designed optical performance. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|In {{the quest}} for {{mechanisms}} to improve the light extraction efficiency and luminous efficacy of solid state lighting, the remote <b>phosphor</b> concept {{has emerged as a}} potential solution. Such a concept consists in bringing the <b>phosphor</b> element at a remote location from the LED chip. Early, this technology was propelled by two premises: a) it allows the <b>phosphor</b> to operate at a lower temperature and, therefore, increases its conversion efficiency; and b) it allows backscattered light to be redirected towards the target. This paper addresses the first premise by experimentally comparing the operating <b>phosphor</b> temperature in the intimate and remote <b>phosphor</b> configuration applied to the light engine approach. Results show that, for the topologies tested, the <b>phosphor</b> operates at a lower temperature in the remote <b>phosphor</b> configuration than in the intimate <b>phosphor</b> one. status: publishe...|$|R

Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of <b>phosphors</b> used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the development of}} an innovative conformal <b>phosphor</b> deposition method. Several existing conformal <b>phosphor</b> deposition methods are compared and discussed first. Afterwards, a new 'quasi-conformal <b>phosphor</b> dispensing' method is proposed. This method uses conventional dispersed <b>phosphor</b> dispensing equipment without any modification. The only requirements are the control of <b>phosphor</b> concentration/volume and the mounting of an additional platform underneath the LED chip. In this paper, the packaging structure and the implementing procedure of the quasi-conformal <b>phosphor</b> dispensing method are demonstrated in detail. In addition, the optical performance of prototypes is characterized and compared to that of matching conventional packages. Furthermore, the impact on production cost is also discussed. Compared with the conventional dispersed <b>phosphor</b> deposition method, more than 50 % of <b>phosphor</b> saving could be achieved with the proposed new method.

25|$|The use of thermographic <b>phosphors</b> {{offers some}} {{advantageous}} features including {{ability to survive}} in reactive and high temperature environments, chemical stability and insensitivity of their phosphorescence emission to pressure and gas composition.

25|$|White {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) became {{available in the}} mid-1990s as LED lamps, in which blue light emitted from the semiconductor strikes <b>phosphors</b> deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the <b>phosphors</b> produces a net emission of white light.|$|E
25|$|Light-emitting <b>phosphors</b> {{are applied}} as a paint-like coating {{to the inside}} of the tube. The organic {{solvents}} are allowed to evaporate, then the tube is heated to nearly the melting point of glass to drive off remaining organic compounds and fuse the coating to the lamp tube. Careful control of the grain size of the suspended <b>phosphors</b> is necessary; large grains, 35 micrometers or larger, lead to weak grainy coatings, whereas too many small particles 1 or 2 micrometers or smaller leads to poor light maintenance and efficiency. Most <b>phosphors</b> perform best with a particle size around 10 micrometers. The coating must be thick enough to capture all the ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc, but not so thick that the phosphor coating absorbs too much visible light. The first <b>phosphors</b> were synthetic versions of naturally occurring fluorescent minerals, with small amounts of metals added as activators. Later other compounds were discovered, allowing differing colors of lamps to be made.|$|E
40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} {{is a good}} alternative light source with reduced energy consumption. Light-emitting diode (LED) is very efficient in turning electrical energy into light. LED {{has a number of}} advantages over the traditional light sources. The optical performance of the LED component is very critical. In general, white light can be obtained by applying <b>phosphor</b> on a blue LED chip. The blue light from the LED excites the <b>phosphor</b> to emit yellow light. The blue and yellow light mixes together to give white light. In order to obtain a good optical performance, it is necessary to apply <b>phosphor</b> properly. It is challenging to distribute a right amount of <b>phosphor</b> on the LED die. Besides, <b>phosphor</b> dispensing is usually the slowest process when compared with die bonding and wire bonding. This controls the overall throughput of the LED packaging process. There are different methods to apply the <b>phosphor.</b> The <b>phosphor</b> is mixed with epoxy or silicone to form slurry and is then dispensed onto the chip. However, the spatial color distribution is poor if <b>phosphor</b> slurry is used. Conformal <b>phosphor</b> coating can be used to improve the spatial color distribution. In this paper, an innovative <b>phosphor</b> stencil printing method is proposed. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the <b>phosphor</b> stencil printing process for wafer-level LED packaging. LEDs are first mounted on a wafer submount. Wire bonds are used as interconnect. The <b>phosphor</b> is stencil printed on the chip surface after wire bond. The minimum <b>phosphor</b> layer thickness is controlled by the wire bond loop height. In order to achieve a low loop height, reverse wire bonding is used. The first bond is on the wafer submount and the second bond is on the LED chip. The reverse wire bond has a very low profile which allows a thin layer of <b>phosphor</b> to be printed on the chip surface. Prototypes are successfully fabricated. A uniform layer of <b>phosphor</b> is stencil printed on the LED chip on the wafer submount. Experimental result shows that the proposed <b>phosphor</b> printing method is very effective in distributing the right amount of <b>phosphor</b> on the chip surface. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

The first <b>phosphor</b> lines were 'green'. For technical reasons 'green' <b>phosphor</b> was replaced by 'blue' <b>phosphor</b> (1961) and finally 'violet' <b>phosphor</b> (1965). The significant distinguishing feature is the afterglow time - 'blue' 20 sec., 'green' 10 sec., 'violet' 5 sec. - rather than the colour as such.|$|R
25|$|Various <b>phosphors</b> are {{available}} {{depending upon the}} needs of the measurement or display application.

For events which are fast and repetitive, or high frequency, a short-persistence phosphor is generally preferable.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{limitations}} in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, {{it has not}} been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit <b>phosphors</b> of respective color in acceptable coordination, {{solely on the basis of}} the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of <b>phosphors,</b> but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue <b>phosphors,</b> unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.|$|E

The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the <b>phosphors</b> deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor {{on top of each other}} and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors.

5000|$|The {{storage is}} {{accomplished}} using {{the principle of}} secondary emission. When the ordinary writing electron beam passes a point on the <b>phosphor</b> surface, {{not only does it}} momentarily cause the <b>phosphor</b> to illuminate, but the kinetic energy of the electron beam knocks other electrons loose from the <b>phosphor</b> surface. This can leave a net positive charge. Storage oscilloscopes then provide one or more secondary electron guns (called the [...] "flood guns") that provide a steady flood of low-energy electrons traveling towards the <b>phosphor</b> screen. Flood guns cover the entire screen, ideally uniformly. The electrons from the flood guns are more strongly drawn to the areas of the <b>phosphor</b> screen where the writing gun has left a net positive charge; in this way, the electrons from the flood guns re-illuminate the <b>phosphor</b> in these positively charged areas of the <b>phosphor</b> screen.|$|R
