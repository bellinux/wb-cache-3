40|$|PhD (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 South Africa’s {{electricity}} supply is under pressure. Mining {{is one of}} South Africa’s largest electricity consumers with electricity-intensive services such as compressed air, cooling, ventilation, etc. More than 40 % of mine electricity consumption is used for cooling and ventilation. There {{is a need to}} reduce the operational cost on a mine as electricity prices are set to increase at least 2 % above South Africa’s inflation target. The mine-cooling and ventilation system was investigated for energy cost-saving. No clear energy and cost-saving strategy for the entire mine-cooling and ventilation system was found. Projects are implemented ad hoc and scattered throughout the system. A strategy is needed to help realise the total saving available on the entire mine-cooling and ventilation system. An implementation strategy for load-management and energy-saving projects on a mine-cooling and ventilation system was developed. A <b>peak</b> <b>clip</b> project on the surface BAC was developed and added to the strategy. The resultant strategy attains all savings throughout the entire mine-cooling and ventilation system. A <b>peak</b> <b>clip</b> project on the surface BAC of a typical mine results in an annual saving of R 1. 4 million. Implementing this new project on other mines could save R 11 million annually.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{generation}} of compressed air comprises 20 % {{of the total}} electricity usage in the mining industry, although compressed air is often seen as a free source of energy. There are however significant costs associated with generating compressed air and maintaining a compressed air system. There are several methods to optimise the electricity used to generate compressed air. The focus {{of this study is}} on one of these methods – the implementation of a dynamic air compressor selector. A Dynamic Compressor Selector (DCS) system was developed to fulfil this purpose. DCS is a system that combines demand- and supply-side management of a compressed air network. DCS calculates a pressure set point for compressors and schedules the compressors according to the demand from the end-users. End-users include shafts, plants, workshops and smelters. DCS takes all of the compressors and end-users into consideration while doing the calculations. This dissertation focuses on the DCS implementation process and on the problems encountered by previous authors while implementing the DCS technology. Additional problems were encountered while the DCS technology was implemented. DCS was however still successfully implemented. This study will expand the implementation procedure to ensure that the technology can be implemented successfully in the future. DCS was implemented at a platinum mine in South Africa where it was able to calculate pressure set points for the compressors. DCS was able to accurately match the supply of, and demand for compressed air closely, resulting in lower overall compressed air usage. DCS improved compressor scheduling and control, limiting compressor cycling. Improved compressor scheduling and control resulted in significant decreases in the electricity used to generate compressed air at the mine.

There are many available DSM measures that can be implemented, however this thesis analyses the effects of two DSM methods as strategic options to reduce energy consumption in university buildings, specifically the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor. The first considered option is the combination of <b>peak</b> <b>clipping</b> and load shifting, which {{is the process of}} shifting clipped peak loads away from peak periods to off-peak periods. This thesis addresses the challenge in performing <b>peak</b> <b>clipping</b> and load shifting which is determining the right time to perform <b>peak</b> <b>clipping</b> and load shifting, followed by an assessment of estimated savings in energy usage and electricity bill through these selected methods. Through careful assessment and implementation of time selection, the combined method of <b>peak</b> <b>clipping</b> and load shifting contributes up to 10 % savings of energy consumption and electricity bill. Another DSM option is retrofitting which is a process that requires direct change on the existing physical or electrical system of old or already occupied buildings to achieve reduction in energy consumption and electricity bills. In this study, the potential savings by retrofitting the currently installed fluorescent T 8 and T 5 lighting systems with more recent LED technology in the selected buildings were examined and proved to reduce up to 64 % of estimated annual energy consumption and electricity bill.

30|$|While speech {{intelligibility}} and speech quality are linked, work by Voiers [38] showed that an amplitude-distorted signal {{that had been}} <b>peak</b> <b>clipped</b> did not impact intelligibility but seriously affected the quality. This phenomena is well illustrated by examples of vocoded or robotic speech where the intelligibility can be 100 % but the quality is ranked as bad or poor. In evaluating the {{speech intelligibility}} provided by two hearing aid algorithms with NSIM, {{it was noted that}} while the intelligibility level was the same for both, the NSIM predicted higher levels of similarity for one algorithm over the other [39]. This suggested that NSIM may be a good indicator of other factors beyond intelligibility such as speech quality. It was necessary to evaluate intelligibility after the auditory periphery when modeling hearing impaired listeners as the signal impairment occurs in the cochlea. This paper looks at situations where the degradation occurs in the communication channel, and hence assessing the signal directly using NSIM on the signal spectrograms rather than neurograms simplifies the model. This decreased the computational complexity of the model by two magnitudes to an order comparable with other full-reference metrics such as PESQ and POLQA.|$|R

In the future, {{it will be necessary}} to change the energy demand according to power generation of renewable energy sources, which means that the regulation will be moved from electricity suppliers to the consumer’s side.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{recordings}} of speech samples obtained with a dedicated recording device to those from more readily available devices. Speech recordings are used by professionals in the field of communication sciences and disorders to identify and transcribe features of an individual’s speech, regardless of his or her age. This process requires high-quality recordings, but devices intended to produce such recordings are often expensive, not easily accessible, and have few uses. This research addressed the following questions: (A) What combination of microphones and recording devices provides the clearest speech sample based on a signal-to- noise ratio? (B) Does <b>peak</b> <b>clipping</b> distort recorded speech samples for certain combinations of microphones and recording devices? (C) Are differences present between the quality of recordings for different devices dependent on the subject’s age (i. e., child or adult) ?

40|$|The main {{drawback}} of OFDM {{system is}} the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signals. Partial transmit sequence scheme is a promising algorithm to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) consist of several inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operations and complicated calculations to obtain optimum phase sequence which results in increasing the computational complexity of PTS.

In this paper, for further reduction of PAPR the <b>peak</b> <b>clipping</b> of the OFDM signal is introduced along with the PTS with new phase sequence scheme. Since clipping is one of the simplest techniques of PAPR reduction, it does not increase the complexity of the system much and a better PAPR reduction is obtained with the combined effect of clipping and PTS with New Phase Sequence. But the clipping technique introduce some distortion in the signal, however <b>peak</b> <b>clipping</b> of signal below a particular threshold can maintain the BER in the tolerable range.

However, OFDM systems result in high peak amplitude after inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) at the transmitter, which leads to large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

30|$|Although soft-clipping {{avoids the}} distortions {{resulting}} from the non-linear region of the HPA, it does introduce new bit errors of its own.

If the clipping {{is applied to the}} Nyquist sampling rate then the resultant distortion falls in-band whereas if the signal is oversampled then the distortion is distributed both in- and out-of-band and the out-of-band distortion can be removed by applying frequency-domain filtering (Armstrong 2001). However, filtering causes peak regrowth in the signal. To overcome the <b>peak</b> regrowth, <b>clipping</b> and filtering is repeated several times until the desired reduction in PAPR is achieved (Armstrong 2002).|$|R
