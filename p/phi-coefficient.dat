40|$|Two {{measures}} of association for dichotomous variables, the <b>phi-coefficient</b> and the tetrachoric correlation coefficient, are reviewed {{and differences between}} the two are discussed {{in the context of the}} famous so-called Pearson-Yule debate, that took place in the early 20 th century. The two {{measures of}} association are given mathematically rigorous definitions, their underlying assumptions are formalized, and some key properties are derived. Furthermore, existence of a continuous bijection between the <b>phi-coefficient</b> and the tetrachoric correlation coefficient under given marginal probabilities is shown. As a consequence, the tetrachoric correlation coefficient can be computed using the assumptions of the <b>phi-coefficient</b> construction, and the <b>phi-coefficient</b> can be computed using the assumptions of the tetrachoric correlation construction. The efforts lead to an attempt to reconcile the Pearson-Yule debate, showing that the two measures of association are in fact more similar than different and that between the two, the choice of measure of association does not carry a substantial impact on the conclusions of the association analysis...|$|E
40|$|In this article, 41 {{models of}} {{covariation}} detection from 2 × 2 contingency tables were evaluated against past {{data in the}} literature and against data from new experiments. A new model was also included based on a limiting case of the normative <b>phi-coefficient</b> under an extreme rarity assumption, which {{has been shown to}} be an important factor in covariation detection (McKenzie & Mikkelsen, 2007) and data selection (Hattori, 2002; Oaksford & Chater, 1994, 2003). The results were supportive of the new model. To investigate its explanatory adequacy, a rational analysis using two computer simulations was conducted. These simulations revealed the environmental conditions and the memory restrictions under which the new model best approximates the normative model of covariation detection in these tasks. They thus demonstrated the adaptive rationality of the new model...|$|E
40|$|Nonmetric traits {{have been}} a fixture in human studies but its true {{potential}} for genetic inferences and distance analyses was not realized until the 1960 ’s. Focus has mainly rested on cranial nonmetric traits while the prospective of infracranial traits for testing intertrait correlation and for use in intrapopulation analysis has not been adequately addressed. Using a skeletal sample from the Dakhleh Oasis, this thesis tests the suitability of 17 vertebral traits for nonmetric studies looking closely at kinship analysis and significance of intertrait correlation in the population. <b>Phi-coefficient</b> and odds ratio along with various spatial statistics were used in this study. The results revealed that intertrait correlation is occurring at a significant level in the population; traits need to be further examined {{in order to be}} used for genetic distance studies, and the use of rare infracranial traits have great promise for kinship studies...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{occupational}} exposures in {{the genesis of}} airways disease may be underestimated in workforce studies because of the "healthy" worker effect, due either to those with more resistant airways entering a workplace or those with work related airways disease changing or quitting their job. Both effects are minimised in population-based studies which have the disadvantage that occupational exposures are of necessity self-reported. The overall goal {{of this research was}} to develop and validate an instrument to measure occupational exposures in epidemiologic research in general population studies of airways disease. The study hypothesis was that self-reported exposure information pertinent to airway disease was as accurate a reflexion of exposure as information derived from industrial hygiene expertise. To examine the study hypothesis, use was made {{of occupational}} questionnaires completed by 338 adults participating in a Montreal community based study. A list of 927 reported jobs was submitted for coding of exposures to 2 industrial hygienists working independently to code exposures. Intra-subject reproducibility of questionnaire information, assessed using a test-retest approach in 33 subjects showed good overall concordance for most components of the work history. Inter-rater reliability (between hygienists) was also good for some categories of exposures. Validity analysis of self-reported exposure, using as a reference criterion the exposure coding by either hygienist lead to poor values for sensitivity and <b>phi-coefficients</b> but not for specificity. Slight improvement in sensitivities and <b>phi-coefficients</b> was found for latest job. While smoking, a family history and atopy were determinants of asthma in multivariate models, significant exposure response relationships were obtained only with self reported exposure, not with exposures coded by either hygienist. Nevertheless the coefficients and confidence intervals for self-reported exposures were, for most part, in the same direction and range as those for exposure coded by the 2 hygienists. These results are consistent with the study hypothesis that self reported exposures perform comparably, possibly even better than exposures based on industrial hygiene expertise in characterising exposure response relationships for airway disease in community based studies...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{analyzing}} multi-dimensional frequency data are detailed. The Second Order Exponential (SOE) model is applicable for dichotomous classifications. The distribution has {{two sets of}} parameters, ϴi 2 ̆ 7 s and ϴj 2 ̆ 7 s. The ϴi 2 ̆ 7 s are interpreted as the log of the odds of the marginal probabilities if no two factor relationships exist. Or if all ϴij are not zero, then the ϴi 2 ̆ 7 s are analogous to a main effect in a 2 m factorial analysis, (m = number of factors or classifications). The ϴif 2 ̆ 7 s may {{be interpreted as a}} measure and direction of the two factor relationships. These ϴij are analogous to partial or adjusted <b>phi-coefficients.</b> The second method discussed assumes a multinomial distribution and the statistics are developed from an Information Theoretic Approach. Each hypothesis is tested using twice the minimum discrimination information statistic (m. d. i. s), 2 I. From the null hypothesis it is possible to estimate unique cell probabilities by an iterative metod. Then 2 is equal to 2 (sample frequencies) log (sample frequencies) - 2 (expected frequencies) log (expected frequencies). (141 pages...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{justified}} {{as a result}} of two factors: (1) general decline of the population of college-aged students predicted for the 19802 ̆ 7 s and 19902 ̆ 7 s and (2) administrative inefficiency experienced by the admissions and instructional staff at Waukesha County Technical Institute (WCTI) in Southeast Wisconsin because of inability to predict which applicants would actually show up to register. The purpose was to bring understanding and control to the no-show problem by creating a model for predicting which applicants to WCTI would likely be no-shows. For purposes of developing a prediction model and a body of information relating to the model, data already available at WCTI were used: information on the application form. Half of the total sample of 300 were application forms from no-show applicants which were randomly chosen from forms on file for the fall semesters in the academic years from 1976 to 1982. Half of the total sample of 300 were application forms randomly selected for applicants who sought admission for the same academic years and who did register. The total random sample of 300 was stratified by program. It was hoped that a set of statistically significant predictor variables could be attained. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. A series of hypotheses were established to determine the independence of the registered/no-show criterion against the independent variables. A matrix of the intercorrelations of the dependent and independent variables was created using point biserial coefficients, <b>phi-coefficients,</b> and contingency coefficients; linear discriminant analysis was used to test Hypothesis 12 (the prediction model). In Hypotheses 1 through 11, chi-square analysis of the correlations required that the null hypotheses be retained at the. 05 level. The chi-square value for the linear discriminant analysis of the Predictor Hypotheses was significant at the. 05 level. The null hypothesis for the Predictor Hypothesis was rejected. However, since all 11 of the predictor variables taken simultaneously accounted for only about. 08 of the variability in the dependent variable, the result of the linear discriminant analysis is of no practical administrative value...|$|R

The experimental task was a sighting task. The independent variables were direction of sighting (two levels) and hand used in sighting (right or left). The dependent variable was the eye used in sighting. Handedness was defined as the hand used in writing. Each of 98 Ss underwent 12 sighting trials which replicated the 4 sighting conditions 3 times. 68. 3 percent of all Ss gave 12 unilateral eye responses. Using 9 out of 12 unilateral eye responses as a criterion of eye preference, there were 69 right-eyed Ss (67 right-handed, 2 left-handed), 20 left-eyed Ss (15 right-handed, 5 left-handed) and 9 Ss (9 right-handed, left-handed) who showed no eye preference.

A total number of 172 releves, collected during 2002 - 2004, is used. TWINSPAN clustering is applied for determination vegetation types. The diagnostic species groups for the associations and subassociations are created by Cocktail method using the <b>phi-coefficient</b> with values above 0. 3 within the JUICE software. As a result class Fesluco-Brometea is established with the alliances Festucion valesiacae, Pimpinello-Thymion and Chrysopogoni-Danthonion. The originally described Botriochloetum ischaemi Pop 1977 association is considered as typical on the subassociation level and a part of our releves are referred to it. Following the nomenclature rules we determined the subassotiation typicum. One new subassociation named Thymefosum pannonici of more xerophytic character, as compared to typical one, and well represented by differential species is established. The geographical distribution of Agropyro-Thymetum zygoidi and Agrostideto-Chrysopogonetum grylli associations is extended to the territory of Bulgaria.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} measures of association for ordinal variables from a theoretical perspective. In particular, we study the <b>phi-coefficient,</b> the tetrachoric correlation coefficient and the polychoric correlation coefficient. We also {{introduce a new}} measure of association for ordinal variables, the empirical polychoric correlation coefficient, which has better theoretical properties than the polychoric correlation coefficient, including greatly enhanced robustness. In the first article, entitled ``On {{the relation between the}} <b>phi-coefficient</b> and the tetrachoric correlation coefficient'', we show that under given marginal probabilities there exists a continuous bijection between the two measures of association. Furthermore, we show that the bijection has a fixed point at zero for all marginal probabilities. Consequently, the choice of which of these measures of association to use is for all practical purposes a matter of preference only. In the second article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the tetrachoric correlation coefficient'', we generalize the tetrachoric correlation coefficient so that a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions can be assumed as underlying distributions. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the generalized tetrachoric correlation coefficient to be well defined for a given parametric family of bivariate distributions. With examples, we illustrate the effects on the polychoric correlation coefficient of different distributional assumptions. In the third article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the polychoric correlation coefficient'', we generalize the polychoric correlation coefficient to a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions, and show that the generalized and the conventional polychoric correlation coefficients agree on the family of bivariate normal distributions. With examples, we illustrate the effects of different distributional assumptions on the polychoric correlation coefficient. In combination with goodness-of-fit p-values, the association analysis can be enriched with a consideration of possible tail dependence. In the fourth article, we propose a new measure of association for ordinal variables, named the empirical polychoric correlation coefficient. The empirical polychoric correlation coefficient relaxes the fundamental assumption of the polychoric correlation coefficient so that an underlying joint distribution is only assumed to exist, not to be of a particular parametric family. We also provide an asymptotical result, by which the empirical polychoric correlation coefficient converges almost surely to the true polychoric correlation under very general conditions. Thus, the proposed empirical polychoric correlation coefficient has better theoretical properties than the polychoric correlation coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Ecological {{gradients}} along river {{banks of}} the Mura River influence forest species composition. On the basis of 58 relevés of floodplain forests along the Mura River, the classification of vegetation plots was performed with the Pc-Ord program. The diagnostic species combination for three clusters revealed after classification was calculated by fidelity measure (<b>phi-coefficient)</b> and presented in an analytic table. Average Ellenberg inidicator values, stream distances and relative elevations of the relevés were passively projected onto PCA to show ecological relationships among them. Correlations of plant functional type and stream distance gradients were calculated with regression analysis. For the main edifiers response curves to the stream distance gradients weremade. The classification of the Mura floodplain forests has revealed three ecologically interpretable vegetation types: Salicetum albae (most humid and nutrient-rich sites), Fraxino-Ulmetum allietosum ursini (ecologically intermediate sites), F. -U. quercetosum robori (the driest and the least nutrient-rich sites). Zonation of vegetation is connected to distance from the closest stream which influences species distribution through ecological gradients of moisture and nutrient. The proportion of therophytes is significantly negatively correlated with {{the distance from the}} closest stream and the proportion of neophytes is significantly negatively correlated with distance from the main stream...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{diagnostic}} species is an important concept in plant sociology. However, since over a century ago, when the term “association” was introduced, the identification of diagnostic species {{has been among the}} most controversial topics in phytosociological practice. With the aim of promoting methodological standardization in plant sociology, this paper addresses: 1) the need to distinguish between the concepts and methods involved in the definition of syntaxa (analysing relevés, characterization, diagnosis, naming and typification), and 2) the need to support and improve existing syntaxonomical classification schemes using statistical measures of fidelity to identify diagnostic species. The phytosociological literature describes numerous different approaches to the designation of diagnostic species. Here, we examine two such approaches to determine diagnostic species using as an example the class Atriplici julaceae-Frankenietea palmeri {{within the context of a}} data set of 5092 relevés taken of coastal plant communities distributed along the Pacific rim of North America. Diagnostic species were determined using both the <b>phi-coefficient</b> of association to detect differential species and the Ochiai index to designate character species. Our findings support the results obtained by combining classic phytosociological methods (expert knowledge, rearrangement of relevé tables, presence tables, etc.) with clustering methods. </p...|$|E
40|$|Association {{coefficients}} are quantities {{that play}} an important role in many domains of data analysis. An example is the <b>Phi-coefficient</b> (Yule 1912) for two dichotomous variables. Suppose the N elements of the di-chotomous variables fall into the classes “+ ” and “−”. Many association coefficients for dichotomous variables can be defined using the four counts a, b, c, and d presented in Table 1. The quantities a, b, c, and d characterize the joint distribution of the two variables. The row and column totals of Table 1 are the marginal distributions that result from summing the joint counts. We denote the marginals by n 1 and u 1 for the first variable and by n 2 and u 2 for the second variable. Table 1 : Bivariate counts table for binary variables with classes + and −. Variable two Variable one + − Total + a b n 1 − c d u 1 Total n 2 u 2 N Using the parameters from Table 1, the <b>Phi-coefficient</b> can be written as φ = ad − bc√ (a+ b) (a+ c) (b+ d) (c+ d) The maximum and minimum value of coefficient φ, regardless of the marginal distributions, are 1 and − 1 respectively. However, the values 1 and − 1 only occur in the extreme cases that n 1 = n 2 or n 1 = u 2. 1 Zysno (1997) reviews modifications of coefficient φ from the literature that reduce its dependence on the marginal distributions. The various pro-posals are considered unsatisfactory by Zysno, and therefore he proposes the modification φ ∗ = ad − bc |ad − bc|+Ne (Zysno 1997, p. 49) where e = min(b, c) if ad ≥ bc min(a, d) if ad ≤ bc (Zysno 1997, p. 47). The modified coefficient φ ∗ has indeed all of the desirable properties discussed by Zysno (1997) : zero value if the variables are statistically independent, maximum value 1 and minimum value − 1 for all marginal distributions. However, coefficient φ ∗ is not a new coefficient, since it has been proposed elsewhere. The first modification discussed in Zysno (1997, p. 45) is a measure introduced by Cole (1949). Cole proposed a coefficient of ecological asso-ciation that measures the degree to which the observed proportion of joint occurrences of two species types exceeds or falls short of the proportion of joint occurrences expected on the basis of chance alone. The measure, denoted by C 7, can be written as (i) C 7 = ad − bc (a+ b) (b+ d) if ad ≥ bc, b ≤...|$|E

Location: At 68 ° to 78 °N: six locations along the Dalton Highway in arctic Alaska and three in Canada (Banks Island, Prince Patrick Island and Ellef Ringnes Island). Methods: We analysed floristic and structural vegetation, biomass and abiotic data (soil chemical and physical parameters, the n-factor [a soil thermal index] and spectral information [NDVI, LAI]) on 147 microhabitat releves of zonalpatterned-ground features. Using mapping, table analysis (JUICE) and ordination techniques (NMDS). Results: Table analysis using JUICE and the <b>phi-coefficient</b> to identify diagnostic species revealed clear groups of diagnostic plant taxa {{in four of the}} five zonal vegetation complexes. Plant communities and zonal complexes were generally well separated in the NMDS ordination. The Alaska and Canada communities were spatially separated in the ordination because of different glacial histories and location in separate floristic provinces, but there was no single controlling environmental gradient.

Patterned-ground complexes with the largest thermal differential between the patterned-ground features and the surrounding vegetation exhibited the clearest patterned-ground morphologies...|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} {{technological}} advances, listening activities {{are increasingly being}} offered online, and with increasing authenticity {{in terms of how}} the tasks reflect activities beyond the classroom setting. Specifically, this study investigates the effectiveness of a CALL listening comprehension activity using an online videotaped academic lecture to promote incidental vocabulary acquisition and listening comprehension. The tasks consist of partial dictation pretest, posttest and delayed posttest, and ten multiple-choice listening comprehension questions respectively. The academic lecture is also part of an ESL Listening course. Thus, it is important that, firstly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the CALL activity for vocabulary acquisition, and secondly, that we examine what learners actually do during the CALL activity and its influence on the effectiveness of the activity. The research questions governing this study are: (1) Can a student-controlled authentic listening text that is not modified for the purpose of ESL instruction facilitate language learning? (2) What do learners actually do to complete a CALL activity based on an authentic listening text?

40|$|Summary. Most recent {{ecological}} {{studies of}} testate amoebae {{were conducted in}} acid Sphagnum-dominated mires. Little data exists about the variation in testacean assemblages along the complete gradient from extremely poor acid fens to strongly calcareous spring fens. This so called poor-rich gradient {{is the most important}} gradient for the majority of mire biota and can display a time dimension as well. In order to fill this gap we studied modern testacean assemblages in spring fens in the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic and Slovakia). The DCA of all testacean assemblages revealed two major factors controlling species variation, the poor-rich gradient and the microhabitat-type: waterlogged bare sediments versus bryophytes. Sampled sediments of poor acidic fens have species composition similar to that of bryophyte tufts from mineral-richer fens. The ordination of the subset of samples taken from bryophyte tufts shows the clear poor-rich gradient on the first axis and moisture gradient causing variation of “acid ” samples along the second axis. Based of DCA results, testacean assemblages were divided into six major types for which the diagnostic species were determined using <b>phi-coefficient.</b> Nearly all types are dominated by Euglyphidae, Centropyxidae, Cyclopyxidae and Difflugiidae were characteristic for calcareous habitats. Species richness did not correlate with the poor-rich gradient. The species variation in testate amoebae assemblages is better predicted by both the species composition of the vegetation as a whole and by the composition of bryophyte tuft than by long-term averages of water chemistry variables. The autecology of many species living in acid Sphagnum fens corresponds well with published data with several exceptions. On the other hand, the study of the complete poor-rich gradient revealed different species optima reported from higher pH Sphagnum fens, and thus it changed our vie...|$|E
30|$|To {{address the}} {{limitation}} of apprentice-solver versus apprentice-non-solver of the first method, a cross-table comparison {{between the two groups}} [apprentices who solve (1) versus those who do not solve (0) the task] regarding their skill-mastering [apprentices who use a certain skill correctly (1) as opposed to those who do not use a certain skill, or use the skill incorrectly (0)] were added. This approach is based on the deterministic CDM model [“Theoretical considerations on diagnostic assessments using cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs)” section], which stated that solvers are able to solve tasks correctly because they are disposed to apply all of the necessary skills in the correct way (=skill-master). However, non-solvers are not able to answer tasks correctly because they do not dispose of all necessary skills or they apply {{one or more of the}} skills in an incorrect fashion (=skill non-master). In other words, necessary skills were significantly more often applied (in the right way) with solvers than with non-solvers. Conversely, those skills that are significantly more often used by solvers than by non-solvers are necessary for the task solution process and have to be included in the Q matrix as necessary (“ 1 ”). Those skills that are applied in the case of a certain task and do not significantly differ between solvers and non-solvers are, by definition, not necessary. On the basis of the categorical variable characteristics, a <b>phi-coefficient</b> analysis (Bühner and Ziegler 2008, pp. 627 – 629) was run for each skill to task assignment. On the basis of a 5 % significance level, skill level necessity was decided. It is critical to note that the solver-versus-non-solver procedure has only limited significance if the number of group sizes differs considerably. This is especially the case if tasks are quite easy (solver group is much bigger than non-solver group) or quite difficult (solver group is much smaller than non-solver group).|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MCom (Labour {{relations}} management)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2013 Globally, {{workplace bullying}} {{is a growing}} phenomenon which affects millions of employees. It is characterised by frequency of incidence, duration and reaction {{on the side of}} both the perpetrator and victim, ultimately caused by power struggles in ineffective working environments. The impact on both the Company and employee is significant and there is a negative impact on the employment relationship. It may lead to reduced performance and productivity, individual health problems, impact on job satisfaction and foster intentions to quit. The primary objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of workplace bullying in a South African Information Technology (IT) company, and determine the impact of this construct on job satisfaction and intention to quit. A cross-sectional survey design was used. The constructs were measured by means of a biographical questionnaire, the Negative Acts Questionnaire Revised, a Job Satisfaction Questionnaire and an Intention to Quit Questionnaire. Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients were used to assess the validity and reliability of the measuring instruments. The <b>phi-coefficient</b> was used to determine effect size and power of the chi-square tests for independence (Aron, Elliot, & Aaron, 2011). The research method for the articles consisted of a literature review and an empirical study. The statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 20. 0 programme (SPSS 2012). Article 1 focuses on the prevalence and measurement of workplace bullying in an IT company. Descriptive statistics (frequencies) and cross tabulations were used to describe the data. Significant relations were found in constructs within the negative acts, and also between the negative acts and biographical information. Article 2 focuses on the relation between workplace bullying, job satisfaction and the intention to quit in an IT company. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, standard deviations, skewness and kurtosis) were determined to describe the data, principal component analysis was used and an Oblimin rotation was performed to determine the constructs for analysis. Pearson’s correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis were used to determine the relationship between these constructs. Significant relations and difference are found between the various individual constructs and the scores of the negatives acts, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Conclusions are made for the current research, limitations discussed and recommendations for future research are put forward. Master...|$|E
40|$|Aviation is {{a global}} industry. Many {{professional}} pilots follow a career path that takes them into employment crossing national and international boundaries. They take with them their training, qualifications and experiences, and then build on these in diverse organisational and national cultural environments. They also carry with them their personal and professional attitudes, which then influence their behaviour. Professional pilots still often display a historically masculine attitude, which affects the relationship on the flight deck, particularly {{when one of the}} pilots is female. Because perceptions based on gender differences (real or alleged) have a pervasive and powerful influence on behaviour, it is important to manage gender diversity properly {{to meet the demands of}} a two-gender workplace. This has important implications for flight crew effectiveness and aviation safety. The study started with an overview of the literature, historical data on female aviators, selected relevant legislation and current world trends in aviation. A survey was then designed as the basis for a cross-cultural study of attitudes towards female pilots. The primary objective of this study was to develop a instrument to assess female and male aviators' perceptions regarding gender-related pilot behaviour across cultures and to determine the main and interaction effects of biographical variables on the perceptions held by professional pilots. The research group consisted of two non-probability samples: 183 pilots from the United States of America and 530 pilots from South Africa. An Aviation Gender Attitude Questionnaire (AGAQ) was devised to provide valid and reliable measurements of attitudes with regard to female pilots' Flying Proficiency and Safety Orientation. To determine the similarity or difference in the response patterns of the two samples, factor analysis, Tucker's coefficient of agreement and analysis of item bias were used. Univariate and multivariate analysis of variance were applied to uncover any possible main and interaction effects of the biographical characteristics on the respondents¡¯ perceptions of gender-related pilot behaviour. The results of the Principal Axis Factor Analysis performed on the AGAQ indicated little difference in the factor structures for the United States and South African groups. Tucker's <b>phi-coefficient</b> of congruence indicated factoral agreement (Tucker's phi ¡Ý 0. 95) between the United States and South African respondents with regard to both factors of the AGAQ. The items of the two factors showed no uniform or non-uniform bias for pilots from the different culture groups. The results of the n-way ANOVAs and MANOVAs indicated that gender is the primary independent variable that has a significant effect (p< 0. 001) on pilots' perceptions and attitudes towards female pilots. The mean scores for the female pilots were significantly higher than their male counterparts for both Flying Proficiency and Safety Orientation. The research findings are of particular interest in the field of Crew Resources Management (CRM) and ¡®Hazardous Attitudes¡¯ training. Topics such as gender issues and diversity management should be addressed to improve and advance gender-sensitive CRM training.

U 20. stoljeću ta metoda doživjela je veliki razvoj i zamah, a njena otkrića mnogo su koristila šumarima kao pomoć pri planiranju šumskog gospodarstva i u suvremenom uzgajanju šuma, posebice za grupno postupno uzgajanje i slobodnu tehniku. Razvoj brzih i visoko učinkovitih osobnih računala u 80 -im godinama prošloga stoljeća, omogućio je masovnu i razmjerno jednostavnu uporabu matematičkih metoda, ponajprije multivarijatne statistike u vrednovanju, klasifikaciji i poređenju fitocenoloških snimaka. Računala omogućuju stvaranje opsežnih baza fitoce no loških podataka koje fitocenolozi uspješno koriste te pomoću njih izrađuju suvremene preglede šumske i grmolike vegetacije širih područja. Korištenje i obrada velikog broja snimaka u mnogočemu je promijenila poglede na temeljnu jedinicu sintaksonomskoga sustava, na asocijaciju i na pojam svojstvenih i razlikovnih (diferencijalnih) vrsta. Usprkos velikom razvoju i sadaš njoj širokoj razgra na tosti različitih pristupa u proučavanju vegetacije, temelji fitocenološkog proučavanja šumskih ekosustava i u 21. stoljeću ostaje poznavanje biljaka, dakle botaničko znanje. Šumske zajednice, asocijacije kao apstraktne jedinice, trebale bi biti ne samo floristički (što matematička obrada može prikladno osigurati), već i ekološki utemeljene, njihove sastojine na terenu prepoznatljive šumarima (praktičarima), a fitocenološki opisi trebali bi im pomoći u konkretnim zahvatima (sječi), planiranju i proučavanju. Phytocoenology (phytosociology) studies {{interactions}} bet ween plant communities. It researches {{the dependence}} of plants on the living and non-living environment (climate, parent material, mineral soil composition). It provides explanation for the selective manner in which nature operates, which enables plant communities adapted to specific sites to form from the surviving tree, scrub and other plant species; it gives an overview of these communities and their changes over time. The article gives an account of a comprehensive historical development of phytocoenology in Central Europe and a description of certain issues in the contemporary phytocoenological study of forest ecosystems with special regard to Slovenia and Croatia. Phytocoenology developed in the 19 th century when botanists did not only study individual plants, but also how entire vegetation changes within a landscape. The focus of their attention became plant formations or plant communities {{in relation to their}} environment. In the southeastern European region, phytogeographical (geobotanical) or vegetation studies {{in the second part of}} the 19 th and at the beginning of the 20 th century were published by F. Krašan, G. Beck and L. Adamović, for example. An important milestone was the Botanical Congress in Brussels (1910), where the concept of association was defined. This resulted in a fast development of the discipline, but different methods were developed in different parts of the world, and attention was paid to different issues. The most widespread, also in Slovenia and Croatia, was the Central-European (Braun-Blanquet, Zürich-Montpellier) method. Among other things, the pioneers of phytocoenological research in Slovenia (G. Tomažič, M. Wraber, and V. Tregubov) and Croatia (I. Horvat, S. Horvatić) conducted also thorough research of forest communities. In this respect, Horvat´s Biljnosociološka iztraživanja šuma u Hrvatskoj (Horvat 1938) is a pioneer work. In Slovenia and Croatia, phytocoenology established itself in forestry practice only after the Second World War. Soon after the end of the war two Horvat´s books, Nauka o biljnim zajednicama (1949) and Šumske zajednice Jugoslavije (1950), were published. Professors Dušan Mlinšek and Milan Anić deserve a lot of credit for the promotion of phytocoenology in the forestry of Slovenia and Croatia because they emphasised the significance of the knowledge and consideration of sites in contemporary silviculture. The result of a very fruitful cooperation of phytocoenologists in the then Yugoslavia and more widely, within the Eastern Alpine and Dinaric Society for Vegetation Ecology in the 1970 s and 1980 s, was also a map of natural potential vegetation of Yugoslavia in the scale of 1 : 1. 000. 000 (B. Jovanović et al. 1986) and Prodromus phytocoenosum Jugoslaviae (Zupančič et al. 1986). The work of the time was incorporated also into the Map of Natural Vegetation of Europe in the scale of 1 : 2500000 (Bohn et al. 2000). Development of fast and more advanced personal computers in the 1980 s, which paved a way for relatively simple massive utilisation of mathematical methods (above all multivariate statistics) in comparisons of phytocoenological relevés and their grouping by environmental factors, brought about a significant turnaround in vegetation research conducted according to the Central-European and other methods. One of the first widely used software of this kind was TWINSPAN (Hill 1979). Later on other program packages, such as MULVA (Wildi & Orloci 1996), SYN-TAX (Podani 2001), JUICE (Tichy 2002), CANOCO (Ter Braak & Šmilaure 2002), PC-ORD (McCune & Mefford 2006), etc. were applied as well. In this respect, a problematic issue in the Central-European method is the subjective selection of relevés and subjective evaluation of cover or abundance of species with ordinal values (e. g. r, +, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). There have been discussions among experts on the correct procedures for numeric processing of ordinal input data. Some, e. g. Podani (2005), believe that only ordinal classification and non-metric ordination methods are suitable for such data. Others disagree. A similar problem exists with the statistical analysis of data acquired using non-random (subjective) sampling, such as are also our relevés. Experts published their pro et contra views on when and to what extent such analysis is appropriate in the journal Folia geobotanica (Herben & Chytrý 2007). Despite the above concerns it is still true that the Central-European method allows a relatively fast, simple and inexpensive way of acquiring useful data on vegetation and its connections with the environment. Databases of vegetation relevés (e. g. TURBOVEG - Hennekens & Schaminée 2001) already keep large amounts of historic, several decades and even half a century old relevés that were made with subjective plot selection. Disregarding these relevés on account of their statistically problematic (subjective and non-random) origin would mean discarding very valuable ecological data. Ecologists therefore use these data to their advantage, but with regard to their limitations. These data are used also in contemporary overviews of vegetation of large regions (e. g. in Willner & Grabherr 2007). Using and processing large quantities of relevés has changed the views of the basic unit of the syntaxonomic system - association - in many ways, and has affected the way we see the concept of character and differential species (comp. Willner 2006). When selecting diagnostic species authors apply different computing procedures. A large number of relevés enable a relatively objective calculation of fidelity of species to certain syntaxa and their diagnostic value (e. g. with <b>phi-coefficient</b> - Tichý & Chytrý 2006). As a rule, in formalized classification the number of syntaxonomic units of a vegetation formation (e. g. forest communities) within a certain region is reduced. The question remains, however, whether such reduction is founded on the actual site conditions and on the actual phytocoenoses. Before the turn of the century there was a shift from the knowledge (study) of plant communities to the knowledge (study) of habitats. It is an acknowledgement of the Braun-Blanquet method that the most widely used habitat type classification in Europe (Devillers & J. Devillers-Teschuren 1996) is in many ways based on this method itself, as well as on its findings and its review of plant communities, arranged in a hierarchical system. If we compare Braun-Blanquet´s Phytocoenology from 1964 and van der Maarel´s Vegetation ecology, which was published in 2005, we can observe a significant development and a broad array of different approaches to the research of plants, including forest vegetation. Nevertheless, the foundations of phytocoenological study of forest ecosystems in the 21 st century may stay similar to what they have been so far. This means the knowledge of plants, i. e. botanical knowledge, remains essential. A forester who is professionally active in the forest should be familiar with the flora and vegetation of his district, so botany and dendrology in the new study programmes should be taught in the same extent as before, with a sufficient number of lessons left for practical and field work. Forest phytocoenology is their upgrading and its composite part is the knowledge of different methods of vegetation analysis. There are more methods apart from the Central-European method. Lately functional approach has gained momentum in Europe in discussions and research of vegetation, especially of that in disturbed habitats, and in the study of syndynamic processes (compare e. g. Grime 1974, 2001, Klotz et al. 2002). It would be very useful for the southeastern Alpine-Dinaric region with its variegated vegetation to prepare and unify the databases of our numerous relevés, to process them and critically review the correctness of names and justification of some of the syntaxa. This can only be done with consideration of the actual site conditions and the actual phytocoenoses in nature, which means we should not act merely as statisticians or mathematicians, who hardly know anything about the forest. Forest communities, associations treated as abstract units, should be not only floristically (which can be adequately provided with a mathematical processing), but also ecologically grounded, foresters (who are the users of our research) should be able to recognise their stands in the field, and our descriptions ought to provide help to foresters in concrete interventions into the forest...|$|E
