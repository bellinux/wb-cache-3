By the Miocene, when Africa had collided with Asia, African rodents such as the porcupine began to spread into Eurasia. Some fossil species were very large in comparison to modern rodents and included the giant beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, which grew to a length of [...] and weight of [...] The largest known rodent was Josephoartigasia monesi, a <b>pacarana</b> with an estimated body length of 3m (10ft).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pacarana</b> (Dinomys branickii) is a {{rare and}} slow-moving hystricognath rodent {{indigenous}} to South America. Native peoples of the region [...] call it the <b>pacarana</b> (false paca) because it is superficially similar to the paca, a different rodent which {{is not in the}} same family. The <b>pacarana</b> has a chunky body and is large for a rodent, weighing up to 15 kg and measuring up to 79 cm in length, not including the thick, furry tail.|$|E

50|$|Caviomorpha is the rodent infraorder or parvorder {{that unites}} all New World hystricognaths. It is {{supported}} by both fossil and molecular evidence. The Caviomorpha was for a time {{considered to be a}} separate order outside the Rodentia, but is now accepted as a genuine part of the rodents. Caviomorphs include the extinct Heptaxodontidae (giant hutias) and extant families of chinchilla rats, hutias, guinea pigs and the capybara, chinchillas and viscachas, tuco-tucos, agoutis, pacas, <b>pacaranas,</b> spiny rats, New World porcupines, coypu and octodonts (Vassallo and Antenucci, 2015).|$|R
50|$|Josephoartigasia is an extinct genus {{of giant}} rodent from the Early to Late Pliocene, {{related to the}} living <b>pacarana.</b> The genus {{includes}} the largest known rodent, Josephoartigasia monesi. The two species would have resembled gigantic <b>pacarana,</b> or capybaras the size of cows, with an estimated weight of 1000 kg.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pacarana</b> is {{the sole}} extant member of the rodent family Dinomyidae in the infraorder Caviomorpha; the paca that it resembles in {{appearance}} is in a different Caviomorph family, the Cuniculidae. Initially, the <b>pacarana</b> {{was regarded as a}} member of the superfamily Muroidea, that includes the true mice, but that view was abandoned in the face of evidence that suggests that the <b>pacarana</b> is in the family Dinomyidae together with extinct animals such as Phoberomys pattersoni and Josephoartigasia monesi, prehistoric giant rodents that lived in South America several million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Josephoartigasia monesi, an {{extinct species}} of South American caviomorph rodent, {{is the largest}} rodent known, and lived from about 4 to 2 million years ago during the Pliocene to early Pleistocene. The species {{is one of two}} in the Josephoartigasia genus, the other being J. magna. [...] J. monesi is {{sometimes}} called the giant <b>pacarana,</b> after its closest living relative, the <b>pacarana</b> (Dinomys branickii) in the family Dinomyidae. The species may have weighed a ton, considerably larger than any living rodent.|$|E
50|$|Facultative monogamy, or Type I monogamy, {{occurs when}} the male is not fully {{committed}} to one female, but he chooses {{to stay with her}} because there are no other mating opportunities available to him. In this type of monogamy, species rarely spend time with their families, and {{there is a lack of}} paternal care towards the offspring. Elephant shrews (Rhynchocyon chrysopygus and Elephantulus rufescens), Agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata), Grey duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia), and <b>Pacaranas</b> (Dinomys branickii) are some of the most common examples of the mammalian species that display Type I monogamy. In addition, these species are characterized to occupy low areas over a large expand of land.|$|R
25|$|Pygmy {{marmosets}} (Cebuella pygmaea), Goeldi marmosets (Callimico goeldii), <b>pacaranas</b> (Dinomys branickii), {{and eastern}} lowland olingos (Bassaricyon alleni) are found here, {{but not in}} regions to the east. Other primates present include tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus imperator), brown pale-fronted capuchins (Cebus albifrons), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), white-faced sakis (Pithecia irrorata), and black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The rare red uakari monkeys (Cacajao calvus) {{are found in the}} north in swamp forests. Nocturnal two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) are well distributed throughout this region along with the widespread three-toes sloths (Bradypus variegatus). The Amazon River is a barrier to a number of animals such as the tamarins Saguinus nigricollis, which occur on the north side, and Saguinus mystax, which occurs on the southwest side of the Amazon-Ucayali system.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{reported}} in the forest include: the spectacled bear, the puma, the white-tailed deer, the Andean fox, the montane guinea pig, the mountain tapir, the tapeti, the <b>pacarana,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|The Dinomyidae are {{a family}} of South American hystricognath rodents: the dinomyids were once a very speciose group, but now {{contains}} only a single living species, the <b>pacarana.</b> Several of the extinct dinomyids were among the largest rodents known to date, the bison-sized Josephoartigasia monesi and the smaller Josephoartigasia magna. The dinomyids {{are thought to have}} occupied ecological niches associated with large grazing mammals due to their ability to compete with the native ungulates of South America. These large forms disappeared after the formation of a connection to North America. The modern <b>pacarana</b> is only modest in size, considerably smaller than the capybara.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pacarana</b> is nocturnal and {{is found}} only in {{tropical}} forests of the western Amazon River basin and adjacent foothills of the Andes Mountains. It ranges from northwestern Venezuela and Colombia to western Bolivia, including the Yungas. It is common in Cotapata National Park in Bolivia.|$|E

50|$|With {{a length}} of more than 2 m in T. gigantissimus, it {{contains}} {{two or three of}} the largest rodents that ever lived, along with Phoberomys, Josephoartigasia, and the giant beaver. It is part of the same South American radiation of rodents as both Phoberomys and the modern capybara, which is the largest living rodent, reaching lengths of up to 1.35 m. The closest living relative to Telicomys is the <b>pacarana.</b>|$|E

By the Miocene, when Africa had collided with Asia, African rodents such as the porcupine began to spread into Eurasia. Some fossil species were very large in comparison to modern rodents and included the giant beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, which grew to a length of 2.5 m and weight of 100 kg. The largest known rodent was Josephoartigasia monesi, a <b>pacarana</b> with an estimated body length of 3 m (10 ft).|$|E

50|$|The zoo {{is home to}} part of an {{international}} breeding programme for some endangered species such as Owston's palm civet and red-fronted macaw for which an overseas in-situ conservation support programme of funding and skills exchange exists, along with support for the unau sloth project and <b>pacarana</b> in South America, pangolin and small carnivore conservation programme in South East Asia. The World Land Trust BIAZA zoo reserve in South America is also supported through the wild spaces scheme. Support is also given annually to students at the Libanona Ecology Centre in Southern Madagascar. The EAZA Campaign is supported annually. Recent overseas project information can be found for each project on the zoo website. Increasingly animal species held at the zoo are listed as threatened or endangered species on the Red Data lists produced by the IUCN.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{our history}} with designing coherent real-time processing algorithms within Kyma that enable the spontaneous processing of acoustic instruments using the Capybara- 320 and <b>Pacarana</b> synthesis engines in interactive real-time performance. Compositional and performance {{issues for the}} current work, System of Shadows, are examined, discussed, and performed during the demonstration, focusing on the composer’s Kyma processing algorithms and the musical score used by both performers. We posit relevant data surrounding the interactive performance issues involved in a complex real-time processing work of this nature, and discuss our collaborative creative process. Real-time performance choices by the trumpeter, directed improvisation and interaction between the two performers (and the formal compositional structures these decision help shape), realtime programmatic choices, and Kyma’s virtual control parameters {{are discussed in the}} context of the larger dynamic performance environment...|$|E
