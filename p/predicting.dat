5|$|On June2, 2009, Klotzbach's team issued another updated {{forecast}} for the 2009 season, <b>predicting</b> slightly below average activity (11 named storms, 5hurricanes, 2 of Category3 or higher and ACE Index of 85). Also on June2, 2009, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU COAPS) issued its first ever Atlantic hurricane season forecast. The FSU COAPS forecast predicted 8 named storms, including 4 hurricanes, and an ACE Index of 65. On June18, 2009, the UK Met Office (UKMO) issued a forecast of 6tropical storms in the July to November period with a 70% {{chance that the}} number {{would be in the}} range3 to 9. They also predicted an ACE Index of 60 with a 70%chance that the index would be in the range40 to 80. On August4, 2009, Klotzbach's team updated their forecast for the 2009 season, again <b>predicting</b> slightly below average activity (10 named storms, 4hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes). On August6, 2009, the NOAA also updated their forecast for the 2009 season, <b>predicting</b> below average activity (7–11 named storms, 3–6 hurricanes, and 1–2 major hurricanes).|$|E
5|$|On May21, 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, <b>predicting</b> a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific. A day later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, <b>predicting</b> a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes. Below-average activity was expected {{as a result of}} either ENSO-Neutral or La Niña conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in <b>predicting</b> bleeding risk and do not perform well in <b>predicting</b> hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Presently, {{there is}} much {{interest}} in how students study and what skills best facilitate their academic performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how students’ conceptions of knowledge, approaches to learning, and personality relate to academic success. An online survey was completed by 198 first-year tertiary students, including 116 off-campus psychology students. This paper will report the relationships among the key variables. As expected, Quick Learning and Simple Knowledge variables positively <b>predicted</b> a Surface learning approach. In contrast, Innate Ability, Simple Knowledge, and Certain Knowledge variables negatively <b>predicted</b> a Deep learning approach. Innate Ability negatively <b>predicted</b> a Strategic learning approach. However, students’ conceptions of knowledge did not <b>predict</b> academic success. As expected, students who adopted a Surface learning approach experienced lower academic success. Contrary to expectations, however, Deep and Strategic learning approaches did not positively <b>predict</b> academic success. An interesting finding was that Intellect positively <b>predicted</b> a Deep learning approach. Further, Conscientiousness, Intellect, and Emotional Stability positively <b>predicted</b> a Strategic learning approach and negatively <b>predicted</b> a Surface learning approach. Personality also <b>predicted</b> academic success. Neuroticism negatively <b>predicted</b> academic success; Conscientiousness positively <b>predicted</b> academic success. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in <b>predicting</b> survival. The most {{important}} staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby to {{pass through}} the Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, with one computer model <b>predicting</b> a Category4 hurricane in the area.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to present a conceptual model for selection into the early childhood profession and to test the model using contemporaneous assessments. A stratified random sample of center-based child care providers in 4 Midwestern states (n = 964) participated in a telephone interview, and 223 were also assessed with the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale—Revised or the Infant–Toddler Environment Rating Scale to rate global observed quality, and the Caregiver Interaction Scale to rate interactional quality. When the model was tested with infant–toddler and preschool teachers combined, having a Child Development Associate (CDA) <b>predicted</b> global observed quality, education years and child development coursework <b>predicted</b> compensation, and compensation <b>predicted</b> observed quality. When the model was tested separately for infant–toddler teachers, years of education and child development coursework <b>predicted</b> compensation, but none of the education variables <b>predicted</b> observed quality and compensation did not <b>predict</b> observed quality. For preschool teachers, years of education <b>predicted</b> compensation and having a CDA <b>predicted</b> observed quality, but compensation did not <b>predict</b> observed quality.
