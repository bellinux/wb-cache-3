5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise pursue a Ferengi starship to the planet Gamma Tauri IV, where both ships are disabled by an unknown <b>power</b> <b>drain.</b> Away teams from each vessel beam down to the planet where they find an automated system left behind by the Tkon Empire.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E
500|$|The Enterprise is {{in pursuit}} of a Ferengi vessel which has stolen an energy {{converter}} from an unmanned Federation outpost. [...] While the Ferengi were known to the Federation, this is the first contact with the species, and the Ferengi are thought to be at a similar technology level as themselves. [...] As the chase passes the planet Delphi Ardu IV, both ships suffer power drains causing them to come to a halt. [...] Each crew initially believe the <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> is caused by the other vessel, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) realizes that the Ferengi are as confused as they are, and orders the crew to investigate the planet. Operations Officer Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) reports that the planet seems to have once been a remote outpost of the [...] "Tkon Empire" [...] that became extinct 600,000 years ago. Picard contacts the Ferengi and gets them to agree to mutually explore the planet below to try to find the source of the energy drain.|$|E
500|$|Remembering Q {{from the}} Enterprise, O'Brien spots Q {{on the station}} and warns Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), speculating that Q may be {{responsible}} for the <b>power</b> <b>drains.</b> When confronted, Q denies any wrongdoing, although he offers no alternative explanation. As the <b>power</b> <b>drains</b> become more severe, an unknown gravimetric field begins pulling the station toward the nearby wormhole. Q challenges Sisko to a boxing match on the Promenade, and suddenly, they are both wearing antique-style boxing costumes. A few punches are thrown, and Q is shocked when Sisko knocks him down. [...] "You hit me! Picard never hit me!" [...] Q exclaims.|$|R
50|$|At the lab, {{the player}} meets several {{captured}} mutants such as Quicksilver, Surge and Colossus. With their help, the player eventually defeats Sublime and the U-Men, {{a group of}} anti-mutant soldiers that somehow uses <b>power</b> <b>drained</b> from mutants, and saves the captured victims.|$|R
50|$|During the game, Jackie {{can obtain}} the twelve magical talismans which give him special powers. The talisman <b>powers</b> <b>drain</b> Jackie's Chi Energy, but Jackie can heal his energy by {{collecting}} green orbs in every level. Below is {{the order in}} which Jackie collects the talismans.|$|R
2500|$|Older {{versions}} of the system software suffered from <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> issues when the car wasn't being used, with the batteries losing 4.5kWh overnight (known commonly as [...] "vampire drain"). System software v5.8 (v1.49.30), released December 12, 2013, reduced overnight energy loss substantially, to 1.1kWh per night, or around 3 miles. In January 2014, Bjørn Nyland, a Model S owner in Norway, recorded a range loss of approximately 20% during a 27-day extended vacation, an indicated range loss of , or [...] per day, while stored in frigid temperatures without any charging cable attached.|$|E
2500|$|OLED {{technology}} {{is used in}} commercial applications such as displays for mobile phones and portable digital media players, car radios and digital cameras among others, as well as lighting. Such portable display applications favor the high light output of OLEDs for readability in sunlight and their low <b>power</b> <b>drain.</b> Portable displays are also used intermittently, so the lower lifespan of organic displays is less of an issue. Prototypes have been made of flexible and rollable displays which use OLEDs' unique characteristics. Applications in flexible signs and lighting are also being developed. OLED lighting offers several advantages over LED lighting, such as higher quality illumination, more diffuse light source, and panel shapes. [...] Philips Lighting have made OLED lighting samples under the brand name [...] "Lumiblade" [...] available online and Novaled AG based in Dresden, Germany, introduced a line of OLED desk lamps called [...] "Victory" [...] in September, 2011.|$|E
50|$|After {{witnessing}} the atmospheric dissipation extinction event transpire, {{the crew is}} puzzled by an unexpected <b>power</b> <b>drain,</b> the origin of which Worf tracks to the Holodeck. His brother has transported {{the population of the}} Boraalan village aboard the ship, using the Holodeck to replicate caverns identical to those on the planet, misleading the villagers into thinking they are still on Boraal II.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} with Knox, Adam {{discovers that}} Arthur is still alive, yet paralyzed. Realizing what Arthur wants, a panicked Adam tries to escape but {{is forced to}} touch Arthur's hand. Arthur then steals Adam's power of regeneration and heals himself. After having his <b>power</b> <b>drained</b> by Arthur, Adam seems to rapidly age, then crumbles to dust.|$|R
50|$|Acting on {{information}} gained by the X-Men, the player {{goes to a}} secret underground base used by Hodge and the Purifiers. He/she eventually finds Hodge who is now wearing a more powerful <b>Power</b> Armor containing <b>drained</b> mutant <b>powers.</b> Hodge claims that the <b>power</b> <b>drained</b> from Pixie and Caliban {{will enable them to}} find and capture any mutant that the Purifiers want. He also says that he is being helped by some other group or person. After the fight, Hodge falls from the generator tower and is presumed dead.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} and most common {{version of the}} powerCON is rated at 20 A. It comes in two deliberately incompatible variants to prevent people connecting two mains supplies together. The type A is blue and used for power sources (power flows out of a blue-ended cable, into a chassis socket). The type B is white and used for <b>power</b> <b>drains</b> (<b>power</b> flows from a chassis socket into a white-ended cable). Couplers are available with one chassis socket of each type mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube to extend cables.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{construction}} of the Game Boy Advance case, the Afterburner light is slightly too narrow to illuminate the screen evenly. This creates what is called the [...] "trapezoid effect": a trapezoid-shaped pattern of light across the screen. The Game Boy Advance SP does not suffer from the [...] "trapezoid effect", though its integrated battery makes the <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> more significant.|$|E
50|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise pursue a Ferengi starship to the planet Gamma Tauri IV, where both ships are disabled by an unknown <b>power</b> <b>drain.</b> Away teams from each vessel beam down to the planet where they find an automated system left behind by the Tkon Empire.|$|E
5000|$|Original ATX PSUs {{have power}} {{distribution}} designed for pre-P4/XP PCs. They lack the supplemental 4-pin 12-volt CPU power connector, so they most likely {{cannot be used}} with P4/XP or newer motherboards. Adapters do exist but <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> on the 12 V rail must be checked very carefully. There is a chance it can work without connecting the 4-pin 12 V connector, but caution is advised.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Thunderbolts, Radioactive Man fought Spider-Man and Anti-Venom {{during the}} New Ways to Die storyline; during the fight, Radioactive Man had {{a portion of his}} {{radiation}} <b>powers</b> <b>drained</b> by Anti-Venom. He continued with the team however, going after the super-hero Moon Knight, with the group. Radioactive Man was one of Songbird's strongest allies within the team, often supporting her when she fought against Osborn.|$|R
50|$|There are two to {{four teams}} (green, red, blue, and yellow). Each player pilots a ship {{of his or her}} team's color. The ships move around a plane. There are {{obstacles}} which the ships cannot pass through (walls, areas with no floor, etc.) Ships are armed with a laser and a special weapon. When the laser is fired, its <b>power</b> <b>drains.</b> Laser <b>power</b> returns at a constant rate.|$|R
50|$|The Afterman: Descension {{begins with}} Sirius still {{encompassed}} in the protective aura of Evagria; however, {{she has become}} weakened due {{to the cost of}} energy necessary to keep The Afterman alive. As her <b>power</b> <b>drains,</b> Amory is convinced that these will be the last moments of his life. It is at this crucial time that Sirius is saved by the entity of Sentry the Defiant, the soldier who gave his life to evince the brutality of Vic the Butcher.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{terrestrial}} {{placement of the}} transmitters and sub-GHz nature of the signal, MBS signals can travel several kilometers and—because the network is specifically designed, deployed, and managed for indoor positioning—can be reliably received in deep indoor conditions that block satellite signals (e.g., GPS, GLONASS). MBS signals also enable location to be computed with far lower <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> than GPS. In addition, the system incorporates barometric pressure compensation technology that allows receivers equipped with pressure sensors to compute their altitude very precisely, typically within a floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{product line}} {{continued}} to be refined and expanded. The chugger / smoker was redesigned and moved from the tenders into the engines. The advantages included eliminating the separate motor (<b>power</b> <b>drain</b> and cost) and ensuring precise (geared) synchronicity of the chugging with {{the rotation of the}} drive wheels. DC versions of the engines were offered in the 1949 line. Two different engines (the other AC) could be controlled with nominal independence on the same track. Diesels, not offered since 1940 were offered in the 1950 line.|$|E
50|$|Enterprise {{also had}} a phased array radar system known as SCANFAR. SCANFAR was {{intended}} to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. SCANFAR consisted of two radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the US Navy. The AN/SPS-32 operated together with the AN/SPS-33, which was the square array used for 3D tracking, into one system. It was installed on only two vessels, Enterprise and the cruiser , placing a massive <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> on the ship's electric system.|$|E
50|$|Immortus's actions leave Wanda's hex <b>power</b> <b>drained</b> {{and highly}} unreliable, which was fixed by Agatha Harkness and Doctor Strange. Wanda is then {{nominated}} {{as leader of}} the Avengers West Coast team. When the team is dissolved, Wanda leads a new one called Force Works. The team suffers several setbacks, including the death of Wonder Man on the first mission. When the team splinters after the last mission involving Kang the Conqueror, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye return to the main team.|$|R
2500|$|Whilst vacating the Prime Minister’s {{office at}} Parliament House, Labor {{journalist}} Bob Ellis observed that: “With the <b>power</b> <b>drained</b> from him, (Keating) appeared two inches shorter, a sallow, strangely grinning, dull-eyed, not wholly trustworthy man, who had seemed but days before an immortal". Bob Hawke, who he had rolled as leader, later remarked that Keating [...] "doesn't {{have the capacity}} to put things behind him" [...] and that he “genuinely feel(s) sorry for Paul, (sic) he should be a happy, happy man and he's not." ...|$|R
5|$|Arriving in 1986, {{the crew}} finds their ship's <b>power</b> <b>drained.</b> Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its {{cloaking}} device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank {{to hold the}} whales they need {{for a return to}} the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power to be restored.|$|R
50|$|RoboCop {{returns to}} the rebel base to find it abandoned. One of the Otomo ninjabots then arrives and attacks him. RoboCop {{experiences}} another <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> and his side-arm is destroyed, but eventually {{he is able to}} overcome his opponent. Meanwhile, Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists Lazarus broadcast an improvised video, revealing that OCP is behind the outbreaks of criminality in the city and implicating them in the removal and termination of the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP's stock to plunge dramatically, driving the company into total ruin.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{time the}} systems evolved {{to replace the}} {{mechanical}} linkages to the valves with electrical controls, producing the [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] design, and more recently, optical networking systems in {{what is known as}} [...] "fly-by-light". All of these systems require three separate components, the hydraulic supply system, the valves and associated control network, and the actuators. Since any one of these systems could fail and render the aircraft inoperable, redundancies are needed that greatly increase the complexity of the system. Additionally, keeping the hydraulic oil pressurized is a constant <b>power</b> <b>drain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The HPM {{technology}} {{is being developed}} and commercialized by Hyperion Power Generation, Inc. Hyperion is targeting the volume market for small to medium-sized applications in remote areas for industrial installations and residential installations serving 20,000 (typical US) to 100,000 (typical non-US) households. They claim the unit will be deliverable in a sealed container and will be mostly maintenance free, as the unit {{is not to be}} opened on site. The company wants to mass-produce the units in a factory, deliver them by truck and take them back for re-processing after 5 to 10 years (depending on <b>power</b> <b>drain).</b>|$|E
50|$|Willow begins {{her final}} ritual of destruction. Xander confronts her and {{physically}} tries {{to stop her}} from completing the ritual. She repels him with magic force, but, wounded, he renews his efforts. He reminds Willow of their friendship and that he loves her no matter what. He tells {{her that if she}} destroys the world, she kills him as well and that he will stay with her until she does. Willow's emotional barriers collapse, her dark <b>powers</b> <b>drain</b> away, and her physical transformation is undone. She collapses in tears.|$|R
5000|$|... 5 September 2007: Spacecraft {{computer}} froze as {{a result}} of unknown influences, most likely radiation-induced upsets. This happened while the spacecraft was in full sun and with the <b>power</b> <b>drains</b> (30 W) on to prevent battery overcharging. Without the computer to cycle the drains off, the spacecraft remained in a continuous negative net power configuration which eventually drained the batteries. When the battery voltage dropped below 8 V, the electronic switches for the drains defaulted to off, returning the spacecraft to positive net power and allowing the batteries to recharge.|$|R
5000|$|Gameplay of Disruptor {{is similar}} to many first-person shooters, but the player has access to special powers called [...] "Psionics", similar to psychokinesis. Different <b>powers</b> include <b>drain,</b> healing, shock, and a shield.|$|R
50|$|Tunnelling {{occurs with}} {{barriers}} of thickness around 1-3 nm and smaller, {{but is the}} cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena. For instance, tunnelling is a source of current leakage in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) electronics and results in the substantial <b>power</b> <b>drain</b> and heating effects that plague high-speed and mobile technology; it is considered the lower limit on how small computer chips can be made. Tunnelling is a fundamental technique used to program the floating gates of FLASH memory, {{which is one of the}} most significant inventions that have shaped consumer electronics in the last two decades.|$|E

50|$|The Hubsan H111 Q4 FPV {{follows the}} pattern that Hubsan use with their other ranges and adds a First Person View capable model to this nano quad. The H111 FPV {{is the same}} as the {{standard}} H111 in terms of features but it has a FPV camera on the front and a 5.8ghz video transmitter to send the real time images back to the screen on the controller (transmitter). The battery is a 180mAh LiPo which while tiny is almost twice the size of the standard H111’s 100mAh battery. That results in a slightly increased flight time even considering the bigger <b>power</b> <b>drain.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) {{returns from}} the Gamma Quadrant in her runabout with a woman that Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) recognizes as Vash (Jennifer Hetrick) from his time on board the Enterprise. Although the crew is unaware of his presence, Q (John de Lancie) [...] a nearly omnipotent prankster [...] has also stowed away on the runabout. Vash {{explains}} that she {{has spent the past}} two years in the Gamma Quadrant, but she describes her method of getting there as a [...] "private matter". During their trip back to Deep Space Nine, the vessel undergoes a series of unusual <b>power</b> <b>drains.</b>|$|R
50|$|The book {{follows the}} {{standard}} d20 convention of six primary statistics, classes, levels, experience points, feats, and skills. Normal humans {{have access to}} only the aristocrat, commoner, expert, fighter, rogue, and warrior classes. The Engel have access to special classes and abilities restricted to their bands; unlike humans, they are incapable of multiclassing. There is no magic; there are only Potestas (powers), which work as skills restricted by the Engelic band the player chooses. Such <b>powers</b> <b>drain</b> the hit points of the Engel; a similar but less harmful mechanic {{is found in the}} Star Wars d20 Roleplaying Game.|$|R
50|$|The Sinestro Corps confront Kyle, {{who has his}} <b>powers</b> <b>drained</b> out of him by Sinestro himself, and is {{immediately}} taken over by Parallax. Parallax then clothes itself in a new uniform, which appears as {{a combination of the}} Sinestro Corps' uniform, Kyle's original Green Lantern costume, and the armor Hal Jordan wore as Parallax. Parallax's possession also turns the hair on top of Kyle's head gray, just as it turned the hair on Hal Jordan's temples. Parallax returns to Qward with the Sinestro Corps and is inducted into their ranks, becoming one of the Anti-Monitor's heralds.|$|R
