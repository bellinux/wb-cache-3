Over {{evolutionary}} time, if {{the function of the}} new variant remains identical to the original, then it is likely that one or the other will be lost as mutation accumulate, resulting in a pseudogene. However, if the mutations do not immediately prevent the enzyme from functioning, but instead modify either its function, or its pattern of gene expression, then the two variants may both be favoured by natural selection and become specialised to different functions.

50|$|Species {{belonging}} to the Brassicaceae are mostly annual, biennial, or perennial herbaceous plants, some are dwarf shrubs or shrubs, and very few vines. Although generally terrestrial, a few species such as water awlwort live submerged in fresh water. They may have a taproot or a sometimes woody caudex that may have few or many branches, some have thin or tuberous rhizomes, or rarely develop runners. Few species have multi-cellular glands. Hairs consist of one cell and occur in many forms: from simple to forked, star-, tree- or T-shaped, rarely taking {{the form of a}} shield or scale. They are never topped by a gland. The stems may be upright, rise up towards the tip, or lie flat, are mostly herbaceous but sometimes woody. Stems carry leafs or the stems may be leafless (in Caulanthus), and some species lack stems altogether. The leaves do not have stipules, but there may be a pair of glands at base of leafstalks and flowerstalks. The leaf may be seated or have a leafstalk. The leaf blade is usually simple, entire or dissected, rarely trifoliolate or pinnately compound. A leaf rosette at the base may be present or absent. The leaves along the stem are almost always alternately arranged, rarely apparently opposite. The genome size of Brassicaceae compared to that of other Angiosperm families is very small to small (less than 3.425 million base pairs per cell), varying from 150 Mbp in Arabidopsis thaliana and Sphaerocardamum spp., to 2375 Mbp Bunias orientalis. The number of homologous chromosome sets varies from four (n=4) in some Physaria and Stenopetalum species, five (n=5) in other Physaria and Stenopetalum species, Arabidopsis thaliana and a Mathiola species, to seventeen (n=17). About 35% of the species in which chromosomes have been counted have eight sets (n=8). Due to polyploidy, some species may have up to 256 individual chromosomes, with some very high counts in the North-American species of Cardamine, such as C. diphylla. Hybridisation is not unusual in Brassicaceae, especially in Arabis, Rorippa, Cardamine and Boechera. Hybridisation between species originating in Africa and California, and subsequent <b>polyploidisation</b> is surmised for Lepidium species native to Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

In ornamental plant breeding these phenomena {{go hand in hand}} and can be observed in the breeding his-tory of many ornamental crops (Rosa, Chrysanthemum, Gladiolus, Alstroemeria, Lil-ium, orchids etc). With lily as model crop techniques developed for overcoming pre- and post-fertilisation barriers are reviewed. For overcoming F 1 -sterility mitotic and meiotic <b>polyploidisation</b> are applied and can result in fertile allopolyploids. The mechanism of viable pollen production of mitotic and meiotic <b>polyploidisation</b> is quite different. Mitotic <b>polyploidisation</b> possess one homologous chromosome set.

Many invasive species have undergone <b>polyploidisation,</b> leading to the coexistence of various cytotypes in the native range, whereas, in most cases, only one cytotype {{is present in the}} introduced range. Since genetic variation within a species can modify soil rhizosphere communities, we studied the effects of different cytotypes and ranges (native diploid, native tetraploid and introduced tetraploid) of Centaurea maculosa and Senecio inaequidens on microbial biomass carbon, rhizosphere total DNA content and bacterial communities of a standard soil in relation to plant functional traits. There was no overall significant difference in microbial biomass between cytotypes. The variation of rhizosphere total DNA content and bacterial community structure according to cytotype was species specific. The rhizosphere DNA content of S. inaequidens decreased with <b>polyploidisation</b> in the native range but did not vary for C. maculosa. In contrast, the bacterial community structure of C. maculosa was affected by <b>polyploidisation</b> and its diversity increased, whereas there was no significant change for S. inaequidens. Traits of S. inaequidens were correlated to the rhizosphere biota. Bacterial diversity and total DNA content were positively correlated with resource allocation to belowground growth and late flowering, whereas microbial biomass carbon was negatively correlated to investment in reproduction. There were no correlations between traits of the cytotypes of C. maculosa and corresponding rhizosphere soil biota.

40|$|<b>Polyploidisation</b> {{is a key}} {{source of}} {{diversification}} and speciation in plants. Most researchers consider sexual <b>polyploidisation</b> leading to unreduced gamete as its main origin. Unreduced gametes are useful in several crop breeding schemes. Their formation mechanism, i. e., First-Division Restitution (FDR) or Second-Division Restitution (SDR), greatly impacts the gametic and population structures and, therefore, the breeding efficiency. Previous methods to identify the underlying mechanism required the analysis of a large set of markers over large progeny. This work develops a new maximum-likelihood method to identify the unreduced gamete formation mechanism both at the population and individual levels using independent centromeric markers. Knowledge of marker-centromere distances greatly improves the statistical power of the comparison between the SDR and FDR hypotheses. Simulating data demonstrated the importance of selecting markers {{very close to the}} centromere to obtain significant conclusions at individual level. This new method was used to identify the meiotic restitution mechanism in nineteen mandarin genotypes used as female parents in triploid citrus breeding. SDR was identified for 85. 3 % of 543 triploid hybrids and FDR for 0. 6 %. No significant conclusions were obtained for 14. 1 % of the hybrids.

A Begonia collection was screened on the occurrence of 2 n pollen with the aid of four different techniques: pollen size measurement, flow cytometric analysis of nuclei isolated from germinated and non germinated pollen, investigation of the microsporogenesis and analysis of progeny.

40|$|Background: <b>Polyploidisation</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} mechanisms in the evolution of angiosperms. As in many other genera, formation of polyploids has significantly contributed to diversification and radiation of Knautia (Caprifoliaceae, Dipsacoideae). Comprehensive studies of fine- and broad-scale patterns of ploidy and genome size (GS) variation are, however, still limited to relatively few genera and little is known about the geographic distribution of ploidy levels within these genera. Here, we explore ploidy and GS variation in Knautia based on a near-complete taxonomic and comprehensive geographic sampling. Results: Genome size is a reliable indicator of ploidy level in Knautia, even if monoploid genome downsizing is observed in the polyploid cytotypes. Twenty-four species studied are diploid, 16 tetraploid and two hexaploid, whereas ten species possess two, and two species possess three ploidy levels. Di- and tetraploids are distributed across most of the distribution area of Knautia, while hexaploids were sampled in the Balkan and Iberian Peninsulas and the Alps. Conclusions: We show that the frequency of <b>polyploidisation</b> is unevenly distributed in Knautia both in a geographic and phylogenetic context. Monoploid GS varies considerably among three evolutionary lineages (sections) of Knautia, but also within sections Trichera and Tricheroides, as well as within some of the species.

Molecular and cytogenetic tools {{are available to}} determine the hybrid status of obtained seedlings. However, these modern breeding techniques are rarely used for woody ornamentals. In this study the possibilities of interspecific hybridisation and ploidy breeding for woody ornamentals are investigated. Also the optimal strategies to analyse the hybrid nature of seedlings are determined. Application of morphological, molecular (AFLP) and cytogenetic (GISH, flow cytometry) techniques is evaluated for the case-study genera Hydrangea, Hibiscus and Buddleja. Parental species within these 3 genera were (cyto) genetically very different. This was confirmed by AFLP, flowcytometry and karyotyping. This information gave indications about the crossability of different species within the 3 genera. When performing interspecific crosses there were no prezygotic barriers observed for the 3 genera. However, interspecific hybridisation was hampered due to postzygotic barriers, such as fruit abortion, albinism and growth aberrations in the seedlings. Therefore, in vitro embryo rescue was used for Hydrangea, Hibiscus and Buddleja. Within the 3 genera different hybrid populations were generated. Morphological studies, AFLP and genome size measurements confirmed the hybrid nature of the seedlings. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH), is rarely used in woody ornamentals for {{the identification of the}} origin of chromosomes in hybrids resulting from breeding programs.

The parental genomes could be distinguished and recombinant chromosomes were detected. <b>Polyploidisation</b> by application of mitotic inhibitors on seed(ling) s, was obtained for diploid B. globosa.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{gives an}} overview of the role of biotechnology in the development and production of two indigenous flower bulbs in South Africa, namely Lachenalia and Ornithogalum. During the 1970 s the two major constraints to successful commercialisation were identified as slow propagation rate and susceptibility to virus, and work to overcome these was started. Later, more advanced techniques, viz. molecular markers, embryo rescue and in vitro bulb production, were developed. Techniques such as virus elimination, mass propagation, in vitro long-term storage, in vitro bulb formation, embryo rescue and in vitro <b>polyploidisation</b> are being applied on a routine basis to shorten the time required to develop new cultivars, to maintain the propagation scheme and overcome incompatibility between species. More advanced technology gene transfer and marker-assisted hybrid selection, may be applied in future to develop cultivars resistant to virus and to increase efficiency of hybrid selection...|$|E
40|$|Wheat {{was one of}} {{the first}} crops to be domesticated more than 10, 000 years ago in the Middle East. Molecular {{genetics}} and archaeological data have allowed the reconstruction of plausible domestication scenarios leading to modern cultivars. For diploid einkorn and tetraploid durum wheat, a single domestication event has likely occurred in the Karacadag Mountains, Turkey. Following a cross between tetraploid durum and diploid T. tauschii, the resultant hexaploid bread wheat was domesticated and disseminated around the Caucasian region. These <b>polyploidisation</b> events facilitated wheat domestication and created genetic bottlenecks, which excluded potentially adaptive alleles. With the urgent need to accelerate genetic progress to confront the challenges of climate change and sustainable agriculture, wild ancestors and old landraces represent a reservoir of underexploited genetic diversity that may be utilized through modern breeding methods. Understanding domestication processes may thus help identifying new strategies. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhylogenetic {{utility of}} two nuclear genes (GBSSI- 2 and DHAR) was {{explored}} in genus Fragaria {{in order to}} clarify phylogenetic relationships among taxa and to elucidate {{the origin of the}} polyploid species. Orthology of the amplified products was assessed by several methods. Our results strongly suggest the loss of one GBSSI duplicated copy (GBSSI- 1) in the Fragariinae subtribe. Phylogenetic analyses provided new insights into the evolutionary history of Fragaria, such as evidence supporting the presence of three main diploid genomic pools in the genus and demonstrating the occurrence of independent events of <b>polyploidisation.</b> In addition, the data provide evidence supporting an allopolyploid origin of the hexaploid F. moschata, and the octoploids F. chiloensis, F. iturupensis and F. virginiana. Accordingly, a new pattern summarizing our present knowledge on the Fragaria evolutionary history is proposed. Additionally, sequence analyses also revealed relaxed constraints on homoeologous copies at high ploidy level, as demonstrated by deletion events within DHAR coding sequences of some allo-octoploid haplotypes...|$|E
40|$|Effects of <b>polyploidisation</b> on {{gene flow}} between natural populations are little known. Central European diploid and {{tetraploid}} populations of Arabidopsis arenosa and A. lyrata are here {{used to study}} interspecific and interploidal gene flow, {{using a combination of}} nuclear and plastid markers. Ploidal levels were confirmed by flow cytometry. Network analyses clearly separated diploids according to species. Tetraploids and diploids were highly intermingled within species, and some tetraploids intermingled with the other species, as well. Isolation with migration analyses suggested interspecific introgression from tetraploid A. arenosa to tetraploid A. lyrata and vice versa, and some interploidal gene flow, which was unidirectional from diploid to tetraploid in A. arenosa and bidirectional in A. lyrata. Interspecific genetic isolation at diploid level combined with introgression at tetraploid level indicates that polyploidy may buffer against negative consequences of interspecific hybridisation. The role of introgression in polyploid systems may, however, differ between plant species, and even within the small genus Arabidopsis, we find very different evolutionary fates when it comes to introgression...|$|E
40|$|The {{tetraploid}} Brassica napus possesses several seed-expressed microsomal lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAAT) including BAT 1. 5, {{which has}} been retained after genome duplication {{as a consequence of}} a subfunctionalization of the gene encoding the ubiquitously expressed Kennedy pathway enzyme BAT 1. 13. Next, cDNA BAT 1. 3, encoding a LPAAT was subsequently isolated from an embryo library. The rapeseed LPAAT encoded by BAT 1. 3 is orthologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana At 1 g 51260 gene product possibly associated with tapetum development and male fertility. However, BAT 1. 3 expression is predominant during the mid stages of embryo development in seeds of Brassica napus. Functional characterisation of BAT 1. 3 provides further support for a hypothesis of gene dosage sensitivity of LPAATs as does an analysis of the chromosomal localisation of LPAAT genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The pattern of retention or loss of LPAAT genes after <b>polyploidisation</b> or segmental duplication is consistent with a model of balanced gene drive...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mapping {{centromere}} {{locations in}} plant species provides essential {{information for the}} analysis of genetic structures and population dynamics. The centromere's position affects the distribution of crossovers along a chromosome and the parental heterozygosity restitution by 2 n gametes is a direct function of the genetic distance to the centromere. Sexual <b>polyploidisation</b> is relatively frequent in Citrus species and is widely used to develop new seedless triploid cultivars. The study's objectives were to (i) map the positions of the centromeres of the nine Citrus clementina chromosomes; (ii) analyse the crossover interference in unreduced gametes; and (iii) establish the pattern of genetic recombination in haploid clementine gametes along each chromosome and its relationship with the centromere location and distribution of genic sequences. Results: Triploid progenies were derived from unreduced megagametophytes produced by second-division restitution. Centromere positions were mapped genetically for all linkage groups using half-tetrad analysis. Inference of the physical locations of centromeres revealed one acrocentric, four metacentric and four submetacentric chromosomes. Crossover interference was observed in unreduced gametes, with variation seen between chromosome arms. For haploid gametes, a strong decrease in the recombination rate occurred in centromeric and pericentromeric regions, which contained a low density of genic sequences. In chromosomes VIII and IX, these low recombination rates extended beyond the pericentromeric regions. The genomic region corresponding to a genetic distance < 5 cM from a centromere represented 47 % of the genome and 23 % of the genic sequences. Conclusions: The centromere positions of the nine citrus chromosomes were genetically mapped. Their physical locations, inferred from the genetic ones, were consistent with the sequence constitution and recombination pattern along each chromosome. However, regions with low recombination rates extended beyond the pericentromeric regions of some chromosomes into areas richer in genic sequences. The persistence of strong linkage disequilibrium between large numbers of genes promotes the stability of epistatic interactions and multilocus-controlled traits over successive generations but also maintains multi-trait associations. Identification of the centromere positions will allow the development of simple methods to analyse unreduced gamete formation mechanisms in a large range of genotypes and further modelling of genetic inheritance in sexual <b>polyploidisation</b> breeding schemes.

40|$|Background: Polyploidy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} evolutionary pathways in flowering plants and has significantly contributed to their diversification and radiation. Due to the prevalence of reticulate evolution spanning three ploidy levels, Knautia is considered one of the taxonomically most intricate groups in the European flora. On the basis of ITS and plastid DNA sequences as well as AFLP fingerprints obtained from 381 populations of almost all species of the genus we asked the following questions. (1) Where and when did the initial diversification in Knautia take place, and how did it proceed further? (2) Did Knautia undergo a similarly recent (Pliocene/Pleistocene) rapid radiation as other genera with similar ecology and overlapping distribution? (3) Did polyploids evolve within the previously recognised diploid groups or rather from hybridisation between groups? Results: The diversification of Knautia was centred in the Eastern Mediterranean. According to our genetic data, the genus originated in the Early Miocene and started to diversify in the Middle Miocene, whereas the onset of radiation of sect. Trichera was in central parts of the Balkan Peninsula, roughly 4 Ma. Extensive spread out of the Balkans started in the Pleistocene about 1. 5 Ma. Diversification of sect. Trichera was strongly fostered by <b>polyploidisation,</b> which occurred independently many times. Tetraploids are observed in almost all evolutionary lineages whereas hexaploids are rarer and restricted to a few phylogenetic groups. Whether polyploids originated via autopolyploidy or allopolyploidy is unclear due to the weak genetic separation among species. In spite of the complexity of sect. Trichera, we present nine AFLP-characterised informal species groups, which coincide only partly with former traditional groups. Conclusions: Knautia sect. Trichera is a prime example for rapid diversification, mostly taking place during Pliocene and Pleistocene. Numerous cycles of habitat fragmentation and subsequent reconnections likely promoted hybridisation and <b>polyploidisation.</b> Extensive haplotype sharing and unresolved phylogenetic relationships suggest that these processes occurred rapidly and extensively. Thus, the dynamic polyploid evolution, the lack of crossing barriers within ploidy levels supported by conserved floral morphology, the highly variable leaf morphology and unstable indumentum composition prevent establishing a well-founded taxonomic framework...|$|E

40|$|Mixoploidy {{is common}} in proembryos and embryos {{as well as in}} meristems of radicles, primary, {{secondary}} and adventitious roots and in innovation shoots of stapeliad species (Asclepiadaceae). The proportion of polyploid cells in the meristem of single adventitious roots is significantly higher than in meristems of primary and secondary roots. This may lead to a complete <b>polyploidisation</b> of adventitious roots. Innovation shoots display a low percentage of polyploid cells, comparable to the condition found in primary and secondary roots. Nevertheless cells of different euploid levels are frequently found. During field studies, however, individuals of a given population were always found to have the same chromosome number: infraspecific polyploidy was found in only three out of 305 investigated stapeliad species. Genera with an orthotropic growth form were found to be diploid throughout, whereas the genera of which the members spread vegetatively by means of innovation shoots, comprise di-, tetra- and polyploid species. This phenomenon can be ascribed to ecological rather than morphological factors. The often proposed hypothesis that new cytotypes can have a vegetative origin is not found to be acceptable. </p...|$|E
40|$|Range shifts (especially {{during the}} Pleistocene), <b>polyploidisation</b> and {{hybridization}} are major factors affecting high-mountain biodiversity. A good system to study {{their role in}} the European high mountains is the Doronicum clusii aggregate (Asteraceae), whose four taxa (D. clusii s. s., D. stiriacum, D. glaciale subsp. glaciale and D. glaciale subsp. calcareum) are differentiated geographically, ecologically (basiphilous versus silicicolous) and/or via their ploidy levels (diploid versus tetraploid). Here, we use DNA sequences (three plastid and one nuclear spacer) and AFLP fingerprinting data generated for 58 populations to infer phy-logenetic relationships, origin of polyploids—whose ploidy level was confirmed by chro-mosomally calibrated DNA ploidy level estimates—and phylogeographic history. Taxonomic conclusions were informed, among others, by a Gaussian clustering method for species delimitation using dominant multilocus data. Based on molecular data we identified three lineages: (i) silicicolous diploid D. clusii s. s. in the Alps, (ii) silicicolous tetraploid D. stir-iacum in the eastern Alps (outside the range of D. clusii s. s.) and the Carpathians and (iii) the basiphilous diploids D. glaciale subsp. glaciale (eastern Alps) and D. glaciale subsp. cal...|$|E
