The main purpose of this study was to explore the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>libraries</b> on physical libraries. The goal of the study was to conceptualize a framework for understanding the impact of <b>Electronic</b> <b>library</b> on Physical library which was accomplished by finding out whether the number of physical library users had increased or decreased in terms of the usage of the physical library in the past five years, what challenges are being faced by physical libraries due to the availability of <b>electronic</b> <b>libraries</b> and finally by evaluating the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>libraries</b> on physical libraries...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} {{generalization}} {{of the most}} relevant approaches {{to the problems of}} designing, developing and implementing digital libraries into contemporary learning information environment is made. The approaches to defining “electronic library” are reviewed. The purpose of creating an <b>electronic</b> <b>library,</b> the specific features (possibilities of entering or deleting information objects, visualized conception of information environment, possibility of cataloging objects), the functional features, the main functions of the <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> (informative, advisory, research) are defined. The concept of the digital library in according to aforementioned features is presented. The network of digital libraries should meet the following requirements: versatility; integrity; quantity of scientific and educational information; centralization; principle of open systems; democracy; compliance with the current level of development of information and communication technologies; accessibility; search engines update development; cooperating development; functional standardization; legal and regulatory support; relevant network design. It is noted that an <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> occurs in 3 basic forms: as a set of electronic resources, as an information technology of the traditional library, as a substitution of the traditional libraries. The forms of <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> are defined in accordance to the structure of their organization (independent, a shared resource, integrated), to the types of agencies of digital library maintenance, to their content (universal, thematic, sectoral or personal). The number of ways to forming <b>electronic</b> <b>library</b> is singled out. It is noted that the digital library is a library in the conventional sense, when it works with users. It is indicated that creation of <b>electronic</b> <b>libraries</b> is one of the directions of organizing electronic information resources. ...|$|R
