40|$|Countdown signal {{control is}} a {{relatively}} new control mode that can inform a driver in advance about the remaining time to pass through intersections or the time needed to wait for other drivers and pedestrians. At present, few countries apply vehicular countdown signals. However, in China, some cities have applied vehicular countdown signals for years, though it is unclear how and how much such signals influence driving <b>psychologies</b> <b>and</b> behaviors compared with non-countdown signal controls. The present work aims to clarify the impact of vehicular countdown signals on driving <b>psychologies</b> <b>and</b> behaviors on the cognitive level. A questionnaire survey with 32 questions about driving <b>psychologies</b> <b>and</b> behaviors was designed, and an online survey was conducted. A total of 1051 valid questionnaires were received. The survey data were analyzed, and the main results indicate that most of the surveyed drivers prefer countdown signal controls and think that such controls can improve not only traffic safety but also traffic operational efficiency. The surveyed drivers also think that countdown signal controls have an impact on driving <b>psychologies</b> <b>and</b> behaviors and the survey results have demonstrated that the driving behaviors of female drivers surveyed are not conservative under the clear conditions of green countdown signal control. Further studies and methods concerning the effects of countdown signals on driving <b>psychologies</b> <b>and</b> behaviors are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Stratton wrote Experimental <b>Psychology</b> <b>and</b> its Bearing upon Culture {{to explain}} both typical {{psychological}} experiment methodology {{and how the}} results obtained answered philosophical problems. The book covered experimental results in <b>psychology</b> <b>and</b> how they influenced overall social behavior and the everyday cultural life of people. It did so {{by looking at the}} history of experimental <b>psychology,</b> <b>and</b> then surveying experimental methods covering both their applications and limits. Stratton pointed out how psychological experiments differed from the ones in physiology. The survey of experiments also included studies on mental perception, including among the blind. Stratton noted that the blind did have a sense of space. He also described how measurements of mental phenomena were both possible and being done in practice, though he did believe the results had to be interpreted on a psychic scale different from the usual physical ones used for measures such as lengths and weights. He rejected the argument the mind was unitary and could not be studied by splitting it into parts, by drawing on the analogy of studying a tree by looking at its constituent parts, themselves not functionally trees. He presumed sensations were akin to trees in how they could be split up into parts.|$|E
