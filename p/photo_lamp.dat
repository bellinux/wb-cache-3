5000|$|Once artist Gene Ha obtains a script, {{he makes}} [...] "tiny" [...] {{thumbnail}} sketches of each page, and then makes layout sketches on shrunked copies of comic art board, two per page. It {{is at this}} stage that he works out the light/dark balance of the page. Though he says about 90% of his artwork are done without photo reference, he will sometimes photograph his friends pose as the central characters, or use a full length mirror to draw himself. He renders minor characters from his imagination. Irrespective of how much sunlight he has on a given day, he prefers to use a 500W incandescent <b>photo</b> <b>lamp,</b> though he believes a 500W halogen lamp is also adequate. He prefers to use a lead holder with H lead for sketching, and 2B lead for shading, which he sharpens with a rotary lead pointer, believing that such leads can be sharpened better than a traditional pencil. He blows up a scan of each page layout to 8.5" [...] x 11", and draws [...] "tight" [...] pencils on top of these, which are then scanned and printed on 11" [...] x 17" [...] inkjet paper in faint blue line. He prefers Xerox paper because he feels that the surface of marker paper tends to get smudgy or oily. When importing art to modify in his computer, he uses Photoshop.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The present work {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} of nanocomposite of polypyrrole with [Fe(CN) 3 (dien) ]. H 2 O photoadduct via in-situ oxidative chemical polymerisation. Photoadduct was synthesised by irradiating an equimolar mixture of K 3 [Fe(CN) 6] and diethylenetriamine (dien) using Osram <b>photo</b> <b>lamp.</b> The successful synthesis of photoadduct was proved by Elemental analysis, UV-Vis and FTIR spectra. Nanocomposite of photoadduct with PPY was then prepared by oxidative chemical polymerization using FeCl 3 as oxidant. The successful synthesis of the nanocomposite was confirmed from FTIR, XRD and SEM. The nanocomposite showed significant increase in thermal stability, dielectric constant and ac-conductivity as compared to pure polypyrrole. The photocatalytic activity of the materials was also studied against the methyl orange (MO) dye under UV-Vis light and nanocomposite showed efficient photocatalytic activity (91 % degradation after 2 hrs) than pure PPY which showed only 24 % degradation of dye after 2 hrs. Thus as synthesised nanocomposite can be effectively utilised {{for the removal of}} organic dyes...|$|E

5000|$|In 1965, the Model 100/16 Slit Lamp was {{produced}} {{based on the}} slit lamp by Littmann. This was soon followed by the Model 125/16 Slit Lamp in 1972. The only {{difference between the two}} models was their operating distances of 100 mm to 125 mm. With the introduction of the <b>photo</b> slit <b>lamp</b> further advancements were possible. In 1976, the development of the Model 110 Slit Lamp and the 210/211 <b>Photo</b> Slit <b>Lamps</b> were an innovation by which each were constructed from standard modules allowing {{for a wide range of}} different configurations. At the same time, halogen lamps replaced the old illumination systems to make them brighter and essentially daylight quality. From 1994 onwards, new slit lamps were introduced which took advantage of new technologies. The last major development was in 1996 in which included the advantages of new slit lamp optics.

30|$|Despite the {{satisfying}} results, {{there is}} a need for further studies to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the QDs-based lateral flow test strip in patients with suspected infection and with positive serologic test results, and patients with other pathologic conditions. Besides, a multi-centric study in which the same samples are evaluated would be highly valuable. Moreover, it was very difficult to take clear fluorescent <b>photos</b> under ultraviolet <b>lamp</b> by the nonprofessional digital camera we used and therefore our group is working at a kind of mini-reader with ultraviolet source and a miniaturized professional charge-coupled device (CCD). We hope to take clear fluorescent photographs of QDs-based lateral flow test strips for qualitative and quantitative analysis by this reader. With this equipment, we will be able to obtain a more accurate and objective result.|$|R
40|$|A 19 -year-old female {{who was a}} known case of {{multiple}} endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2, presented with gradual decrease of visual acuity in her left eye and bilateral corneal opacities which had developed over a 7 month period. She had nocturnal lagophthalmos since childhood, and history of a thyroid mass with increased serum levels of calcitonin for which subtotal thyroidectomy had been performed. The histopathologic diagnosis of the thyroid mass had been medullary thyroid carcinoma. Best corrected visual acuity was 20 / 25 and 20 / 40 in her right and left eyes, respectively. Slit lamp biomicroscopic examination, photography using a <b>photo</b> slit <b>lamp</b> (Haag-Streit BQ 900, Switzerland), and corneal confocal scan imaging (Confoscan 3. 4, Nidek Technology, Padova, Italy) were performed. Since we suspected limbal stem cell deficiency, impression cytology was also performed on both eyes. Slit lamp examination in both eyes revealed moderate thickening of the eyelid margins, meibomian gland dysfunction, gelatinous and worm-like subconjunctival masses in the perilimbal area suggestive of neuromas (Fig. 1 A), nonspecific vascularized opacification of the inferior cornea which was more severe {{on the left side}} (Fig. 1 B), and prominent intrastromal medullated nerves with an irregular lacy pattern across {{more than half of the}} cornea (Fig. 1 C). Intraocular pressure and fundus examination were unremarkable. Although the patient had signs of meibomian gland dysfunction, she did not have dry eye symptoms. Since we were suspicious of limbal stem cell deficiency as one of the possible factors in the development of corneal opacities, impression cytology was performed bilaterally which disclosed mild epithelial squamous metaplasia of the involved areas, but no signs of limbal stem cell deficienc...|$|R

Patients and methods: This was a prospective, observational cross-sectional study of patients presenting with peculiar pearl-like lesions in the anterior chamber of their eyes. 1 mL of betamethasone sodium phosphate (2 mg/mL) and betamethasone dipropionate (5 mg/mL) was injected subconjunctivally. Follow-ups of all patients were conducted {{for a period of}} 6 weeks. Anterior segment imaging was done using SD-OCT and also <b>photo</b> slit <b>lamp</b> before and after management. Results: Twelve eyes of 12 patients were included in this study. These patients presented with pearl-like lesions in the anterior chamber with signs of anterior uveitis. There was no history of ocular injury or tuberculosis in any patients. Six weeks after subconjunctival steroid injection, all patients achieved mean best-corrected visual acuity, which changed from 0. 2 (range 0. 1 &ndash; 0. 4) to 0. 5 (range 0. 4 &ndash; 0. 8), and the severity of iritis decreased. SD-OCT showed that the lesions at presentation appeared as a globular noncystic mass attached {{to the back of the}} cornea, encroaching on the angle of the eye, and attached to the anterior surface of the iris at some points. Conclusion: SD-OCT for imaging the anterior segment allowed us to exclude the cystic nature of this pearly lesion. Some similarities may exist between these pearly lesions and superficial phlyctenular keratitis, which may support the immunological and inflammatory origin of these lesions.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{concentration}} of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the aqueous humor before and after intracameral injection of bevacizumab in eyes with neovascular glaucoma, and to detect the duration of an anti-VEGF effect of bevacizumab in the anterior chamber. Methods: In this prospective interventional case series, 1. 25 mg of bevacizumab was injected into the anterior chamber of five eyes in five neovascular glaucoma patients. Aqueous humor samples were obtained just before intracameral injection of bevacizumab and two weeks after injection. The concentrations of VEGF in the aqueous humor were measured using ELISA. To investigate corneal endothelial damage after intrecameral bevacizumab injection, specular microscopy was performed before injection and two weeks after injection. Slit <b>lamp</b> <b>photo</b> and iris fluorescent an-giography was performed to determine the regression of iris neovascularization. Results: After injection, substantial regression of neovascularization or fluorescein leakage was seen in all treated eyes. The VEGF concentrations in the aqueous humor in eyes with NVG were 1181. 8 ± 1248. 3 pg/mL before intra-cameral injection of bevacizumab. Two weeks after injection, the VEGF concentrations decreased to 33. 2 ± 12. 2 pg/ mL (p= 0. 04, Wilcoxon signed rank test). There were no significant changes in IOP or corneal endothelial cells. Conclusions: Intracameral bevacizumab injection can remarkably reduce iris neovascularization in neovascular glaucoma patients. VEGF levels were significantly decreased two weeks after injection and corneal toxicity was no...|$|R
