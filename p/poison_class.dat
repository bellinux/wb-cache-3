40|$|Objectives This study aims {{to provide}} {{baseline}} {{data to support}} the implementation of generic substitution policy in Malaysia by evaluating the community pharmacists' perceptions and opinions on generic substitution and current substitution practices. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study involving {{the entire population of}} Malaysian community pharmacies (nÂ =Â  1419) was undertaken using a self-completed anonymous mail questionnaire. Results A total of 219 responses were received for a response rate of 15. 4 %. Majority of the respondents (93. 6 %) agreed that pharmacists should have generic substitution rights. Almost all pharmacists (96. 8 %) viewed <b>Poison</b> <b>Class</b> C (pharmacist only medicine) as most suitable class of controlled medicines for substitution. About half (51. 6 %) of the pharmacists preferred a policy which allowed substitution on any prescription. The pharmacists prefer to consult the physician when substituting narrow therapeutic index medicines (88. 1 %) and prescription only medicines (51. 3 %). Less than 25. 0 % of the pharmacists routinely keep the medication records and follow-up the patients who received substitution. Monitoring the efficacy (79. 2 %) and patient's satisfaction with the generic medicines (74. 9 %) were the main reasons for following-up the patient if substitution occurs. Conclusions Malaysian community pharmacists are generally in favour of generic substitution policy implementation. Community pharmacist Perception Generic substitution Generic medicine Policy...|$|E

40|$|Poisonings {{account for}} almost 1 % of {{emergency}} room visits each year. Time {{is a critical}} factor in dealing with a toxicologic emergency. Delay in dispensing the first antidote dose can lead to life-threatening sequelae. Current toxicological resources that support treatment decisions are broad in scope, time-consuming to read, or at times unavailable. Our review of current toxicological resources revealed a gap in their ability to provide expedient calculations and recommendations about appropriate course of treatment. To bridge the gap, we developed the Antidote Application (AA), a computational system that automatically provides patient-specific antidote treatment recommendations and individualized dose calculations. We implemented 27 algorithms that describe FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration) approved use and evidence-based practices found in primary literature for the treatment of common toxin exposure. The AA covers 29 antidotes recommended by Poison Control and toxicology experts, 19 <b>poison</b> <b>classes</b> and 31 <b>poisons,</b> which represent over 200 toxic entities. To the best of our knowledge, the AA is the first educational decision support system in toxicology that provides patient-specific treatment recommendations and drug dose calculations.

5|$|These toxic {{mushrooms}} resemble several edible species (most notably caesar's mushroom and {{the straw}} mushroom) commonly consumed by humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental <b>poisoning.</b> Amatoxins, the <b>class</b> of toxins found in these mushrooms, are thermostable: they resist changes due to heat and so, their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking.|$|R
2500|$|Pasteels, Grégoire, and Rowell-Rahier [...] also grouped {{chemical}} defenses, {{albeit in}} a different manner. Weaponry is partitioned into chemical compounds that are truly poisonous, those that restrict movement, and those that repel predators. True <b>poisons,</b> essentially <b>Class</b> I compounds, interfere with specific physiological processes or act at certain sites. Repellents {{are similar to those}} classified under Class II as they irritate the chemical sensitivity of predators. Impairment of movement and sense organs is achieved through sticky, slimy, or entangling secretions that act mechanically rather than chemically. This last grouping of chemicals has both Class I and Class II properties. As with Class I and Class II compounds, these three categories are not mutually exclusive, as some chemicals can have multiple effects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{research}} program was initiated in 1990 to carefully examine the toxin profiles in mussels {{from the northern}} Adriatic Sea. Since then, a number of polyether toxins have been isolated and characterized, some of which represent new additions to the diarrhetic shellfish <b>poisoning</b> (DSP) <b>class</b> of biotoxins and seem to be peculiar to the Adriatic Sea. During our investigation of toxic Adriatic mussels, we also isolated {{a new type of}} toxin, whose structure was elucidated by extensive use of 1 D and 2 D NMR techniques. Some of them could represent a further alarm for public health owing to their cytotoxic activity. The recent application of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods for detection of Adriatic marine biotoxins allowed us to hasten the analysis of toxic samples and to advance effective structural hypothesis even when full structure elucidation of new toxins by NMR spectroscopy is hampered by the limited amount of available material...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear foci {{containing}} the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML bodies), which occur in most cells, {{play a role}} in tumor suppression. Here, we demonstrate that CHFR, a mitotic checkpoint protein frequently inactivated in human cancers, is a dynamic component of PML bodies. Intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis identified a distinct fraction of CHFR that interacts with PML in living cells. This interaction modulates the nuclear distribution and mobility of CHFR. A trans-dominant mutant of CHFR that inhibits checkpoint function also prevents colocalization and interaction with PML. Conversely, the distribution and mobility of CHFR are perturbed in PML(-/-) cells, accompanied by aberrations in mitotic entry and the response to spindle depolymerization. Thus, PML bodies control the distribution, dynamics and function of CHFR. Our findings implicate the interaction between these tumor suppressors in a checkpoint response to microtubule <b>poisons,</b> an important <b>class</b> of anticancer drugs...|$|R
40|$|A {{new series}} of indolocarbazole glycosides {{containing}} disaccharides were synthesized and their in vitro antiproliferative activity was evaluated against three human cancer cell lines (A 2780, H 460, and GLC 4). Cytotoxicity appeared to be remarkably affected by the regio- and stereochemical features of the disaccharide moiety. In vivo antitumor activity of the compounds studied, two of which having IC 50 < 100 nM, was determined using ovarian cancer cell line A 2780 xenografted on nude mice. One compound showed an efficacy {{similar to that of}} the reference compound edotecarin, though with a lower long-lasting activity. The topoisomerase I inhibitory properties of some compounds were also examined. Molecular dynamics simulations of the ternary topoisomerase I-DNA-ligand complexes were performed to analyze the structural features of topoisomerase I <b>poisoning</b> with this <b>class</b> of indolocarbazoles. A plausible explanation of their biological behavior was provided. These theoretical results were compared with the recently published crystal structure of an indolocarbazole monosaccharide bound to the covalent human topoisomerase I-DNA complex. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH& Co.

40|$|Introduction: It is {{stated that}} {{students}} cannot carry their knowledge on basic medical sciences that they gained with classical education to clinical classes and clinical practice and problem based learning (PBL) can compensate this drawback. It was aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of PBL scenario written on this topic on level of knowledge about childhood <b>poisoning</b> of third <b>class</b> students who completed the most of theoretical pharmacology education. Materials and Method: A questionnaire form prepared by researchers was applied to randomly chosen PBL groups without writing names and {{on the basis of}} voluntariness before and after a case of childhood poisoning which was applied as the second PBL scenario in the second midterm of 2009 - 2010 academic years. Numbers, percentages, chi-square and student’s t-test were used for evaluation of the questionnaire form comprised of demographic data, open-closed ended questions for measuring attitudes and level of knowledge against case of poisoning and statements as making a priority ranking. Results: In the study group, 89 students took part in pre-test and 96 students took part in post-test. In the answers to the list including the substances that are the most common causes of admission according to data of Refik Saydam National Poison Center (e. g. lotion, bath foam, cosmetics, water color and calamine lotions), the substances that the students stated to be toxic in pre-test were answered correctly in the post-test (p< 0. 05). Number of correct answers increased significantly for knowledge about commonly used drugs in clinical practice like anti-depressants, calcium canal blockers, oral antidiabetics that were marked as non-toxic by the students although they are toxic (p< 0. 05). While mean knowledge score for these 40 items was 17. 52 ± 5. 82 in pre-test, it increased to 27. 89 ± 8. 79 in post-test (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Results {{of this study indicate that}} PBL scenario applied to the students who learned pharmacology theoretically led increase of knowledge in terms of childhood poisoning.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} was to {{determine}} the spectrum and severity of effects of unintentional antipsychotic poisoning in children. A computerised literature search of MEDLINE (1966 to February 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2005) was undertaken. The Internet was searched using URL: www. google. com. The proceedings of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology (NACCT) and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) were hand searched. All cases of unintentional antipsychotic (all <b>classes)</b> <b>poisoning</b> in children aged 0 - 6 years were included. The data extracted included the age, weight, antipsychotic, dose, clinical effects, treatment and outcomes. The toxic dose was estimated as the lowest dose causing objective adverse effects. Sixty-eight reports were identified. Few contained all of the required information. Most of the case series included multiple antipsychotics with limited information on individual drugs or all ages with limited paediatric information. For most antipsychotics the ingestion of one tablet caused symptoms that were sometimes severe and usually lasted from 1 to 3 days. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were often delayed for up to 12 - 24 hours. Chlorpromazine caused CNS depression, hypotension and miosis; EPS and cardiac effects were rare, and the toxic dose was estimated to be 15 mg/kg. Haloperidol caused drowsiness (rarely coma) and over one-half of patients had neuromuscular effects (mainly EPS), with a toxic dose estimated at 0. 15 mg/kg. Thioridazine caused CNS depression and potentially cardiac effects, with a toxic dose of 1. 4 mg/kg. Atypical antipsychotics caused significant CNS depression (except risperidone); EPS were less common. Toxic doses were clozapine 2. 5 mg/kg, olanzapine 0. 5 mg/kg and aripiprazole 3 mg/kg. EPS responded to anticholinergic drug treatment. In summary, unintentional antipsychotic ingestion in children can cause severe effects that last 1 - 3 days, often with one tablet. Children potentially ingesting a toxic dose or who are symptomatic should be considered for assessment in hospital. Most cases resolve with good supportive care. Toxic doses are only estimates that are based on limited data and should be used with caution until prospective studies are undertaken...|$|R
