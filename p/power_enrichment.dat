40|$|Abstract Background Much of {{the public}} access cancer {{microarray}} data is asymmetric, belonging to datasets containing no samples from normal tissue. Asymmetric data cannot be used in standard meta-analysis approaches (such as the inverse variance method) to obtain large sample sizes for statistical <b>power</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Noting that plenty of normal tissue microarray samples exist in studies not involving cancer, we investigated the viability and accuracy of an integrated microarray analysis approach based on significance analysis of microarrays (merged SAM) using a collection of data from separate diseased and normal samples. Results We focused on five solid cancer types (colon, kidney, liver, lung, and pancreas), where available microarray data allowed us to compare meta-analysis and integrated approaches. Our results from the merged SAM significantly overlapped gene lists from the validated inverse-variance method. Both meta-analysis and merged SAM approaches successfully captured the aberrances in the cell cycle that commonly occur in the different cancer types. However, the integrated SAM analysis replicated the known cancer literature (excluding microarray studies) with much more accuracy than the meta-analysis. Conclusion The merged SAM test is a powerful, robust approach for combining data from similar platforms and for analyzing asymmetric datasets, including those with only normal or only cancer samples that cannot be utilized by meta-analysis methods. The integrated SAM approach {{can also be used}} in comparing global gene expression between various subtypes of cancer arising from the same tissue. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of the exhaust manifold in the engine cylinder head has received considerable attention in recent years for automotive gasoline engines, due to the proven benefits in: engine weight diminution, cost saving, reduced <b>power</b> <b>enrichment,</b> quicker engine and aftertreatment warm-up, improved packaging and simplification of the turbocharger installation. This design practice is still largely unknown in diesel engines because of the greater difficulties, caused by the more complex cylinder head layout, and the expected lower benefits, due {{to the absence of}} high-load enrichment. However, the need for improved engine thermomanagement and a quicker catalytic converter warm-up in efficient Euro 6 diesel engines is posing new challenges that an integrated exhaust manifold architecture could effectively address. A recently developed General Motors 1. 6 L Euro 6 diesel engine has been modified so that the intake and exhaust manifolds are integrated in the cylinder head. Extensive CAD/CAE/CAM analyses have been employed in order to guide the design of the overall surface and the water cooling jacket that surround the exhaust manifold of the new engine version, and thus to be able to improve the low-frequency thermal fatigue resistance of the head. The thus obtained prototype engine head has been tested on a highly-dynamic test bench at the Politecnico di Torino in order to characterize performance, emissions and thermal behavior in comparison to the baseline production engine. The results have generally been very promising and have shown the possibility of maintaining the same performance rating over the overall engine speed range as well as comparable emissions and brake specific fuel consumption in steady-state conditions. Furthermore, appreciably faster engine and aftertreatment warm-up have been recorded due to the higher heat fraction that is transferred to the coolant and to the more favorable exhaust gas enthalpy management. The latter benefit is in fact very interesting as far as the control of HC and CO emissions within the NEDC homologation is concerne...|$|E

The resulting models were applied to two difficult cases (p 38 and CDK 2) for which enrichment was not better than random.

ABSTRACT: Coal {{preparation}} {{plants are}} currently considering {{the introduction of}} more complex control procedures. Maximization of yields of desired quality saleable products or optimization of total economic effect of the plant production are main tasks for control systems at present. Design of such systems requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the whole technological process, its characteristics and interaction among unit operations in the plant. Computer simulation is a convenient tool for designing and evaluating complex coal preparation processes. It enables determination of expected results of coal processing and selection of an optimal strategy of the control of the whole plant [4]. In design of the coal preparation process control systems the computer simulation models are very useful. Computer simulation allows considering, in an efficient way, various variants of technological system solutions, analysing conditions of preparation process course in case of commercial contracts changed and while raw coals characteristics are changed [4]. In the paper an application of computer simulation program for coal preparation processes analysis and their control has been presented. The integral part of this software is an algorithm of searching the function algorithm of control target, i. e. the maximum production function of preset quality. The procedure how to determine the maximum production value has been presented in four exemplary technological systems with one, two or else three jigs. Results of <b>power</b> coal <b>enrichment</b> in considered technological systems have been presented in the paper. For four version of technological scheme and different production foredesign the optimal separation densities for each jigs have been calculated.

All methods were assessed individually and then combined in a Ligand-Based Virtual Screening (LBVS) and Target-Based Virtual Screening (TBVS) consensus scoring, using Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate their performance. Three consensus strategies were used: scaled-rank-by-number, rank-by-rank and rank-by-vote, with the most thriving the scaled-rank-by-number strategy, considering that the stiff ROC curve appeared to be satisfactory in every way to indicate a higher <b>enrichment</b> <b>power</b> at early retrieval of active compounds from the database. The ligand-based method provided access to a robust and predictive HQSAR model that was developed to show superior discrimination between active and inactive compounds, which was also better than ROCS and EON procedures.
