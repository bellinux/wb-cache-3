But Felix was determined that he would not stir in the matter unless Didon brought him the full sum of £250; and he almost thought, and indeed hoped, that she would not. Either she would be suspected at the bank and apprehended, or she would run off with the money on her own account when she got it;--or the cheque would have been missed and the <b>payment</b> <b>stopped.</b> Some accident would occur, and then {{he would be able to}} recede from his undertaking.

40|$|The {{multiple}} legal {{actions in}} the last three years, aimed at achieving ceratain wage differences by the satff employrd in the public sector (differences which were not granted by the employer or granted, but whose <b>payment</b> <b>stopped</b> following the Court of Accounts audit), raised at least two categories of problems. First it is the economic aspect, given the considerable additional value of claims in question. Then, the legal approach of the arrising implications is a quite difficult one. The executive is required to identify the financial source, without affecting the foreshadowed budget balance and, generally, the original calculation of the macro multiannual financial plan, given the objective of adopting the Euro currency (2014). The solution adopted: regulations on the time grading of payments, by Government Emergency Ordinance: 2012 (34 %), 2013 (33 %) and 2014 (33 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Numerous archival {{documents}} {{show how the}} 1575 - 1577 <b>payment</b> <b>stop</b> on the contracts with Genoese bankers (asientos) induced a freeze of the domestic credit market through the bankers' intermediation for asientos and credit linkages. Commercial fairs stopped, banks failed and trade suffered while the King granted legal protection to the Genoese bankers. The evidence strikingly confirms that the strategy of Philip II was not directed against the bankers but against the cities that were represented in the Cortes. He forced them to increase their fiscal commitment that funded the domestic debt (juros) into which asientos could be converted. The <b>payment</b> <b>stop</b> lasted until the cities agreed to the doubling of their commitment...|$|R

40|$|There is global {{enthusiasm for}} {{payments}} for ecosystem services (PES) programs to solve environmental problems, including in China. However, PES programs in China {{go against the}} principle of ‘voluntary transaction’, which weakens the influences of economic factors on farmers’ participation decisions and {{makes it hard to}} reveal their influence on farmers’ participation willingness. Using household survey data and a logistic regression model, this study attempts to understand the influencing factors of farmers’ decision-making on involvement in PES projects for hypothetical voluntary participation and focuses on whether the farmer would reject the program if the <b>payment</b> <b>stopped.</b> A surprising but promising result is found {{in the case of the}} Paddy Landto-Dry Land (PLDL) program in Chicheng County, China, wherein, apart from the negative impact of education and the positive effect of off-farm income, two non-economic factors play a significant role in farmers’ participation. The one is basic cognition, which negatively affects farmers’ participation, and the other is inner altruistic motivation, which positively contributes to the participation. In addition, the high proportion of reconversion to paddy land after the payment period threatens the long-term sustainability of the PLDL program. Faced with the low education and environmental cognition statuses in remote agricultural areas, increasing educational quality and promoting the popular awareness of PES programs in rural areas should be highlighted in sustaining the efficiency and effectiveness of PES programs in the long run...|$|E

Payments ranged from $50 to $725 per month, and started only a month after SMU went on its original probation (though it later emerged that a slush fund had been maintained {{in one form or another}} since the mid-1970s).
