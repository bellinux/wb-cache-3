5|$|Alternatively, {{when one}} board finishes, play can {{continue}} on the other board. In this case, pieces in reserve can still be dropped, but no new <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> coming in. The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> thus fried under pressure.|$|E
50|$|A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> said {{to attack}} (or threaten) an opponent's piece if, {{in the next}} move, it could capture that <b>piece.</b> A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> said to defend (or protect) {{a piece of the}} defender's color if, in case the defended <b>piece</b> <b>were</b> taken by the opponent, the defender could {{immediately}} recapture. Attacking a piece usually, but not always (see Sacrifice), forces the opponent to respond if the attacked <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> undefended, or if the attacking <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> of lower value than the one attacked.|$|R
5000|$|Four <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> {{found with}} a total weight 5.730 kg out of an {{estimated}} 53 kg weight before break-up. The largest found <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> probably only the second largest. These four <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> found, named after villages, where they were found: ...|$|R
50|$|Whichever {{player has}} more <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> the winner (a Mandarin <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> equal to ten or five citizen pieces).|$|R
5|$|By convention, {{the game}} <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> divided into {{white and black}} sets, and the players are {{referred}} to as White and Black respectively. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Notes: 1,023 pieces melted. White {{metal and}} zinc <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{known to have}} been struck. The zinc pieces were {{allegedly}} fixed {{in the center of a}} target during the shooting festival. If hit, the shooter would be given a larger award.|$|E
5000|$|If {{a player}} can trap an enemy piece between two {{friendly}} pieces, the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> blocked and cannot be moved. Such a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> called alligatus or, according to Isidore, incitus. To {{make it clear}} that a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> an alligatus, it is turned upside down.|$|R
50|$|Three {{of these}} five <b>pieces</b> of {{inscription}} <b>were</b> discovered in Myittha Township, Mandalay Region on 17 November 2013 and one <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> found on 27 November 2013. One <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> still missing. The found four <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> rejoined and currently stands in Petaw monastery. The slab size is 1.75 m in height, and 1.06 m in breadth.|$|R
25|$|As if this {{mosaic of}} {{unrelated}} <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> not complex enough, {{some of the}} assembled <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> uplifted, eroded by streams, and then locally buried in their own eroded debris; other <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> forced deep into the Earth to be heated and squeezed, almost beyond recognition, and then raised again to view.|$|R
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> close to being done the temperature is raised and the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|The tablebases of all endgames {{with up to}} six <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} for free download, and may also be queried using web interfaces (see the external links below). Nalimov tablebase requires more than one terabyte of storage space.|$|E
5|$|Although many of {{his works}} feature his {{signature}} aliens, no two <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> alike. The subject matter may also be themed and adapted to their context. Invader's repertoire of subjects includes Star Wars characters, the Pink Panther and Mega Man, Spider-Man, Hong Kong Phooey, Thomas from Kung-Fu Master and Popeye. Sites near major bank buildings are marked with dollar sign mosaics, those in Hong Kong have an oriental theme.|$|E
5000|$|Ambuscade: If two pieces' sum {{is equal}} to an enemy <b>piece</b> that <b>is</b> placed between the two (i.e. the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> within a move of both attacking pieces), the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{captured}} and removed from the board.|$|R
50|$|A {{procedure}} for 3 partners and general <b>pieces</b> <b>was</b> found in 1960. A {{procedure for}} 3 partners and connected <b>pieces</b> <b>was</b> {{found only in}} 1980.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, the {{dismantled}} <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> {{found inside}} the Third Pylon {{of the main}} temple, constructed {{in the time of}} Amenhotep III, at Karnak, and between 1927 and 1930 all of the <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> carefully removed. These <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> then assembled into the building that is seen today in the Karnak Open Air Museum.|$|R
5|$|Many of the cannons {{and other}} weapons from the Mary Rose have {{provided}} invaluable physical evidence about 16th-century weapon technology. The surviving gunshields are almost {{all from the}} Mary Rose, and the four small cast iron hailshot <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> the only known examples {{of this type of}} weapon.|$|E
5|$|Silver treasures, {{common in}} the Scandinavian countries, are found also in Slavic areas {{including}} Poland, especially northern Poland. Silver objects, coins and decorations, often cut into <b>pieces,</b> <b>are</b> believed to have served as currency units, brought in by Jewish and Arab traders, but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige. The process of hiding or depositing them, besides protecting them from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual.|$|E
5|$|Since 1994, the Crown Jewels {{have been}} {{on display in the}} Jewel House in the Waterloo Block. Some of the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> used {{regularly}} by the Queen. The display includes 23,578 gemstones, the 800-year-old Coronation Spoon, St. Edward's Crown (worn during all crownings at Westminster Abbey) and the Imperial State Crown.|$|E
5000|$|The valuations of the {{partners}} are additive, i.e., when a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> divided, the sum of a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> equal to {{the sum of its}} parts.|$|R
5000|$|A {{block is}} a {{defensive}} tactic in chess {{in response to}} an attack, consisting of interposing a piece between the opponent's attacking piece and the piece being attacked. This type of blocking will only work if the attacking <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> a type that can move linearly an indefinite number of squares such as a queen, rook, or bishop and {{there is at least one}} empty square in the line between the attacking and attacked <b>piece.</b> Blocking <b>is</b> not an option when the attacking <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> directly adjacent to the <b>piece</b> it <b>is</b> attacking, or when the attacking <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> a knight (because knights [...] "jump over other pieces" [...] and cannot be blocked). When an opponent's attack on a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> blocked, the blocking <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> to some extent pinned, either relatively or absolutely, until a future move by either side allows it to be unpinned.|$|R
2500|$|Each <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{called a}} [...] "fers", {{the same name}} as the chess queen, as the move of the two <b>pieces</b> <b>was</b> the same at the time.|$|R
5|$|Super Smash Bros. {{features}} {{music from}} some of Nintendo's popular gaming franchises. While many are newly arranged for the game, some <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> taken directly from their sources. The music for Super Smash Bros. was composed by Hirokazu Ando, who later returned as sound and music director for Super Smash Bros. Melee. A complete soundtrack was released on CD in Japan through Teichiku Records in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} of the building provides a home to the Fashion Museum, which was known before 2007 as the Museum of Costume. The collection was started by Doris Langley Moore, who gave her collection {{to the city of}} Bath in 1963. It focuses on fashionable dress for men, women and children from the late 16th century to the present day and has more than 30,000 objects. The earliest <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> embroidered shirts and gloves from about 1600.|$|E
5|$|The {{finite element}} method is an {{important}} numerical method to solve partial differential equations, widely applied in simulating complex physical systems. It attempts to approximate the solution to some equation by piecewise linear functions, where the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> chosen {{with respect to a}} sufficiently fine grid, which in turn can be recast as a matrix equation.|$|E
50|$|Originally this <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{written in}} E major. The <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> often {{performed}} in E-flat major, {{which makes the}} fingering less difficult on modern E-flat and B-flat trumpets.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 the <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{surveyed}} {{as part of}} the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey. At {{the time}} of survey, the <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> described as needing treatment.|$|R
5000|$|If a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> moved voluntarily {{between two}} enemy <b>pieces,</b> it <b>is</b> not captured.|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} a {{distinct}} royal jewel collection is vague, {{though it is}} believed the jewels have their origin somewhere in the 16thcentury. Many of the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> from overseas and {{were brought to the}} United Kingdom as a result of civil war, coups and revolutions, or acquired as gifts to the monarch. Most of the jewellery dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of an en passant capture is relevant to claims of a draw by threefold repetition. Two positions whose <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{all on the same}} squares, with the same player to move, are for this purpose considered different if there was an opportunity to make an enpassant capture in the first position, and of course that opportunity no longer exists the second time the same configuration of pieces occurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{whereabouts}} {{of some of}} Burges's most important <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> unknown, but discoveries are sometimes made: a brooch which he designed as a wedding present for his friend John Pollard Seddon was identified on the BBC television series Antiques Roadshow and subsequently sold at auction for £31,000 in August 2011.|$|E
50|$|Qualification for piece removal {{after each}} turn: If a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> lying on its side, the <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> removed. If a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> bumped, it is left alone. If a Hero is killed {{before all the}} warriors are eliminated, the hero is put back into place; the player who owned the hit hero will lose an action on their next turn.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} in 2011 by the Adams Public Library after Greg Mendez had {{an exhibition}} of {{his work at the}} Decatur library. The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> installed in October 2011.|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{listening}} to music, I see colors and shapes, either angular or circular, {{and get a}} sense of whether the <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> horizontal or vertical. Joshua’s <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> all blue and green." ...|$|R
