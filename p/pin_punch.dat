50|$|ARDF {{transmitters}} have a {{low power}} output and operate in either the two meter or eighty meter amateur radio band. The transmissions are in Morse code. Each transmitter sends a unique identification {{that can be easily}} interpreted even by those unfamiliar with the Morse code by counting the number of dits that follow a series of dashes. The transmitters on course all transmit on the same frequency and each transmit in sequence for one minute at a time in a repeating cycle. Within a few meters of each transmitter, an orienteering control flag and punch device will be present. For many events and all major events the punch device is an electronic system, such as SPORTident, used in orienteering competitions. This records the time competitors visit each control on a small device that they carry. An alternative is to use <b>pin</b> <b>punches</b> which the competitor uses to make a distinct pattern on a control card they carry. Competitors need to locate the control flag at the transmitter site and use the punch device to record their visit. Good course design will attempt to preclude, as much as possible, runners interfering with the transmitter equipment as they approach the control. At large international or national events, jurors might be present at transmitter controls to ensure fair play.|$|R
50|$|Spring punches, {{also called}} roll pin punches, {{are used to}} drive roll pins. Standard pin punches should never be used on a roll pin. Because of the hollow, thin wall {{construction}} of a roll pin, a standard <b>pin</b> <b>punch</b> will often collapse, mar or distort {{the end of the}} pin or be driven into, and jammed inside, the hollow core of the roll pin. When choosing a roll <b>pin</b> <b>punch,</b> select one that is no larger than the compressed diameter of the pin. If a punch is used that is larger than the pin,the surrounding metal in which the pin is seated can be damaged. Also, a roll <b>pin</b> <b>punch</b> should not be used which is smaller than the compressed diameter of the pin. If this occurs, {{it may be possible to}} drive the punch through the hollow center of the roll pin.|$|E
50|$|Roll pin punches are {{designed}} with a small projection {{in the center of}} the pin tip to support the circumference of the roll pin. The tips of roll pin punches are not flat and should never be used on regular solid pins. If a roll <b>pin</b> <b>punch</b> is used on a solid pin, it will mar or mark the pin.|$|E
50|$|In metalworking, a drift pin, drift <b>pin</b> <b>punch,</b> slave pin, simply drift, or even pokey bit is {{the name}} for a tool used for {{enlarging}} holes, or aligning holes prior to bolting or riveting metal parts together. A drift pin is not used as a punch {{in the traditional sense}} of the term. A drift is constructed as a tapered rod, with the hammer acting on the large end of the taper. The tapered end of a drift punch is placed into the semi-aligned bolt holes of two separate components, and then driven into the hole. As it is driven in, the taper forces the two components into alignment, allowing for easy insertion of the fastener. Unlike most punches, force should never be applied to the tip of drift pin.|$|E
5000|$|Archer then {{abandoned}} {{this approach}} {{in favour of}} perforation, a process which used rows of small round <b>pins</b> to <b>punch</b> out the holes. In 1848 Archer patented his perforation machine which worked on the [...] "stroke" [...] principle. The arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation, and this became known as [...] "comb" [...] perforation. Perforation trials were conducted in 1849 and 1850 {{under the auspices of}} the British Government and stamps from these trials were first issued towards the end of 1850. The Archer machine proved the viability of the process but never entered service. Archer's patent for his perforating machine (no. 12,340 of 1848, dated May 23, 1849) was purchased for £4,000 in June 1853. New machines based on Archer's principles were constructed by David Napier and Son Ltd; these were initially used in October 1853 for revenue stamps and from January 1854 for postage stamps.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The bone {{drilling}} {{temperature fields}} under different cutting parameters and cooling modes were experimental researched by using common twist drill, diamond <b>punching</b> <b>pin,</b> diamond bullet-like grinding head and diamond spherical grinding head. Three cooling modes were applied, namely, natural air cooling, normal saline pouring cooling and normal saline spray cooling. K-thermocouple {{was used to}} measure temperature in bone hole. Results showed that the drill shape could influence drilling temperature greatly. The maximum drilling temperature of diamond spherical grinding head is 46. 31 °C. The maximum drilling temperature of common twist drill is 42. 1 °C and that of diamond bullet-like grinding head is 38. 29 °C. The drilling temperatures at drill speed is under 560 r/min, 900 r/min, 1, 250 r/min and 2, 100 r/min are 38. 84 °C, 41. 1 °C, 43. 84 °C and 46. 31 °C. This reflects that under same of other drilling parameters, drilling temperature increases with the increase of drill speed. The maximum bone drilling temperatures of diamond <b>punch</b> <b>pin</b> under 2, 100 r/min speed of mainshaft and air cooling conditions vary as feed speed increase firstly and then decrease. The normal saline spray cooling has the lowest maximum drilling temperature of (29. 34 °C) at same depth, following by normal saline pouring cooling of (32. 45 °C) and air cooling of (40. 28 °C) successively. The normal saline spray cooling has the best cooling effect, followed by normal saline pouring cooling and air cooling successively...|$|R
50|$|The buttstock, lower {{handguard}} {{and upper}} heatguard are manufactured from birch plywood laminates like the later model AK-47 furniture. Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping {{better than the}} conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper.The wooden buttstock used in the AKM is further hollowed {{in order to reduce}} weight and is longer and straighter than that of the AK-47, which assists accuracy for subsequent shots during rapid and automatic fire. The wooden stock also houses the issued cleaning kit, which is a small diameter metal tube with a twist lock cap. The kit normally contains the cleaning jag to which a piece of cloth material is wrapped around and dipped into cleaning solution. It also contains a <b>pin</b> <b>punch,</b> an assembly pin to hold the trigger, disconnector and rate reducer together while putting these back into the receiver after cleaning the weapon, and a barrel brush. The kit is secured inside the butt stock via a spring-loaded trap door in the stock's pressed sheet metal butt cap.|$|E
5000|$|The carbine's {{integral}} 10-round {{magazine is}} not an issue in those states and nations which prohibit higher-capacity magazines, except Canada, and New Zealand. In the case for Canada, the SKS is classified as a non-restricted firearm and the magazine must be pinned to five rounds or the rifles must be retrofitted with five-shot magazines, while New Zealand's arm code states that an A class center fire, self-loading rifle must have no more than seven rounds in the magazine (this only applies to guns on an a-cat licence, those on an e-cat have no magazine limit). Where higher capacity magazines are legally permitted, {{there are a number of}} secondary market vendors that sell higher capacity magazines of up to 30 rounds (or more). These secondary market magazines may be installed by first removing the fixed OEM magazine (a process that involves the removal of the trigger group assembly with a <b>pin</b> <b>punch,</b> screwdriver, bullet-tip, or similar device). However, although the 7.62×39mm round is generally compared to the American Winchester [...]30-30, many states have laws against hunting rifles with magazines of more than five rounds. Magazine plugs limiting the magazine to five rounds must be used for hunting in these states.|$|E
50|$|Narayam {{was made}} in shapes and sizes to suit the writer's style and {{ergonomic}} comfort. They ranged from very simple design to the most eloquent fashions befitting the status of its users. Sometimes, it was maintained as an accessory to other personal utility tools like pocket knives etc., similar to the swiss army knife culture. In addition to scribing, the narayam {{could be used as}} a <b>punching</b> <b>pin</b> to pierce small holes on the palm leaves. Through these holes, the individual leaves were kneaded together using threads, thereby forming a bound collection which is commonly known as a 'grantha' (book), e.g. Guru Granth Sahib.|$|R

2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel <b>pin</b> that <b>punches</b> out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps. [...] The purpose of all such primer crimps is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to crimps, to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|R

40|$|Different {{types of}} self-injury have been {{classified}} as reflecting impulsive and compulsive characteristics (article by Simeon and Favazza [Self-injurious Behaviors: Assessment and Treatment pp 1 - 28.

The current research used a prospective design {{to evaluate whether}} there is a progression between these different types of self-injurious behaviors (SIB) over time. Support was found for a progression from compulsive SIB (including hair pulling, nail-biting, skin picking, scratching, and preventing wounds from healing) to impulsive SIB (including cutting, burning, carving, <b>pin</b> sticking, and <b>punching)</b> in a group of adult women (N = 106). Other factors hypothesized to be linked to this outcome were disordered eating, age, and personality facets of impulsivity (specifically, urgency and lack of perseverance).

40|$|The {{potentials}} of semi-solid forming {{technology have}} generated much interest regarding its application in micromanufacturing. This study investigates {{the feasibility of}} using semi-solid forming technology to produce parts with micro/meso features. An experimen-tal setup has been developed to {{study the effects of}} die/punch temperature, initial solid fraction, punch speed, and workpiece shape on the semi-solid forming process. A part has been produced for a microreactor application and has been analyzed with an optical measurement system for feature formation. The results indicated complex interaction among the process parameters and the material flow, which affected the final <b>pin</b> forma-tion. The <b>punch</b> temperature and velocity had a significant effect on the overall die filling. The initial workpiece shape and solidification of the semi-solid material during forming influenced the micro/meso-feature formation sequence, affecting the final pin formation. Furthermore, grain deformation and distribution of the formed parts were investigated. The grains became larger due to induction heating and the forming process. Severely distorted grains were observed at the corner regions of the pins and the punch-workpiece interface. DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 251540...|$|R

40|$|Der Siedlungskomplex von Udabno in Ostgeorgien wurde in den Jahren 2000 bis 2007 intensiv archäologisch untersucht. Auf mehreren Bergkuppen befinden sich dicht beieinander drei Siedlungen in strategisch günstiger Lage. Die Untersuchungen von insgesamt 25 einphasigen und regelhaft, einheitlich orientierten, rechteckigen Grubenhäusern ergab eine zeitliche Einordnung der Besiedelung an den Übergang vom 2. zum 1. Jt. v. Chr. und damit in die Spätbronze-/Früheisenzeit. Mehr als 1400 stratigraphisch gesicherte Kleinfunde wurden während den Ausgrabungen dokumentiert. Das Spektrum umfasst zahlreiche Metall-, Knochen-, Keramik- und Steinartefakte. Aus der typologischen und funktionalen Zusammensetzung der Kleinfundinventare können verschiedene Aktivitätsbereiche innerhalb der Häuser und des gesamten Siedlungsplatzes abgeleitet werden. So beschränkten sich die Bewohner vor allem auf landwirtschaftliche Arbeiten wie die Viehzucht. Ebenso sind handwerkliche Tätigkeiten in den Siedlungen nachgewiesen. Funde wie zum Beispiel Spinnwirtel, Webkämme und Webgewichte belegen die Herstellung von Textilien in allen Siedlungsbereichen. In einzelnen Arealen fanden sich depotartige Niederlegungen von zum Teil noch im Herstellungsprozess befindlichen Schmuckstücken, wie Karneolperlen, Steinanhängern oder bronzenen Zierblechen. Innerhalb der Häuser dienten architektonische Strukturen (z. B. Lehmbänke) der Abgrenzung bestimmter Aktivitätsbereiche, so dass mit Hilfe der Kleinfunde Koch-, Arbeits-, Wohn- und Lagerbereiche lokalisiert werden können. Anhand von naturwissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen an ausgewählten Funden – wie zum Beispiel Mahlsteinen aus ortsfremdem Material – werden zudem Verbindungen zu anderen Gebieten aufgezeigt. This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the activities of the University of Tübingen at Troy and their implications for research related to Black Sea archaeology which goes back to the 1990 s. Udabno is situated about 40 km from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, in the East Georgian region of Kakheti. Intensive excavation work in three large settlements was started in 2002 and finally completed in 2007. The investigations at the areas of Udabno I–III revealed single-phase settlements, which date in the Late Bronze-/Early Iron Age, i. e. the transition from the second to first millennium BC. According a conflagration the majority of the houses were destroyed. The inventories in these burnt houses were therefore preserved in situ. Altogether, remains of 25 houses were discovered. The aim of this thesis was to examine more than 1400 small finds which were documented stratigraphically during the campaigns. A special focus involved drawing conclusions about the everyday life and organisation in the settlements and trading activities of its residents. A second part of this dissertation includes important information on the production technology of metals, and the reconstruction of trade routes, based on grinding stones, and obsidian, which was the result of archaeometrical investigations. Among other finds, a large number of stone artefacts were analysed, including mortars and pestles, grinders and rubbers, pounders, pendants, and carnelian beads. Beside these artefacts, the assemblage includes metal finds in the form of spearheads, knives, <b>pins,</b> rings, and <b>punched</b> sheets. Almost all the metal artefacts are made of arsenic- or tin-copper. Iron is used only sporadically. In addition, there are some small finds made of bone and pottery, like combs, and seals, and also some obsidian objects. As a result of the investigation of the small finds and their architectural context {{it can be said that}} there is no compelling evidence for specific differences within the settlement that indicate social stratification. It is probable that the development of social stratification was prevented by the short duration of the settlement activity in this region. The type and quality of the small finds point to a rather low level of prosperity. Animal husbandry seems to be the most important activity of the residents. Secondary evidence for agriculture includes remains of a threshing sledge as well as many (bread) stamps and grin-ding stones. The picture of the “agricultural” and “industrial” activities we have gained from our analyses shows us the daily lives of a rural population in the Late Bronze-/Early Iron Age which had individual trade links to the southeast of Georgia (Tsalka), northern Armenia and eastern Anatolia. This work can be seen as a contribution to the ongoing intensive research into the prehistory of a region which is characterised by major lacunae in our knowledge due to insufficient research in the 20 th century. The results of the excavations in Udabno have revealed an interesting example of a characteristic rural settlement between the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mountains...|$|R
