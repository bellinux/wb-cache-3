5|$|GPK trains {{used the}} Glasgow and <b>Paisley</b> Joint Line {{as far as}} Paisley; it was joint with the Glasgow, <b>Paisley</b> and Greenock Railway. The line between Shields Junction and <b>Paisley</b> was quadrupled in 1880s. It was reduced again to double track during the mid 1960s. A third track was added once more in early 2012.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of <b>Paisley</b> established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from <b>Paisley</b> should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of <b>Paisley</b> save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of <b>Paisley</b> could visit the house annually. After the foundation <b>Paisley</b> was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E
5|$|A papal bull of 11 July 1265 {{reveals that}} <b>Paisley</b> Abbey built {{only a small}} oratory served by <b>Paisley</b> monks. Twenty years after the bishop's ruling <b>Paisley</b> complained to the papacy, which led Pope Clement IV to issue two bulls, dated 11 June 1265 and 6 February 1266, {{appointing}} mandatories to settle the dispute; {{the results of their}} deliberations are unknown. Crossraguel was not finally founded until about two decades after Donnchadh's death, probably by 1270; its first abbot, Abbot Patrick, is attested between 1274 and 1292.|$|E

Susan McKay wrote in the Irish Times that, on hearing <b>Paisley's</b> accusations, Black {{went straight to the}} Reaveys' house and told Reavey that he knew he was innocent. The then Northern Ireland deputy first minister, the SDLP's Seamus Mallon, expressed outrage at <b>Paisley's</b> claims. Ronnie Flanagan, chief constable of the RUC, said there was [...] "no evidence whatsoever" [...] to connect Reavey with the massacre, and that no police file contained any such allegation.|$|R

5|$|On 22 July 1847 {{the company}} {{acquired}} {{control of the}} <b>Paisley</b> and Renfrew Railway under the <b>Paisley</b> & Renfrew Railway Sale and Improvement Act. ,. The purchase had earlier been agreed by the proposed <b>Paisley,</b> Barrhead and Hurlet Railway, supported by the GPK, for £34,000. It was horse-operated and had a track gauge of 4ft4in (1,321mm). The line was loss-making and had no practical value other than the tactical one of securing territory against competing companies. The <b>Paisley</b> Barrhead and Hurlet Bill failed in the 1847 session of Parliament and was re-presented in 1848; the share capital proposed had risen to £230,000; during the Lords' hearings it became plain that running powers {{were likely to be}} granted to the Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, an offshoot of the Caledonian Railway. The GPK had subscribed to £150,000 in face value of the shares of this proposed line, with the sole intention of excluding the Caledonian Railway from the area. The GPK now petitioned against the Bill, but this was unsuccessful, and it received the Royal Assent, with the running powers clause, on 31 August 1848.|$|E

5|$|<b>Paisley</b> quickly {{offered to}} buy the Princess, and reached an {{agreement}} with the Old Strathcona Foundation in October 1994 for an unspecified amount. The banks, however, refused to finance Paisley’s plan and the deal fell through in December. The Old Strathcona Foundation quickly pivoted, and attempted in early 1995 to transfer control of the cinema to the Princess Theatre Society, “a small board made up of film experts and business people” including <b>Paisley.</b>|$|E
5|$|Raising capital proved straightforward, {{and it was}} {{possible}} to present a Bill for the line in the 1837 session of Parliament. There was strenuous opposition from river and canal interests, but this was overcome. At the time the Glasgow, <b>Paisley</b> and Greenock Railway (GP) was also promoting its line, with a similar route from Tradeston to <b>Paisley.</b> It became obvious that Parliament would be hostile to the formation of two adjacent lines, so it was determined to build the line jointly as far as <b>Paisley.</b> Both the GPK and the GP received the royal assent on 15 July 1837. The Glasgow, <b>Paisley</b> Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway Act authorised share capital of £625,000, and £208,300 in loans. The line was to be constructed simultaneously from each end, to prevent the experience of the Ardrossan Railway which failed to build the eastern end of its authorised line.|$|E

5|$|The Glasgow, <b>Paisley,</b> Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK) was {{a railway}} in Scotland that {{provided}} train services between Glasgow, Kilmarnock and Ayr. It opened its first line, between Glasgow and Ayr, in stages from 1839 to 1840. The section between Glasgow and <b>Paisley</b> was made jointly with the Glasgow, <b>Paisley</b> and Greenock Railway. Later it built {{a line from}} Dalry via Kilmarnock to Cumnock, linking there with the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway, and together forming a through route from Glasgow to Carlisle. The two companies merged to form the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Paisley</b> witches, {{also known}} as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches, were tried in <b>Paisley,</b> Renfrewshire, central Scotland, in 1697.

5|$|Donnchadh's most {{important}} long-term patronage {{was a series}} of gifts to the Cluniac Abbey of <b>Paisley</b> that led to the foundation of a monastery at Crossraguel (Crois Riaghail). At some date before 1227 he granted Crossraguel and a place called Suthblan to <b>Paisley,</b> a grant confirmed by Pope Honorius III on 23 January 1227. A royal confirmation by King Alexander III of Scotland dated to 25 August 1236 shows that Donnchadh granted the monastery the churches of Kirkoswald (Turnberry), Straiton and Dalquharran (Old Dailly). He may also have given the churches of Girvan and Kirkcudbright-Innertig (Ballantrae).|$|E

5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob <b>Paisley,</b> who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to <b>Paisley,</b> Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, <b>Paisley</b> had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.|$|E
