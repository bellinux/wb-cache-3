40|$|The {{local anesthetics}} {{procaine}} and <b>piperocaine</b> blocked induction of the plasmid-determined enzymatic activities {{involved in the}} metabolism of n-alkanes in Pseudomonas putida. Procaine reversibly inhibited existing alkane hydroxylase activity. Induction of a soluble aliphatic amidase activity was not affected. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} induction of the plasmid-determined alkane metabolic system in P. putida involves a membrane component(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that a cloned 2 -megadalton (MDal) fragment of Escherichia coli DNA contained the structural gene for major outer membrane protein a (also known as 3 b or M 2 (40 kDal). The present study demonstrates that M 2 is synthesized from a 42 -kDal precursor that also {{is present in}} the outer membrane. The conversion of the 42 -kDal precursor to M 2 is inhibited by a number of different local anesthetics (procaine, <b>piperocaine,</b> lidocaine, cocaine), by the neuroactive drug atropine, and by the classical trypsin inhibitors N alpha-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and benzamidine. Our kinetic studies demonstrate that the amidase action of pure trypsin is inhibited competitively by the local anesthetics tested (excluding lidocaine) as well as by atropine and neostigmine. A mechanism of action for local anesthetics as well as atropine in E. coli may to be inhibit trypsinlike proteases, in a competitive manner, in the region of the outer membrane. The mechanism of action of these compounds in regulating nerve conduction in man have certain features in common with the mechanism proposed in E. coli...|$|E
