Sometimes called the [...] "Warrior Cardinal", he {{is seen as a}} {{controversial}} figure and is considered to have given moral justifications for the US military intervention in Iraq which had terrible consequences on the Christianity in Iraq with its almost annihilation ten years later under a Shiite regime allied with Teheran. Early 2003, O'Brien preached to the soldiers at West Point saying openly at mass : [...] "I {{know that a lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the Pope is against war with Iraq... But even if he did, you are not bound by conscience to obey his opinion. However, you are bound in conscience to obey the orders of your Commander-in-Chief, and if he orders you to go to war, it is your duty to go to war".|$|E
2500|$|The album's [...] "most startling" [...] {{song was}} {{considered}} [...] "What About," [...] in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse. Jackson stated, [...] "I think it's important to let others know that {{certain things that}} you may have experienced in your life, and that they're not alone, and that you understand what they're going through, and that they can make it through." [...] Joel Lyans included it among [...] "The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness," [...] writing, [...] "Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women." [...] Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton's infidelity to Hillary Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, [...] "President Clinton? <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> to me. They say 'this is his song'," [...] comparing the situation with her song [...] "This Time" [...] inaccurately related to O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson due to its subject matter.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we probably need to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well as we should have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E

Well, we do not know, because we have never yet honestly tried, what the commonest people will or will not respond to. When Sir Richard Wallace's pictures were being exhibited at Bethnal Green, after <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the workers <b>had</b> no souls for art and would not appreciate its treasures, a story is told of a female in very poor clothes gazing intently {{at a picture of}} the Infant Jesus in the arms of his Mother, and then exclaiming, 'Who would not try to be a good woman, who had such a child as that?'

It is important to note, however, that Dora Maurer does not consider her art political, nor does she bear the thought in mind when creating.

Most of this critique is attributed to her work done in the 1960s to 1980s.|$|E

Mr. Monk knew that he might probably be sent for, but had not expected that any of the ex-Prime Ministers of the day would come to him. <b>People</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> not improbably he himself might be the man,--but he himself had indulged in no such dream.

She also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Armed Revolutionary Nuclei had never deliberately targeted ordinary <b>people.</b> Fioravanti <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the 1980 Bologna train station bombing was the work of Libya, but the Italian state had been reluctant to pursue that line of enquiry because of dependence on Libya's oil, and blamed neo-fascists.|$|R

He was reputed to be a hard, cruel person, and rumors circulated that he abused his wife and children. Then one night a big black dog told the children to kill their father.
