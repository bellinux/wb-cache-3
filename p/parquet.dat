5|$|The A Station's {{control room}} was given many Art Deco {{fittings}} by architect Halliday. Italian marble {{was used in}} the turbine hall, and polished <b>parquet</b> floors and wrought-iron staircases were used throughout. Owing to a lack of available money following the Second World War, the interior of the B Station was not given the same treatment, and instead the fittings were made from stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The house {{also has}} {{significant}} interior features, including marble fireplaces, wood paneling, coffered ceilings, window and door architraves, <b>parquet</b> floors, and extensive carved wood and plaster detail, {{primarily in the}} Adamesque mold.

5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, <b>parquet</b> floor was installed, and the room was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E

Originally constructed in the Federal style for Henry Bates Grubb between 1800 and 1805, Mount Hope Estate was the most formal ironmaster's mansion built in the area between 1750 and 1850. In 1895, Daisy Grubb oversaw significant changes, adding a Victorian ballroom, a billiard room, chandeliers, and <b>parquet</b> floors, and converting original hinged doors to sliding doors, while still maintaining much of the original construction, including the original facade and fireplace mantels.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, <b>parquet</b> blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} {{investigations}} of boundary value problems for its theoretical significance and extensive applications in mathematical physics, such as elasticity theory, potential theory, medical imaging. Numerous {{results have been}} achieved for boundary value problems in different particular domains; see [1 – 10]. The basic boundary value problems are the Schwarz, Dirichlet, Robin and Neumann problems. In general, the well-known conformal invariance of the reflection across circles and lines {{can be used to}} find a Schwarz operator for simple domains like circles, half circles, rings, half planes, etc. But the explicit Schwarz-Poisson formula in a rectangle cannot be simply obtained from the classical Schwarz-Poisson formula on the unit disc or the half-plane by conformal mapping. In [11, 12], the authors introduced a method of plane <b>parqueting,</b> which can be used to determine a Schwarz operator, the harmonic Green and Neumann functions, and requires that reflecting the domain at all of these circular or straight curves produces a <b>parqueting</b> of whole complex plane with possible exception of singular points. In [7, 10, 13], the authors discussed Schwarz and Dirichlet problems in an isosceles orthogonal triangle and an equilateral triangle via different series. Also the Green and Neumann functions for a strip and a rectangle were established in detail in [6]. In the present paper, we construct a modified Schwarz-Poisson representation formula by the <b>parqueting</b> reflection principle and Cauchy-Pompeiu formula in a rectangle, discussing the related Schwarz problem explicitly.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the Schwarz-type boundary-value problem (BVP) of the nonhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equation on an isosceles orthogonal triangle. By {{the technique of}} plane <b>parqueting</b> and the Cauchy–Pompeiu formula on the triangle, the Schwarz–Poisson formula is obtained. We also investigate boundary behaviors of the Schwarz-type operator and the Pompeiu-type operator. Especially, boundary-values at the corners are proved to exist. Finally, {{the solution of the}} Schwarz-type BVP is explicitly obtained...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} studies on {{experimental}} psychology which analyze the aesthetic evaluation of forms such as crystals and the Penrose <b>parquets.</b> The application of Fourier series and integrals to digitalized images gains a new meaning {{with the discovery}} of the role of spatial frequencies in psychological behaviour linked to visual perception. As with cameras and cine-cameras, one can obtain works that of undoubted pleasantness also with electronic microscopes and computers. Some products which are considered artistic and others coming from some scientific subjects which utilize fractals, Penrose <b>parquets,</b> electronic microscope and painting obtained by light diffusion were chosen as products of instruments that are the results of advanced technologies. Research aimed at proving the hypothesis that technological practices with different functions and applications lead to aesthetic results that it is the elements that mark the difference between the artistic and the aesthetic is still underway. These terms are difficult to quantify and this is the reason why in the present study the semantic differential has been used. The technique allows the analysis of affective meaning; hence the global significance of the stimuli in question...|$|R

40|$|As a large {{producer}} and consumer of wood building materials, China suffers product formaldehyde emissions (PFE) but lacks systematic investigations and basic data on Chinese standard emission tests (CST), so {{this paper presented}} a first effort on this issue. The PFE of fiberboards, particleboards, blockboards, floorings, and <b>parquets</b> manufactured in Beijing region were characterized by the perforator extraction method (PE), 9 - 11 L and 40 L desiccator methods (D 9, D 40), and environmental chamber method (EC) of the Chinese national standard GB 18580; based on statistics of PFE data, measurement uncertainties in CST were evaluated by the Monte Carlo method; moreover, PFE data correlations between tests were established. Results showed: (1) Different tests may give slightly different evaluations on product quality. In PE and D 9 tests, blockboards and <b>parquets</b> reached E 1 grade for PFE, which can be directly used in indoor environment; but in D 40 and EC tests, floorings and <b>parquets</b> achieved E 1. (2) In multiple tests, PFE data characterized by PE, D 9, and D 40 complied with Gaussian distributions, while those characterized by EC followed log-normal distributions. Uncertainties in CST were overall low, with uncertainties for 20 material-method combinations all below 7. 5 %, and the average uncertainty for each method under 3. 5 %, thus being acceptable in engineering application. A more complicated material structure and a larger test scale caused higher uncertainties. (3) Conventional linear models applied to correlating PFE values between PE, D 9, and EC, with R 2 all over 0. 840, while novel logarithmic (exponential) models can work better for correlations involving D 40, with R 2 all beyond 0. 901. This research preliminarily demonstrated the effectiveness of CST, where results for D 40 presented greater similarities to EC-the currently most reliable test for PFE, thus highlighting the potential of Chinese D 40 as a more practical approach in production control and risk assessment...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive.

No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge.
