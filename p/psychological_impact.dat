5|$|Even {{during the}} Cold War, the <b>psychological</b> <b>impact</b> of a {{battleship}} was significant. In 1946, USS Missouri was dispatched {{to deliver the}} remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region. In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS New Jersey stopped the firing. Gunfire from New Jersey later killed militia leaders.|$|E
5|$|The bombardments {{failed to}} cause {{significant}} physical damage, {{but had a}} major <b>psychological</b> <b>impact</b> on the residents of Sydney and Newcastle. Due to the inaccuracy of the submarines' range-finding equipment, coupled with the unstable firing platform of a submarine at sea, specific targeting was impossible. The intention of the submarine bombardment was to frighten {{the population of the}} target area.|$|E
5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the <b>psychological</b> <b>impact</b> of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E

5|$|The {{bombs and}} fire lances of the Jin {{were the only}} two weapons of the Jurchens that the Mongols were wary of facing. The Jurchen {{deployment}} of gunpowder was extensive, but it is not certain if the Mongols had acquired gunpowder from the Jurchens before this point. Herbert Franke maintains that gunpowder was in the arsenal of both combatants, but Turnbull believes that only the Jurchens made use of it. The Mongols loaded their catapults with large stones or bombs of gunpowder, which were fired at the Jin fortifications. The barrage inflicted casualties in the city and had a <b>psychological</b> <b>impact</b> on the soldiers operating the Jurchen trebuchets.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rebels}} did reach their targets, they {{experienced}} further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten {{by a small}} garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attempted to attack the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant <b>psychological</b> <b>impact,</b> leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Castillo Armas {{had begun}} to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited {{material}} success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant <b>psychological</b> <b>impact.</b> On 25 June, {{the same day that}} he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that {{if it were not for}} U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the {{outbreak}} {{coincided with the}} deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, <b>psychological</b> <b>impact,</b> or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{proceeded}} {{to clear the}} bunkers. They utilized flamethrower teams, which had a visible <b>psychological</b> <b>impact</b> on the fort's garrison. At one point, the Egyptians, {{with the help of}} a wounded Israeli prisoner, managed to secure a bunker by convincing the panicked Israelis inside to come out and surrender. Soon after losing contact with the fort, the Israelis attempted to reach it once more. By this time, Malhov was dead. A group of tanks from Baluza advanced to Lahtzanit, but the Sa'iqa company occupying the firing ramp managed to destroy two tanks, forcing the remainder to retreat. Another group of tanks and half-tracks tried to break through the southern isolation force, but were ambushed and withdrew after losing a tank.|$|E
5|$|Trew {{contends that}} the capture of {{northern}} Caen had a <b>psychological</b> <b>impact</b> on the French population, convincing them the Allies were there to stay and that the liberation of France could not be far off. By Operation Charnwood's conclusion, Allied losses since 6 June had amounted to over 30,000 men, excluding {{those who had been}} evacuated due to sickness and those suffering from battle exhaustion. Buckley believes Charnwood to have been a good idea but one that proved better in concept than in execution, influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group to produce results. Copp wrote that the broad-based assault plan across the entire front worked, preventing the Germans bringing to bear superior firepower on any one formation.|$|E

The economics variable that changes is only the working hour. The psychological indicators namely stress, frustration, anxiety, anger, denial, shyness, and grief also experienced changes...|$|R
40|$|Recently, rapid {{development}} of the Klang Valley has tended to squeeze settlement developments into fragile areas, particularly flood plains, due to the limited supply of suitable non-hazardous land. Developments on these flood plains will {{be exposed to the}} risk of flooding. The Klang Valley is well known for its serious problems with flash floods: they generally occur four to five times a year and sometimes more often. Two to three hours of heavy rain is enough to cause the river in the Klang Valley to reach its peak discharge. Flash floods have led to intangible <b>psychological</b> <b>impacts</b> on the effected residents. This research will discuss the <b>psychological</b> <b>impacts</b> of flash flooding in two residential areas with different levels of living community and different housing constructions. The first is the properly planned settlement of TTDI Jaya and the second is the squatter settlement of Kampung Haji Abdullah Hukom.

The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua; as a result, they had a limited payload. A large number of them substituted dynamite or Molotov cocktails for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.|$|E

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 114 - 116). Although Fuzzy Logic is not new, it is however {{only since}} 2004 that an axiomatic {{theory has been}} created that has all the desirable effects of Fuzzy Logic.

Within this thesis we aim to utilize credibility theory to model the <b>psychological</b> <b>impacts</b> of market participants on European options. Specifically this is done by modifying the approach that was originally taken by Black and Scholes. The Hew model, which {{is known as the}} fuzzy drift parameter model, begins by replacing the deterministic drift within Brownian motion with a fuzzy parameter.

A phenomenon which is rarely touched upon {{is that of the}} difficult employee in a subordinate position who directs his or her workplace incivility towards the manager (in this paper referred to as the Bottom Up Employee). Eight managers were interviewed to gather and present qualitative data on the perceptions by mangers of a difficult employee within the workplace, the direct <b>psychological</b> <b>impacts</b> on coworkers and managers and the indirect <b>psychological</b> <b>impacts</b> on innocent bystanders caused by the constant contact or indirect relationship with the Bottom Up Employee, respectively, and the best practices to employ within an organization to handle the Bottom up Employee. The results of the interviews confirmed the existence of the Bottom Up Employee and the devastating impacts he or she can have on the manager. The consensus from those managers who dealt firsthand with the Bottom Up Employee was to dismiss rather than to retain the Bottom Up Employee.
