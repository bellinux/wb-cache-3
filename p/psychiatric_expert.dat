2500|$|The Leopold and Loeb case raised, in a well-publicized trial, Darrow's lifelong {{contention}} that psychological, physical, and environmental influences—not a conscious choice {{between right and}} wrong—control human behavior.

When someone tries to go against a certain law or custom that is forbidden, he wrote, he should feel a sense of revulsion. As neither Leopold nor Loeb had a working emotional system, they did not feel revolted.|$|E
