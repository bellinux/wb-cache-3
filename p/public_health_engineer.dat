40|$|Inadequate or {{improper}} {{collection and}} disposal of liquid waste leads to pollution of surface and groundwater and pose major threats to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and community well being. The emergence of big cities and industries has typically demanded centralised collection, treatment and disposal systems for liquid wastes. Most cities in developed countries have reticulated sewerage systems which collect and treat the wastes to acceptable standards. In fact a majority of municipal authorities and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>engineers</b> consider the reticulated sewerage system with a modern high technology treatment system and disposal facility as the only suitable approach to liquid waste for a municipal area. Such systems require continuous and plentiful supply of water {{along with all the}} capital intensive infrastructure necessary for treatment and these conditions are not always easily fulfilled. Developing countries and smaller more isolated communities find the cost of providing such facilities to achieve the necessary <b>public</b> <b>health</b> requirements prohibitively high. In rural and semi-rural and particularly remote areas a centralised system generally costs much more on a per capita basis than a locally based independent system of liquid waste. disposal. In this context there are now a variety of options for wastewater treatment, disposal and reuse. Such systems can produce an effluent quality equal to or better than a conventional treatment plant. The major concern for municipal authorities and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>engineers</b> is to dispose of the waste with minimum nuisance and health problems and at a price that can be managed within capital and recurrent budgets. From {{the point of view of}} a local community there are questions of the affordability of the chosen system for them, but also wider and deeper issues of community development and control over technologies that have the potential to influence the dynamics, form and autonomy of the society into which they are introduced. There are now growing environmental and social pressures to consider all the possibilities for reusing wastes and to begin introducing systems which are of a sustainable nature.

40|$|Once central {{figures in}} American <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> {{waterworks}} <b>engineers</b> {{are no longer}} involved in many decisions made about the public water supplies.

Sensing a potentially divisive issue, two leaders of the profession, Abel Wolman and Linn Enslow, took steps they hoped would prevent a rift within the profession and allow waterworks engineering to continue its association with the wider <b>public</b> <b>health</b> community. Although the leaders saw the fluoridation issue differently, neither encouraged the profession to consider it openly or to take up the broader question of what limits, if any, should be placed on treating water supplies to meet human needs. Instead, they opted to locate authority for fluoridation outside the waterworks profession with dentists, doctors, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> administrators.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fine substrate sediments {{are considered to be}} important in the management of urban river systems. Urban construction activities have been reported to increase sediment loads causing the temporary siltation of channel substrates within the urban area. Nevertheless fine sediment derived from urban areas frequently carry toxic material well in excess of background concentration levels. While the soluble phase of heavy metals and the importance of their association with suspended sediment has received considerable attention, longer term studies of fine urban river-bed sediments are limited. Furthermore studies of heavy pollutants in active stream sediments, below mine waste tips, have shown the channel substrate can provide a long term store for heavy metals in association with fine sediments. This thesis investigates the variety of impacts that urbanisation has upon the sedimentation of gravel bed rivers. A freeze coring technique and infIltration baskets have been used to study the textural-geochemical properties of fme matrix sediment and its development within an urban river-bed framework, within and below a number of contrasting urban catchments in the U. K. Complex urban hydrological and sedimentological regimes are shown to have a variable influence upon matrix sedimentation. The actual volume of matrix present within the urbanised substrate is influenced by the degree of urbanisation within the catchment. Furthermore this sediment is finer in size and associated heavy metal concentrations are well in excess of natural background levels. Although heavy metal levels do correlate slightly with textural characteristics, the presence of maximum concentrations at depth in the substrate indicate possible mobilisation of metals within the urbanised river-bed. The temporal behaviour of matrix development within an urbanised substrate is shown to differ from natural river-beds. Despite high suspended sediment concentrations the magnitude of the potential rate of supply is lower, by 50 percent, and dominated by organic material. This sediment also contains elevated heavy metal cocnentrations. This contrasts to the inorganic sediment ingress of natural river substrates. It is concluded that fine matrix sediments within urban gravel bed rivers should be at least of concern to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>engineers,</b> water authorities and conservationists...|$|R
40|$|In this issue: Field {{training}} {{activities of the}} Communicable Disease Center. The Communicable Disease Center, with a background of successful achievements in training workers for the fields of malaria and rodent-borne disease control, has established several regional field-training centers during 1946, 1947, and 1948, in order to more effectively assist all the States with practical training (internship type) of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> personnel. These regional training centers established through the cooperative effort of State and local health departments are located as follows: Southeastern section of U. S. -Atlanta, Columbus, Albany, and Savannah, Ga.; Northeastern section of U. S. - Albany and Troy, N. Y.; Midwestern section of U. S. - Cincinnati, Ohio, and Topeka, Kans.; Western or Rocky Mountain section - Denver, Colo. Presented in this Bullet in are short summaries -prepared by Training Division training officers- of field training courses carried on during the past 2 years. Reference to these articles will develop the point that this practical training falls into two categories. (l) In-service training for CDC personnel; and insect and rodent control training for foreign visitors who have taken academic courses at the universities here in the United States, and who desire {{to participate in the}} application of these <b>public</b> <b>health</b> principles about which they have studied. (2) Field training of both professional and nonprofessional personnel for nearly all types of workers employed by local, State, or Federal health authorities. These include <b>health</b> officers, sanitary <b>engineers,</b> sanitarians (professional grade), and health educators; and in the nonprofessional category, sanitary inspectors, sanitarians for milk and food sanitation control, rodent- and insect-borne disease control, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> department records personnel. The field training centers have been strategically located with the thought of using them as focal points from which assistance in training could be rendered to States that already have established, or intend to develop, field training facilities of their own. Many States, including Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, California, and Michigan, have developed, with financial assistance from certain foundations, effective field-{{training activities}}. Others {{are in the process of}} doing so. It is the aim of the Training Division to help all the States- by loan of personnel and by furnishing training aids such as motion pictures, film strips, manuals, and equipment- to develop the most essential facilities, in order that these 50, 000 people mentioned by Dr. Scheele may be quickly trained and started on their important work of preventing disease through well-conceived and efficiently executed programs in local health departments. In the following brief summaries, several of the training officers at headquarters of the Training Division in Atlanta and at regional training centers throughout the country have outlined the organization and conduct of the different types of field training. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that without the sympathetic and enthusiastic support of the directors of these local and State health departments where training activities are under way, no effective field training can be carried on by the <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> Service.
