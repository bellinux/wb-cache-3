The behavior of stochastic resonance (SR) in direct-modulated semiconductor laser systems is investigated in this article. Considering the carrier and <b>photon</b> <b>noises</b> and the cross-correlation between the two noises, the power spectrum of the photon density and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the modulated laser system were calculated using the linear approximation method. We found that the SR always appears in the dependence of the SNR upon the bias current density, and is strongly affected by the cross-correlation coefficient of the carrier and <b>photon</b> <b>noises,</b> the frequency of modulation signal and the photon lifetime in the laser cavity.

50|$|Visual {{information}} in optical systems is inhibited by the {{temporal and spatial}} attributes of the sensory input, and by the biophysical properties of the neuronal circuits. How neural circuits encode behaviorally relevant information {{is dependent on the}} computational capacity of the nervous system with relation to the ambient conditions the organisms normally operate in. H1 neurons are proven to be very efficient encoders of information via their high resilience to stimulus noise from external sources. The operational and encoding processes of sensory pathways are often negatively affected by both external noise (relating to the stimulus) and internal noise (imperfect physiological processes); however, the activity of H1 is unaffected by <b>photon</b> <b>noise.</b> Instead, neuronal noise intrinsic to the H1 neural architecture is the limiting factor for accurate responses to stimuli. This dramatically reduces the noise of H1 electrophysiological readings, and provides the reliability necessary for accurate study conclusions.|$|E

The <b>photon</b> counting <b>noise</b> has contributions from the light which is sent in through the input ports {{as well as the}} vacuum modes at sideband frequencies generated by the gravitational waves. The minimum detectable gravity wave amplitude depends on the frequency of the wave as well as the squeezing and recycling parameters.
