5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10â€¯Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more <b>power.</b> <b>Battery</b> life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E

25|$|Green Lantern vol. 4 #45 and 46 {{depicts the}} battle between the Sinestro Corps and the Star Sapphires. During the conflict, the {{conversion}} crystals are compromised and the Sinestro Corps members inside are released. Kryb immediately abandons the battle to see to her children; she is followed by Sapphire Miri Riam and the two eventually reach Kryb's planet to find her children are gone. Kryb begs Miri to help her find her children promising to return to Zamaron of her own free will if Miri helps her. Miri senses that Kryb's love for her children is genuine and, {{despite the fact that}} Miri is repulsed by Kryb, agrees to help her. Back on Zamaron the battle takes an unexpected turn when deceased Sinestro Corps members resurrected as Black Lantern arrive. Carol Ferris and Sinestro are forced to work together until Hal Jordan and the Indigo Tribe arrive. The battle rages on until two black rings head for the violet Central <b>Power</b> <b>Battery,</b> bonding to the two crystallized lovers inside (who are Prince Khufu and his consort Chay-ara; the original forms of Hawkman and Hawkgirl). The two are transformed into Black Lanterns and their escape causes the battery to explode, causing widespread devastation to the planet and freeing the Predator. The damage is so great that the Sapphires are forced to abandon the planet to the Black Lanterns, fulfilling the Book of the Black's prophecy.

25|$|The {{original}} Star Sapphire's {{powers are}} vast. She {{is equipped with}} an arsenal of weapons, including a replicate Zamaron star sapphire, of unknown origin. She also {{has a variety of}} personal powers, though whether they stem from herself or her personal armament is unclear. She is also able to access the memories of the Zamorans regarding the Star Sapphire gem, such as the experiences of other wearers. As with the powers of the woman bearing the title of Star Sapphire, the limitations of the Star Sapphire gem are also unclear. Psychologically, the women serving as Star Sapphire have displayed a bizarre preoccupation with gender, suspected of reflecting a pathological fear of men. They also have had a less than accurate grasp of the variations in physics between dimensions. They are sometimes foiled primarily due to their own overconfidence. The Star Sapphire gems used to power the original incarnations of Star Sapphire were used by the Zamarons to create the main violet <b>Power</b> <b>Battery.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{that mission}} the Zamarons {{contacted}} Carol Ferris on Earth, and reveal {{to her that}} the Predator was on the planet. While searching for the violet emotional entity, Carol travels to Las Vegas where she locates the Predator, now inhabiting the body of a man who is infatuated with a woman who does not even know who he is, and defeats it alongside Larfleeze and Hal who also had come searching for the love entity. The three then take the Predator back to Zamaron, however when Carol discovers the intentions of the Zamarons, she argues that the Guardians' technology that the Zamarons-based the battery on can be powered by the ambient love in the universe and refused to deliver the Predator. Upon hearing Carol's words, the Zamaron Queen Aga'po used the last of her life force to charge the Central <b>Power</b> <b>Battery,</b> leaving her title of Queen of the Star Sapphires to Carol.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the final}} issue in the storyline, the Zamarons are shown to have removed the Star Sapphire from their sister-in-arms at the cost of her life. The Zamarons agree that Jordan was right in showing how the Star Sapphire's power is too {{overwhelming}} to one host. The farther {{from the center of the}} emotional spectrum, the greater the influence a powered light has over its bearer (a plot element which would again become significant at the opposite end of the spectrum with the Red Lanterns). The Zamarons claim they could rectify the problem by taking a page from the Book of Oa. They are shown transforming the Star Sapphire into a violet power ring which they place on a pedestal along with a violet <b>power</b> <b>battery.</b> In discussion, they also describe how they'd been focused on love so long that they were almost like the emotionless Guardians.

30|$|Regarding the two key {{barriers}} above, {{there are}} two corresponding important research problems {{that need to be}} solved. The first one is battery technology and industry construction, where it is necessary to reduce the cost and enhance the performance of <b>power</b> <b>batteries.</b> New materials and structures are among the most important study directions. Only after the major breakthrough in these aspects, can the vigorous development of EV come, and can the issues of its application be solved finally. The manufacturing methods, energy management system, package technology and re-use or re-purposing of <b>power</b> <b>batteries</b> have important significance, too.

40|$|In {{dealing with}} the {{increment}} in environment pollution and source consumption, {{research has focused on}} the application of renewable energy source. <b>Batteries,</b> especially <b>power</b> <b>batteries,</b> which has great prospects in the fields, are among the attention.

In order to develop and apply battery in a more efficient and appropriate method, their response to various operating conditions must be understood. Knowing the battery temperature variation in electric vehicles (EVs) is very important issue. Temperature depends on ambient temperature, charging current and charging time. Recently neural networks have been successful used for power system applications. In the literature, there are many neural networks for power system applications. However, Back Propagation (BP) has demonstrated better capabilities. This paper presents neural network for temperature estimation of <b>power</b> <b>batteries.</b> The main contribution of this paper is consideration of nonuniform temperature field and the temperature effect in batteries. In addition, the results of estimation and actual measured values are compared, proving the feasibility and accuracy of the method...|$|R
2500|$|Sins of the Star Sapphire, {{running in}} Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issues #29â€“32 (December 2008 â€“ March 2009), {{is the story}} arc in which the {{formation}} of the Star Sapphires is shown. It both introduces important members of the new corps and reveals distinguishing features which set them apart from their peers. At the beginning of the arc, the Zamarons have crafted their own main <b>power</b> <b>battery.</b> Inside of their main battery are the crystallized [...] "Adam and Eve" [...] skeletons and Star Sapphire gem found when they first arrived on Zamaron. While experimenting with their new means of controlling the violet light of love, the Zamarons (perhaps intentionally) attracted the attention of the Guardians on Oa. Perceiving their visible power fluctuations as a threat, Guardian Scar decides to act on the display rather than wait and [...] "hope for the best." [...] In response, she requests a diplomatic audience with Zamaron's Queen Aga'po. Two other Guardians accompany her, while Lanterns Guy Gardner, Arisia, and Sodam Yat serve as escorts. While on Zamaron, the delegates from Oa find that the Zamarons are in possession of a number of yellow power rings that were left unclaimed after the Sinestro Corps War plotline. The rings are shown being drained of their power (which Arisia interprets as a deliberate display of how the same could be done to green power rings). More importantly, the delegates also discover that a number of female Sinestro Corps members have also been collected after the war and are imprisoned in violet crystals.|$|E
