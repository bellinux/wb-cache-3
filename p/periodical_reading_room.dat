5000|$|Cone LibraryApart from {{residence}} halls, the Cone Library is {{the first}} single purpose academic building constructed on campus. [...] Raymond Whitaker designed the building that was constructed by H. George Schloemer in 1958 for $250,000. The 186 by 40 ft Modern structure follows an irregular rectangular plan and is dominated by large plate glass windows. The main facade of the building is divided into eight bays with the main entrance just off center. The entrance bay is set off by stone. The building's mottled red face brick is laid in American bond with a header course on every sixth course. Another dominate feature of the building are the deep eaves that overhang the walls. Along {{the upper part of}} the wall is a wide band of stone. The window lintels are likewise stone. There are also three basement level windows in each bay, save for the entrance bay. The east side of the south elevation is composed of solid brick with no windows. It features a decorative cut stone design that portrays Marycrest's insignia that is embedded in the wall. It was created by Sister Mary Clarice Ebert, CHM who taught in the college's art department. The front section of the main level of the interior was divided into three large rooms. They were separated by wood and glass panel walls. The <b>periodical</b> <b>reading</b> <b>room</b> was on the north, the main desk and card catalog was in the center, and the reference reading room was on the south. The stacks were located across the back of the building. The basement originally housed the student union in the south half and an audio-visual room, alumnae office, and receiving room on the north. [...] Walsh HallRaymond Whitaker was already in retirement when he designed Walsh Hall with the assistance of Kenneth Wagner. It was completed in 1964 by O. Jorgensen & Sons of Clinton for $650,000. [...] The four-story structure housed science classrooms and laboratories. The 162 by 72 ft building follows a rectangular plan with its main facade on the west elevation. The exterior brick is laid in American bond with a header course set between every fifth course. Parapet walls capped with stone rise above a flat roof. Brick piers separate the bays. The main facade is five bays while the side elevations are eight bays. The west elevation is composed of the main entrance in the center bay with windows similar to others found in the building above it. The center bay is flanked by two bays with a single column of windows centered in the bay. There is a combination of single, paired and triple window units in the building. The east elevation features window groupings similar to those found on the north elevation. The south elevation features an unusual arrangement of windows and stone panels that form a cross in the center bay. The clustered window groups have stone sills, frames and mullions. The stone beltcourses on each floor double as window lintels.|$|E

40|$|The Library of Congress has {{a wealth}} of {{information}} on North American Indian people but does not have a separate collection or section devoted to them.

50|$|Loa's {{work can}} broadly {{be divided into}} three phases. During his early career, he wrote {{primarily}} classical Chinese poetry. On a sojourn as a doctor in a Japanese hospital in Amoy (now called Xiamen), a treaty port in China, he became acquainted {{with the work of}} Chinese May Fourth writers such as Lu Hsun. Although his stay in China seems to have been depressing, he returned to Taiwan with the intention to contribute to Taiwan's cultural scene. He opened a <b>reading</b> <b>room</b> in his clinic where he provided Chinese vernacular fiction as well as Japanese <b>periodicals.</b> This <b>reading</b> <b>room</b> allowed him to mentor several important writers of the late Japanese colonial period. Most of his writing during this second period was nativist in his choice of themes and satirical in form. Through several short stories written during the 1920s and early 1930s, Loa satirized the brutality of colonial policemen, the indifference of the populace, and the impotence of native intellectuals. During the third period, Loa became more nativist in orientation and actively experimented with writing in Taiwanese Hokkien. Although these experiments were not entirely successful, they expressed an emerging Taiwanese national consciousness upon which later Taiwanese writers would build.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being UP's training and research centre in the medical sciences, the School {{is also the most}} important health care centre in the region. It is an intellectual workshop, where research and daily practice, teaching and the provision of health care services enhance each other's efficiency. This is also the origin of the School's mission: to create a bridge between theoretical sciences and practice through training highly qualified specialists; a bridge with two pillars, scientific research of an international level on the one hand, and the provision of medical treatment as the most important duty. The two pillars are connected by teaching, where the main goal is to train the best possible specialists who can extend the School's influence over to the broader region, the entire Transdanubian area, and even beyond the borders of the country. The Medical School integrates 21 basic science and preclinical departments, and 31 clinical departments equipped with educational and research tools of the highest European standards. The central educational building houses a large Assembly Hall, four auditoriums, several seminar rooms and student laboratories. The Central Library subscribes to more than 400 journals and <b>periodicals.</b> Its <b>reading</b> <b>room</b> can seat 200 students.
