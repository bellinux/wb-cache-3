5|$|The University of Colorado's School of <b>Pharmacy</b> (SOP) {{began in}} 1911 as a {{division}} of the School of Medicine in Boulder. It became an independent college in 1913 and a school in 1957. It received its accreditation in 1938–1939 and awarded a B.S. in <b>Pharmacy</b> degree in 1995–1996 when it received a full accreditation status awarding the Doctor of <b>Pharmacy</b> (PharmD) degree by the ACPE. In 1986, the School of <b>Pharmacy</b> was administratively transferred to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. The physical transfer from Boulder and final consolidation of faculty, staff and students was completed between August and November 1992. In 2008, the school moved to the Anschutz Medical Campus, and offers medical and graduate degrees in <b>pharmacy,</b> the pharmaceutical sciences, molecular toxicology, and pharmaceutical outcomes research. 30% of its class is from out of state. In 2009, the NIH awarded $7,310,389 and $19,189,543 in grants towards the SOP and Pharmacology department, respectively. In 2011, the school will move into its new building, the Skaggs School of <b>Pharmacy</b> and Pharmaceutical Sciences which will also be located on the Anschutz Medical Campus.|$|E

40|$|Class of 2016 AbstractsObjectives: To {{compare the}} minimum {{vaccination}} age {{to receive an}} influenza vaccine of rural and urban <b>pharmacies.</b> Rural <b>pharmacies</b> are defined in all Arizona <b>pharmacies</b> in counties other than Pima or Maricopa, urban <b>pharmacies</b> are defined as all <b>pharmacies</b> within the Tucson city limits. Methods: <b>Pharmacies</b> were called for a phone interview asking what the minimum age someone needs to be to receive an influenza vaccination from their store is. <b>Pharmacies</b> were called during their operating hours during a 4 -week period {{at the end of}} January and early February. Results: 269 <b>pharmacies</b> were included in the study. <b>Pharmacies</b> consisted of 153 rural <b>pharmacies</b> and 116 urban <b>pharmacies.</b> The median minimum vaccination age for both rural and urban <b>pharmacies</b> was 8. Overall, there was found to be {{no significant difference between the}} minimum vaccination age between rural and urban <b>pharmacies</b> (p = 0. 242). Conclusions: The minimum age to receive an influenza appears to be similar between rural and urban <b>pharmacies...</b>|$|R

40|$|US <b>pharmacies</b> tend to {{be located}} at intersections of major cross streets {{throughout}} a city, while {{in the case of}} Mexican border cities <b>pharmacies</b> are clustered close to US - Mexico border crossings. Presumably {{this is due to the}} volume of US clients who frequent the <b>pharmacies.</b> Although the precise number of border crossings to purchase medications is unclear, it is thought to be significant. In the past, patient-based surveys were the primary source for information regarding US residents crossing the border into Mexico for prescription medications. The current study examines the distribution of <b>pharmacies</b> throughout Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, recording the change in the number of <b>pharmacies</b> over a 15 -year period and suggesting the scale of US residents who use Mexican <b>pharmacies.</b> Field research was conducted in 1996 and 2011.

40|$|Background: Private {{health care}} {{providers}} are largely the first point of contact for Tuberculosis (TB) patients, who either undergo treatment from private practitioners or buy medicines on their own from private <b>pharmacies.</b> Aims: This study assessed the availability, sale and magnitude of anti-tuberculosis drugs dispensing through private <b>pharmacies.</b> Methodology: The present cross sectional study was conducted among private <b>pharmacies</b> located along the national highway from Thalassery to Payyannur in the Kannur district of Kerala, India. A total of 38 private <b>pharmacies</b> located along the national highway were included. Results: The duration that anti–TB drugs had been on sale showed that 74. 3 % of <b>pharmacies</b> had started to sell these drugs only less than ten years ago.
