Although a transfer of shares in the WHH companies would have required State approval under the rules in force at the time for <b>protecting</b> <b>state</b> assets, the shares in Jinjia were not covered. When Peregrine collapsed, and transferred its Jinjia shares, Groupe Danone became majority owner. Zong has alleged that this transfer of ownership was a bad-faith takeover by stealth.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the traditional security discourse which sees security as focused on <b>protecting</b> <b>state</b> interests, human security proponents believe that Anti-personnel mines could not be viable weapons of war due to the massive collateral damage they cause, their indiscriminate nature and persistence after conflict. In particular, they argue that Anti-personnel mines differ from most weapons, which have to be aimed and fired since they {{have the potential to}} kill and maim long after the warring parties have ceased fighting. The United Nations has reckoned that landmines are at least ten times more likely to kill or injure a civilian after a conflict than a combatant during hostilities. The effects are also long-lasting. The ICBL estimates that anti-personnel mines were the cause of 5,751 casualties in 2006. Whereas traditionally, states would justify these negative impacts of mines due to the advantage they give on the battlefield, under the human security lens, this is untenable as the wide-ranging post-conflict impact on the day-to-day experience of individuals outweighs the military advantage.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel scheme of {{feed-forward}} control and its reversal for <b>protecting</b> quantum <b>state</b> against decoherence. Before the noise channel our pre-weak measurement and feed-forward are just {{to change the}} <b>protected</b> <b>state</b> into the state almost immune to the noise channel, and after the channel our reversed operations and post-weak measurements are just to restore the <b>protected</b> <b>state.</b> Unlike most previous state protection schemes, ours only concerns the noise channel and does not care about the <b>protected</b> <b>state.</b> We show that our scheme can effectively <b>protect</b> unknown <b>states,</b> nonorthogonal states and entangled states against amplitude damping noise. Our scheme has dramatic merits of <b>protecting</b> quantum <b>states</b> against heavy amplitude damping noise, and can perfectly protect some specific nonorthogonal states in an almost deterministic way, which might be found some applications in current quantum communication technology. And it is most important that our scheme is experimentally available with current technology...|$|R

Its missions are to protect the constitutional order, sovereignty, territorial integrity and military potential of Georgia from illegal acts of special services and individuals of foreign countries; to prevent violent and unconstitutional change of order and state authority. Further it is to ensure economic security and fight terrorism on national and international level, transnational organized crime and international crime as well as carry out measures towards prevention, detection and suppression of corruption.

50|$|Leičiai were war-like {{servants}} of a ruler, the staff enforcing his authority. Their duties were likely war-related, among which possibly were breeding riding horses, providing roadmen, <b>protecting</b> <b>state</b> borders. They were a {{possession of the}} monarch, that is, subordinates {{to the state and}} not to nobles. The first mention of them in written sources is known from 1407, when Grand Duke Vytautas granted an estate and its staff, including leytey, to Manvydas, then an elder of Vilnius. Later Grand Dukes Alexander Jagiellon and Sigismund I the Old used to transfer royal estates to nobles for a temporary administration in exchange for cash, which was needed to finance continuous wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. These contracts are the major primary source on leičiai. Their name was rendered in various forms: leythey, leyty, leytten, litten, лейти, лейци, лейтеве, лойти, людей лейтъскихъ, etc. These forms are considered to be the same as in у Лейтахъ - in Leičiai (administrative area).|$|E

5000|$|Formed in 1965 {{during the}} {{administration}} of Guatemalan President Enrique Peralta Azurdia, the PMA performed both police and military functions and protected elite interests. Although independent from the military police, the PMA functioned under the direct supervision of the Military of Guatemala and the military intelligence directorate (G-2). Detachments of the PMA were active throughout the country during the conflict, maintaining control over the rural populace and protecting the landowning elite. In addition to regular police functions, the PMA's protection duties included security for both state and private enterprises, and the PMA was divided into two primary segments; one <b>protecting</b> <b>state</b> enterprises (electric plants, train stations, etc.), known as the [...] "ordinaria," [...] {{and the other for}} private enterprises (known as the [...] "extraordinaria").
