5000|$|The Confederacy, such as President Jefferson Davis, {{believed}} {{from the}} beginning in [...] "King Cotton": British dependence on cotton for its large textile industry would lead to diplomatic recognition and mediation or military intervention. The Confederates had not sent out agents ahead of time to ascertain if the King Cotton policy would be effective. Instead, by popular demand, not government action, shipments of cotton to Europe were ended in spring 1861.

50|$|After {{the short}} truce in 1802-1803 the European wars resumed and {{continued}} until {{the defeat of}} Napoleon in 1814. The war caused American relations with both Britain and France to deteriorate rapidly. There was grave risk of war with one or the other. With Britain supreme on the sea, and France on the land, the war developed into a struggle of blockade and counterblockade. This commercial war peaked in 1806 and 1807. Britain's Royal Navy shut down most European harbors to American ships unless they first traded through British ports. France declared a <b>paper</b> <b>blockade</b> of Britain (which it lacked a navy to enforce) and seized American ships that obeyed British regulations. The Royal Navy needed large numbers of sailors, and saw the U.S. merchant fleet as a haven for British sailors.|$|E

50|$|Early in the Civil War—a small, {{privately owned}} {{schooner}} -- {{worked out of}} Mobile, Alabama, under Confederate <b>papers</b> as a <b>blockade</b> runner. Few details of these operations have been found; {{but we do know}} that, on the night of 11 October 1862, she succeeded in slipping through the Federal blockade off Mobile Bay and sailed to Cuba laden with cotton. After arriving at Havana, Cuba, six days later, she delivered her cargo and filled up with lead, tin, medicine, wine, coffee, and other items needed by the South. On the evening of 14 November, as she was attempting to return to Mobile, Ariel was detected and captured by the Union screw steamer Huntsville. Sent to Key West, Florida, for adjudication, the schooner was eventually condemned as a lawful prize and was purchased by the Union Navy from the Key West prize court on 24 July 1863.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have lived}} long enough, and have seen {{too much of}} men and things, to fancy my country and countrymen right in all their transactions, merely because newspapers, members of congress, and fourth of July orators, are pleased to affirm the doctrine. No one can go much to sea without reading with great {{distrust}} many of the accounts, in the journals of the day, of the grievous wrongs done the commerce of America by the authorities {{of this or that}} port, the seizure of such a ship, or the imprisonment of some particular set of officers and men. As a rule, it is safer to assume that the afflicted parties deserve all that has happened to them, than to believe them immaculate; and, quite likely, much more, too. The habit of receiving such appeals to their sympathies, renders the good people of the republic peculiarly liable to impositions of this nature; and the mother who encourages those of her children who fetch and carry, will be certain to have her ears filled with complaints and tattle. Nevertheless, it is a fact beyond all dispute, that the commerce of the country was terribly depredated on by nearly all the European belligerents, between the commencement of the war of the French revolution and its close. So enormous were the robberies thus committed on the widely extended trade of this nation, under one pretence or another, as to give a colouring of retributive justice, if not of moral right, to the recent failures of certain States among us to pay their debts. Providence singularly avenges all wrongs by its unerring course; and I doubt not, if the facts could be sifted to the bottom, it would be found the devil was not permitted to do his work, in either case, without using materials supplied by the sufferers, in some direct or indirect manner, themselves. Of all the depredations on American trade just mentioned, those of the great sister republic, {{at the close of the}} last century, were among the most grievous, and were of a character so atrocious and bold, that I confess it militates somewhat against my theory to admit that France owns very little of the [...] "suspended debt;" [...] but I account for this last circumstance by the reparation she in part made, by the treaty of 1831. With England it is different. She drove us into a war by the effects of her orders in council and <b>paper</b> <b>blockades,</b> and compelled us to expend a hundred millions to set matters right. I should like to see the books balanced, not by the devil, who equally instigated the robberies on the high seas, and the [...] "suspension" [...] or [...] "repudiation" [...] of the State debts; but by the great Accountant who keeps a record of all our deeds of this nature, whether it be to make money by means of cruising ships, or cruising scrip. It is true, these rovers encountered very differently-looking victims, in the first place; but it is a somewhat trite remark, that the aggregate of human beings is pretty much the same in all situations. There were widows and orphans as much connected with the condemnation of prizes, as with the prices of condemned stock; and I do not see that fraud is any worse when carried on by scriveners and clerks with quills behind their ears, than when carried on by gentlemen wearing cocked hats, and carrying swords by their sides. On the whole, I am far from certain that the account-current of honesty is not slightly--honesty very slightly leavens either transaction--in favour of the non-paying States, as men do sometimes borrow with good intentions, and fail, from inability, to pay; whereas, in the whole course of my experience, I never knew a captor of a ship who intended to give back any of the prize-money, if he could help it.

40|$|Abstract The {{critical}} role of inappropriate inflammation is becoming accepted in many diseases that affect man, including cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, infection and cancer. This review proposes that cancer up-regulates the angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor through systemic oxidative stress and hypoxia mechanisms, thereby triggering chronic inflammatory processes to remodel surrounding tissue and subdue the immune system. Based on current literature and clinical studies on angiotensin receptor inhibitors, the <b>paper</b> concludes that <b>blockade</b> of the AT 1 receptor in synergy with cancer vaccines and anti-inflammatory agents should offer a therapy to regress most, if not all, solid tumours. With regard to cancer being a systemic disease, {{an examination of}} supporting evidence for a systemic role of AT 1 in relationship to inflammation in disease and injury {{is presented as a}} logical progression. The evidence suggests that regulation of the mutually antagonistic angiotensin II receptors (AT 1 and AT 2) is an essential process in the management of inflammation and wound recovery, and that it is an imbalance in the expression of these receptors that leads to disease. In consideration of cancer induced immune suppression, it is further postulated that the inflammation associated with bacterial and viral infections, is also an evolved means of immune suppression by these pathogens and that the damage caused, although incidental, leads to the symptoms of disease and, in some cases, death. It is anticipated that manipulation of the angiotensin system with existing anti-hypertensive drugs could provide a new approach to the treatment of many of the diseases that afflict mankind. </p...|$|R
40|$|NLRP 3 {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the key components of innate immunity. Upon activation, NLRP 3 forms a multiprotein complex called as the ‘inflammasome’ which leads to the activation of pro-inflammatory caspase- 1 which subsequently results in the formation of Interleukin (IL) - 1 β and IL- 18. Mutations in the NLRP 3 gene can lead to its constitutive activation resulting in an uncontrolled production of IL- 1 β. These mutations have been implicated in hereditary inflammatory diseases, often grouped under Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS, cryopyrin being an alternative name for NLRP 3). Paper I in this thesis presents the case of a patient with a long history of arthritis and antibiotic resistant fever, but without the typical symptoms of CAPS. The patient was a heterozygous carrier of two common polymorphisms, Q 705 K in NLRP 3 and C 10 X in CARD- 8. Experimental studies indicated elevated activity of caspase- 1 and IL- 1 β levels in the patient and a total clinical remission was achieved by IL- 1 β blockade. These two polymorphisms simultaneously occur in almost 4 % of the control population, suggesting the possibility of a genetic predisposition for inflammation in these individuals. We, therefore, investigated a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in paper II, and found that carrying the combined polymorphisms resulted in increased RA susceptibility and a more severe disease course. Hypothetically, this subgroup might benefit from IL- 1 β <b>blockade.</b> <b>Paper</b> III presents two patients: siblings, who did not fit into a typical CAPS phenotype. The inflammatory symptoms in both the patients appeared in adult life. A novel and functional M 299 V mutation in NLRP 3 was detected in the siblings who neither had common symptoms nor the same disease severity. Consequent with inflammasome activation, abnormally elevated caspase- 1 activity and IL- 1 β levels were seen. Patients in papers I and III highlight the risk of missing out such patients if attempting a very conventional diagnosis. Paper IV dissects the functional role of Q 705 K in NLRP 3 using THP- 1 cells in an in vitro model. Moderately elevated IL- 1 β and IL- 18 levels could be observed in the THP- 1 cells expressing Q 705 K, as compared to the wild type expressing cells, indicating a gain-of-function. Due to the presence of this alteration in healthy individuals it can be classified as a low-penetrance alteration. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanistic details of this polymorphism...|$|R
40|$|TEA is a {{classical}} blocker of K(+) channels. From mutagenesis studies, {{it has been}} shown that external blockade by TEA is strongly dependent upon the presence of aromatic residue at Shaker position 449 which is located near the extracellular entrance to the pore (Heginbotham, L., and R. MacKinnon. 1992. Neuron. 8 : 483 - 491). The data suggest that TEA interacts simultaneously with the aromatic residues of the four monomers. The determination of the 3 -D structure of the KcsA channel using X-ray crystallography (Doyle, D. A., J. M. Cabral, R. A. Pfuetzner, A. Kuo, J. M. Gulbis, S. L. Cohen, B. T. Chait, and R. MacKinnon. 1998. Science. 280 : 69 - 77) has raised some issues that remain currently unresolved concerning the interpretation of these observations. In particular, the center of the Tyr 82 side chains in KcsA (corresponding to position 449 in Shaker) forms a square of 11. 8 -A side, a distance which is too large to allow simultaneous interactions of a TEA molecule with the four aromatic side chains. In this <b>paper,</b> the external <b>blockade</b> by TEA is explored by molecular dynamics simulations of an atomic model of KcsA in an explicit phospholipid bilayer with aqueous salt solution. It is observed, in qualitative accord with the experimental results, that TEA is stable when bound to the external side of the wild-type KcsA channel (with Tyr 82), but is unstable when bound to a mutant channel in which the tyrosine residue has been substituted by a threonine. The free energy profile of TEA relative to the pore is calculated using umbrella sampling simulations to characterize quantitatively the extracellular blockade. It is found, in remarkable agreement with the experiment, that the TEA is more stably bound by 2. 3 kcal/mol to the channel with four tyrosine residues. In the case of the wild-type KcsA channel, TEA (which has the shape of a flattened oblate spheroid) acts as an ideal plug blocking the pore. In contrast, it is considerably more off-centered and tilted in the case of the mutant channel. The enhanced stability conferred by the tyrosine residues does not arise from Pi-cation interactions, but appears to be due to differences in the hydration structure of the TEA. Finally, it is shown that the experimentally observed voltage dependence of TEA block, which is traditionally interpreted in terms of the physical position of the TEA along the axis of the pore, must arise indirectly via coupling with the ions in the pore...|$|R
