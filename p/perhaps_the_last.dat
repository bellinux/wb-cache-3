25|$|As {{late as the}} 1960s {{there was}} still a hospital, post office, butcher, Red & White grocery store, general store, barbershop and several garages, {{including}} Royalite and BA stations on the trans-Canada highway and two garages in town operated by the Kuntz and Kraus families. The historic Queen's Hotel, built in 1884 and <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the major commercial structures of Main Street, burned to the ground in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The South Saxons {{fought off}} the West Saxons in 722 {{and again in}} 725. At {{the end of the}} 8th century, Ealdwulf was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{independent}} king of Sussex, after which Sussex and other southern kingdoms came increasingly under Mercian rule. Mercia's grip was shattered in 825 at the battle of Ellendun, after which Sussex and the other southern kingdoms came under the control of Wessex, which later grew into the kingdom of England.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} who call the USDA 'the last plantation.' An 'old line' department, USDA {{was one of the}} last federal {{agencies}} to integrate and <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> to include women and minorities in leadership positions. Considered a stubborn bureaucracy and slow to change, USDA is also perceived as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and socially disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{noteworthy}} curiosity {{that the}} opening of the Janus was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> act connected to the ancient religion in Rome: Procopius writes that in 536 CE, during the Gothic War, while general Belisarius was under siege in Rome, at night somebody opened the Janus Geminus stealthily, which had long stayed closed since 390, year on which Theodosius I's edict banned the ancient cults. Janus was faithful to his liminal role also in the marking of this last act.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{the sample}} {{standard}} deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (<b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 14 surviving fulmars), then instead {{of the sample}} standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is N instead of N-1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical software packages calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.|$|E

25|$|Of the 1,700-plus {{force of}} British troops and African auxiliaries, about 1,300 were killed, {{most of them}} Europeans, {{including}} field commanders Pulleine and Durnford. Only five Imperial officers survived, and the 52 officers lost was the most lost by any British battalion up to that time. Amongst those killed was Surgeon Major Peter Shepherd, a first-aid pioneer. The Natal Native Contingent lost some 400 men, and there were 240 lost from the group of 249 amaChunu African auxiliaries. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> to die was Gabangaye, the portly chief of the amaChunu Natal Native Contingent, who was given over to be killed by the udibi (porter or carrier) boys. The captured Natal Native Contingent soldiers were regarded as traitors by the Zulu and executed.|$|E
25|$|Among many {{memorial}} concerts nationwide, {{a memorial}} performance of The Dream of Gerontius was {{given at the}} Royal Albert Hall, at which John Coates and Frederick Ranalow sang with the Royal Choral Society. The Musicians' Benevolent Fund was first established as the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund for Musicians, and his figure became a presiding genius of twentieth-century English music. His particular association with the lyrics of A. E. Housman and the music of Elgar, and his death soon after the First World War, reinforce his embodiment of the lost Edwardian generation, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> in which his religious conviction could so thoroughly have endeared him to so many. At much {{the same time the}} Glasgow Orpheus Choir instituted a Gervase Elwes Silver Medal, and the Feis Ceoil in Dublin inaugurated its Gervase Elwes Memorial Cup. A choir named after him was established at Walsall. A portrait plaque by Arthur Vokes was set up in the centre of the village of Billing.|$|E
25|$|As late as 1964 Sivatte {{tried to}} {{maintain}} correct relations with Don Carlos Hugo, but the attempt backfired as {{significant number of}} Sivattistas, including Carles Feliu de Travy, left RENACE and re-integrated within Javierismo. The conversion was a serious blow to Sivatte, who made sure that the prince was a subversive leftist traitor and vehemently opposed his bid {{to take control of}} Carlism; this stand produced even sort of rapprochement between Sivatte and Fal Conde. Over time RENACE was getting more and more marginalized. Entirely failing to attract young activists, it was turning into a group of rapidly aging if not already senile dissenters. In 1970 it seemed reinvigorated when representatives of Juntas de Defensa and envoys of RENACE met in Estella to co-ordinate their activities; the meeting produced nothing but a few documents, eclipsed by what looked like impressive dynamics of the socialist-controlled Partido Carlista. In 1973, during the key annual Sivattista event, Aplec de Montserrat, only 150 participants did show up. During the same event next year Sivatte was detained and fined, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> sign of political recognition he has received in his life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> {{memory of}} <b>the</b> series is David Robinson {{retiring}} as a champion. In the clinching Game 6, Robinson had 13 points and 17 rebounds to complement Tim Duncan on the inside. In that game, the Spurs trailed {{at one point}} 72-63 before going on a 19-0 run to put the game away and take the series. Stephen Jackson's three pointer during the run held the lead permanently. The Spurs' win denied New Jersey from having both NBA and NHL titles in the same year.|$|R

500|$|At that time, {{it seemed}} a place in which {{anything}} could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors {{from all parts of}} Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: [...] "What Manchester does today, {{the rest of the world}} does tomorrow."•• Manchester's golden age was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{presence}} {{on social media}} has drawn analysis from journalists. Time named her [...] "Twitter's most outspoken (and beloved) commentator". The New York Times writer Jenna Wortham commended Cher on her social media usage, saying [...] "Most celebrities' social-media feeds feel painfully self-aware and thirsty... In her own way, Cher is an outlier, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user to stand at her digital pulpit and yell (somewhat) incomprehensibly, and be rewarded for it. Online, authenticity and originality are often carefully curated myths. Cher thrives on a version of nakedness and honesty that is rarely celebrated in the public eye." [...] Monica Heisey of The Guardian called Cher's Twitter profile [...] "a jewel in the bizarro crown of the internet", and stated, [...] "While many celebrities use Twitter for carefully crafted self-promotion, Cher just lets it all hang out." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{not often}} given the {{attention}} of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period. [...] The prolific Kunisada (1786–1865) had few rivals {{in the tradition of}} making portrait prints of courtesans and actors. [...] One of those rivals was Eisen (1790–1848), who was also adept at landscapes. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had. [...] His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular, especially his series of heroes from the Suikoden (1827–1830) and Chūshingura (1847). He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes—the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo era; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the Shogunate at the time.|$|E

500|$|Barrett made a final public {{acknowledgement}} of his musical past in 2002, his first since the 1970s, when he autographed 320 copies of photographer Mick Rock's book Psychedelic Renegades, which contained {{a number of}} photos of Barrett. Rock was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> person {{in the music industry}} with whom Barrett kept in contact. In 1971, Rock conducted the final interview of Barrett before his retirement from the music industry a few years later, and Barrett subsequently turned up on Rock's London doorstep [...] "four, maybe five times" [...] for a cup of tea and conversation through 1978, before Barrett moved back to Cambridge. They had not spoken in more than twenty years when Rock approached Barrett to autograph his photography book, and Barrett uncharacteristically agreed. Having reverted to his birth name [...] "Roger" [...] from his stage name [...] "Syd" [...] many years before, he had autographed the book simply [...] "Barrett." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 18th century saw the {{increased}} competition of the French workshops, both royal and private. [...] Weavers like Le Clerc, Leyniers, van den Hecke and de Vos maintained quality, {{but the last}} of the traditional Brussels tapestry ateliers closed {{at the time of the}} French Revolution, by which time tapestry was finally becoming less popular; Goya's designs for the royal factory in Spain were <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> major works in the medium.|$|E
2500|$|The GTR was amalgamated {{into the}} Canadian National Railway in 1920. [...] During the decades that followed, the CPR and the CNR {{continued}} {{to expand their}} competing hotel chains across the country. [...] The Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, built in 1958 over that city’s Central Station, was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> true railway hotel built in Canada.

[...] Both Dressen and Swift died during the year – Dressen in August because of a kidney infection, Swift in October due to cancer.
