5000|$|Typical of javari on an {{instrument}} with preferably long strings, {{is that on}} the soundboard the strings run over a wide bridge with a very flat parabolic curve. The curvature of the bridge {{has been made in}} a precise relation to the optimum level of playing, or more exact, a precise amplitude of each string. Any string, given length, density, pitch and tension, wants to be plucked within the limits of its elasticity, and so vibrate harmoniously with a steady pitch. When a string of a tanpura is plucked properly, it produces a tone with a certain amplitude that will slowly decrease as the tone fades out. In this gradual process, the string, moving up and down according to its frequency, will make a <b>periodic</b> <b>grazing</b> contact with the curved surface of the bridge. The exact grazing-spot will gradually shift up the sloping surface, {{as a function of the}} decreasing amplitude, finally dissolving into the rest-position of the open string. In this complex dynamic sonation process, the shifting grazing will touch upon micro-nodes on the string, exciting a wide range of harmonics in a sweeping mode. The desired effect is that of a cascading row of harmonics in a rainbow of sound. As an analogy, a properly shaped and adjusted javari is similar to the refraction of white light through a prism. When the prism is of good proportions and quality and used properly, the phenomenon should produce itself. [...] "The voice of an artist which is marked by a rich sound resembling that produced by two consonants played together, is often loosely known to have Javārī in it, although such use is arbitrary." ...|$|E

Using the existence condition derived, a set of parameter values is found that generates a double <b>grazing</b> <b>periodic</b> motion in the considered system. By extending the discontinuity mapping of one constraint surface to that of two constraint surfaces, the Poincaré map of the vibroimpact system is constructed in the proximity of the grazing point of a double <b>grazing</b> <b>periodic</b> orbit, which has a more complex form than that of the single <b>grazing</b> <b>periodic</b> orbit. The <b>grazing</b> bifurcation of the system is analyzed through the Poincaré map with clearance as a bifurcation parameter.

40|$|Abstract Grazing removal {{is widely}} used in grass-land management. Plant {{responses}} following grazing removal at different organizational levels, however, are not well understood. We examined plant responses at different stocking rates in an Inner Mongolia grassland ecosystem dominated by Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis. Our results indicated that plant response patterns differed significantly among stock-ing rates, {{at different levels of}} organization, and between wet and dry years. Community aboveground net primary production (ANPP) recovered more quickly at low and moderate stocking rates than those at high stocking rates. Response of aboveground net primary production (RANPP) was significantly posi-tively correlated with both individual biomass and density responses of L. chinensis. Overcompensation of L. chinensis after grazing removal contributed greatly to positive RANPP at the community level. Significant compensatory effects were found between the two dominant species and between dominant species and the remaining non-dominant species. Variation in precipitation significantly affected com-munity ANPP, relationships between community and species responses, and compensatory effects between species. Our study suggests that <b>periodic</b> <b>grazing</b> removal {{is likely to be a}} useful method for grassland management and that a combination of species with compensatory effects can be advantageous for reseed-ing practices in grassland restoration...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Audubon Nebraska, a state office of the National Audubon Society, {{purchased}} the 610 -acre O 2 ̆ 7 Brien Ranch located three miles south of Denton, Nebraska. The site, now called Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center (SCPAC), will be devoted to prairie education and restoration. The Center 2 ̆ 7 s size expanded to 626 acres in 2000 when the Wachiska Audubon Society bought an adjacent 16 -acre property on the northwest comer of the section. Historically, most of the ranch was never farmed, probably because of its hills and {{the large number of}} glacial boulders present in the soil. It {{is one of the largest}} native grasslands remaining in Lancaster County, containing nearly 500 acres of unplowed tall grass prairie. Other natural features include Spring Creek and its associated riparian zones, several wetlands, springs, ravines, and a mature bur oak woodland. Six cattle ponds have been constructed on site, two along Spring Creek. There is a 52 -acre crop field in the southeast comer, two small (3 ̆c 5 acres) abandoned alfalfa fields, and disturbed areas north and south of the ranch house. A century of cattle ranching has impacted the floristic composition of the prairie. Overgrazing on portions of several pastures has encouraged the spread of woody and exotic plant species. Large, resilient stands of excellent prairie, though, remain. A three-year research project catalogued more than 340 plant species (Kottas 2000). Current land management targets the removal of invasive and exotic plants - honey locust, Siberian elms, leafy spurge, and musk thistles being priorities - and the establishment of native flora. Because prairie developed naturally under <b>periodic</b> <b>grazing</b> of bison, elk, and other animals, grazing will continue with cattle, but with lower stocking rates than the previous owner 2 ̆ 7 s and a rotation system.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{a so-called}} corner-collision bifurcation in piecewise-smooth systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), {{for which a}} <b>periodic</b> solution <b>grazes</b> with {{a corner of the}} discontinuity set. It is shown under quite general circumstances that this leads to a normal form that is to lowest order a piecewise-linear map. This is the first generic derivation from ODE theory of the so-called C-bifurcation (or border collision) for piecewise-linear maps. The result contrasts with the equivalent results when a <b>periodic</b> orbit <b>grazes</b> with a smooth discontinuity set, which has recently been shown to lead to maps that have continuous first derivatives but not second. Moreover, it is shown how to calculate the piecewise-linear map for arbitrary dimensional systems, using only properties of the single periodic trajectory undergoing corner collision. The calculation is worked out for two examples, including a model for a commonly used power electronic converter where complex dynamics associated with corner collision was previously found numerically, but is explained analytically here for the first time...|$|R

40|$|It has {{recently}} been suggested {{that the use of}} a short-duration rotational grazing (SDG) system can significantly increase total beef production on rangelands. The <b>periodic</b> intense <b>grazing</b> pressure of the SDG system is assumed to retard maturation of the forage and stimulate forage growth. This combination of immature, high quality forage and greater total forage production should allow higher stocking rates and/or improved animal performance. Such a system may be of greater utility with improved pastures planted to forages possessing a greater genetic potential for growth. This study was designed to determine the animal and forage responses to SDG on a cool-season improved pasture compared with a traditional continuous grazing management system...|$|R
30|$|Conservancies {{influence}} grazing {{strategies in}} a number of ways. All conservancies have controlled grazing plans that set rules for within their boundaries. These usually restrict the number of livestock allowed into the conservancy and the areas where and the periods in which they can graze. Grazing plans vary by conservancy, but livestock grazing is generally restricted in areas surrounding tourist camps, to maintain higher quantities of grass and avoid livestock being visible to, or heard by, guests. <b>Periodic</b> <b>grazing</b> is allowed in areas farther away. Conservancies usually allow more flexible grazing during the low tourism season when some camps may be closed or during severe droughts. Some conservancies organise their grazing using a single but large grazing herd, opening up different parts of the conservancy in succession for grazing. Usually, cattle herds neighbouring the conservancy are allowed access on a rotational basis, as different parts of the conservancy are open for grazing at different times. Sheep and goats, which tend to graze close to their bomas, are not allowed access. Grazing is usually permitted only during the day for ease of monitoring and to avoid conflict with predators. Grazing rules are monitored and enforced by conservancy rangers, and herd owners are fined if herds are caught grazing in the conservancy outside of the specified times and places. Herds are driven out of the conservancy to the ranger post or gate and impounded until the fine is paid. In some cases, herders or livestock owners caught grazing illegally in the conservancies have been imprisoned or given community service (KII 32; Naboisho 2013). The commonest reason given for the strict grazing restrictions was the fact that tourism investors do not want cattle in the conservancies (KII 14, 18, 32). Where conservancies initially completely outlawed livestock grazing, some persuasion was required to convince the tourism investors to allow it to some level (KII 14). Although grazing restrictions applied to both conservancy members and non-members, there was discussion that when conservancies do allow livestock grazing, conservancy members’ livestock received preferential access (KII 16, 26; CI 8, 17, 19, 29).|$|E
40|$|Grazing {{cattle in}} grasslands can impact many {{ecosystems}} services including {{the movement of}} sediment and nutrients to water bodies, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat. In riparian grassland ecosystems congregation of cattle in or near streams may increase the sediment, nutrient, and pathogen loading of surface water resources, however the impact of cattle on water bodies may be limited through pasture characteristics or management practices that reduce congregation of cattle in or near streams. The first study in this thesis was designed {{to determine the effects}} of pasture size, stream access, and off-stream water on the presence of cattle near pasture streams. In the first study the effects of an off-stream water site or limiting the stream access of cattle to stabilized sites on the presence of cattle in or near a pasture stream was measured in small (4. 0 ha) and large (12. 1 ha) pastures. Limiting stream access of cattle to stabilized sites reduced presence of cattle in or near streams. However, providing off-stream water sites affected congregation of cattle in or near streams relatively little. Regardless of management treatment, presence of cattle in and near the pasture stream was reduced in pastures with a larger proportion of grazing land outside of the riparian zone. As temperatures increased, the probability of cattle spending time in and near the pasture stream or tree shade increased, with a greater probability of presence in riparian shade occurring in small pastures. In upland grassland ecosystems, cattle grazing at elevated stocking densities has the potential to improve plant diversity, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat through soil disturbance, incorporation of plant litter into the soil profile, and removal of aboveground forage. A second study was designed {{to determine the effects of}} a single spring grazing event at two stocking densities with or without subsequent rotational grazing on plant community properties, soil characteristics, and wildlife habitat in upland grasslands. Soil structural characteristics, proportion of plant species, and wildlife habitat were measured following no grazing or a single grazing event at elevated stocking densities with or without subsequent rotational grazing. Grazing at elevated stocking densities during periods of heavy rainfall reduced the proportion of cool season grass species for 14 months allowing succession of annual grass followed by legume species. However, after 14 months the proportion of cool season grass species returned to pre-grazing levels. The maximum height with 50 % visual obstruction from vegetation was reduced for 12 months following grazing, but there were few subsequent differences. Although a single spring grazing event at either a high or moderate stocking density during periods of heavy rainfall increased soil bulk density, penetration resistance to a depth of 10 cm, and bare ground, grazing at a higher stocking density had less impact on soil structural characteristics likely because of a shorter stocking duration. Further research is necessary to determine if shade can be used to influence cattle distribution in pastures and rangelands in addition to more comprehensive research on the effects of <b>periodic</b> <b>grazing</b> at elevated stocking densities on soil aggregate stability, soil organic carbon, soil erosion, and wildlife habitat in Midwest grassland ecosystems...|$|E

In particular, it is shown that a discrete, linear feedback strategy may be employed to retain the existence of an attractor near the grazing trajectory, such that the deviation of the attractor from the grazing trajectory goes to zero as the system parameters approach those corresponding to grazing contact. The implementation relies on a local analysis of the near-grazing dynamics using the concept of discontinuity mappings. Numerical results are presented for a linear and a nonlinear oscillator...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An impact-forming {{machinery}} {{with double}} masses is considered. Dynamics of the impact-forming machinery, in perfectly plastic impact case, is studied {{by using a}} three-dimensional map. The map is of piecewise property due to synchronous or non-synchronous motion of two masses immediately after the impact, and singularities caused by the grazing contact motions of two masses. The influence of the piecewise property and singularities on global bifurcations and transitions to chaos is elucidated. The impact-forming system exhibits {{two different types of}} period n single-impact motions in different forcing frequency regions, respectively. The results from simulation show that period-doubling bifurcations of single-impact periodic orbits of the impact-forming machinery are commonly existential. However, no period-doubling cascade occurs because of the piecewise and discontinuous nature of the map. The <b>periodic</b> motions with <b>grazing</b> contact of two masses lead complex sequences of transitions to chaos...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to present a modeling and simulation methodology for MEMS devices and identify and understand the associated nonlinearities due to large deflections, electric actuation, impacts, and friction. In {{the first part of}} the dissertation, we introduce a reduced-order model of flexible microplates under electric excitation. The model utilizes the von Karman plate equations to account for geo-metric nonlinearities due to large plate deflections. The Galerkin approach is employed to reduce the partial-differential equations of motion and associated boundary conditions into a finite di-mensional system of nonlinearly coupled ordinary-differential equations. We use the reduced-order model to analyze the mechanical behavior of a simply supported microplate and a fully clamped microplate. Effect of various design parameters on both the static and dynamic characteristics of microplates is studied.

40|$|Native {{grassland}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily degraded of all North American ecosystems, and restoration of altered grasslands is a tool used to mitigate some of the biological ramifications of past land use practices. Providing habitat for grassland-dependent bird species often {{is one of the}} many goals of restoration. We evaluated the efficacy of meadow restoration for breeding birds in the Nebraska Platte River Valley by comparing the bird community and vegetation structure on 25 natural (original sod) and 25 restored meadows. We conducted principal components analyses on the vegetation structure and on the bird community, and modeled the densities of common bird species in relation to vegetation features. Vegetation structure of natural and restored meadows overlapped broadly, although some metrics differed between the 2 types of meadows. With the exception of Dickcissel (Spiza americana), natural meadows supported higher densities of upland bird species, whereas restored meadows supported generalist species associated with moister conditions and brushier vegetation. Models of bird density reflected some of the differences in bird communities and vegetation structure between the 2 types of meadows: species with higher densities on natural meadows were associated with less bare ground, less woody vegetation, and less litter, whereas species that were more common on restored meadows were associated with more bare ground, more woody vegetation, more litter, less grass, and greater vegetation height-density. <b>Periodic</b> burning and <b>grazing</b> may help restore planted meadows in the Platte River Valley while maintaining species diversity...|$|R
40|$|Many {{dynamical}} {{systems of}} interesting physical phenomena are piecewise-smooth (PWS). In this dissertation, a particular PWS model, namely an elasto-plastic inverted pendulum (called the 2 ̆ 2 EPT 2 ̆ 2 model) {{is used to}} model an engineering structure under earthquake-like forcing. As a simplest model, we study {{the case of a}} sinusoidal forcing function. Ultimately we want to investigate the dynamics by constructing and analyzing bifurcations of periodic solutions. However, as a first step we consider the stability of equilibria of the undriven EPT model. We use a shooting method to construct periodic solutions of a simplication without plasticity, called the 2 ̆ 2 elastic-torque 2 ̆ 2 (ET) model. Using similar methods, we generate <b>grazing</b> <b>periodic</b> orbits for the EPT model. We observe that there are two families of periodic orbits - one associated with the pendulum near the top (orbits near ϴ = 0), and the other with near the bottom (orbits near ϴ = π). A question of interest is: which forcing amplitudes lead to switching from the top to the bottom? We construct a 2 ̆ 2 safe region 2 ̆ 2 corresponding to amplitudes that do not lead to this switch. Next, we investigate stability and bifurcations of periodic solutions to both the ET and EPT models using the more powerful continuation tool, 2 ̆ 2 AUTO 2 ̆ 2. However, because the EPT model is nonsmooth and degenerate, AUTO 2 ̆ 7 s tools sometimes fail. To repair this problem, we construct a smooth version of the EPT model, called the 2 ̆ 2 ST 2 ̆ 2 model; it permits the study of dynamics even when AUTO fails for the EPT model. Stability and bifurcations of periodic solutions to this final model are also investigated so that we can compare them with those of the original system. Finally, codimension-two bifurcations of our models, i. e., the loci of the special bifurcations, are constructed using two continuation parameters: the forcing amplitude, β, and the forcing frequency, Ω. Tuning these simultaneously can lead to collisions of bifurcations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to develop theoretical and computational tools {{for the study of}} qualitative changes in the dynamics of systems with discontinuities, also known as nonsmooth or hybrid dynamical systems, under parameter variations. Accordingly, this dissertation is divided into two parts. The analytical section of this dissertation discusses mathematical tools for the analysis of hybrid dynamical systems and their application to a series of model examples. Specifically, qualitative changes in the system dynamics from a nonimpacting to an impacting motion, referred to as grazing bifurcations, are studied in oscillators where the discontinuities are caused by impacts. Here, the study emphasizes the formulation of conditions for the persistence of a steady state motion in the immediate vicinity of <b>periodic</b> and quasiperiodic <b>grazing</b> trajectories in an impacting mechanical system. A local analysis based on the discontinuity-mapping approach is employed to derive a normal-form description of the dynamics near a grazing trajectory. Also, the results obtained using the discontinuity-mapping approach and direct numerical integration are found to be in good agreement. It is found that the instabilities caused by the presence of the square-root singularity in the normal-form description affect the grazing bifurcation scenario differently depending on the relative dimensionality of the state space and the steady state motion at the grazing contact. The computational section presents the structure and applications of a software program, T̂Ĉ, developed to study the bifurcation analysis of hybrid dynamical systems. Here, we present a general boundary value problem (BVP) approach to locate periodic trajectories corresponding to a hybrid dynamical system under parameter variations. A methodology to compute the eigenvalues of periodic trajectories when using the BVP formulation is illustrated using a model example. Finally, bifurcation analysis of four model hybrid dynamical systems is performed using T̂Ĉ.
