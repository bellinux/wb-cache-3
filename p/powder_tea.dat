40|$|ObjectiveTo observe {{effects of}} Dan Wei Powder (Powder for {{treating}} the gall bladder and stomach) Tea Bag (DWSTB) on the aggregation rate of blood platelet in vivo and in vitro. MethodsIncrease of the platelet aggregation {{rate in the}} rat in vivo was induced by carrageenin, and increase of the rabbit platelet aggregation rate in vitro was induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen, respectively. The effects of DWSTB on the platelet aggregation rate were investigated in vivo and in vitro, respectively. ResultsThe maximum in vivo platelet aggregation rate in the rat was significantly decreased after administration of 2. 0 and 4. 0 g·kg− 1 DWSTB (P < 0. 05. P < 0. 01). The maximum rabbit platelet aggregation rate induced by ADP and collagen in vitro were suppressed significantly by 2. 0 – 16. 0 mg·mL− 1 and 2. 0 – 8. 0 mg·mL− 1 DWSTB, respectively (P < 0. 05.

40|$|The {{effects of}} green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> on {{the levels of}} {{alpha-tocopherol}} in egg yolk, egg production and egg quality of laying hens were examined. Twenty 84 -week-old laying hens were divided into 4 dietary groups of 5 hens each in the late stages of laying. Four levels of green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> (0 % = control diet, 1 %, 5 % and 10 %) were fed to the hens for 3 weeks. At the end of 3 weeks, all experimental diets were switched to the control diet (0 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder)</b> for 3 weeks. The first group was fed the controlled diet throughout the experimental period. The egg weight, egg mass and feed intake were the highest for the 0 % and 1 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> diets and the lowest for the 5 % and 10 % diets (P < 0. 05). The rate of egg production and the intake of feed decreased significantly {{with an increase in}} the intake of green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> (P < 0. 05). The weights of the hens who received up to 5 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> in their diets decreased. However, the gain in the hens` weight was not influenced by the intake of 1 % green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> diet. There {{were no significant differences in}} the yolk color fan score for the 4 treatment diets. The egg shell strength decreased with increasing green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> intake, while the alpha-tocopherol content of egg yolk of the hens fed the experimental diet increased with increasing green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> intake. The fatty acid composition of yolk was not affected by the diet. The results suggested that the transfer of alpha-tocopherol from dietary green <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> to egg yolk was sensitive to the alpha-tocopherol intake and that green tea supplementation would support adequate egg production and egg weight when used up to a level of 1 % in the diets of laying hens...|$|R
