500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days.

At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust your gut. I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and <b>prorate</b> the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E

The publisher earns so 3 cents per pound sold, the bookseller earns 12 (minus shipping costs, dependent).

5000|$|The {{court found}} that its {{reasoning}} for the [...] "one year rule" [...] was well illustrated by {{the facts of the}} case before it. If the taxpayers in this situation were forced to deduct their rental payments on a <b>prorated</b> basis, the simplicity of the cash basis method of accounting was sacrificed for an inconsequential change in the timing of deductions. Under the <b>prorated</b> system the taxpayers could only deduct 1/12 of their rental payment in 1973. But in 1974, and every year until 1992, the taxpayers would be able to deduct both 1/12 of the current payment (for the month of December) and 11/12 for the preceding year's payment that covered the rental period in the current tax year (January-November); thus the taxpayers would be deducting 12/12 of rental payment—an entire year's worth of payments. So there was only a difference between the <b>prorated</b> deduction system and the [...] "one-year rule" [...] for the first and last year of the lease term.|$|R

5000|$|Thus, Unidroit {{has chosen}} to {{harmonise}} {{only a part of}} the [...] "substantive law" [...] on securities. Indeed, certain proprietary aspects concerning securities are governed in too different ways by the negotiating states. This is in particular the case of what is considered to be the [...] "heart of proprietary law", that is to say the question whether an investor that has [...] "deposited" [...] a security with an intermediary continues to exercise on such deposited security a right in rem or if its right is transformed, as from the deposit, into a simple claim. Such distinction, academic based more than case law-based, is not so important in usual times, but becomes crucial when an insolvency procedure is open against the intermediary. In countries where the first interpretation prevails, the investor shall dispose of a right to [...] "rivindicate" [...] (claim as one's own) which will allow him a speedy recover of the securities. In countries where the second interpretation prevails (the US and, to a certain extent the recourse to trust deposits in common law countries), the investor would only dispose of a right of claim, that will oblige him, except when the contrary is specified, to share with other creditors of the insolvent intermediary the product of the winding up of the intermediary in <b>prorate</b> {{of the value of the}} security.|$|E
