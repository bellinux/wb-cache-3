500|$|Several of the {{characters}} are given [...] "I am" [...] songs that introduce them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. [...] Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with [...] "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's hopes with the quieter [...] "I Am Going to Like It Here". [...] Although not a formal musical number, the brief [...] "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as [...] "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" [...] in a Broadway musical. [...] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as [...] "corny stuff... <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> to get a laugh". [...] Helen Chao's sad [...] "Love, Look Away" [...] is described by Lewis as [...] "arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".|$|E
500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came to my head, and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E
500|$|Shakira and Amanda Ghost, the {{executive}} {{producers of the}} album, enlisted {{a diverse group of}} producers to collaborate on the tracks, such as Pharrell Williams, one half of the record production duo The Neptunes, who co-wrote four of the tracks on the album with Shakira. Other collaborators included John Hill, Sam Endicott, and Timbaland. Shakira later said that her collaboration with Williams helped her learn a lot, noting [...] "When collaborating you always try and capture something from the other person and I learnt a lot from his method". The singer revealed that the two readied four tracks in five days, and commented that [...] "What was interesting is that he's very fast and immediate in the studio and I'm a little slower". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, was personally called by Shakira to co-compose the title track of the album along with Hill. He explained how they both began working with the single, saying she [...] "contacted him , asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean, who previously appeared as a featured artist on [...] "Hips Don't Lie" [...] with Shakira, talked about his chemistry with her, saying [...] "I have a natural chemistry with Shakira. I love the Latin vibe. The Lebanese vibe. I love the multicultural aspect of the CD. These days it's hard for you to pick up a CD and love it from beginning to end. Shakira represents that 360 degrees of: You put it in, and the whole CD rocks". In She Wolf, Jean appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Spy".|$|E

2500|$|He quickly grew {{disillusioned with}} the {{political}} system. [...] "Energy systems are notorious for their long gestation periods, often twenty years or longer, [...] {{there had to be}} a pay-off in a product within five to seven years in order to justify the public money being <b>put</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> are political cycles involving re-election, so the politicians didn't want to put money into systems that were going to come to fruition in some other generation. You sent out the plans, and they hacked and cut at them." [...] When the contract ran out, he decided to quit and strike out on his own.|$|E
2500|$|Noel {{admits that}} certain {{lines from the}} song are lifted from John Lennon: [...] "I got this tape in the United States that had {{apparently}} been burgled from the Dakota Hotel and someone had found these cassettes. Lennon was starting to record his memoirs on tape. He's going on about 'trying to start a revolution from me bed, because they said the brains I had went to my head.' I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?" [...] Gallagher also admits that he was under the influence of illegal substances when he wrote the song and to this day he claims he does not know what it means.|$|E

Gladwyne then sailed to Pearl Harbor <b>putting</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> on 27 December 1945.

60|$|I must confess, the {{relation}} of all this made me very much repent that I had not happened to have <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> with the ships; though indeed, as the road lay open {{to the east and}} south winds, it might have been worse another way; I mean, when the storm blew.

60|$|The Osprey {{proved to}} be a fine sea boat, and behaved so well that even Lady Greendale {{declared}} she would not be afraid to trust herself on board her in any weather. They sailed up the Clyde as far as Greenock, and then returning, cruised for a fortnight among the islands on the west coast.

60|$|Not {{more than}} half a dozen {{passengers}} ventured on deck, for the next two days, {{but at the end of}} that time the force of the wind gradually abated, and on the following morning the Madras had all her sails set, to a light but still favourable breeze.

60|$|So Jonas {{brought down}} the box trap that night. It was a long box, about {{as big as a}} cricket, with a tall, pointed back, which looked like a steeple; so Rollo called it the steeple trap. It was so made that if the {{squirrel}} should go in, and begin to nibble some corn, which they were going to <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> it would make the cover come down and shut him in. They fixed the trap {{on the end of the}} log, and Jonas observed, as he sat on the log, that he could see the barn chamber window through a little opening among the trees. Of course he knew that from the barn chamber window he could see the trap, though it would be too far off to see it plain.|$|E

I am afraid it is of no use trying to get the Portuguese authorities to arrest the ship or to search her. You see, to a certain extent it is an extradition case.
