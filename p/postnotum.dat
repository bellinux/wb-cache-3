2500|$|The tergal {{plates of}} the thorax are simple {{structures}} in apterygotes {{and in many}} immature insects, but are variously modified in winged adults. The pterothoracic nota each have two main divisions: the anterior, wing-bearing alinotum and the posterior, phragma-bearing <b>postnotum.</b> Phragmata (singular: phragma) are plate-like apodemes that extend inwards below the antecostal sutures, marking the primary intersegmental folds between segments; phragmata provide attachment for the longitudinal flight muscles. Each alinotum (sometimes confusingly {{referred to as a}} [...] "notum") may be traversed by sutures that mark the position of internal strengthening ridges, and commonly divides the plate into three areas: the anterior prescutum, the scutum, and the smaller posterior scutellum. The lateral pleural sclerites are believed to be derived from the subcoxal segment of the ancestral insect leg. These sclerites may be separate, as in silverfish, or fused into an almost continuous sclerotic area, as in most winged insects.|$|E

5000|$|The mesothoracic wing {{is entirely}} membranous, {{completely}} transparent and colourless, or bearing zonal pigmentation useful for recognition. Its surface {{is divided into}} three regions: the most developed is the alar (main flight) region, supported by robust wing veins; posteriorly is the anal region; and, finally, in the rear section-proximal, there is an expanded lobiform alula.The alula also termed the axillary lobe is a broad lobe at the proximal posterior margin of the wing stalk. It is continuous with the upper calypter and distally it is (usually) separated from the wing by an indentation called the alular incision. Aluliare a newly acquired feature of the Diptera (Hennig 1973) and aluli are usually absent or poorly developed in the Nematocera (excepting Anisopodidae) but present and relatively large in the Brachycera. In higher Diptera between the alula and the thorax is the upper calyptra, also the tegula. The calyptra are just below the junction of the wing with the thorax and are part of the axillary membrane of the wings of some Diptera - the two basal lobes are called the calypteres ( [...] also termed squamae, squamulae). The proximal lobe is called the lower calypter (or basicalypter or squamula thoracica). It arises from the furrow between the scutellum and the <b>postnotum</b> as a narrow, membranous ligament and ends where the more distal lobe,termed the upper calypter(or disticalypter or squamula alaris), folds sharply over it (calyptral fold).The upper calypter is usually larger than the lower calypter, but in some groups (Tabanidae, Acroceridae, and many Calyptratae), the lower calypter is larger than the upper one. The calyptral fringe is a fringe of hairs along the posterior margin of each calypter. The tegula (Shown here http://www.diptera.info/infusions/terms/terms.php?op=view&id=240) is the most proximal plate {{at the base of the}} costal margin (also termed the costal plate or epaulet.Next to it (distal)is the basicosta.|$|E
