40|$|To {{study the}} time course change of {{discrepancy}} in {{length of the}} lower extremities after the onset of poliomyelitis, 11 patients were observed for at least 8 years (rapidly <b>progressive</b> <b>type</b> and slowly <b>progressive</b> <b>type)</b> and 5 patients were observed for at least 5 years (non <b>progressive</b> <b>type).</b> Three patterns {{of change in the}} discrepancy were observed. a. In the rapidly <b>progressive</b> <b>type,</b> a final discrepancy more than 6. 3 cm was seen about 12 years after the onset of the disease. The aggravation of the discrepancy appeared as an oblique weak S-shaped curve as it gradually approached the final discrepancy. b. In the slowly <b>progressive</b> <b>type,</b> 3. 3 to 5. 8 cm in the final discrepancy was seen about 12 years after the onset of the disease. The aggravation of the discrepacny showed a slightly upward convex curve, as it gradually approached the final discrepancy. c. In the non <b>progressive</b> <b>type,</b> a discrepancy not exceeding 3. 0 cm was seen 6 to 8 years after the onset of the disease, after which it remained constant. The rapidly <b>progressive</b> <b>type</b> apperaed to follow the logistic curve, set forth by Verhulst. To test the fitting of this curve, diagrams of finite differences were used. The plotted points were distributed almost along the straight line of finite differences. The slowly <b>progressive</b> <b>type</b> also appeared to follow the logistic curve. To test the fitting of this curve, diagrams of finite differences were used. The plotted points were distributed almost along the straight line of finite differences. The prediction of discrepancy in adult life can be obtained by making a straight line on the diagrams of finite differences based on plotted 3 or 4 points measured at 4 or 5 years after the onset of the disease. A point of intersection of the straight line against the diagonal line between the vertical axis and the horizontal axis indicates the final discrepancy. The predicted values were close to the actual values, and this method of prediction may be useful for the planning of limb equalization...|$|R
