In practice, measurement in production means measures of partial productivity. Interpreted correctly, these components {{are indicative of}} productivity development, and approximate the efficiency with which inputs are used in an economy to produce goods and services.

In a way, the measurements are defective {{because they do not}} measure everything, but it is possible to interpret correctly the results of partial productivity and to benefit from them in practical situations. At the company level, typical partial <b>productivity</b> <b>measures</b> are such things as worker hours, materials or energy used per unit of production.|$|E

All <b>measures</b> of <b>productivity</b> considered are credible in the sense that highly productive plants, regardless of measure, are clearly more profitable, less likely to close, and grow faster. Nevertheless, labor <b>productivity</b> and <b>measures</b> of total factor productivity that are based on regression estimates of production functions are better predictors of plant growth and survival than factor share-based measures of total factor <b>productivity</b> (TFP). <b>Measures</b> of <b>productivity</b> that are based on several years of data appear to outperform <b>measures</b> of <b>productivity</b> that are based solely on data from the most recent year.

40|$|The {{move towards}} commercialization and {{privatization}} has pressured airports {{to become more}} productive and competitive. The need to devise an overall (total) <b>productivity</b> <b>measure</b> is increasingly important in airport business. The dissertation made three major research contributions.

Third, it developed models for explaining variations in productive efficiency. These are accomplished in two case studies. In case study 1, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to assess relative total productivity of 72 airports operating in 25 MASs during 2000 – 2002.

We then construct an alternative <b>productivity</b> growth <b>measure</b> using activity analysis which integrates the externality/social output into a generalized <b>productivity</b> <b>measure</b> reflecting social responsibility. This method is very general and could be applied to gauge corporate social responsibility.

40|$|Human performance, {{in all its}} {{different}} dimensions, is a {{very complex}} and interesting topic. In this paper we focus on performance in the workplace which, asides from complex is often controversial. While organizations and generally competitive working conditions push workers into increasing performance demands, this does not necessarily correlates positively to productivity. Moreover, existing performance monitoring approaches (electronic or not) are often dreaded by workers since they either threat their privacy or are based on <b>productivity</b> <b>measures,</b> with specific side effects. We present a new approach for the problem of performance monitoring that is not based on <b>productivity</b> <b>measures</b> but on the workers' movements while sitting and on the performance of their interaction with the machine. We show that these features correlate with mental fatigue and provide a distributed architecture for the non-intrusive and transparent collection of this data. The easiness in deploying this architecture, its non-intrusive nature, the potential advantages for better human resources management {{and the fact that it}} is not based on <b>productivity</b> <b>measures</b> will, in our belief, increase the willingness of both organizations and workers to implement this kind of performance management initiatives. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

A <b>productivity</b> <b>measure</b> is expressed as the ratio of output to inputs used in a production process, i.e. output per unit of input. Productivity is a crucial factor in production performance of firms and nations. Increasing national productivity can raise living standards because more real income improves people's ability to purchase goods and services, enjoy leisure, improve housing and education and contribute to social and environmental programs. Productivity growth also helps businesses to be more profitable.
