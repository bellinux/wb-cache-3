5|$|<b>Players</b> <b>will</b> change {{ends at the}} end of a set unless {{otherwise}} decreed by the umpire.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Southern {{was named}} to the final {{training}} squad for the 2012 Summer Olympics, and as such, attended a training camp starting on 20 February 2012 at the Australian Institute of Sport. The squad of seventeen <b>players</b> <b>will</b> be cut to thirteen before the team departs for the Olympic games, with the announcement being made on 13 June.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the top}} current <b>players</b> <b>will</b> {{meet the}} {{criteria}} of multiple categories for invitation. The Masters Committee, at its discretion, can also invite any golfer not otherwise qualified, although in practice these invitations are currently reserved for international players.|$|E
50|$|When in {{possession}} state, the possessing <b>player</b> <b>will</b> receive experience {{equivalent to a}} percentage of the experience the possessed player receive from monster kills. Also, the possessing <b>player</b> <b>will</b> not be able to interact with NPCs and certain skills may be unusable. The possessing <b>player</b> <b>will</b> experience a recovery rate similar to that of towns, but on the other hand, skills used by the possessing <b>player</b> <b>will</b> cost twice their usual casting cost. The possessed <b>player</b> <b>will</b> not be able to turn into any Marionette so as long s/he dons a possessed equipment.|$|R
50|$|Weapons at the <b>players</b> {{disposal}} <b>will</b> include laser {{guns and}} flamethrowers. The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> have pets {{to assist them}} in tasks. The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> encounter large bosses. The game is a side scroller.|$|R
50|$|The {{paths to}} each ending is {{dependent}} on the number of times the player has defeated the final boss, the Doomsday Beast Jormungandr. After defeat him the first time, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> talk with Zazie. After Jormungandr's first defeat, the player cannot fight him again until the Megaman (Rockman) side-quest has been completed with Shademan. When that's completed and Jormungandr is defeated again, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> talk to Violet again. When Jormungandr is defeated for the third time, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> get to talk to Sabata. Defeat Jormungandr again, and the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> talk with Lady. One last time, and the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> talk with Lita. The cycle then repeats itself when defeating Jormungandr.|$|R
5|$|Uru is {{a revolutionary}} {{adventure}} game {{that takes the}} best qualities of the Myst franchise and makes them even better. The single-player experience will eclipse the beauty, grandeur, and mind-challenging elements of previous titles. Plus, with the option to join a constantly updated online universe, the adventure never has to end. From new machines and puzzles to special events and entirely new Ages, <b>players</b> <b>will</b> find more to do, more to see, and more to explore each time they return—and this time, they can discover everything with old and new friends.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific <b>players</b> <b>will</b> not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign <b>players</b> <b>will</b> allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E
50|$|The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> have {{a choice}} between four {{characters}} as their first opponent (Joe, Mary, Bob and Franco). After the first four opponents are defeated, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> fight against Ryuji Yamazaki for a plot-based match in which the player must win only one round. The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> then proceed to fight against Mai, Andy, Hon-Fu, Sokaku, Terry and Geese in that order, before Yamazaki again for a full match. Depending on the grade average, the game will end against Yamazaki or the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> fight against either, or both, of the Jin twins.|$|R
50|$|In each of {{the matches}} in the final step 3-7, the highest seeded <b>player</b> <b>will</b> meet the lowest seeded player,the second highest seeded <b>player</b> <b>will</b> meet the second lowest seeded player etc.|$|R
50|$|One <b>player</b> <b>will</b> {{run out of}} ko threats. That <b>player</b> <b>will</b> {{be forced}} to make a play that his {{opponent}} {{does not have to}} respond to immediately, and his opponent wins the ko immediately.|$|R
5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other <b>players,</b> <b>will</b> join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E
5|$|Hardaway {{was one of}} 21 players {{selected}} to the 2011 Collegeinsider.com Freshmen All-America selection on March 25. Following the season, Darius Morris sought {{the advice of the}} NBA's undergraduate advisory committee to determine his draft prospects. On 4 May, Morris announced his final decision not to withdraw his name prior to the 8 May deadline and to enter June 23 2011 NBA Draft. Morris was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers with the 41st overall selection in the 2nd round of the 2011 NBA Draft. Following the season Hardaway was invited to the 17 – 24 June 2011 17-man tryouts for the 12-man FIBA Under-19 World Championship team by USA Basketball.

He made the final roster along with two other Big Ten rivals.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, <b>players</b> <b>will</b> be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E
50|$|Mining: At level 45, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> unlock {{a mining}} feature {{on one of}} the islands on the Dragon Isles. It {{consists}} of mining parts to craft a new dragon. The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> be able to craft it when 200 parts are mined. At level 80, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> now be able to mine for land. Bombs are used for mining dragons and dynamite is used to mine for land.|$|R
50|$|A level two <b>player</b> <b>will</b> {{choose the}} number {{consistent}} {{with the belief that}} all other players are level one. Since a level one <b>player</b> <b>will</b> choose 25, a level two player should choose 13. This process repeats for higher-level players.|$|R
50|$|The game {{includes}} elements {{borrowed from}} Space Invaders and Arkanoid. The player maneuvers the Vaus spacecraft along the blue region {{located at the}} bottom of the screen, and must deflect a ball at a formation of bricks and Space Invaders aliens. The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> need to avoid fire from the latter, although the player can deflect the shots at the aliens. The goal of each stage is to destroy the formation of bricks as well as the aliens, and the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> move forward to the next stage once this goal has been completed. The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> need to make his/her way across several different worlds, with each world containing four stages. At the final stage, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> need to fight a final boss before moving on. Once a world has been completed, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> acquire a random power-up in the form of characters representing older Taito properties, such as Bubble Bobble, Darius and Psychic Force.|$|R
5|$|Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus are not {{the same}} character. Additionally, he stated that by playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, <b>players</b> <b>will</b> be able to {{distinguish}} Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true personality. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection. The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus' heart entered Sora's body and Roxas' birth allowed Ventus to influence his appearance. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus' broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned. Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English.|$|E
5|$|Outside of combat, Scarygirl navigates {{the game}} world by running, jumping, gliding, and using her tentacle arm to grapple onto objects. Scarygirl {{eventually}} gains {{access to a}} feather attachment that can replace the hook on her tentacle arm, allowing Scarygirl to hover and reach otherwise inaccessible locations. Stages contain deadly traps {{that have to be}} avoided, often by grappling over them, and most stages contain at least two paths through the stage, although after choosing one the option to backtrack and take the other route exists. Crystals, which can be used to purchase combat upgrades for both combat and exploration, and heart fragments, which increase Scarygirl's maximum health, are scattered throughout stages. In order to get all of the crystals and heart fragments, <b>players</b> <b>will</b> have to traverse both paths through stages that have more than one path.|$|E
5|$|<b>Players</b> <b>will</b> {{be granted}} {{experience}} points upon each match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins and colors onto them. In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities {{that can only}} be used once after they are collected. There are six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by showing their health and location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon pickup in the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the power-up items. Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the dance}} battle, the person with the most points is the winner. The <b>player</b> <b>will</b> have his {{character}} presented {{at the front of the}} stage. Each <b>player</b> <b>will</b> receive experience points and Den/BEATS according to what position they finished in.|$|R
50|$|The protagonist is an immortal {{and will}} be able to survive severe injuries. Over time, the <b>player</b> <b>will</b> lose body parts and will have to collect the removed limbs by rolling into them. Players can cause large objects to crush nearby enemies, harming them but not the <b>player.</b> Gameplay <b>will</b> also feature puzzle elements.

50|$|Best <b>player</b> <b>will</b> get B$400 ($290 USD).|$|R
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick <b>players</b> <b>will</b> find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{gameplay}} {{features a}} third-person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and {{turn into a}} morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement {{is not limited to}} a two-dimensional plane. When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches into a first-person perspective, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where <b>players</b> <b>will</b> have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.|$|E
5|$|The way demons behave {{is based}} on their and the protagonist's {{respective}} alignments. Alignments come in two types, Light-Neutral-Dark, and Law-Neutral-Chaos. A demon's alignment can range across both alignments, resulting in nine possible stances that affect how they behave and what actions in battle or story progression pleases them. The protagonist's alignment changes depending on choices made during the story, and in response the attitudes of people and demons change; for instance, demons who are law-aligned will refuse to form an alliance with chaos-aligned players. Additionally, depending on their alignment, <b>players</b> <b>will</b> not be let into certain areas; for instance, the Order of Messiah will not let chaos-aligned players into their churches.|$|E
50|$|A pure {{strategy}} provides a complete definition {{of how a}} <b>player</b> <b>will</b> play a game. In particular, it determines the move a <b>player</b> <b>will</b> make for any situation {{he or she could}} face. A player's strategy set is the set of pure strategies available to that player.|$|R
50|$|A {{level one}} <b>player</b> <b>will</b> choose the number {{consistent}} {{with the belief that}} all other players are level zero. If all other players in the game are level zero, the average of those guesses would be about 50. Therefore, a level one <b>player</b> <b>will</b> choose 25.|$|R
