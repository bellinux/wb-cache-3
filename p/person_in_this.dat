25|$|A {{business}} administrator oversees {{a business}} and its operations. The job {{is to ensure that}} the business meets its goals and is properly organized and managed. The tasks a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position has are both wide and varied, and often include ensuring that the right staff members are hired and properly trained, making plans for the business' success, and monitoring daily operations. When organizational changes are necessary, a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position usually leads the way as well. In some cases, the person who he, starts or owns the business serves as its administrator, but this is not always the case, as sometimes a company hires an individual for the job.|$|E
25|$|When Huxley {{himself was}} young there were {{virtually}} no degrees in British {{universities in the}} biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> transformation.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} method of vertical suspension {{is to use}} a bondage rope harness. With the ropes tied around the body and in particular around the upper arms close to the shoulders as well as around the upper leg and through the groin, it is possible to suspend a person with ropes attached to these areas similar to the way a parachute is attached to a <b>person.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> position the arms and legs may be left to hang free, as the person would have great difficulty getting free without assistance.|$|E
25|$|In other {{situations}} the delusion {{may turn out}} to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another <b>person.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1963, {{one group}} was {{composed}} of mid-level officers such as colonels, majors, and captains. Đỗ Mậu was in this group, which was coordinated by Trần Kim Tuyến, South Vietnam's director of intelligence. Tuyến had been a palace insider, but a rift had developed in recent years, and he began plotting as early as 1962. As South Vietnam was a police state, Tuyến was a powerful figure and had many contacts.

He noted that, before World War II's Operation Barbarossa, when Nazi German troops began rounding up and executing members of various communities, the region did not experience [...] "racial tension". Despite his fondness for the interwar period, the director added: [...] "I believe that an artist {{should not be a}} hostage to his own political convictions.

[...] He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until Christopher Pattinson, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Edson, told him.

2500|$|A Parliament {{called to}} meet on 7 October {{repealed}} all the legislation of the Coventry parliament the previous year.

Entering Parliament with his sword borne upright before him, he made for the empty throne and placed his hand upon it, as if to occupy it. He may have expected the assembled peers to acclaim him as king, as they had acclaimed Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Instead, there was silence. Thomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, asked whether he wished to see the king. York replied, [...] "I know of no <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> realm the which oweth not to wait on me, rather than I of him." [...] This high-handed reply did not impress the Lords.|$|E

[...] According to Brazile, Obama had reclaimed the [...] "high road", but the question remained as to whether that road would [...] "lead to the White House or back to the United States Senate." [...] Unaffiliated Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons called it [...] "an incredibly honest speech" [...] and [...] "a brave thing to do politically."
