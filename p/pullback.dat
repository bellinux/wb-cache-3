5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the <b>pullback</b> shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a <b>pullback</b> depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} the <b>pullback</b> is {{essentially}} the notion of precomposition of one function with another. However, by combining this idea in several different contexts, quite elaborate <b>pullback</b> operations can be constructed. This article begins with the simplest operations, then uses them to construct more sophisticated ones. Roughly speaking, the <b>pullback</b> mechanism (using precomposition) turns several constructions in differential geometry into contravariant functors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Adhesive {{categories}} are categories which have pushouts {{with one leg}} a monomorphism, all <b>pullbacks,</b> and certain exactness conditions relating these pushouts and <b>pullbacks.</b> We give a new proof {{of the fact that}} every topos is adhesive. We also prove a converse: every small adhesive category has a fully faithful functor in a topos, with the functor preserving the all the structure. Combining these two results, we see that the exactness conditions in the definition of adhesive category are exactly the relationship between pushouts along monomorphisms and <b>pullbacks</b> which hold in any topos. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we seek to}} {{understand}} limits, a unifying notion that brings together the ideas of <b>pullbacks,</b> products, and equalizers. To do this, we will build up the basic framework of category theory, starting from {{the definition of a}} category. With this done, we will define <b>pullbacks,</b> products, and equalizers, and we will close this paper by showing two results: first, that having products and equalizers is equivalent to having <b>pullbacks</b> and a terminal object, and second, that having all finite limits is equivalent to havin...|$|R

25|$|When the map φ is a diffeomorphism, {{then the}} <b>pullback,</b> {{together}} with the pushforward, {{can be used to}} transform any tensor field from N to M or vice versa. In particular, if φ is a diffeomorphism between open subsets of Rn and Rn, viewed as a change of coordinates (perhaps between different charts on a manifold M), then the <b>pullback</b> and pushforward describe the transformation properties of covariant and contravariant tensors used in more traditional (coordinate dependent) approaches to the subject.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} Chern classes was via algebraic topology: the Chern classes arise via homotopy theory {{which provides a}} mapping associated with V to a classifying space (an infinite Grassmannian in this case).

Introduction Coalgebras have been introduced by Aczel and Mendler [AM 89] to model various types of transition systems. Reichel [Rei 95], and Jacobs [Jac 96] show that coalgebras are well suited for modeling object oriented programmming and for program verification. In [Rut 96], J. J. M. M.
