5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply <b>pretend</b> <b>it</b> never happened.|$|E
25|$|It is {{even more}} tragic that other world leaders who witness {{repression}} <b>pretend</b> <b>it</b> is not happening, or is exaggerated. When history eventually deals with the dictators, those who stood by and watched should also bear the consequences. A shameful quality {{of the modern world}} is to turn away from injustice and ignore the hardships of others.|$|E
500|$|Sharp, when {{describing}} filming with her husband, Gleaves, who plays her on-screen lover, said, [...] "there aren't {{too many people}} who can {{go to work and}} have an affair with their husband". When discussing the filming of Scott & Bailey, Jones said [...] "I can't <b>pretend</b> <b>it</b> wasn't a tough shoot, both emotionally and physically, because it was", before adding that {{on the last day of}} filming she had to shoot a gruelling scene involving her chasing a suspect from a crime scene, while Sharp and Bullmore [...] "were having massages and facials ready for the wrap party".|$|E

500|$|Horst Fascher (born 1936, Hamburg) was Koschmider's nightclub bouncer, who {{had been}} the 1959 West German featherweight boxing champion, but his career was cut short after he unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight. He later became a friend of the Beatles, and {{protected}} them from drunken customers. Lennon occasionally urinated out of his apartment’s window onto the street below, and often started arguments with the audience, so that eventually one member of the audience would jump on stage to hit him, but it was Fascher’s job to protect Lennon and the group. In some occasions beer bottles were thrown at them. Fascher remembered Lennon often greeting the audience with a [...] "Heil Hitler", and a Nazi salute: [...] "He'd pull out a black comb and <b>pretend</b> <b>it</b> was a moustache... people laughed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month. It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to <b>pretend</b> <b>it</b> was there, because I was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a cat. I really am a cat person".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{synopsis of}} the film {{was published in the}} Moving Picture World as follows: [...] "Professor Dix has won fame as a scientist and has collected many objects of Egyptian ware, centuries old, that arouse the enthusiasm of his associates. Even Jack Thornton, an active, go-ahead young businessman, is interested in the professor's home, but although he tries to <b>pretend</b> <b>it</b> is Egyptology which interests him, the professor's fair young daughter is really the lodestone. Jack decides to win the old man's respect by posing as an Egyptologist himself. To start his collection, he purchases a mummy at an auction sale, and takes it home expecting that later he can make a great hit with his sweetheart's father, by presenting it to him as a gift. While the mummy is in Jack's room, a live electric wire is by accident brought in contact with it. The body has been so perfectly mummified, that the electric current is all that is necessary to ignite the vital spark, and Jack is amazed to see dancing forth from the case which he thought contained only unattractive rags and bones, a beautiful Egyptian princess. As soon as she is released, the mummy makes violent love to Jack, and causes his sweetheart to quarrel with him (for how can a plain businessman explain the presence in his room of a beautiful barbarian?). When her love is spurned, the visitor from the distant past avenges herself by having Jack made into a mummy and placed in the case in her stead. Her heart relents, however, in time to save him from being 'cut up' by the professor, who with the sharp knife, starts to investigate the contents of the mummy case. But all ends happily when Jack's plain statements of the seemingly impossible facts are proved true by the professor. Jack is reunited to his sweetheart, and the professor, being a widower, also an ardent admirer of everything antique, leads the recreated Egyptian lady to the altar, {{in spite of the fact}} that there is a difference of several thousand years in their ages." ...|$|E

2500|$|The NAACP of Portland withdrew {{its support}} of the protest, accusing the {{original}} organizers of failing to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color. The group's president said she was told that those issues, along with anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter messaging and signage, were [...] "too political". As {{a result of the}} affiliate's criticism, a small group of women from Eastern Oregon who served as the original organizers of the Portland event were replaced with new leaders to [...] " [...] a larger platform to women of color". After the NAACP chapter was made aware of the leadership changes, its president explained: [...] "I felt it was important that we not miss this teachable moment about what role of race and religion and class were playing in pulling this march together." [...] Furthermore, she told Willamette Week: [...] "Putting a black woman's face {{at the beginning of the}} march doesn't fundamentally change the reason we withdrew our support. It's always been the case that if somebody suffers a racist incident, you're just supposed to suck it up and then, for the sake of unity, let's all join hands and <b>pretend</b> <b>it</b> didn't happen. I'm just at a place where I don't think that's healthy or wise anymore." ...|$|E
