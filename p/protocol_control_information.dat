40|$|Introduction The sole Transport Connection (TC) release {{facility}} {{provided by}} the current ISO/IEC Connection-Mode Transport Service [ISO 8072] is an abrupt (and thereby possibly destructive) one. At present, in the OSI Reference Model [ISO 7498], the concept of orderly (or graceful) release is introduced at the session service level. So {{it is up to}} the peer session entities to make sure that there are no more in-transit data on the TC to which is assigned the session connection that is to be gracefully released before requesting the abrupt termination of this TC. Some people even think that there is no objective reason for providing an orderly connection release in any layer except the application layer (cf. Question 6 in [ISO SD 9]). They argue that peer application entities could ensure, by way of an exchange of application <b>protocol</b> <b>control</b> <b>information,</b> that there are no more data in transit on the presentation connection and could then safely perform an abrupt termination o...|$|E

The Z 39. 50 client/server session model provides multiple abstract views of records, depending on whether searching, retrieval, or element selection is taking place. The underlying network stream that carries user queries, database records, diagnostics, and <b>protocol</b> <b>control</b> <b>information</b> is structured according to the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as applied to human readable specifications written in the Abstract Syntax Notation, ASN. 1. Several important decisions face creators of Z 39. 50 servers. Building the BER transport mechanism may be done from scratch or with software tools compiled from ASN. 1. Developing a model for managing result sets (records resulting from a query) is required by the stateful nature of Z 39. 50.

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} subject of {{compression}} for wireless links, where additional processing at the sender and receiver can dramatically improve the transmission capacity of a communication link. The placement of compression functions within the OSI reference model is discussed. Applying compression at the appropriate layers is important, simulation results {{show that there is}} seldom benefit from compressing the same data twice. The efficiency of link-layer compression methods consequently also depends on whether (and at what level) encryption and/or higher-layer compression are applied. The thesis therefore investigates issues that impact link performance, relating these to application requirements, and the characteristics of the communication channel. The focus of the thesis is on packet header compression, which operates only on the <b>protocol</b> <b>control</b> <b>information</b> carried in packet headers. The behaviour of packet header compression algorithms are related to the IETF-defined Robust Header Compression (ROHC) framework. Where the packet headers form {{a large proportion of the}} total packet size, such as Voice-over-IP, such methods significantly improve the link compression efficiency. This thesis evaluates these algorithms in terms of compression efficiency and the reliability requirements of the link. The issue of compression IPv 6 headers is also discussed. Several important issues in implementing ROHC are described, such as a lack of public domain information concerning algorithms, design choices, and source code, which make the current specifications complicated and difficult to understand. Despite this, the work concludes that these ore similar methods could have significant benefits for wireless links. To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, a satellite Independent Header Compression scheme is introduced. This proposes a basic framework for robust header compression suited to a satellite environment. This is intended to form a basis for development of methods that will be found in future satellites links. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

30|$|Developing {{efficient}} {{routing protocols}} {{has always been}} a challenging task because of the specific characteristics of a MANET environment [2]. First, since nodes are free to move arbitrarily, the network topology may change randomly and rapidly at unpredicted times and an efficient routing protocol should be able to react appropriately to these topology changes. Second, the available bandwidth is limited because it is shared by multiple nodes and can also vary due to fading, noise, and interference. As a consequence, the <b>protocol's</b> amount of <b>control</b> <b>information</b> should be limited. Third, the nodes that form the network can be very heterogeneous, ranging from small battery-powered devices with limited processing capacity to full-fledged computers possibly connected to the power net and with ample processing power. Finally, network sizes can range from tens up to thousands of nodes.|$|R

The continuous growth is also producing a byproduct that blocks the global distribution of data services because the evolved network functions are effective only within a single network domain. In short, the global network will have the network generations of conventional IP-based network, the next generation network, and the emerging future network. In order to achieve advanced network services utilizing evolved network functions across multiple network domains and generations, this paper proposes a network function exchange architecture. The proposed network function exchange intermediates the various differences related to <b>control</b> <b>protocols,</b> management <b>information,</b> and data format. A service scenario using the network function exchange and detailed architecture is described.

30|$|The {{multiplexing}} {{method of}} <b>control</b> <b>information</b> and data is conducted according to [17].

Although the relay does not know the content of the new <b>control</b> <b>information,</b> the relay does know which kind of <b>control</b> <b>information</b> will be transmitted by the UE, e.g., periodic CQI, ACK/NACK of HARQ. Therefore, the relay can know bit number of the new <b>control</b> <b>information</b> and thus can perform the same rate matching as the UE to generate the data bits. Because the mapping rule of data bits to resource is predefined, the UE and the relay will have the same mapping results for data transmission.

30|$|One {{major problem}} in using the type II relay in uplink data {{retransmission}} [10, 11] {{is caused by the}} backward compatibility requirement. As specified in LTE-Advanced specifications, when a legacy UE has both <b>control</b> <b>information</b> (e.g., ACK/NACK, periodic channel quality indicator (CQI) report, etc.), and data to be transmitted in the uplink, the UE should embed the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> in the data transmission in order to retain the single carrier-frequency division multiple access characteristics and to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Such a transmission requirement, i.e., embedding <b>control</b> <b>information</b> in data, brings difficulty for type II relay-assisted cooperative retransmission, where type II relay monitors initial transmission of the UE and performs cooperative transmission to assist retransmission of UE when the initial transmission is failed. We assume that the UE has <b>control</b> <b>information</b> (e.g., ACK/NACK to different downlink data packets) to be transmitted at both initial transmission and retransmission. For simplicity, we denote the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> embedded in initial transmission as “old” <b>control</b> <b>information</b> and the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> embedded in retransmission as “new” <b>control</b> <b>information.</b> The type II relay can only know the old <b>control</b> <b>information</b> through monitoring and detecting the initial transmission but cannot know the new <b>control</b> <b>information</b> to be transmitted by the UE in advance before the retransmission. Therefore, type II relay will have difficulty in performing the retransmission. If the type II relay sends exactly the same signals as the initial transmission of the UE, i.e., with the old <b>control</b> <b>information,</b> the old <b>control</b> <b>information</b> from the relay and the new <b>control</b> <b>information</b> from the UE will collide at the eNodeB. If the relay punctures the old <b>control</b> <b>information</b> in cooperative retransmission, the eNodeB receives the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> only from the UE but a superposed reference signal from both the relay and the UE. Consequently, channel estimation mismatch occurs for the <b>control</b> <b>information</b> and results in unacceptable detection performance of the <b>control</b> <b>information.</b>|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{information}} science explores {{ways in which}} quantum physical laws can be harnessed to control the acquisition, transmission, protection, and processing of information. This field has seen explosive growth {{in the past several}} years from progress on both theoretical and experimental fronts. Essential to this endeavor are methods for <b>controlling</b> quantum <b>information.</b> In this thesis, I present three new approaches for <b>controlling</b> quantum <b>information.</b> First, I present a new protocol for continuously protecting unknown quantum states from noise. This protocol combines and expands ideas from the theories of quantum error correction and quantum feedback control. The result can outperform either approach by itself. I generalize this protocol to all known quantum stabilizer codes, and study its application to the three-qubit repetition code in detail via Monte Carlo simulations. Next, I present several new <b>protocols</b> for <b>controlling</b> quantum <b>information</b> that are fault-tolerant. These protocols require only local quantum processing due to the topological properties of the quantum error correcting codes upon which they are built. I show that each protocol's fault-dependence behavior exhibits an order-disorder phase transition when mapped onto an associated statistical-mechanical model. I review the critical error rates of these protocols found by numerical study of the associated models, and I present new analytic bounds for them using a self-avoiding random walk argument. Moreover, I discuss fault-tolerant procedures for encoding, error-correction, computing, and decoding quantum information using these protocols, and calculate the accuracy threshold of fault-tolerant quantum memory for protocols using them. I end by presenting a new class of quantum algorithms that solve combinatorial optimization problems solely by measurement. I compute the running times of these algorithms by establishing an explicit dynamical model for the measurement process. This model, the digitized version of von Neumann's measurement model, is recognized as Kitaev's phase estimation algorithm. I show that the running times of these algorithms are closely related to the running times of adiabatic quantum algorithms. Finally, I present a two-measurement algorithm that achieves a quadratic speedup for Grover's unstructured search problem. </p...|$|R
