Of these 45,266 students, 19,517 of them matriculated into a medical school for a success rate of 43 percent.

5000|$|As in {{the year}} before, Kitsch {{encountered}} funding difficulties {{in the spring of}} 2009, but this time {{in the form of a}} suspension of funding from Cornell's Student Assembly Finance Commission when Kitsch′s Cornell editorial board made a technical error during the funding <b>pre-application</b> <b>process.</b> Despite the fact that the error was caught before the deadline for the main funding application, Kitsch was denied the opportunity to correct its error or apply for funding. The SAFC declared that nothing could be done to give Kitsch any money that semester. Funds from Ithaca College, advertising, subscriptions, and other Cornell sources (most importantly, the Department of History and the Cornell Council for the Arts) enabled Kitsch to print one issue in the spring semester, but not two as originally planned. Fritch would later call the actions of the SAFC [...] "disproportionate…absurd and unfair".|$|E
40|$|Governmental {{policies}} in the UK have indicated that {{a new form of}} localism is to be applied in the urban development industry. Private developers, who are primarily initiators and financers of urban regeneration projects, are obliged to implement public consultation into their <b>pre-application</b> <b>process.</b> However, whether the involved actors consider the current interpretation of public engagement in urban regeneration effective remains questionable. This research investigates the private-civic relationship and pinpoints the most critical aspects of public engagement, in order to improve the situation for the future.

40|$|Overview This audit {{assessed}} the effectiveness, efficiency and {{economy of the}} Regional Growth Fund (RGF), the achievement of its intended outcomes and whether the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport & Resources (the department) has applied the {{lessons learned from the}} RGF to the planning and implementation of the Regional Jobs and Infrastructure Fund (RJIF). Weaknesses in the design and implementation of the RGF mean that the department cannot fully demonstrate that value for money and the goals and objectives of the RGF have all been achieved to date. These weaknesses include a lack of transparency in <b>pre-application</b> <b>processes</b> and fundamental flaws in performance evaluation and reporting. Regional Development Victoria (RDV) has not effectively monitored and reported on all the outcomes of the RGF. The reported outcomes of jobs and investment leveraged are potentially misleading as they inflate the actual achievements of the RGF. Reported job numbers primarily relate to expected, rather than actual jobs created. Consequently, reported RGF figures do not provide an accurate picture of actual achievements. Going forward, the department is applying the lessons learned to the design and implementation of the new RJIF including a stronger evaluation framework. However, given RJIF 2 ̆ 7 s recent implementation, {{it is too early to}} determine the effectiveness of these improvements...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressurized}} {{light water}} cooled, medium (1000 MWt) power plant IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) {{has been under}} development for three years by an international consortium of over twenty organizations from nine countries. The plant conceptual design was completed in 2001 and the preliminary design is currently underway. The <b>pre-application</b> licensing <b>process</b> with NRC was activated in October, 2002 and IRIS {{is one of the}} few designs considered by US utilities as part of the ESP (Early Site Permit) process. The novel features of the IRIS design, either from a safety performance and advance design point of view, provide a great opportunity for a more massive usage of Computational Fluid Dynamics in the process design for IRIS. A CFD-Group of international scientists, affiliate to the different IRIS parters has been formed and given the mission of investigating the many application opportunities for CFD with the goal also of verifing the gain in term of time, costs, resources saving over traditional design approaches. A first activity has been focused on identifying areas where CFD can be effectively used to support the design and analysis of the plant. For example, the following phenomena have been identified and selected for further considerations with CFD analyses: mixing phenomena (flow, temperature and boric acid) in the downcomer and lower plenum, boron and mixing phenomena in the pressurizer region, heat lossed and parasitic flow rates at some key locations in the pressurizer and reactor coolant system interface, and evaluations of the effectiveness of the bypass flow paths and the natural circulation flow path in the riser-steam generator regions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the CFD design support program that has been defined for IRIS and discusses in some detail the main areas of investigation. Also, an overview of CFD competences as they are distributed within the different organizations is provided and the international cooperation program that will support this activity is presented. Beside supporting the IRIS design in some key areas, the main porpouse of this program is also testing the opportunity for CFD to be used as a design support “tool” for advanced nuclear plants operating within a set of well-defined and accepted standard procedure able to identify any strenght, limits and future possible impementation of computational analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between private interests and state planning actors {{has been identified}} as central to facilitating development. Many authors argue that the earlier this interaction occurs, the greater the chance that development outcomes will meet the objectives of a diverse set of interested actors. An increasingly popular method of facilitating such interaction is the pre-application meeting. Drawing on the perceptions and experiences of senior council staff and development applicants, this paper explores the role and value of pre-application meetings in New South Wales. The main themes include the difficulty in defining pre-application meetings, the use of preapplication meetings as part of the assessment process, and, finally, the advantages and issues that arise with the <b>pre-application</b> <b>process.</b> 13 page(s...|$|E
