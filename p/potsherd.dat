500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving manuscripts of Sappho, {{including the}} <b>potsherd</b> on which fragment 2 is preserved, {{date to the}} third century BC, and thus predate the Alexandrian edition. The latest surviving copies of Sappho’s poems transmitted directly from ancient times are written on parchment codex pages from the sixth and seventh centuries AD, and were surely reproduced from ancient papyri now lost. Manuscript copies of Sappho's works may have survived a few centuries longer, but around the 9th century her poetry appears to have disappeared, and by the twelfth century, John Tzetzes could write that [...] "the passage of time has destroyed Sappho and her works".|$|E

[...] A supposed facsimile of this <b>potsherd</b> appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the Book of Mazarbul. Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.|$|E

Besides a round unleavened loaf of bread called badnjački kolač, and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, sauerkraut, noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine. It used to be served in some villages on a sack filled with straw, with the family seated around it on the floor. In the north Dalmatian region of Bukovica, a part of food that remained after the dinner used {{to be put on}} a <b>potsherd,</b> and taken to the rubbish heap.

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an {{earthenware}} reconstruction system, {{which can}} automatically reconstruct some earthenware from numerous given <b>potsherds</b> in two dimensional grayscale images. The system supposes that given <b>potsherds</b> are thin and moderately flat and small. Some earthenware having three dimensional shape, such as crocks, can be reconstructed {{by the system}} within the supposition. The system performs earthenware reconstruction through two phases. At the first phase, <b>potsherds</b> are joining automatically in two dimensions. An efficient joint detection algorithm is proposed at the phase. At the second phase, three dimensional shape is recovered by adequate three dimensional transformation. In this paper, some experimental results of reconstruction from numerous <b>potsherds</b> are also reported. 1...|$|R

The aim of {{the paper}} is a chrono-tpological and archaeometrical {{analysis}} of three new Appenninico <b>potsherds</b> coming from the embanked site of Fondo Paviani, already known in literature {{for the presence of}} some Appenninico <b>potsherds.</b> Two of the new ones come from the survey, while a third one was found in an archaeological layer that can be dated to RBA 2. The petrographic analysis demonstrated a local production, as it is for the other Appenninico <b>potsherds</b> from Valli Grandi Veronesi contexts. The material filling the carved decoration motifs was examined with SEM and XRD. The analysis showed that it is a white pigment made of grounded bones, applied on pots after firing. Since the MBA 3 phase is substantially missing in the Fondo Paviani settlement, the three <b>potsherds</b> support the hypothesis of the continuation of techniques and decorative patterns also in RBA...|$|R

40|$|Thirteen <b>potsherds</b> {{from the}} Eğirdir Caravanserai (south-west of Turkey) were {{characterized}} by optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mineralogical and petrographic studies of medieval <b>potsherds</b> in there show a ceramic body composed of a microcrystalline to amorphous matrix with various clasts and voids. The thin section, XRD and SEM analyses of samples showed that <b>potsherds</b> consist of K-feldspar (orthoclase), plagioclase (albite and anorthite), pyroxene (diopside), melilite (gehlenite), mullite, wollastonite, mica (biotite and muscovite), chlorite, leucite, amphibole, quartz, calcite, iron minerals (hematite and magnetite) and trace amounts of sphene. The obtained results showed that calcareous materials including illitic-kaolinitic clays were used for pottery production and the <b>potsherds</b> were fired in the temperatures from 800 to 1150 °C...|$|R

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that palynomorphs {{can occur in}} fired ancient <b>potsherds</b> when the firing temperature was under 350 °C. Pollen and phytoliths recovered from incompletely fired and fully fired <b>potsherds</b> (ca. 2700 yrs BP) from the Yanghai Tombs, Turpan, Xinjiang, NW China {{can be used as}} potential indicators for reconstructing past vegetation and corresponding climate in the area. The results show a higher rate of recovery of pollen and phytoliths from incompletely fired <b>potsherds</b> than from fully fired ones. Charred phytoliths recovered from both fully fired and incompletely fired <b>potsherds</b> prove that degree and condition of firing result in a permanent change in phytolith color. The palynological data, together with previous data of macrobotanical remains from the Yanghai Tombs, suggest that temperate vegetation and arid climatic conditions dominated in the area ca. 2700 yrs BP...|$|R

2500|$|For {{cultures}} that produced pottery, archaeologists invariably {{spend a great}} deal of time defining ceramic [...] "types." [...] Each type is a series of attributes which distinguishes one group of pottery (whether whole vessels or <b>potsherds)</b> from all other groups of pottery, such that each type was produced in a single time and place. Ideally, the attributes used to identify types are ones that are identifiable with the naked eye, and are found on small fragments of pottery, so that the sorting of <b>potsherds</b> into types is quick and straightforward. By sorting <b>potsherds</b> in terms of types, archaeologists can examine a series of <b>potsherds</b> (including those lying on a site surface) and quickly suggest when and where the pottery was made. By extension, they can estimate when a prehistoric site was used, whether there are any traded pieces, and so on.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is this. I {{believe that}} <b>potsherd</b> to be {{perfectly}} genuine, and that, wonderful as it may seem, it has come down in your family from since the fourth century before Christ. The entries absolutely prove it, and therefore, however improbable it may seem, it must be accepted. But there I stop. That your remote ancestress, the Egyptian princess, or some scribe under her direction, wrote that which we see on the sherd I have no doubt, nor have I the slightest doubt but that her sufferings {{and the loss of}} her husband had turned her head, and that she was not right in her mind when she did write it." ...|$|E
6000|$|When he {{had gone}} we {{discussed}} the situation, which filled me with alarm. I did {{not at all like}} the accounts of this mysterious Queen, [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed," [...] or more shortly She, who apparently ordered the execution of any unfortunate stranger in a fashion so unmerciful. Leo, too, was depressed about it, but consoled himself by triumphantly pointing out that this She was undoubtedly the person referred to in the writing on the <b>potsherd</b> and in his father's letter, in proof of which he advanced Billali's allusions to her age and power. I was by this time too overwhelmed with the whole course of events that I had not even the heart left to dispute a proposition so absurd, so I suggested that we should try {{to go out and get}} a bath, of which we all stood sadly in need.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next thing}} that I found was a {{parchment}} carefully rolled up. I unrolled it, and seeing {{that it was}} also in Vincey's handwriting, and headed, [...] "Translation of the Uncial Greek Writing on the Potsherd," [...] put it down by the letter. Then followed another ancient roll of parchment, that had become yellow and crinkled {{with the passage of}} years. This I also unrolled. It was likewise a translation of the same Greek original, but into black-letter Latin, which at the first glance from the style and character appeared to me to date from somewhere about the beginning of the sixteenth century. Immediately beneath this roll was something hard and heavy, wrapped up in yellow linen, and reposing upon another layer of the fibrous material. Slowly and carefully we unrolled the linen, exposing to view a very large but undoubtedly ancient <b>potsherd</b> of a dirty yellow colour! This <b>potsherd</b> had in my judgment, once been a part of an ordinary amphora of medium size. For the rest, it measured ten and a half inches in length by seven in width, was about a quarter of an inch thick, and densely covered on the convex side that lay towards the bottom of the box with writing in the later uncial Greek character, faded here and there, {{but for the most part}} perfectly legible, the inscription having evidently been executed with the greatest care, and by means of a reed pen, such as the ancients often used. I must not forget to mention that in some remote age this wonderful fragment had been broken in two, and rejoined by means of cement and eight long rivets. Also there were numerous inscriptions on the inner side, but these were of the most erratic character, and had clearly been made by different hands and in many different ages, and of them, together with the writings on the parchments, I shall have to speak presently.|$|E
