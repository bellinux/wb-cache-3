50|$|Cephalanthera austiniae is {{a species}} of orchid known by the common names <b>phantom</b> <b>orchid</b> and snow orchid because the entire plant is white {{except for a few}} yellow {{markings}} on the flowers.|$|E
50|$|Cephalanthera, {{abbreviated}} Ceph in horticultural trade, is a genus {{of mostly}} terrestrial orchids. Members of this genus have rhizomes rather than tubers. About 15 species are currently recognized, {{most of the}} native to Europe and Asia. The only species found in the wild in North America is the <b>Phantom</b> <b>Orchid</b> or Snow Orchid C. austiniae. Ecologically, this species is partially myco-heterotrophic. Some of the Eurasian species hybridise.|$|E
50|$|The Round Top Botanical Area {{is at the}} {{junction}} of three botanical provinces and includes red fir forest, sagebrush scrub, subalpine and alpine environments. The combination of soil types, varying exposure and elevations produce diverse plant life, such as the <b>phantom</b> <b>orchid</b> (Cephalanthera austiniae), a rare plant that gets nutrients from dead material (saprophyte). The plant's common name is due to its color being all or mostly white.|$|E
50|$|The Forest Service {{designated}} the peak and watershed around the peak the Preston Peak Botanical and Geological Area {{because of the}} rare plants and associations of plants that can be found. Here the Alaska cedar and noble fir reach the southern terminus of their rangeand share habitat with the northwest California endemic Brewer spruce and Port Orford cedar. There is also an interesting population of high elevation Pacific yew on the peak that, {{along with a few}} other population in the Klamath Mountains, may justify reclassification as at least a subspecies.A few other rare plants living on or around the peak are the <b>phantom</b> <b>orchid</b> and Siskiyou fritillary.|$|E
50|$|Fog drip {{may play}} a key role in the {{precipitation}} in the upper watershed. On Cahill Ridge (just west of San Mateo Creek and east of Pilarcitos Creek, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, Oberlander measured fog drip beneath Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), Coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter 125 feet tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most precipitation and in five weeks of measurement (July 20-August 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced 59 inches of precipitation, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced 7-17 inches of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids Giant helleborine (Epipactis gigantea) and <b>Phantom</b> <b>orchid</b> (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops.|$|E
5000|$|In California Coast Ranges, {{a single}} Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) can [...] "douse {{the ground beneath}} it with the {{equivalent}} of a drenching rainstorm and the drops off redwoods can provide as much as half the moisture coming into a forest over a year". Dawson reported that in a study of northern California redwood forests, 34% of annual hydrologic input was from fog drip. In areas were trees had been cut down, the average annual input from fog was only 17%, proving that the redwoods were required for the fog moisture input to the ecosystem. In an Occidental, California study beneath a single 200 ft Douglas fir on a ridge dividing the moister western slope of the California Coast Range from the drier eastern slope, moisture collected under the tree averaged 58 in versus 27 in in an adjacent open meadow. On Inverness Ridge in Point Reyes National Seashore fog drip from Douglas firs in summer may add 20 in to the otherwise 40 in of annual average rainfall. Further south, on Cahill Ridge on the San Francisco Peninsula (between Pilarcitos Creek and Crystal Springs Reservoir) at an altitude of 1000 ft, Oberlander measured fog drip beneath Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), Coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter 125 ft tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most moisture and in five weeks of measurement (July 20-August 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced 59 in of moisture, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced 7 - 17 in of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids Giant helleborine (Epipactis gigantea) and <b>Phantom</b> <b>orchid</b> (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops.|$|E
