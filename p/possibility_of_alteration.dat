Permeabilized cells were activated by immersion in a bath of known [Ca 2 +j. We report that the Ca 2 + sensitivity of cells obtained by enzymatic digestion and permeabilized using a-hemolysin {{is similar to that}} reported previously for mechanically disrupted ventricular myocardium; however, the tension-pCa relation is less steep in the new preparation.

However, monthly production is unstable {{due to lack of}} pollination services. Common pollinator agent of tomatoes is bumblebees which is unsuitable for tropical climate of Indonesia and the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> of local wild plant interaction with their pollinator. Indonesia is rich with wild bees and some of the species already domesticated for years with prospect as pollinating agent for tomatoes. This research aimed to assess the efficiency of local honey bee (Apis cerana L.) and stingless bee (Trigona iridipennis), as pollinator of tomato. During this research, total visitation rate and total numbers of pollinated flowers by honey bee and stingless bee were compared between them with bagged flowers as control. Total fruit production, average weight and size also measured in order to correlated pollination efficiency with quantity and quality of fruit produced. Result of this research showed that A. cerana has slightly higher rate of visitation (p> 0. 05) and significantly shorter handling time (p T. iridipennis due to their larger colony demand and low reward provide by tomato flowers. However, honey bee pollinated tomato flowers more efficient pollinator than stingless bee (80. 3 and 70. 2 % efficiency, respectively; p 0. 05).

40|$|Carbapenems such as {{imipenem}} and meropenem are not rapidly hydrolyzed by {{commonly occurring}} beta-lactamases. Nevertheless, it was possible, by mutagenesis and selection, to isolate mutant strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus rettgeri {{that are highly}} resistant to meropenem and imipenem. Two alterations were noted in the E. cloacae mutants. First, the mutant strains appeared to be strongly derepressed {{in the production of}} beta-lactamases, which reached a very high level when the strains were grown in the presence of imipenem. Second, these mutants were deficient in the production of nonspecific porins, as judged by the pattern of outer membrane proteins as well as by reconstitution assays of permeability. As with most porin-deficient mutants, their cultures were unstable, and their cultivation in the absence of carbapenems rapidly led to an overgrowth of porin-producing revertants. Analysis of the data suggests that the synergism between the lowered outer membrane permeability and the slow but significant hydrolysis of carbapenems by the overproduced enzymes can explain the resistance phenotypes quantitatively, although the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> of the target cannot be excluded at present. With P. rettgeri mutants, there was no indication of further derepression of beta-lactamase, but the enzyme hydrolyzed imipenem much more efficiently than the E. cloacae enzyme did. In addition, the major porin was absent in one mutant strain. These results suggest that a major factor for the carbapenem resistance of these enteric bacteria is the porin deficiency, and this conclusion forms a contrast to the situation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which the most prevalent class of imipenem-resistant mutants appears to lack the specific channel protein D 2 yet retains the major nonspecific porin F...|$|E

We aimed to perform microscopic comparison of muscle and tendon fibres from fresh cadavers (FC), formaldehyde-preserved cadavers (FPC) and cadavers conserved by Thiel's method (TC). Methods Muscle and tendon biopsies performed on FC, FPC and TC were conditioned and stained by Masson's trichrome, Sirius red and Ramon y Cajal, then studied under optical microscope. Alignment {{and integrity of}} the muscle and tendon fibres were studied.

40|$|Introduction & Objectives: Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that induction of two kidney-one clip (2 K 1 C) Goldblatt hypertension in rats eliminates hypertensive response after inactivating of the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala (CA). The present study investigated the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> in local Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) activity in CA after hypertension induction and evaluation of cardiovascular response to Renin Substrate (RS) microinjection into CA in Wistar rats. Materials & Methods: Clamps {{were placed on the}} left renal arteries to induce 2 K 1 C Goldblatt hypertension. A similar surgery procedure without clipping was done in sham group. Rats were studied eight weeks after surgery. The Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured directly with indwelling arterial cannula under urethane anesthesia. Rats received bilateral cannulation of the CA for RS microinjection. After bilateral microinjection of consecutive doses of RS (0. 5 µL- 0. 1, 1 & 10 µM) saline and pretreatment of losartan (10 µM), saralasin(1 nM) or captopril(10 µM) before RS into CA, MAP and HR measured and compared between groups. Results: Bilateral microinjection of consecutive doses of RS into CA increased MAP and HR significantly greater in hypertensive group in comparison with normotensive ones (P< 0. 001). Bilateral microinjection of saralasin and losartan into the CA of Goldblatt hypertensive rats produced significant decrease in MAP and HR from baseline levels. After pretreatment of saralasin, losartan and captopril effects of 1 µM RS microinjection into CA of all groups were inhibited. Conclusion: These results are functionally demonstration of cardiovascular effects of RS after microinjection into CA and that effects have increased after 2 K 1 C hypertension induction. This process may contribute in Goldblatt hypertension pathogenesis. Increased Angiotensin II (AngII) receptors or accelerated proteolytic process of RS to Angiotensin I and II may alter RS microinjection into CA outcome...|$|E

The study has been done on normal and alloxan induced diabetic rabbits by keeping them 12 hrs fasting & water ad lib. Glibenclamide was given in a dose of 50 µg/kg body weight & Nicorandil was administered in a dose of 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 µg/kg body weight concurrently. The drugs were given by oral route. Normal saline treated rabbits were used as control. Blood samples were collected from marginal ear vein & BGL was estimated in the process described by Hultmann. The statistical significance was calculated by employing student “t ” test.

The purified extracellular domain of FGFR- 1 formed complexes with 125 I-bFGF both in {{the presence or absence of}} heparin. Intact FGFR- 1 expressed in 32 D cells also bound the same amount of 125 I-bFGF in the presence or absence of heparin when saturating concentrations of bFGF were used. Varying the concentration of 125 I-bFGF showed that heparin increased the amount of 125 I-bFGF bound at low bFGF concentrations and increased the affinity of bFGF for its receptor by about 3 -fold. To eliminate the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> of bFGF properties through the chemical modification reactions, bFGF was labeled biosynthetically. The binding of biosynthetically labeled bFGF to FGFR- 1 also did not require heparin. When FGFR- 1 or FGFR- 2 were expressed in mutant CHO cells deficient in heparan sulfate synthesis, the cells also bound 125 I-bFGF in the absence of heparin, and the addition of heparin increased the affinity of bFGF for its receptors 2 - 3 -fold. Thus, heparin or heparan sulfate is not required for the binding of bFGF to its receptors but increases the binding affinity to a moderate degree. Finally, the requirement for heparin in signal transduction through the receptor was investigated.

Three of these incidents can be linked to a defined geographical region, while the fourth is likely to be linked. In this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of strains from these incidents was used for genomic comparisons using two approached. The first was JSpecies tetramer, which analyzed tetranucleotide frequency to assess relatedness. The second, the CFSAN SNP Pipeline, was used to perform WGS SNP analyses against three different reference genomes to evaluate relatedness by SNP distances.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit hat das Ziel, eine Lektüre Judith Butler als einer politische Theoretikerin zu präsentieren. Dies impliziert erstens die Forderung nach einer Aufnahme Butlers in den Kanon der politischen Theorie und inkludiert zweitens die weiterführende These, dass Butlers Werk selbst als immanent politisch zu verstehen ist. Bei der Untersuchung von Butlers Beitrag zur politischen Theorie konzentriert sich diese Arbeit auf zwei zentrale Themenfelder: 1. Butlers Konzeption des politischen Subjekts und 2. ihre Theorie der Performativität und der Iterabilität. Während das Subjekt traditionell in der politischen Theorie keine bedeutende Rolle spielt, fordert Butlers Werk eine Wiedereinführung des Subjekts in die Analyse von Politik, indem sie zeigt, dass das Subjekt keineswegs der Politik vorgängig ist, sondern dass die Konstitution des Subjekts vielmehr als eine zentrale politische Angelegenheit begriffen werden muss. Durch ihre Enthüllung, dass subtile, aber sehr wirkungsvolle Machtformen bereits in der Konstitution des Subjekts am Werk sind, ermöglicht Butler eine Erweiterung von Macht- und Herrschaftsanalysen um Dimensionen der Subjektkonstitution. In diesem Zusammenhang ist vor allem ihr Konzept normativer Gewalt beachtenswert, das dazu dient, die Gewalt hervorzuheben, welche von den die Sphäre der sozialen Intelligibilität regulierenden Normen auf jene ausgeübt wird, die vom Feld der intelligiblen Subjekte ausgeschlossen sind. Diese Arbeit schlägt vor, Butlers Konzept der Performativität vor dem Hintergrund einer Hegemonietheorie einer Relektüre zu unterziehen, indem die These vertreten wird, dass das Konzept der Performativität nur dann angemessen verstanden werden kann, wenn es in Zusammenhang mit der Macht der hegemonialen Normen bedacht wird. Zugleich gilt es zu berücksichtigen, dass weder Macht noch Normen statische Entitäten sind, sondern auf ihre ständige Wiederholung angewiesen bleiben, um in ihrem Status bestehen zu können. Die daraus folgende, prinzipielle Iterabilität liefert eine Erklärung für die Möglichkeit von sozialem und politischem Wandel. Das Subjekt ist der Ort dieser Wiederholung und entsprechend stellt die Handlungsfähigkeit des Subjekts auch den Ort möglichen Wandels dar. Handlungsfähigkeit wird dabei nicht als eine intrinsische Eigenschaft des Subjekts gedacht, sondern als eine Möglichkeit, die in politischen Kontexten errungen und bewahrt werden muss. Ziel ist die Resignifizierung des Subjekts als einer kritische Kategorie der politischen Theorie, um Untersuchung der sozialen Bedingungen der Möglichkeit von Handlungsfähigkeit in konkreten politischen Kontexten zu ermöglichen. Butlers Herausforderung der traditionellen politischen Theorie zwingt schließlich dazu, neue Wege zu suchen, um über Politik nachzudenken. Butler vertritt ein Projekt der Denaturalisierung, das heißt sie zeigt, dass sogar die Grundlagen der Politik selbst durchgängig politisch sind. Daher kann das Projekt der Denaturalisierung auch als eine Strategie radikaler Politisierung charakterisiert werden. Für das Konzept von Politik, dass aus dieser Kontingenz aller politischen Kategorien und deren entsprechender Offenheit für ständige Anfechtung und Resignifizierung folgt, schlägt diese Arbeit den Titel einer Politik der Resignifizierbarkeit vor. The aim of {{this inquiry}} is to present a reading of Judith Butler as a {{political}} theorist. That implies, first, to support the claim that Butler should be included into the canon of political theory. Second, it means to suggest that politics {{is at the core}} of Butler’s work. In order to discuss Butler’s challenging contribution to political theory, the inquiry focusses on two main themes: 1. Butler’s account of the political subject and 2. her theory of performativity and iterability. Whereas the subject traditionally does not play a significant role in political theory, Butler’s work asks for a reintroduction of the subject into the realm of politics and political analysis by showing that the subject is not prior to politics, but rather that the constitution of the subject is a major political concern. She reveals that subtle, but very forceful forms of power are already at work in the constitution of the subject. Thereby, she makes it possible to expand the scope of an analyses of power and domination to the critical investigation of processes of subject formation. In this context, her notion of normative violence is meant to highlight the violence enforced by the norms that define the realm of social intelligibility on those that are excluded from counting as intelligible subjects. This inquiry suggests to reread Butler’s notion of performativity in the light of a theory of hegemony. In other words, it claims that performativity can only be adequately understood when regarded in connection with the power of the hegemonic norms. At the same time, neither power nor the norms are static entities, rather, they are dependent on a permanent reiteration in order to sustain there status. The principal iterability that follows from this necessity of reiteration offers an explanation of the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> and social and political change. The subject is the site of this reiteration and, thus, the subject’s agency is also the site of possible alteration. In this context, agency is not thought as an inner capacity of the subject, but as a possibility that needs to be achieved and secured in political contexts. In other words, the aim is a resignification of the political subject as a critical category of political theory in order to investigate into the social conditions of possibility of agency in concrete political contexts. Finally, Butler’s challenge of traditional political theory forces us to consider new ways to think about politics itself. Butler supports a project of denaturalization, that means, she shows that even the foundations of politics are themselves political. Hence, the project of denaturalization can be characterized as a strategy of radical politicization. This inquiry labels the notion of politics that follows from the contingency and ungroundedness of all political categories and their corresponding openness for permanent contestation and resignification as a politics of resignifiability...|$|E

This organism may be present on human tissue and could pose medical problems if its endopeptidase and a hemolysin were to be produced in ususually high quantities or altered {{in such a way}} as to be more effective in their activities. Considered are: (1) Development of a nutrative holding medium for suspension of organisms; (2) the establishment of baseline information for the standardization of the assay for endopeptidase levels and hemolytic titers; (3) formulation of a method by which intracutaneous hemorrhage could be quantitated in guinea pig tissue; and (4) the responses of these organisms to parameters of spaceflight and experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Proteomics is {{performed}} in microgravity research {{in order to}} determine protein alterations occurring qualitatively and quantitatively, when single cells or whole organisms are exposed to real or simulated microgravity. To this purpose, antibody-dependent (Western blotting, flow cytometry, Luminex (R) technology) and antibody-independent (mass spectrometry, gene array) techniques are applied. The anticipated findings will help to understand microgravity-specific behavior, which has been observed in bacteria, as well as in plant, animal and human cells. To date, the analyses revealed that cell cultures are more sensitive to microgravity than cells embedded in organisms and that proteins changing under microgravity are highly interactive. Furthermore, one has to distinguish between primary gravity-induced and subsequent interaction-dependent changes of proteins, as well as between direct microgravity-related effects and indirect stress responses. Progress in this field will impact on tissue engineering and medicine and will uncover <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> counteracting <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> protein expression at lowered gravity...|$|R

The conventional mineral processing methods such as screening and gravity separation in Humphrey spiral were used with the aim to concentrate the amorphous phase of fly-ash. Subsequently, the samples of ash and separation products of fly-ash were subjected to zeolitization. The degree of zeolitization has been valuated by {{the determination of the}} ion-exchange capacity of obtained zeolites, which was compared to a standard.
