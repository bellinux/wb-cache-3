500|$|Music halls, {{where both}} Nan and Kitty are employed—and put on display—as male impersonators, allow {{about half the}} novel's action and {{commentary}} on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers {{for the first time}} to perform as Kitty's partner and realises the impact of their double act together, she states, [...] "whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy". Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London [...] "swells": gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun <b>poked</b> <b>at</b> the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves. Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.|$|E
500|$|The {{youngest}} {{sister of}} the [...] "precious Jackson clan", Janet Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael {{and the rest of}} the Jackson family. Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that [...] "he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as <b>poked</b> <b>at,</b> gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys." [...] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, [...] "or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a [...] "superstar" [...] in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while [...] "successfully [...] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult." [...] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the [...] "Queen of Pop". Klein argued that [...] "stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.".|$|E

60|$|Moore was a {{left handed}} hitter, who choked his bat up short, and <b>poked</b> <b>at</b> the ball. He {{was a good}} bunter, and swift on his feet.
