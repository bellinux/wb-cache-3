25|$|Since South Wangtong Island was unfortified by the Chinese, the British set up {{a battery}} there to target the forts on North Wangtong Island, which would also {{distract}} {{attention away from the}} upcoming attack on Anunghoy. Shortly after midday on 25 February, the Nemesis embarked 130 troops of the 37th Madras Native Infantry (MNI) to assist in erecting a mortar battery on the island. In the evening, Capt. W. J. Birdwood of the Madras Sappers and fellow engineer officers, with a working party of Royal and Madras Artillery, covered by the 37th MNI, erected a sand bag battery on a saddle {{in the middle of the}} island. Two 8-inch iron and one 24-pounder brass howitzer were <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position.</b> During construction, the North Wangtong batteries fired during much of the night but their shots passed mostly above the site and slackened towards 2:00 am.|$|E
500|$|On October 6, {{a cannon}} that was dubbed the [...] "Old Sow" [...] arrived from Ticonderoga. <b>Put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> the next day, it started lobbing shells at the fort. Montgomery then began {{planning}} {{the placement of}} a second battery. While he first wanted to place one to the northwest of the fort, his staff convinced him instead to place {{on the eastern shore}} of the Richelieu, where it would command the shipyard and Royal Savage. [...] This battery, whose construction was complicated by an armed row galley sent from the fort to oppose the works, was completed on October 13, and opened fire the next day. [...] One day after that, Royal Savage lay in ruins before the fort. Its commander had, in anticipation of her destruction, ordered her to be anchored where her supplies and armaments might be recovered.|$|E

60|$|Therefore Général Marchand, {{taking all}} these facts into consideration, {{made up his}} mind to await the ogre inside the walls of Grenoble. Here at any rate defections and desertions {{would be less likely to}} occur than in the field. He set to work to organise the city into a state of defence; forty-seven guns were <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> upon the ramparts which {{dominate}} the road to the south, and he sent a company of engineers and a battalion of infantry to blow up the bridge of Ponthaut at La Mure.|$|E
60|$|I had {{established}} a depot of supplies at Perkins' plantation. Now that all our gunboats were below Grand Gulf {{it was possible that}} the enemy might fit out boats in the Big Black with improvised armament and attempt to destroy these supplies. McPherson was at Hard Times with a portion of his corps, and the depot was protected by a part of his command. The night of the 29th I directed him to arm one of the transports with artillery and send it up to Perkins' plantation as a guard; and also to have the siege guns we had brought along moved there and <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{first day}} {{was spent in}} getting out planks and lining the {{proposed}} shaft, which was made {{much smaller than the}} hole already dug, which extended over the whole of the two claims. The next day a windlass was <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position,</b> and the work began in earnest. At the depth of twenty feet they came upon gravel, a result which greatly raised their spirits, as its character was precisely similar to that in the bed of the stream, and showed that Frank's conjecture was a correct one, and that the river had at one time flowed along the foot of the high ground beyond.|$|E
60|$|This {{they did}} with the vapour banks near us, {{as we saw in}} the starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had returned. From there we could see the {{searchlights}} on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> there. These continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.|$|E
60|$|The {{advance of}} the Army of the Potomac reached the James on the 14th of June. Preparations were at once {{commenced}} for laying the pontoon bridges and crossing the river. As already stated, I had previously ordered General Butler to have two vessels loaded with stone and carried up the river to a point above that occupied by our gunboats, where the channel was narrow, and sunk there so as to obstruct the passage and prevent Confederate gunboats from coming down the river. Butler had had these boats filled and <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position,</b> but had not had them sunk before my arrival. I ordered this done, and also directed that he should turn over all material and boats not then in use in the river {{to be used in}} ferrying the troops across.|$|E

6000|$|... “Early on {{the morning}} of July 1st Lawton was in {{position}} around El Caney, Chaffee’s brigade on the right across the Guantanamo road, Miles’s brigade in the centre and Ludlow’s on the left. The duty of cutting off the enemy’s retreat along the Santiago road was assigned to the latter brigade. The artillery opened on the town at 6.15 A. M. The battle here soon became general, and was hotly contested. The enemy’s position was naturally strong, and was rendered more so by blockhouses, a stone fort and entrenchments cut in solid rock, and the loopholing of a solidly built stone church. The opposition offered by the enemy was greater than had been anticipated, and prevented Lawton from joining the right of the main line during the day, as had been intended. After the battle had continued for some time, Bates’s brigade of two regiments reached my headquarters from Siboney. I directed him to move near El Caney, to give assistance if necessary. He did so, and was <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> between Miles and Chaffee. The battle continued with varying intensity during most of the day and until the place was carried by assault about 4.30 P. M. As the Spaniards endeavoured to retreat along the Santiago road, Ludlow’s position enabled him to do very effective work, and practically to cut off all retreat in that direction.|$|E
60|$|The {{moment the}} troops were <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> to go into camp all the men {{connected}} with this branch of service would proceed to put up their wires. A mule loaded with a coil of wire would be led {{to the rear of}} the nearest flank of the brigade he belonged to, and would be led in a line parallel thereto, while one man would hold an end of the wire and uncoil it as the mule was led off. When he had walked the length of the wire the whole of it would be on the ground. This would be done in rear of every brigade at the same time. The ends of all the wires would then be joined, making a continuous wire in the rear of the whole army. The men, attached to brigades or divisions, would all commence at once raising the wires with their telegraph poles. This was done by making a loop in the wire and putting it over the spike and raising the pole to a perpendicular position. At intervals the wire would be attached to trees, or some other permanent object, so that one pole was sufficient at a place. In the absence of such a support two poles would have to be used, at intervals, placed at an angle so as to hold the wire firm in its place. While this was being done the telegraph wagons would take their positions near where the headquarters they belonged to were to be established, and would connect with the wire. Thus, in a few minutes longer time than it took a mule to walk the length of its coil, telegraphic communication would be effected between all the headquarters of the army. No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph.|$|E
6000|$|Verena Tarrant got up {{and went}} to her father in the middle of the room; Olive Chancellor crossed and resumed her place beside Mrs. Farrinder on the sofa the girl had quitted; and Miss Birdseye's visitors, for the rest, settled {{themselves}} attentively in chairs or leaned against the bare sides of the parlour. Verena took her father's hands, held them for a moment, while she stood before him, not looking at him, with her eyes towards the company; then, after an instant, her mother, rising, pushed forward, with an interesting sigh, the chair on which she had been sitting. Mrs. Tarrant was provided with another seat, and Verena, relinquishing her father's grasp, placed herself in the chair, which Tarrant <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> for her. She sat there with closed eyes, and her father now rested his long, lean hands upon her head. Basil Ransom watched these proceedings with much interest, for the girl amused and pleased him. She had far more colour than any one there, for whatever brightness was to be found in Miss Birdseye's rather faded and dingy human collection had gathered itself into this attractive but ambiguous young person. There was nothing ambiguous, by the way, about her confederate; Ransom simply loathed him, from the moment he opened his mouth; he was intensely familiar--that is, his type was; he was simply the detested carpet-bagger. He was false, cunning, vulgar, ignoble; the cheapest kind of human product. That he should be the father of a delicate, pretty girl, who was apparently clever too, whether she had a gift or no, this was an annoying, disconcerting fact. The white, puffy mother, with the high forehead, in the corner there, looked more like a lady; but if she were one, it was all the more shame to her to have mated with such a varlet, Ransom said to himself, making use, as he did generally, of terms of opprobrium extracted from the older English literature. He had seen Tarrant, or his equivalent, often before; he had [...] "whipped" [...] him, as he believed, controversially, again and again, at political meetings in blighted Southern towns, during the horrible period of reconstruction. If Mrs. Farrinder had looked at Verena Tarrant as if she were a mountebank, there was some excuse for it, inasmuch as the girl made much the same impression on Basil Ransom. He had never seen such an odd mixture of elements; she had the sweetest, most unworldly face, and yet, with it, an air of being on exhibition, of belonging to a troupe, of living in the gaslight, which pervaded even the details of her dress, fashioned evidently with an attempt at the histrionic. If she had produced a pair of castanets or a tambourine, he felt that such accessories would have been quite in keeping.|$|E
