6000|$|The Webbites do {{not deny}} the broad facts of the case. Our present electoral system, with our big modern {{constituencies}} of thousands of voters, leads to huge turnovers of political power with a relatively small shifting of public opinion. It makes a mock of public opinion by caricature, and Parliament becomes the distorting mirror of the nation. Under some loud false issue a few score of thousands of votes turn over, and in goes this party or that with a big sham majority. This the Webbites admit. But they applaud it. It gives us, they say, [...] "a strong Government." [...] Public opinion, the intelligent man outside the House, is ruled out of the game. He has no <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> at all. The artful little Fabian politicians rub their hands and say, [...] "Now {{we can get to}} work with the wires! No one can stop us." [...] And when the public complains of the results, there is always the repartee, [...] "You elected them." [...] But the Fabian psychology is the psychology of a very small group of pedants who believe that fair ends may be reached by foul means. It is much easier and more natural to serve foul ends by foul means. In practice it is not tricky benevolence but tricky bargaining among the interests that will secure control of the political wires. That is a bad enough state of affairs in ordinary times, but in times of tragic necessity like the present men will not be mocked in this way. Life {{is going to be very}} intense in the years ahead of us. If we go right on to another caricature Parliament, with perhaps half a hundred leading men in it and the rest hacks and nobodies, the baffled and discontented outsiders in the streets may presently be driven to rioting and the throwing of bombs. Unless, indeed, the insurrection of the outsiders takes a still graver form, and the Press, which has ceased entirely to be a Party Press in Great Britain, helps some adventurous Prime Minister to flout and set aside the lower House altogether. There is neither much moral nor much physical force behind the House of Commons at the present time.|$|E

Those two values may be very different, their relationship depending on the properties of the diagnostic test applied and true prevalence of the disease in a population. Methods We defined a new test parameter, the ratio of Test to Actual Positives (TAP), which summarizes the properties of the diagnostic test applied and true prevalence of the disease in a population, and propose that is the most useful summary measure of the potential for bias in disease frequency estimates. Results A consideration {{of the relationship between the}} sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the diagnostic test and the true prevalence of disease in a population can inform study design by highlighting the potential for disease misclassification bias. The effects of a decrease in Sp on the TAP ratio at very low disease prevalence are dramatic, as at 80 % Sp (and any Se value including 100 %), the measured disease frequency will represent a 25 -fold overestimate. At a disease prevalence of 0. 10, the Sp needs to be 90 % or greater to achieve a TAP ratio of 1. 0. However, unlike at lower levels of disease prevalence, the test Se is also an important determinant of the TAP ratio. A TAP ratio of 1. 0 can be achieved by a Sp of 95 % and intermediate Se (40 %- 60 %); or a Sp of 99 % and very high Se (over 90 %). This illustrates how a test with poor performance characteristics in a clinical setting can perform well in a disease burden study in a population.

Specifically, the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959 and Building Societies Act, 1960 gave the Registrar of Friendly Societies new <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> and these were used to discipline building societies revealing inadequate use of their funds. Although {{only a tiny fraction}} of existing societies were ultimately sanctioned, they all observed important deviations from specified accounting-based criteria that were generally recognized as financially sound within the industry. Intervention, however, was also motivated by two other factors: the successful lobbying by the Building Society Association to discipline non-members; and attempts by the Registrar to stop property developers from abusing moribund London-based societies. Results provide enough evidence to suggest that other studies' assessment that managers of British retail financial intermediaries disregarded accounting information in executive decisions need to be revised in light of the fact that the accounting control of building societies was supplemented by the disciplinary power granted to state regulators (as represented by the Treasury and the Registrar of Friendly Societies).

In particular, the corporatist analysis provides a framework for exploring the use of accounting-based regulation to discipline those depository financial institutions that depart from industry norms. Empirical support built upon the legislation enacted in 1959 and 1960 which set performance parameters for building societies and gave the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies new <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> These <b>powers</b> and parameters were used together with accounting ratios (which were generally recognised as financially sound within the industry) to discipline building societies.

Despite the role of these bodies as enforcers of privacy and data protection legislation, Surveillance Studies has so far offered little attention to their role in resistance. Based on a critical socio-legal examination of the Norwegian Data Inspectorate, the focus of this article is on the role of data protection authorities in resisting surveillance and threats to privacy and data protection. More specifically, the article asks what power the Norwegian Data Inspectorate has to achieve genuine resistance, and how its institutional structure affects this capability. Through a three-pronged analysis consisting of (i) institutional mapping, (ii) a typology of resistance strategies, and (iii) a review of its role in the Norwegian public debate on the EU Data Retention Directive, the article addresses the fundamental tension inherent in the Norwegian Data Inspectorate as a privacy-advocating ombudsman and an administrative body.

Would the resulting instrument be likely to generate more appropriate ways of dealing with labour situations, whether or not they pertain to a collective bargaining context ? Adjective as well as substantive law would have to be involved in such an exercise. The latter aspect raises the fundamental issue of the proper relationship between the general law — civil law essentially — and labour law. What degree of autonomy is necessary to the integrity of the specialized law ? Conversely, to what extent is the general law to be relied upon to provide the necessary second-line set of legal provisions ? For instance, the two sets of legal rules entertain different views as to the termination of the employment relationship and as to the effect of a collective agreement.

40|$|Les {{modifications}} apportées au Code canadien du travail par le législateur en 1978 ont considérablement accru le pouvoir de manoeuvre du CCRT. L'auteur fait ici une analyse et un bilan de ces trois années d'expérience. The author {{discusses the}} various means <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> {{available to the}} CLRB when it receives applications for a declaration of unlawful strike or lockout under the provisions of theCode. As a result of amendments to theCode in June 1978, the CLRB enjoys considerable discretionary power in choosing the methods it may apply in resolving a labour dispute. Consequently, the CLRB has, {{in addition to the}} <b>power</b> <b>of</b> declaring that a strike or lockout is, was or would be unlawful in certain cases, the power to issue cease and desist orders, to consent to prosecute or in cases of noncompliance is empowered to file the said order with the Federal Court. However, in numerous disputes, it appears that a CLRB order would not be required if an effort were made to bring the parties themselves to settle the dispute which could have led to certain unlawful actions. The labour relations officers of the CLRB are immediately sent on the spot in an attempt to assist the parties in reaching a settlement. The mediation techniques used to date have been successful to a certain degree in the peaceful settlement of labour disputes. When the CLRB is required to intervene in a more direct fashion, it attempts to discover through its investigation, the underlying causes of the possible unlawful actions in order to prescribe appropriate remedies which in most cases do not address themselves solely to re-establishing the status quo ante. The author gives a practical illustration of how these means <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> are felt, through an in-depth analysis of the Board's decisions. In theCanadian Broadcasting Corporation case, which is considered in detail among other cases in this article, the CLRB issued a cease and desist order after determining that a work stoppage was illegal and could have harmful effects not only on the Corporation from a production standpoint but also on the balance <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the parties at the bargaining table. In addition to issuing this order, the Board decided to prescribe certain special remedies to neutralize the causes of the ills it had identified. The Board consequently ordered the parties, among other things, to refer the specific problem of the interpretation of their collective agreement to accelerated arbitration. This particular part of the order issued by the CLRB inCBC was nevertheless revoked by the Federal Court of Appeal on April 8, 1981. In his article, the author anticipates certain possible future controversies concerning the CLRB's <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> should this Federal Court judgment be upheld. The author concludes that in view of the special nature <b>of</b> the Board's <b>powers</b> in this area, intervention {{on the part of the}} CLRB should not be equated with the jurisdiction exercised by Common Law courts when they are called upon to issue injunctions in the case of certain labour disputes...|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} innovation systems (TIS) framework provides a theory to understand {{under what conditions}} {{technological innovation}}s are successfully developed and implemented. The objective of this dissertation is to further strengthen this TIS intervention framework, which {{is the part of}} the TIS theoretical framework that facilitates the identification of inhibiting problems and the formulation <b>of</b> <b>interventions.</b> Theoretical adaptations and extensions are proposed and their merits subsequently explored during case studies that relate to the empirical domain of energy-efficient housing in the Netherlands. To start with, although the framework emphasizes the dynamic nature of the innovation process, problems are conceptualized and commonly analyzed as independent entities. During a case study of newly-built energy-efficient houses in the Netherlands, it is explored whether giving explicit attention to problem interactions yields contrasting or additional insights compared to an analysis of independent problems. It is found that problems may together form a problematic mechanism, and that intervention on all the problems that form the mechanism is then of little value and can even be counterproductive. Secondly, the TIS intervention framework currently does not provide the theoretical means for coping with inconsistent opinions on what the problems and best interventions are. The merits of taking a subjectivist view that allows multiple ‘truths’ about problems and solutions to coexist are explored during a case study of the Dutch innovation system of renovating houses energy efficiently. It is found that there are two viewpoints on renovation prominent that have their origin in two distinct ‘institutional logics’, namely the so-called ‘steps logic’ that leads to renovation in consecutive steps and the ‘leaps-logic’ that leads to renovation in a single leap. These institutional logics explain why actors are perceiving different problems and are also proposing different solutions for this innovation system. Thirdly, in literature it is often mentioned that the sector tends to form a relatively stable environment for TISs. However, it is found that the success of the heat pump in the Netherlands (and the type of heat pump) depends much on how the current debate on what renovation approach to follow plays out (either in consecutive steps or in a single leap). As this debate developed autonomously at sectoral level, it is concluded that sectoral context may also form a rather unstable environment for TISs. Finally, the question what type <b>of</b> <b>intervention,</b> or set <b>of</b> <b>interventions,</b> is likely to have a large impact on improving the functioning of an innovation system remains unanswered. The objective was set to lay a preliminary foundation for a conceptual framework based on an idea from systems thinking theory, namely that the transformational <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> relates to the characteristics of the points in a system where the intervention acts upon. This reasoning is used to create a preliminary ranking <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> for the TIS framework. Through a case study of highly energy-efficient houses it is illustrated how the ranking can be used as addition to an innovation systems analysis...|$|R
40|$|Dozer, MaryIn a {{randomized}} clinical trial, we assessed whether a brief parenting intervention reduced telomere loss among children adopted internationally. Children (around 2 years old) adopted into {{families in the}} United States {{were randomly assigned to}} one <b>of</b> two <b>intervention</b> conditions. The parents of children assigned to the experimental intervention received Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up, a 10 -session intervention targeting parental nurturance and sensitivity; parents of children in the control intervention condition received an <b>intervention</b> <b>of</b> the same duration, length, and frequency that targeted cognitive and physical development. A third non-randomized group was included with no intervention component. When assessed at about 5 years of age, children whose parents received the experimental intervention had longer telomeres (T/S ratio) than children in the other two groups. These results highlight the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> a brief <b>intervention</b> in remediating biological effects of early deprivation and indicate that experimental manipulation of telomere length is possible.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the conceptual foci and methodological characteristics of research projects which tested the effects <b>of</b> nursing <b>interventions,</b> published in four general nursing research journals with predominantly North American, and two with predominantly European/International authorship and readership. Dimensions and variables of comparison included: nature of subjects, design issues, statistical methodology, statistical <b>power,</b> and types <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> and outcomes. Although some differences emerged, {{the most striking}} and consistent finding {{was that there were}} no statistically significant differences (and thus similarities) in the content foci and methodological parameters <b>of</b> the <b>intervention</b> studies published in both groups of journals. We conclude that European/International and North American nursing intervention studies, as reported in major general nursing research journals, are highly similar in the parameters studied, yet in need of overall improvement. Certainly, there is no empirical support for the common (explicit or implicit) ethnocentric American bias that leadership in nursing intervention research resides with and in the United States of America. status: publishe...|$|R
