25|$|Though Carson's {{program was}} based in Burbank {{beginning}} in 1972, NBC's editing and <b>production</b> <b>services</b> for the program were located in New York, resulting in the requirement that Carson's program be transmitted from Burbank to New York.

This live feed lasted usually from two to two-and-a-half hours a night and was uncensored and commercial-free.

25|$|Disney's Hollywood Studios {{initially}} opened {{as both a}} {{theme park}} and an operating production studio, with active film and television <b>production</b> <b>services,</b> an animation facility branch, and a functioning backlot. To increase public interest and the variety of film representation within the park, Disney entered into a licensing agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, wherein the park's original name was derived. The park's current name took effect in 2008, with {{the removal of the}} MGM-branding throughout the park. The park's icon was originally the Earffel Tower from the park's opening until 2001 when the Sorcerer's Hat—a stylized version of the magical hat from Fantasia—was erected in the park's central hub. It then served as the park's icon until its removal in January 2015. The tower was subsequently removed in April 2016. Currently, the park remains without an official designated icon, although both The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and The Chinese Theatre are represented as such in marketing materials.|$|E

40|$|Product Service System (PSS) advocates an {{innovative}} business mode where manufacturers provide {{products in the}} form of services instead of mere entity offerings. This mode not only enhances the utilization rate of products and resources, but also improves the service levels throughout the whole product lifecycle. PSS extension to manufacturing environment results in <b>Production</b> <b>Service</b> System (PnSS), which forms a hierarchically organized service-oriented manufacturing alliance composed of manufacturers/suppliers with various <b>production</b> <b>service</b> capabilities to collaborate a customer order. The process of selecting the optimal <b>production</b> <b>service</b> providers for a PnSS is called <b>Production</b> <b>Service</b> System Configuration (PnSSC). It is difficult to apply a centralized optimization method for a PnSSC problem because the members participating into the PnSS are uncertain while most of them are not willing to submit their decision details to the centralized decision model. This paper therefore proposes an Analytical Target Cascading (ATC) based distributed configuration system, atcPortal, for PnSSC. Each service provider models their production capabilities as a web service hosted at local end while published at atcPortal, while the embedded ATC mechanism will coordinate all the related services to formulate the optimal PnSSC for a given customer order. This distributed optimization system avoids centralized modeling and optimization process and thus protects enterprise privacy. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 6 th International Conference On Digital Enterprise Technology (DET 2009), Hong Kong, 14 - 16 December.
