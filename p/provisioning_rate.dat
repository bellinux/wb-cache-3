Aims To investigate nesting and foraging ecology in a declining farmland bird whose fledging success {{is influenced by}} the availability of invertebrate prey suitable for feeding to offspring, and where perceived predation risk during foraging can be mediated by vegetation structure. Methods Provisioning rates of adult Yellowhammers feeding nestlings were measured at nests on arable farmland. Foraging sites were compared with control sites of both the same and different microhabitats; <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> was related to habitat features of foraging-sites. Results Foraging sites had low vegetation density, probably enhancing detection of predators, or high invertebrate abundance at high vegetation density. Parental <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> decreased with increasing vegetation cover at foraging sites with high invertebrate abundance; conversely, where invertebrate abundance was low, <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> increased with increasing vegetation cover. Conclusions Vegetation structure at foraging sites suggests that a trade-off between predator detection and prey availability influences foraging site selection in Yellowhammers. Associations between parental <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> and vegetation variables suggest that where invertebrate abundance is high birds increase time spent scanning for predators at higher vegetation densities; however, when prey are scarce, adults may take more risks to provide food for their young...|$|E
40|$|I {{investigated}} the short-term regulation of parental <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> in blue tits by videotaping the {{parents at the}} nest. An additional feeding experiment allowed a comparison between the behaviour of parents rearing their brood under normal and supplemented feeding conditions. Videotaping revealed that parents changed their <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> as an immediate response {{to the absence of}} begging by chicks. When chicks did not beg for food, the parents solicited them with a particular call to make them open their beaks. Parents spent significantly longer away from the nest immediately after uttering these feeding calls. <b>Provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> returned to the usual levels as soon as the chicks started begging again, but supplemented parents took less time to do so than controls (i. e. parents not provided with additional food). Changes in <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> had effects on both the type and size of prey brought to the brood. Females often responded to low brood demand by returning to the nest without food. Food-supplemented parents, but not controls, took larger larvae when they stayed away from the nest for longer. This suggests that parents in the supplemented group could use more time to reach good feeding sites or, more probably, increase their prey selectivity. Blue tits continually monitored the begging behaviour of their offspring and responded accordingly by adjusting their feeding rate, with immediate consequences for prey choice.

American Black Oystercatcher chick diet was comprised mainly of limpets.

40|$|In biparental birds, the {{relative}} {{contribution of the}} sexes to feeding their brood (provisioning share) is sometimes reported to vary with brood size. However, the explanation for changes in provisioning share are often ambiguous (particularly in correlational studies), while the variation in findings between studies remains poorly understood. In this study we examined how short-term, within-pair manipulations of brood size (reduced, original and enlarged) affected <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> in the fairy martin, Hirundo ariel. Following each manipulation, provisioning rates were monitored continuously for a two day period.

The absence of any change in provisioning share with brood demand suggests that alternative activities that could be traded-off against provisioning (e. g., self-maintenance) were similar for both sexes. Nevertheless, provisioning share may vary with the interval (i. e., hours, days, weeks) between the manipulation and measurement of provisioning, and these dynamics may contribute to explaining the inconsistent findings reported in the many previous studies examining the relationship between brood size and provisioning share. ...|$|E

Here we describe a study where we provided experimental pairs of Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) with supplementary food throughout the nest-building period and then quantified nest characteristics, incubation behaviours and nestling <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> at experimentally fed and unfed control nests. We have already reported that experimental females built heavier nests than unfed females and here we extend that study by showing that whilst hatching asynchrony and brood sizes at hatching did not differ between treatments, males at experimental nests provisioned their offspring at significantly higher rates than did males at control nests. As female <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> {{did not differ significantly}} between treatments, total parental <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> were higher at experimental nests, although brood sizes and the mass of nestlings at pre-fledging did not differ between treatments. This implies that when the energetic costs of nest construction were indirectly reduced via the provision of supplementary food, females responded by constructing larger nests.

Rockhopper Penguins from Staten Island performed longer trips throughout the breeding season than do other species of Eudyptes at several other locations.

Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced attributes of nesting behavior. Female nest attendance declined substantially with progression of the nesting cycle, while male attendance patterns were consistent throughout the nesting cycle. Further, although females typically performed most of the incubating, male attendance at the nest area varied considerably among breeding pairs. Both prey item delivery rates and estimated prey mass delivery rates increased with brood size. Prey item delivery rates per nestling, however, decreased with increasing brood size; yet estimated prey mass delivery rates per nestling did not vary with brood size. Peregrine Falcons apparently maintained constant <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> per nestling as brood size increased by increasing average prey size. We found evidence that nest attendance and time-activity budgets of Peregrine Falcons differed during periods of overflights compared with reference nests, but differences depended on stage of the nesting cycle and gender. Males had lower nest ledge attendance during periods when overflights occurred than males from reference nests when data from the incubation and early nestling-rearing stages of the nesting cycle were combined. Females apparently compensated for lower male ledge attendance by attending the ledge more during overflown periods compared to females from reference nests, although this trend was not significant. During late nestling-rearing, however, females perched in the nest area less during periods when overflights occurred than females from reference nests. We did not see a relationship between nest attendance and the number of overflights, the cumulative number of exposures experienced by each nesting pair, or the average sound exposure level of overflights.

40|$|Variation {{in early}} {{nutrition}} {{is often a}} strong predictor of offspring condition and fitness. In the case of woodland passerine birds, nestling diet {{is determined by the}} spatiotemporal distribution of prey items such as caterpillars during the nestling period, and is usually quantified as differences in provisioning behaviour between habitats.

Here we use nestbox cameras and Radio Frequency Identification technology (RFID) to simultaneously assess variation in both nestling diet (components) and <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> (quantity) among a sample (n= 22) of different quality great tit Parus major territories selected from a larger breeding population (n= 310 fledged broods) in a single year. Caterpillars were by far the most numerous item provisioned to nestlings (mean= 75 % of prey items), as expected given the known importance of this food source for this species. Broods raised close to an oak tree, or far from the woodland edge, were provisioned the highest proportion of caterpillars. <b>Provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> declined seasonally and there was a weak association between low <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> and caterpillar rich diets. During {{the first week of the}} nestling stage, nestling condition was unrelated to the proportion of caterpillars in the diet, <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> and oak proximity. Condition at fledging was slightly improved in broods fed a higher proportion of caterpillars in the diet and in broods raised close to an oak tree.

Analyses of long-term data (41 years) from the same population confirmed a relationship between oak proximity and fledgling mass, but not recruitment success.

40|$|Although theory {{developed}} to understand carer response rules in cooperative breeders typically predicts partial compensation, where additional investment by one carer is optimally met by incomplete reductions by the other, fully additive {{care is a}} viable alternative under particular conditions.

That, in a number of cooperative birds, at least one parent often maintains its level of contribution to offspring rearing independent of carer numbers is supportive, but experimental evidence is lacking.

40|$|Colonial {{breeding}} {{occurs in}} a wide range of taxa, however the advantages promoting its evolution and maintenance remain poorly understood. In many avian species, breeding colonies vary by several orders of magnitude and one approach to investigating the evolution of coloniality has been to examine how potential costs and benefits vary with colony size. Several hypotheses predict that foraging efficiency may improve with colony size, through benefits associated with social foraging and information exchange. However, it is argued that competition for limited food resources will also increase with colony size, potentially reducing foraging success. Here we use a number of measures (brood feeding rates, chick condition and survival, and adult condition) to estimate foraging efficiency in the fairy martin Petrochelidon ariel, across a range of colony sizes in a single season (17 colonies, size range 28 - 139 pairs). Brood provisioning rates were collected from multiple colonies simultaneously using an electronic monitoring system, controlling for temporal variation in environmental conditions. <b>Provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> was correlated with nestling condition, though we found no clear relationship between <b>provisioning</b> <b>rate</b> and colony size for either male or female parents. However, chicks were generally in worse condition and broods more likely to fail or experience partial loss in larger colonies. Moreover, the average condition of adults declined with colony size. Overall, these findings suggest that foraging efficiency declines with colony size in fairy martins, supporting the increased competition hypothesis. However, other factors, such as an increased ectoparasitise load in large colonies or change in the composition of phenotypes with colony size may have also contributed to these patterns. ...|$|E

It {{has been shown that}} failed pairs split and help at the nests of male relatives, recognition being established vocally. The helped nests have greater success due to higher <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> and better nest defence. At the end of the breeding season, in June-July, the birds reform the winter flocks in their winter territory.|$|R
30|$|One {{could ask}} why females choose already mated males given that these males {{are unable to}} provide {{sufficient}} food for second families. Korpimäki (1991) showed that polygynous males sufficiently feed their secondary females during courtship, egg laying, and incubation, but they often fail in provisioning after the young have hatched. Our findings also indicate that males had no trouble feeding their females during incubation but failed in provisioning {{at the time of}} nestlings. It was suggested that females of vole-eating birds including the Boreal Owl use <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> during courtship feeding as a cue for mate choice (Altenburg et al. 1982; Simmons 1988; Korpimäki 1991; Palokangas et al. 1992). Already paired Boreal Owl males occupying high-quality territories are able to 'imitate’ the <b>provisioning</b> <b>rates</b> at a similar level to an unmated male when a female is choosing a mate (Korpimäki 1991). However, females presumably cannot predict that their mates will provide little food during the nestling period, which results in poor reproduction success of secondary females (Korpimäki 1991). Finally, despite the poor reproductive success of secondary/tertiary nests, polygynous males gain substantial fitness benefits because they produce more fledglings in one breeding season than monogamous males (Korpimäki and Hakkarainen 2012).|$|R
40|$|<b>Provision</b> <b>rates</b> {{for surgery}} vary widely in {{relation}} to identifiable need, suggesting that reduction of this variation might be appropriate. The definition of unwarranted variation is difficult because the boundaries of acceptable practice are wide, and information about patient preference is lacking. Very little direct research evidence exists on the modification of variations in surgery rates, so inferences must be drawn from research on the alteration of overall rates. The available evidence has large gaps, which suggests that some proposed strategies produce only marginal change. Micro-level interventions target decision making that affects individuals, whereas macro-level interventions target health-care systems {{with the use of}} financial, regulatory, or incentivisation strategies. Financial and regulatory changes can have major effects on <b>provision</b> <b>rates,</b> but these effects are often complex and can include unintended adverse effects. The net effects of micro-level strategies (such as improvement of evidence and dissemination of evidence, and support for shared decision making) can be smaller, but better directed. Further research is needed to identify what level of variation in surgery rates is appropriate in a specific context, and how variation can be reduced where desirable...|$|R
