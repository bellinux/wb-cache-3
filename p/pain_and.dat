40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of relaxation techniques {{as a means}} of increasing <b>pain</b> threshold <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> tolerance <b>and</b> of decreasing anxiety was tested. Forty-two physiotherapy students were divided into experimental and control groups <b>and</b> tested on <b>pain</b> threshold, <b>pain</b> tolerance <b>and</b> anxiety. The 21 experimental group subjects were given one session of relaxation and then re-tested. Their results showed that a single session of relaxation significantly increased their <b>pain</b> threshold <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> tolerance <b>and</b> decreased their anxiety about the situation. No such changes were noted when the control group was re-tested...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: 1) to examine race and sex {{differences}} in primary <b>pain</b> appraisals <b>and</b> catastrophizing; 2) to test the unique ability of race, sex, primary <b>pain</b> appraisals, <b>and</b> catastrophizing to predict experimental <b>pain</b> outcomes; <b>and</b> 3) to conduct mediational analyses testing <b>pain</b> appraisals <b>and</b> catastrophizing as explanatory mechanisms for race and sex differences in <b>pain.</b> One hundred <b>and</b> fifty-five college students at The University of Alabama completed a cold pressor experimental <b>pain</b> task <b>and</b> a questionnaire battery. Statistical methods included multivariable regression models and nonparametric bootstrapping methods for tests of mediation. African-Americans reported higher catastrophizing <b>and</b> had lower <b>pain</b> tolerance than white Americans. Males demonstrated higher challenge appraisals, lower <b>pain</b> intensity, <b>and</b> longer <b>pain</b> tolerance. Challenge appraisals were positively related to pain tolerance, threat/harm appraisals {{were inversely related to}} <b>pain</b> tolerance, <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> catastrophizing was positively related to both <b>pain</b> intensity <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> unpleasantness. Pain catastrophizing partially mediated race differences in <b>pain</b> tolerance <b>and</b> mediated sex differences in intensity, whereas primary pain appraisals did not significantly mediate race or sex differences in pain variables. Primary appraisals and catastrophizing appear to be separable constructs related to different aspects of the pain experience...|$|R

5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. <b>Pain</b> <b>and</b> {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E

This study {{examined the relationship between}} <b>pain</b> perception <b>and</b> joint mobility in arthritis patients before and after total knee arthroplasty.

Visual analogue scales were used for pain intensity, <b>pain</b> distress <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> expectation; knee joint flexion as measured using a goniometer. Data were collected on 24 subjects preoperatively (T 1), immediately postoperatively (T 2) and forty-eight to seventy-two hours postoperatively (T 3). Twenty-four subjects participated in the study.
