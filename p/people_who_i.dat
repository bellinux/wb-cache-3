She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake.

500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M. When asked why the song paid {{a tribute to}} R.E.M.'s lead singer, Michael Stipe, Chris Martin said: [...] "I've lost all respect for fame, but I haven't lost all respect for respect. So the one great thing about being famous is that I get to meet <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> respect. Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master. I'll always look up to him." [...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion". [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalised.|$|E
500|$|Watts {{then took}} a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being {{introduced}} to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts {{decided to move to}} America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film Gross Misconduct, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts. Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. [...] "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> met through Nicole , who had been all over me, had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on." ...|$|E

And I don't want to name any names because they are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> respect but they were really, for some reason, very reticent to stand with us.

I do want to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, and I think I failed in that with this cartoon.

2500|$|King's {{switch from}} the BDO to rival {{organization}} the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) created much debate and controversy. During the 2007 BDO World Darts Championship {{there was much}} speculation that King and three fellow BDO players (Michael van Gerwen, Jelle Klaasen and Vincent van der Voort) would be switching to the PDC after the World Championships. King was angry that rumours had surfaced and even threatened to quit the tournament as the speculation heightened even stating, [...] "I'm really {{not happy with the}} treatment I've had today, not just from one person but from a lot of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> have known for many minutes". Despite claiming to BDO press officer Robert Holmes that he would [...] "rather eat raisins with teeth than play for the PDC" [...] King announced his switch to the PDC on 6 February 2007 in a bid to [...] "further his career". Having reached the semi-final of the 2007 BDO World Championships losing to eventual champion Martin Adams, King had signed a contract confirming he would play at the 2008 tournament due to a clause in all contracts of BDO players stating that if they reach the semi-finals of the World Championship they are obliged to return the following year, with champions committing themselves to three years. King's switch meant that the BDO threatened legal action against King.|$|E

And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
