The study is conducted in one of the socio-economically underprivileged areas of Dhaka, Capital of Bangladesh. For understanding the phenomenon of this study, main emphasis lays on the eight guiding principles of the International Child Development Program (ICDP), that is, the resource-based approach developed by Henning Rye and Karsten Hundeide in 1985, along with other related theories on attachment, humanism, systemic-ecology, and development. Qualitative case study design is chosen on the basis of the purpose of the study. Purposive sampling strategies are used for selecting the study area and participants. Three mother-child dyads are chosen in accordance with pre-decided criteria; the ages of children are under 8 -years as the focus of is delimited to early childhood. Observation and interview methods are used the data collection. As part of data collection, an observation protocol is designed in accordance with the eight themes of ICDP and an interview guide is developed from ICDP and other relevant literature. A total of 30 observation sessions approximately 90 minutes each and 03 interviews around 100 minutes each are recorded. Triangulation, prolonged field work, intensive note-taking, recording, brief follow-up interviews contribute to the accuracy of the study. Ethical issues are cautiously followed throughout the process. Data analyzing shows that all the eight themes of ICDP are found in this study. The three mothers show positive interactions with their children in terms of emotional, meaning, as well as regulative dialogues. In addition, the findings reveal that all the three mothers conceive their children in accordance with a humanistic point of view. Thus, they consider their children as respected <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> own <b>needs,</b> wishes, <b>skills,</b> temperament. The data also indicate influential contextual factors that identify how to learn child upbringing, what are the helpful and difficult conditions for interactions as well as how to manage such difficulties. As the mothers have similar background and live in the same area, they are pointed out resemble influential factors for interactions. These findings from Bangladesh show several similarities with equivalent studies in other countries, such as in Norway, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ethiopia, as well as with studies in family contexts and in school. Thus, this study adds to the examples of international studies confirming positive communication and mediation approaches across cultures. The findings indicate that a series of essential positive interaction patterns between caregiver and child are found. Further studies and innovation projects are suggested in order to validate these findings further as well as to strengthen these patterns amongst caregivers...|$|R

40|$|This master's thesis, {{entitled}} Visibility of {{non-governmental organisations}} in Slovenia among education experts dealing <b>with</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> special <b>needs,</b> explores non-governmental (non-profit) organisations in Slovenia that offer assistance {{and support to}} <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> special <b>needs</b> in the educational process. The theoretical part of the master's thesis explains the main theoretical concepts for {{better understanding of the}} entire thesis. It describes non-governmental organisations and their characteristics. Non-governmental organisations have different names, which is why the thesis defines: a society, an association of societies, an institute, a foundation, a centre and advisory centre, and an association. The master's thesis explores non-governmental organisations focusing on <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> special <b>needs.</b> The current Placement of Children <b>with</b> Special <b>Needs</b> Act, which has been in force since 2013, provides for 9 groups of children <b>with</b> special <b>needs.</b> The theoretical part briefly describes each group and explains how education of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> special <b>needs</b> is organised in Slovenia. Furthermore, it focuses on non-governmental organisations that help children <b>with</b> special <b>needs</b> <b>with</b> their education. One of the goals was to determine who are the experts in Slovene primary schools that work with children with special needs: are they just teachers or are they special school teachers? As for the empirical part of the master's thesis, it revolves around an online survey among people employed in education. The survey was sent to different schools around Slovenia. A total of 64 people responded. The online survey consisted of two parts. The first part was devoted to the experience of the experts with non-governmental organisations, i. e. what importance they attached to them, where they had found out about them, how many they knew, etc. The second part was a test to determine whether the experts recognised certain organisations or knew for which group of children those organisations were intended. ...|$|R
