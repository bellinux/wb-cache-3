In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 Gun Sight was introduced which made these guns even more effective; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II. They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier 40mm Bofors AA guns.|$|E

5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling <b>point</b> <b>being</b> so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the <b>point</b> <b>being</b> that after 10.g3 White is {{no longer able to}} bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4.|$|E
5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun, one of {{the most}} heavily produced anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War, entered service in 1941, and replaced the /90 M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis.

5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} the {{annoying}} bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? {{to be the best}} answer, one <b>point</b> <b>being</b> that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the other lines, can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, a case in <b>point</b> <b>being</b> the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of}} the world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1st centuryAD, the hill fort was {{destroyed}} (slighted) by the Romans. In the 4th6th centuriesAD, the hill fort was reoccupied and huts were {{built over the}} inner rampart.

Eddisbury has been suggested {{as the site of}} an Anglo-Saxon burh built in 914 by Æthelflæd, daughter of Alfred the Great, and recorded in the Mercian Register in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle but this has been queried. In the medieval and post-medieval period, the south-east part of the site was inhabited, at one <b>point</b> <b>being</b> used as a forester's lodge.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a system for}} doing {{automatic}} structure and motion estimation given an image sequence taken by a hand-held camera is presented. The main contribution {{is the ability to}} stitch together partial reconstructions, specifically {{in the case of a}} closed loop motion. One key feature of the system is the possibility to incorporate simple geometrical constraints on the scene in the present case illustrated by two object <b>points</b> <b>being</b> the same, a group of <b>points</b> <b>being</b> the same or several <b>points</b> <b>being</b> coplanar. This is essential when dealing with long image sequences (hundreds of selected images from a sequence of thousands), since the accumulated error necessarily degrades the reconstruction significantly.

5|$|Pope made {{a number}} of saves as York held league leaders Rochdale to a 0–0 away draw, with a <b>point</b> <b>being</b> enough to lift the team back into seventh-place. York were {{prevented}} from equalling a club record of eight consecutive clean sheets when Accrington scored a stoppage time equaliser in a 1–1 home draw, in which York had taken earlier taken the lead with a Coulson penalty. A 1–0 win away win over Oxford, which was decided by a second half Coulson penalty, resulted in York moving one place above their opponents and back into seventh-place. York consolidated their place in a play-off position after beating Bury 1–0 at home with a fifth-minute goal scored by Lowe from a Hayhurst corner. The result meant York opened up a five-point lead over eighth-placed Oxford with two fixtures remaining. A place in the League Two play-offs was secured following a 1–0 win over Newport at home, in which Coulson scored the only goal in the 77th minute with a 25-yard free kick. Pope earned a nomination for League Two Player of the Month for April 2014, having conceded only one goal in five matches in that period.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{got under}} way on Saturday {{afternoon}} with new rules in place. Just as in years before, the qualifying procedure was divided into three parts, with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given <b>point</b> <b>being</b> taken out from contention every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one <b>point</b> <b>being</b> developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.|$|E

5|$|In {{gridiron}} football, {{the safety}} (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play {{that results in}} two points (or, in rare cases, one <b>point)</b> <b>being</b> awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored {{in a number of}} ways, such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a safety is scored in American football, the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or kicking off the ball, also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can {{have a significant impact on}} the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick.|$|E
