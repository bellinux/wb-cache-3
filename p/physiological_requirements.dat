Following basal diet period, pullets were fed on diet containing, respectively, 0. 44 and 0. 53 mg selenium per kg. For 3 weeks. Blood was obtained to determine selenium levels and GSHpx activities. Concentration of selenium in egg yolk, egg white, urine and faeces was also determind. At the end of each period, six laying pullets were sacrificed to collect the liver and the kidney samples. When a sufficient amount of selenium for <b>physiological</b> <b>requirement</b> was provided to laying pullets, body weight, egg production and others in laying pullets were not improved by the additional supplement of selenium in diets. Blood selenium levels and plasma GSHpx activities were not affected by graded amounts of dietary selenium.

Selenium content in egg white, urine and faeces increased with increasing amount of dietary selenium, but, that in egg yolk was not exactly in propotion to selenium levels of diet.

50|$|Gram-negative {{microbes}} have {{a double}} set of covering membranes. A cell membrane encloses the bacterial cytoplasm or cytosol, and over the cell membrane, there is another membrane called bacterial outer membrane. The compartment or space between these two membranes is called periplasm or periplasmic space. In addition, there is a firm cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan layer, which surrounds the cell membrane. Peptidoglycan layer provides some rigidity for maintaining the bacterial cell shape, besides also protecting the microbe against challenging environment. Thus, periplasm ensures expandable and additional space for storing microbial cell secretions, for further and strategic use via a specialized secretory pathway. Size and contents of periplasm are therefore, variable as per <b>physiological</b> <b>requirements</b> (Fig. 2).The first step in biogenesis of gram-negative bacterial OMVs, is bulging of outer membrane above the peptidoglycan layer (Fig 2). It has been suggested (links) that few supramolecular proteins may 'rivet' the outer and cell membranes together, so that the periplasmic bulge protrudes like a 'ballooned' pocket of inflated periplasm. Lateral diffusion of 'rivet complexes' may help in pinching off large bulges of periplasm as OMVs. Detailed experimental work is still awaited to understand the biomechanics of OMV biogenesis. OMVs are also under focus of current research in exocytosis in prokaryotes via outer membrane vesicle trafficking for intra-species, inter-species and inter-kingdom cell signaling, which is slated to change our mindset on virulence of microbes, host-pathogen interactions and inter-relationships among variety of species in earth's ecosystem.|$|E
