The Church of Scientology was unable to shut down Operation Clambake's internet service <b>provider</b> in Norway. The organization succeeded in shutting down the upstream connection to the site's internet service <b>provider,</b> Netherlands-based Xtended Internet. In November 2002, Xtended Internet's upstream <b>provider,</b> Cignal Global Communications received a letter from Church of Scientology counsel alleging copyright and trademark infringement involved with Xenu.net. This letter led to Cignal Global Communications, a United States-based company, terminating its service with Xtended Internet, which had to move their company to a new backbone <b>provider.</b>|$|E

40|$|Part 5 : Cooperation and CollaborationInternational audienceWe study {{competition}} between users over {{access to content}} in a telecom market that includes several access <b>providers</b> and several content <b>providers.</b> We focus situations where exclusive agreements exist between content and access <b>providers,</b> which allows access <b>providers</b> to offer content services for free for their subscribers. We call access <b>providers</b> having such agreements ”super” <b>providers</b> or ”enhanced” service <b>providers.</b> We show that the {{competition between}} the users results in a paradoxical phenomenon in which subscribers of enhanced <b>providers</b> prefer to defer part of their demand to other content <b>providers</b> whose content is costly.

However, little is known about how content <b>providers</b> derive payoffs from such activities. In this study, we build a dynamic structural model to recover the utility function for content <b>providers.</b> Our model distinguishes short-term payoffs based on ad revenue sharing from long-term payoffs driven by content <b>providers</b> ‟ reputation. The model was estimated using a panel data of 914 top 1000 <b>providers</b> and 381 randomly selected <b>providers</b> on YouTube from Jun 7 th, 2010, to Aug 7 th, 2011. The two different sets of <b>providers</b> allow us to explore the difference between top and ordinary <b>providers.</b> Our results demonstrate that both <b>providers</b> value incremental subscribers as much as incremental video views. We also find that top <b>providers</b> value accumulative subscribers more than accumulative video views, while ordinary <b>providers</b> value accumulative video views more...|$|R
