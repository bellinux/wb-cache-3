However {{the rest of the crew}} doubt it'll work, knowing their luck with such things. Kryten tells the crew that the events of the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> prove that 'the whole is great than the sum of its parts', and forces them all to voice a belief that the stardrive will work. Once activated, the engine crashes through the wall and shoots out into space on its own, leaving the crew struggling against decompression. Kryten remarks that, at least, the stardrive did technically work.|$|E

He wheeled to the line at 7:08 p.m., past the deadline for the track to close. Officials decided to allow the run, and his four-lap average of 113.848 mph tentatively took the {{pole position}}. After the run, some drivers protested, and during a post-qualifying inspection, it was found that Arnold's brake cables were not connected. During the rush to get the car on the track, the crew had neglected to connect the brake cables, and technical committee chairman Louis H. Schwitzer disallowed the run.|$|E

When he was first coming into Germany, Ali’s passport was stamped as a tourist’s would be even though he begged the officer to stamp it differently. Since his passport was stamped in this way, he cannot get a job legally, and for seven months Ali has been struggling living in the country. Even after his moving in with his relatives he still struggles with the idea that he is a burden since he doesn’t have a job. He is hopeful at the prospect of work though since the snow would need to be shoveled.|$|E
50|$|Vishwanathan (Suresh Gopi), due to {{his passion}} for farming and agriculture, gave up his job in an MNC and has been settled in his village. One day he gets a call from Hyderabad that Revathi (Maathu), his sister, who is {{studying}} medicine at a medical college has been missing for the <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> Vishwanathan sets out to Hyderabad {{on the same day}} in a tourist bus. The bus, which is on a trip to Tirupati, is packed with a set of Tamil Brahmin pilgrims. Gowri (Annie), a beautiful girl among them grabs his attention for her singing abilities. The next day morning, on reaching Hyderabad, Vishwanathan reaches the college, and from her friends comes to know that Revathi had received threats from one Sudhakar Reddy (K. B. Ganesh Kumar), son of an underworld don. Revathi, who had witnessed a murder committed by Sudhakar, had planned to appear at an identification parade at the police station. Sudhkar in fury, rapes her, and in an effort to save herself, she falls down from the top of a building and dies. Vishwanathan visits the nearby police station to file a complaint, but gets cold response from the local inspector. He even threatens to arrest Vishwanathan, if he decides to move ahead with the complaint. Vishwanathan, who goes crazy of anger, gets into a scuffle with Sudhakar, and kills him, which causes his father Reddy, who is now ruling the city, to hunt for Vishwanathan. He is saved by the rival mafia don Patel (Devan). Vishwanathan is made to stay at a brothel run by Patel, where he meets Appu (Maniyanpilla Raju), a good hearted chap. At the brothel, he is shocked to see Gowri, with whom he had a crush on the bus on the road to Hyderabad. From Appu, he comes to know that she was trapped and kidnapped at Tirupathi and has been sold to Patel by a lady pimp (Lalithasree). On meeting Vishwanathan, Gowri pleads him to save her. At night, she hits the local inspector with a liquor bottle, causing him injury. Vishwanathan decides to save her and is helped by Appu in finding a route outside. Appu introduces him to Jose (Vijayaraghavan), a truck driver from Kerala and his sidekick Kunjahammed (Augustine). But Appu is killed by the goons of Patel. Vishwanathan flees out from the brothel with Gowri and is followed by Patel and his goons. On other side, Reddy is also after him. Their chase turns more violent as they face several hardships on the path, including many local criminals. But Vishwanathan, after a bloody, long chase, succeeds in saving her by killing both Patel and Reddy.|$|E
