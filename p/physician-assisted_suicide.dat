40|$|The use of pain {{medication}} for <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicides</b> {{has brought about}} many debates. The controversy began when Oregon passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997. The Pain Relief Promotion Act (PRPA) of 1999 was introduced to nullify Oregon’s state law and to increase funding for research on palliative care. Some organizations believe that the bill will limit access to {{pain medication}} for patients and will cause under-treatment of pain symptoms. Others believe the act will help regulate pain medicine without intruding on state regulations for medicine. Regulation of controlled substances began in 1970 when The Controlled Substance Act (CSA) was passed. Years later, The Death with Dignity Act was passed into law in Oregon in 1994. This law made it legal for physicians to help their patients commit suicide. In 1998 the Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act was introduced. When it was not passed, Senator Nickles and Senator Lieberman proposed the Pain Relief Promotion Act in 1999. In 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that using controlled substances to assist in suicides {{is a violation of}} the CSA. The American Pain Society believes the PRPA will inhibit doctors from prescribin...|$|R
25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. <b>Physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E
25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> and euthanasia would become routine. Over time doctors would become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would make us want to extend the option to others who, in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives. The ethical arguments for <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they {{can also be used to}} justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent.|$|E

25|$|Pain is {{the most}} common reason for {{physician}} consultation in most developed countries. It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning. Simple pain medications are useful in 20% to 70% of cases. Psychological factors such as social support, hypnotic suggestion, excitement, or distraction can significantly affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness. In some arguments put forth in <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> or euthanasia debates, pain has been used as an argument to permit people who are terminally ill to end their lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of a barbiturate induction agent and a nondepolarizing paralytic agent is used in thousands of anesthetics every day. Supporters {{of the death penalty}} argue that unless anesthesiologists have been wrong for the last 40 years, the use of pentothal and pancuronium is safe and effective. In fact, potassium is given in heart bypass surgery to induce cardioplegia. Therefore, the {{combination of}} these three drugs is still in use today. Supporters of the death penalty speculate that the designers of the lethal-injection protocols intentionally used the same drugs as used in everyday surgery to avoid controversy. The only modification is that a massive coma-inducing dose of barbiturates is given. In addition, similar protocols have been used in countries that support euthanasia or <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide.</b>|$|E
500|$|In Australia {{suicide is}} not a crime.

2500|$|The {{judicial}} {{sense of}} the term [...] "homicide" [...] includes any intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, even to relieve intractable suffering. Not all homicide is unlawful. Two designations of homicide that carry no criminal punishment are justifiable and excusable homicide. In most countries this is not the status of euthanasia. The term [...] "euthanasia" [...] is usually confined to the active variety; the University of Washington website states that [...] "euthanasia generally means that the physician would act directly, for instance by giving a lethal injection, to end the patient's life". <b>Physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> is thus not classified as euthanasia by the US State of Oregon, where it is legal under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, and despite its name, it is not legally classified as suicide either. Unlike <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide,</b> withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments with patient consent (voluntary) is almost unanimously considered, at least in the United States, to be legal. The use of pain medication to relieve suffering, even if it hastens death, has been held as legal in several court decisions.|$|E
2500|$|A 2010 {{survey in}} the United States {{of more than}} 10,000 {{physicians}} found that 16.3% of physicians would consider halting life-sustaining therapy because the family demanded it, even if they {{believed that it was}} premature. Approximately 54.5% would not, and the remaining 29.2% responded [...] "it depends".

2500|$|Emanuel {{said that}} it is a myth that most {{patients}} who want to die choose euthanasia because they are in extreme pain. He said that in his own experience, [...] "those with pain are more likely than others to oppose <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> and euthanasia." [...] He said that patients were more likely to want euthanasia because of [...] "depression and general psychological distress ... a loss of control or of dignity, of being a burden, and of being dependent." [...] He also said that the kind of legalized euthanasia practiced in the Netherlands would lead to an ethical [...] "slippery slope" [...] which {{would make it easier for}} doctors to rationalize euthanasia when it would save them the trouble of cleaning bedpans and otherwise caring for patients who want to live. He said that legalized euthanasia in the Netherlands did not adhere to all the legal guidelines, and that some newborns were euthanised even though they could not possibly have given the legally required consent. As Emanuel said, [...] "The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others. Indeed, the persistence of abuse and the violation of safeguards, despite publicity and condemnation, suggest that the feared consequences of legalization are exactly its inherent consequences." ...|$|E
2500|$|London's fiction {{featured}} several suicides. [...] In his autobiographical memoir John Barleycorn, he claims, as a youth, to have drunkenly stumbled overboard {{into the}} San Francisco Bay, [...] "some maundering fancy {{of going out}} with the tide suddenly obsessed me". He said he drifted and nearly succeeded in drowning before sobering up and being rescued by fishermen. In the dénouement of The Little Lady of the Big House, the heroine, confronted by the pain of a mortal gunshot wound, undergoes a <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> by morphine. Also, in Martin Eden, the principal protagonist, who shares certain characteristics with London, drowns himself.|$|E

According to PolitiFact and TIME, Bachmann's euthanasia remarks distorted Emanuel's position on health care for the elderly and disabled.

2500|$|The {{urban core}} in {{addition}} to certain rural districts is known for supporting liberal political views, perceived as controversial {{in much of the}} rest of North America. Many jurisdictions have relatively liberal abortion laws, gender equality laws, legal cannabis, and strong LGBT rights, especially British Columbia, where gay marriage has been legal since 2003, Washington, where it has been legal since 2012, and Oregon, where same-sex marriage was made legal in May 2014. Oregon was the first U.S. state to legalize <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide,</b> with the Death with Dignity Act of 1994. Washington State was the second when I-1000 passed in 2008. Colegio Cesar Chavez, the first fully accredited Hispanic college in the U.S., was founded in Mount Angel, Oregon in 1973.

2500|$|Regardless of an {{alternative}} protocol, some death-penalty opponents have claimed that execution can be less painful by the administration of a single lethal dose of barbiturate. Supporters [...] of the death penalty, however, state that the single-drug theory is a flawed concept. Terminally ill patients in Oregon who have requested <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> have received lethal doses of barbiturates. The protocol has been highly effective in producing a painless death, but the time to cause death can be prolonged. Some patients have taken days to die, and a few patients have actually survived the process and have regained consciousness up to three days after taking the lethal dose. In a California legal proceeding addressing {{the issue of the}} lethal injection cocktail being [...] "cruel and unusual", state authorities said that the time to death following a single injection of a barbiturate could be as much as 45 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Current states' {{rights issues}} include the death penalty, {{assisted}} suicide, same-sex marriage, gun control, and cannabis, {{the last of}} which is in direct violation of federal law. In Gonzales v. Raich, the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the federal government, permitting the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to arrest medical marijuana patients and caregivers. In Gonzales v. Oregon, the Supreme Court ruled the practice of <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> in Oregon is legal. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court ruled that states could not withhold recognition to same-sex marriages. [...] In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the United States Supreme Court ruled that gun ownership is an individual right under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the District of Columbia could not completely ban gun ownership by law-abiding private citizens. [...] Two years later, the court ruled that the Heller decision applied to states and territories via the Second and 14th Amendments in McDonald v. Chicago, stating that states, territories and political divisions thereof, could not impose total bans on gun ownership by law-abiding citizens.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel {{said that}} legalizing euthanasia, {{as was done}} in the Netherlands, might be counterproductive, in that it would {{decrease}} support for pain management and mental health care. However, Emanuel does support the use of Medical Directives to allow patients to express their wishes when they can no longer communicate. Ezekiel, and his former wife Linda Emanuel, an M.D. Ph.D. bioethicist and geriatrician, created the Medical Directive, which is described as more specific and extensive than previous living wills and is a third generation Advance Directive. He claims the Hippocratic Oath debunks the theory that opposition to euthanasia is modern. Emanuel said that {{for the vast majority of}} dying patients, [...] "legalizing euthanasia or <b>physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> would be of no benefit. To the contrary, it would be a way of avoiding the complex and arduous efforts required of doctors and other health-care providers to ensure that dying patients receive humane, dignified care." [...] Emanuel said that a historical review of opinions on euthanasia from ancient Greece to now [...] "suggests an association between interest in legalizing euthanasia and moments when Social Darwinism and raw individualism, free markets and wealth accumulation, and limited government are celebrated." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Physician-assisted</b> <b>suicide</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with euthanasia. In cases of euthanasia the physician administers {{the means of}} death, usually a lethal drug.
