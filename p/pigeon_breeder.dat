Pigeon dropping extracts (PDE) {{have been shown to}} contain a source of antigenic material. A survey of the hydrolytic enzymes present in PDE has shown that this material contains a variety of proteolytic and nonproteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze synthetic and natural substrates. These enzymes were separated into their basic and acidic components by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Five distinct hydrolytic activities were isolated from the basic group of enzymes. These enzymes were purified by CM-cellulose chromatography, gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100, and selective adsorption to affinity columns. Trypsin, elastase and two forms of collagenase were the specific proteolytic enzymes identified and isolated. A phospholipase was also purified from these basic fractions. Six distinct hydrolytic activities were also identified in the acidic group of enzymes. Significant amounts of the proteases elastase, trypsin and two molecular forms of collagenase were isolated. An esterase and phospholipase were also purified These enzymes were purified by preparative isoelectric focusing, affinity chromatography, and gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 or BioGel A- 0. 5 m columns. A potential role for the enzymes in the induction of PBD is presented. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) of unfractionated PDE on polyacrylamide gels revealed that this material is a complex mixture of components which are acidic in nature. Chromatographically purified antigens PDE(,B), (, 1) and (, 3) showed multiple bands in IEF, with peak concentrations focusing at pH 6. 1, 4. 6 and 3. 8, respectively. Crossed immunoelectrofocusing (CRIF) resolved PDE into nine precipitable components with rabbit antiserum in a pH gradient from 2. 5 to 7. 0. A comparison of <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeder</b> 2 ̆ 7 s sera by CRIF of unfractionated PDE demonstrated a qualitative difference in precipitation patterns. Sera from all (8 / 8) of the symptomatic breeders tested precipitated an unidentified component of PDE, whereas none (0 / 4) of the sera from asymptomatic breeders detected this antigen.

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} {{sensitivity}} of two methods {{for the detection of}} serum antibodies to pigeon faecal antigens in patients with <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeder's</b> disease. METHODS: Serum samples stored at - 20 degrees C from 50 patients with <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeder's</b> disease, 50 control samples from patients with other respiratory diseases, and 50 healthy blood donors were examined for the precipitating antibodies and IgG antibodies to antigens present in extract of pigeon droppings by immunodiffusion and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. RESULTS: Both antigen preparations of pigeon dropping extract were equally effective. A positive immunodiffusion reaction gave one or more precipitin lines and these antibodies were detected only in undiluted sera from 80 % of the patients with <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeder's</b> disease. In the ELISA the sera were tested at a starting dilution of 1 in 100 because positive reactions were observed with sera from healthy blood donors at lower dilutions. All sera which gave optical density readings above 3 SD of the control value were considered to have IgG antibodies. These antibodies were detected in sera from all the patients with <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeder's</b> disease. The antibody titres were much higher in those patients who had precipitating antibodies (range 800 - 51, 200) than those without (range 100 - 800). The antibodies were not detected in the sera of patients with respiratory diseases or healthy blood donors by either method. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies to pigeon dropping antigens were detected by immunodiffusion and ELISA in sera from patients with <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeder's</b> disease but not in control sera.

Rabbits exposed by aerosol to large quantities of pigeon antigens developed a humoral, but not cellular, immunologic response. Moreover, their lungs were essentially normal histologically.

The humoral immunologic response to the inhaled antigen was not increased after BCG injection. Since many individuals are exposed to the etiologic agents of hypersensitivity pneumonitis for extended periods without developing the disease, these findings in animals suggest that some event may occur to induce cell mediated hypersensitivity in order to initiate the disease process. In addition, we have shown that animals with normal lung histology and circulating complement-fixing antibodies undergo serum complement (CH 50) depression after an aerosol challenge with the specific antigen.

After Bonferroni correction the difference in BAL lymphocytes remained significant among the UIP-like and the typical pattern (36. 1  ±  22. 9 versus 64. 6  ±  20. 9, p =  0. 001). UIP-like patients exhibited the worst survival rate (HR: 4. 19; 95 % CI: 1. 66 – 14. 47; p <  0. 004) while NSIP-like pattern showed the best survival (HR: 0. 18; 95 % CI: 0. 04 – 0. 82; p <  0. 03). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with a UIP-like pattern retained a significantly worse survival (HR: 3. 4 (IC 95 %: 1. 15 – 10. 29; p <  0. 03), and mortality for the NSIP group was best and approached statistical significance (p =  0. 07). These findings demonstrate that a variety of histopathologic and imaging patterns are seen in PBD, and the presence of a UIP-like pattern confers the worst prognosis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pigeon</b> <b>breeder’s</b> lung (PBL) {{is a type}} of lung {{inflammatory}} disease associated with the immune response to repeated pigeon-derived antigen exposure. The pathogenesis of PBL remains unclear. In this study, peripheral blood samples were collected from Uygur acute - and chronic-phase PBL patients and healthy subjects with pigeon contact. Foxp 3 + CD 4 + regulatory T cell (Treg) activity in different phases of PBL was characterized by changes in Foxp 3 + CD 4 + Treg, CD 4 + CD 25 + T cell, and T lymphocyte subsets. Based on hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis criteria, 32 PBL cases from January 2012 to December 2013 in the People’s Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Respiratory Department were included. Lung high-resolution computed tomography was performed, and the cases were classified based on the HP phase into 15 acute-phase and 17 chronic-phase cases. The control group included 30 healthy subjects with Uygur pigeon contact. Blood samples were collected, and the T cell subsets were analyzed via flow cytometry. In both PBL groups, the Foxp 3 + CD 4 + Treg and CD 4 + CD 25 + and CD 4 + CD 3 + T cell percentages and CD 4 + /CD 8 + ratios were significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0. 01). In the PBL groups, particularly the acute-phase group, the CD 8 + CD 3 + T lymphocyte percentage was significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences in}} CD 4 + CD 25 + cells between the PBL groups. In peripheral blood from the PBL groups, the CD 4 + /CD 8 + ratio was positively correlated with the Foxp 3 + CD 4 + Treg (r = 0. 864, p < 0. 05) and CD 4 + /CD 25 + cell (r = 0. 34, p < 0. 05) percentages. Low Foxp 3 + CD 4 + Treg expression or overconsumption may be a pathogenic factor in PBL...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure {{to organic}} dust {{produced}} by birds often {{gives rise to}} an immune response, e. g. IgG antibodies, but intense exposure can lead to high concentrations of IgG antibodies {{and the development of}} allergic alveolitis, often known as &# 039;bird fancier&# 039;s lung&# 039;. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the distribution of bird-specific IgG antibodies in exposed and nonexposed individuals and compare a nonquantitative and quantitative method in evaluating raised levels of IgG antibodies. METHODS: Sera were collected in Sweden and South Africa and levels of IgG antibodies specific to pigeon, budgerigar and parrot antigens were quantified using the UniCAP system. Results were compared to the precipitation in gel assay. The IgG antibody values of symptomatic patients without precipitating antibodies (non-PP group; n = 51) and patients with precipitating antibodies (PP group; n = 34) were analyzed and compared to nonexposed asymptomatic blood donors (BD group; n = 73) and environmentally exposed <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeders</b> (n = 11). RESULTS: The IgG antibody response of the analyzed groups in Sweden and South Africa did not vary significantly from each other. IgG antibody responses were the strongest to pigeon antigens with clear increased IgG antibody levels in the PP group [geometric mean (GM) 603 mg/l] compared to the non-PP (GM 6. 9 mg/l) and BD group (GM 5. 0 mg/l). Threshold values, calculated as the GM value from the BD group plus 3 standard deviations (99 % confidence interval), were 9. 8, 10. 8 and 10. 0 mg/l for pigeons, budgerigars and parrots, respectively. Comparison of the two methods resulted in a good concordance with a level of agreement of 94. 1 % (kappa statistic = 0. 83). CONCLUSIONS: The UniCAP system for the detection of bird-specific IgG antibodies is a highly reproducible, generally available, quantitative method for routine diagnostic testing and monitoring of exposed subjects with a very high level of agreement to the precipitating gel assay...|$|R
