40|$|PURPOSE: Membership on a <b>professional</b> <b>medical</b> <b>society</b> or journal {{editorial}} board is {{a marker of}} influence and prestige for those in academic medicine. This study presents the first comprehensive quantification of women on these boards and the implications for women in medicine. METHODS: The numbers {{of women and men}} on professional society and journal {{editorial board}}s across 28 specialties (March 2004) were counted. The number of women holding multiple roles on these boards and the number of women holding top leadership positions on these boards were counted, and these proportions were compared. RESULTS: Three-thousand-four-hundred-seventy-three individuals on 39 <b>professional</b> <b>medical</b> <b>society</b> boards and 54 journal editorial boards were included. Eighty-three percent (2, 884) of board members were male. Men occupied > 80 % of top leadership positions on these boards. Thirty-five of the 589 women in the study held multiple roles. Anesthesiology (p < 0. 0025), pediatrics (p < 0. 0001), dermatology (p = 0. 0001), obstetrics/ gynecology (p = 0. 05), medical genetics (p < 0. 015) and rehabilitation medicine (p < 0. 03) had significantly lower proportions of women on boards in comparison to the total women in the specialty. Internal medicine, plastic surgery, cardiology and general surgery had nearly equivalent proportions; in otolaryngology and family medicine, female board members slightly exceeded the proportion of women in the field. CONCLUSION: Women's representation on society and editorial boards does not always reflect their presence in medical specialties, and it is critically lacking in certain specialties. Efforts should be made to attain parity of women leaders on these boards. Further efforts should be made to eliminate barriers to women's leadership in medicine...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} which health information sources physicians are using and how these sources affect referrals. We explored how venues for health-related information affect physicians' referral practices to smoking cessation services. The 2008 DocStyles survey asked physicians to rank a list of their most trusted sources of health-related information. The analysis was restricted to 1, 617 physicians who responded to all variables of interest. In this sample, the most trusted sources of health-related information cited by physicians were medical journals (95. 9 %), government health agencies (82. 2 %), other physicians (76. 4 %), <b>professional</b> <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> (75. 2 %), and medical Web sites or podcasts (65. 9 %). Medical providers were more likely to refer tobacco users to cessation services if they used <b>professional</b> <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> as a source to obtain patient health-related information, compared with medical providers not using this source (multivariate odds ratio = 1. 31; 95 % confidence interval = 1. 03 - 1. 66).

Therefore, to reach physicians effectively, a broad dissemination of guidelines and best practices in tobacco control is needed and should include information for <b>medical</b> <b>societies.</b> CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 01 - 06 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26753101 PMC 470311...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if revenue generated from pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals creates potential financial {{conflicts of interest}} for nonprofit physician organizations that own those journals. DESIGN: Convenience sample of six <b>professional</b> <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> and their respective journals. Calculation of pharmaceutical advertising revenue generated by these journals for their respective <b>professional</b> <b>medical</b> <b>societies.</b> METHODS: Random selection of each journal for one month per quarter in calendar year 1996 and tabulation per edition of {{the average number of}} pharmaceutical advertising pages for each journal. OUTCOME MEASURES: Published advertising rates were used to estimate pharmaceutical advertising revenue for calendar year 1996 and compared with each organization's gross revenue and membership dues and assessments, based on Internal Revenue Service documents for the last available fiscal year (1995). RESULTS: Estimated pharmaceutical advertising revenue ranged from $ 715, 000 to $ 18, 630, 000. Five organizations raised more than 10 % of their gross income (range 2 % to 30 %) from a single journal's pharmaceutical advertising. Four organizations raised as much or more from pharmaceutical advertising as from members (range 17 % to 790 %). CONCLUSIONS: Potential financial conflicts of interest arising from pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals may be substantial.
