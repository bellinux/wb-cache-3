5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{hold the}} line only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape {{and management of the}} site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the present state and regional <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> carefully combine tourism development in the area with the preservation of its natural and cultural heritage. Ecotourism poses an ideal solution, since {{it has the potential}} of bringing about the desired balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection. Specific objectives of ecotourism development include reviving traditional activities such as small-scale farming and stock-raising, as well as establishing a network of communities of chamois biotopes.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of economic <b>policies</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve efficiency. The {{objective of}} social <b>policies</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve equity. The objective of environmental <b>policies</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve sustainability (often involving implementing Green infrastructure. The objective of institutional governance <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve equilibrium (‘Ethical Equilibrium’) {{among the three}} areas.|$|R
40|$|Any {{attempt to}} reform {{existing}} public policies or to implement new policies faces an arduous negotiation {{process and the}} tyranny of the status quo. One of the basic premises of the Uruguay Round of the GATT is that the reform of border <b>policies</b> could not <b>be</b> sustained without dramatic modification of internal agricultural policies. In October of 1989, the United States tabled a proposal for reforming internal policies of the agricultural sector throughout GATT signatory countries. In essence, this tabled proposal specified policies in terms of three regimes: red light, green light, and yellow light policies. Red light <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forbidden; green light <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> promoted; and yellow light <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated on a case-by-case basis. Quite obviously, green light policies include public good provisions that promote economic growth and do not involve coupled distortionary transfers. ...|$|R

5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires burn more than , {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
25|$|Drupal's <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{announce}} {{the nature of}} each security vulnerability once the fix is released.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Oregon State Parks Department <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> bury whale {{carcasses}} {{where they}} land. If the sand is not deep enough, they are relocated to another beach.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the goal stated above <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{attained}} while providing a widely applicable solution, i.e., {{that can be used in}} a generic location infrastructure. Thus, the policy monitor that enforces the above-mentioned <b>policies</b> cannot <b>be</b> made as a group of static or built-in rules. As noted in [7], organizations use different approaches and philosophies to structure and configure their units and collaborators (e.g., hierarchical, flat, etc.). <b>Policies</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> defined independently of the location system and taking into account the existing organizational model of the site where location <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enforced.|$|R
25|$|Monoculturalism: In some European states, {{culture is}} very {{closely linked to}} nationalism, thus {{government}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assimilate immigrants, although recent increases in migration have led many European states to experiment with forms of multiculturalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of the European Union Common Fisheries <b>Policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> minimize the environmental impact associated with resource use by reducing fish discards, increasing productivity of fisheries, stabilising markets of fisheries and fish processing, and supplying fish at reasonable prices for the consumer.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an {{environmental}} problem is the overpopulation of the earth. The Neo-fundamentalists's family <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase the population dramatically. Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's call for increasing Iran's population from 70 to 120 millions can be understood in the same line.|$|E
50|$|The party's main <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{have the}} Danish Minister for Iceland based in Reykjavík rather than Copenhagen.|$|R
60|$|My wisest <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> remain downstairs {{when these}} {{withering}} blasts were blowing, but probably I {{went up in}} self-defence.|$|R
25|$|Sinn Féin's <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> {{outlined}} in its election manifesto, which aimed for Irish representation and recognition at any post-war peace conference. IPP <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave negotiation to the British government.|$|R
25|$|Official college <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{discourage}} underage (less than 21 years) drinking, {{although there}} have been incidents of violations at off-campus parties. Incoming students are required to take an online course about the dangers of alcohol abuse. The school punishes transgressions with disciplinary action.|$|E
25|$|US and Canadian {{national}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{require a}} label only given significant composition differences or documented health impacts, although some individual US states (Vermont, Connecticut and Maine) enacted laws requiring them. In July 2016, Public Law 114-214 was enacted to regulate labeling of GMO food {{on a national}} basis.|$|E
25|$|Motor vehicle accidents: State Farm Insurance {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 10,000 deer in Connecticut are hit by cars each year. But the state Department of Environmental Protection estimates only 3,000 deer-motor vehicle accidents occur annually. State <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> bury deer carcases {{by the side of}} the road where they were hit.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the Black Panther Party disbanded, {{official}} <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reprimand men who violated the rules of gender equality.|$|R

25|$|A {{republic}} is favoured by some pro-independence {{political parties}} and organisations, including the Scottish Green Party and the Scottish Socialist Party. The SNP is in favour of an independent Scotland retaining the Queen as head of state. Christine Grahame has said she believes that party <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> hold {{a referendum on the}} matter, due to a 1997 SNP conference resolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of this}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} market in which Canadian {{networks}} can realize revenue through advertising sales {{in spite of their}} inability to match the rates that the much larger American networks can afford to pay for syndicated programming. This policy is also why Canadian viewers do not see American advertisements during the Super Bowl, even when tuning into one of the many American networks carried on Canadian televisions.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the {{university}} implemented {{a new policy}} requiring all first-year, full-time undergraduate students to live on campus. The goal of the <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide new students with a comprehensive educational experience. Students exempt from this new rule include those who remain living with their parents and/or legal guardians within Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties, are above the age of 21 by {{the first day of}} fall classes, have a dependent child or family member, or are married.|$|E
50|$|The <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> {{abandoned}} in 1996, after the 1996 federal election replaced the Labor Party with John Howard's Coalition in power. The new <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop the country's uranium mining industry and uranium exports.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{military}} coup of 5 December 2006, the Indian Government <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> engage with Fiji's interim administration rather than isolate the country.|$|R
40|$|For {{some time}} {{government}} policy {{has tried to}} encourage permanent migrants to settle outside the major cities in so-called regional areas. This policy has met with limited success (even though the term ‘regional’ has often included Melbourne). In 2003 the <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> extended <b>to</b> temporary migrants entering on 457 work visas. A large survey of principal visa holders on 457 visas {{suggests that there are}} a number of conditions that would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> met if this <b>policy</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful...|$|R
25|$|The {{popularity}} of Cantonese-language media, Cantopop and the Cinema of Hong Kong has since led to substantial exposure of Cantonese to China {{and the rest}} of Asia. On the Mainland, the national <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> promote Standard Chinese, which is also the medium of instruction in schools. The place of local Cantonese language and culture remains contentious. In 2010, a proposal to switch some programming on Guangzhou television from Cantonese to Mandarin was abandoned following public protests.|$|E
25|$|While {{the primary}} {{registries}} are the Horse Breeders' Associations of Saxony-Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, this studbook {{has proven to}} be the most liberal, accepting heavy warmbloods registered in Westphalia, Baden-Wurttemberg, Weser-Ems, Bavaria, and Berlin-Brandenburg. The goal of this <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify and promote any and all remaining heavy warmblood horses. The heavy warmblood makes up 15-25% of the horse population in Saxony and Thuringia, which attests to the program's efficacy. As of 2005 there were 51 stallions and 1140 mares.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} activities of the spy in the union during a strike is to wreck the strike relief benefit fund, upon which, of course, {{the success of the}} strike so largely depends. If the spy cannot himself have access to the fund, his next <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> spread discontent and cause the strikers to demand higher benefits than the union is able to pay. He will frequently create the impression that the fund is dishonestly handled by the union officials.|$|E
50|$|Nikki Sinclaire {{was another}} MEP. Her main <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> professionalise the party, {{introducing}} a shadow cabinet, and {{to focus on}} communication through the media.|$|R
25|$|Washington {{observers}} {{felt this}} <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> enforce the State Department's Good Neighbor Policy, but many broadcasters {{felt that this}} <b>was</b> an attempt <b>to</b> direct censorship.|$|R
