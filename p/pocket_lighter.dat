50|$|By {{the year}} 1910 he {{received}} his first patent for a <b>pocket</b> <b>lighter</b> (U.S. Pat. 965,149). His <b>pocket</b> <b>lighter</b> used flint material which contained a mixture of cerium and iron according to the patent. His design was a simple device that created a shower of sparks with the press of a finger - {{but there was no}} sustainable flame. Based on the patent dates, this device preceded the Pist-O-Liter (U.S. Pat. 966,153) which he successfully produced that year, but likewise, it only produced sparks. Within three years he received a patent titled Pyrophorous Lighter, (U.S. Pat. 1,084,386) which we now appreciate as the Paragon striker lighter, a simple device capable of producing and sustaining a flame by means of a steel-tipped wand fitted with a cloth-wick saturated in petroleum ether also known as Benzine or Naphtha. The following year, 1914, he was granted a design patent for the well known Bulldog striker lighter (Des. Pat. D 45,407) which utilized the same principles as the Paragon, and soon became a very popular table lighter.|$|E
5000|$|When, in time, {{technological}} advances {{were developed to}} allow for the manufacture of a safe flint material in 1906, Louis Aronson's ambition for an automatic <b>pocket</b> <b>lighter</b> soon became a reality.In 1913, Louis Aronson applied for a patent for a Liter (lighter), which was approved. In 1926 he released a new [...] "automatic operation" [...] Banjo lighter, which offered to both ignition and extinguish in a single push. It was a great success, demand shortly exceeding supply, spurring Aronson to Patent it and design other products around the invention, which were marketed under the Ronson brand name. Under his leadership, the Art Metal Works began designing prototypes, and patented several generations of Igniting-Apparatus until finally arriving at the Banjo Lighter. Ronson received an exclusive patent, in 1926, for a new automatic style of lighter that worked with one hand, and in 1927 Ronson began marketed it as the Ronson De-Light Lighter with the slogan [...] "A flip - and it's lit! Release - and it's out!" [...] Ronson's new lighters were an overnight success worldwide and soon the company offered a variety of lighters for all tastes.As with the Art Metal Works output, many well-built and stylish early Ronson lighters demand high prices in the collectibles marketplace.|$|E

60|$|And when, at last, {{he found}} it, he clasped {{it to him}} and sank back sobbing and exhausted. For many minutes he lay {{trembling}} and broken; but finally he drew himself to a sitting posture, and taking a match from his <b>pocket,</b> <b>lighted</b> the stump of the candle which remained to him. With the light he {{found it easier to}} regain control of his nerves, and presently he was again making his way along the tunnel in search of an avenue of escape. The horrid cry that had come down to him from above through the ancient well-shaft still haunted him, so that he trembled in terror at even the sounds of his own cautious advance.|$|R
