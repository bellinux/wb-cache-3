This study provides data on the prevalence, clinical signs and produced macro-pathology of this parasite mite infecting juvenile wild Grey seals stranded in North-Western Spanish coast. Among the 25 seals examined during the study, a total of 19 had nasal mites in their respiratory upper ways, including adult and larval stages.

40|$|Due to an {{increase}} in pinniped strandings with consistent pathological findings throughout the North Atlantic coast of the United States during the summer and fall of 2006, an unusual mortal- ity event (UME) was declared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on 20 October 2006. The goals of this investigation were to describe the magnitude and duration of the peak in mortalities involved in the UME and to evaluate associations with potential causative agents. Seal strandings during the UME were compared to historical strandings in the area to characterize the epidemiologic pat- terns of the UME. Temporal increases in phocine distemper virus (PDV) prevalence as detected by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were significantly correlated with increased seal stranding frequency. During July to October 2006, there was a significant spatial and tempo- ral cluster of PDV <b>positive</b> <b>seals</b> centered near Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Our findings provide evidence that PDV infections increased in harbor seals along the North Atlantic coast of the U.

40|$|Integrating {{renewable}} energy sources, such as offshore wind turbines, into the electric grid is challenging {{due to the}} variations between demand and generation and {{the high cost of}} transmission cables for transmitting peak power levels. A solution to these issues is a novel highefficiency compressed air energy storage system (CAES), which differs in a transformative way from conventional CAES approaches as it employs nearisothermal compression/expansion and energy storage prior to conversion to electrical power. This approach utilizes seawater as a liquid piston for air compression. The liquid piston creates a <b>positive</b> gas <b>seal,</b> enables a high surface area compression space for increased heat transfer, and utilizes the ocean as a thermal source/sink. The compressed air is stored in an “open accumulator,” where the air volume is modified through displacement of a liquid. The ability to exchange energy in the open accumulator by addition or subtraction of the gas or the liquid provides system control advantages, including storage of high power transients and direct control of air pressure independent of the energy storage level.

40|$|The {{currently}} preferred {{means of}} particulate removal from process or combustion gas generated by advanced coal-based power production processes is filtration with candle filters. However, candle filters have not shown the requisite reliability to be commercially viable for hot gas clean up for either integrated gasifier combined cycle (IGCC) or pressurized fluid bed combustion (PFBC) processes. Even a single candle failure {{can lead to}} unacceptable ash breakthrough, which can result in (a) damage to highly sensitive and expensive downstream equipment, (b) unacceptably low system on-stream factor, and (c) unplanned outages.

Siemens-Westinghouse is evaluating honeycomb-based filter devices on the clean-side of the candle filter that can operate up to 870 C. The EERC is developing a highly porous ceramic disk with a sticky yet temperature-stable coating that will trap dust in the event of filter failure.

In this paper a weak variant of quantum bit commitment, introduced independently by Aharonov et al. [2] and Hardy and Kent [8] is investigated.

If Bob cheats then Alice's probability of detecting the cheating is greater than some fixed constant λ> 0. This improves the probabilities of cheating detections shown by Hardy and Kent and the scheme by Aharonov et al. who presented a protocol that is either binding or sealing, but not simultaneously both.

Methods: Standard endodontic access cavities were prepared in 75 human premolars. The teeth were divided into five groups (n = 15 for each group), including a <b>positive</b> (no <b>sealing</b> of access cavity) and a negative control (Filtek Z 350 XT, 3 M, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). In the experimental groups, the access cavities were sealed with one of the three tested materials. After that, the teeth were immersed in 10 % Indian ink for 14 days. The teeth were then rinsed, dried, sectioned in bucco-lingual direction and evaluated under a stereomicroscope using scores for dye penetration. Data were analyzed using Kruskall-Wallis and Student-Newman-Keuls tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Positive control sections exhibited complete dye penetration and negative control had no specimen showing marginal leakage.

The recent detection of grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) DNA in bite marks on three mutilated harbour porpoises, as well as direct observations of grey seal attacks on porpoises, have identified this seal species as a probable cause. Bite mark characteristics were assessed in a retrospective analysis of photographs of dead harbour porpoises that stranded between 2003 and 2013 (n = 1081) on the Dutch coastline.

40|$|The {{full-flow}} mechanical safeguard device (FFMSGD) {{has been}} developed under contract to the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) to address problems with the reliability of ceramic candle filter elements installed on high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) Hot Gas Cleanup (HGCU) filters. Although systems candle filters are expected to perform satisfactorily when in good operating condition, the failure of even a single filter element can increase the filter system outlet dust loading enough to potentially damage gas turbine blades, contaminate other downstream processes, and limit {{the availability of the}} power system. Filter failure safeguard devices that are installed on each individual candle filter element are envisioned as a guarantee of a candle filter system's ability to withstand some number of element failures and continue operation without these negative consequences. The intention of the FFMSGD is to provide this guarantee without incurring any significant pressure drop penalty or constraining the filter system's reverse-pulse cleaning procedures. The FFMSGD provides a clear flow path for filtered and reverse-flow cleaning gases when its filter element is intact, and activates to provide a <b>positive</b> mechanical <b>seal</b> against gas flow in either direction when its filter element breaks or fails. This activation is induced by the increase in the flow rate of gas through the device in event of filter failure.

INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated continuous flow positive airway pressure systems with high or low flow plus a reservoir bag equipped with spring-loaded mechanical or underwater <b>seal</b> <b>positive</b> end-expiratory pressure valve and a continuous positive airway pressure by a Servo 300 C ventilator with or without periodic hyperinflations (three assisted breaths per minute with constant inspiratory pressure of 30 cm H 2 O over positive end-expiratory pressure). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured the respiratory pattern, work of breathing, dyspnea sensation, end-expiratory lung volume, and gas exchange. We found the following: a) Work of breathing and gas exchange were comparable between continuous flow systems; b) the ventilator continuous positive airway pressure was not different compared with continuous flow systems; and c) continuous positive airway pressure with periodic hyperinflations reduced work of breathing (10. 7 +/- 9. 5 vs. 6. 3 +/- 5. 7 J/min, p <. 05) and dyspnea sensation (1. 6 +/- 1. 2 vs. 1. 1 +/- 0. 8 cm, p <. 05) increased end-expiratory lung volume (1. 6 +/- 0. 8 vs. 2. 0 +/- 0. 9 L, p <. 05) and PaO 2 (100 +/- 21 vs. 120 +/- 25 torr, p <. 05) compared with ventilator continuous positive airway pressure.

40|$|Large rotary {{processors}} such like rotary dryers, rotary calciners and kilns {{are difficult}} to seal properly because of their large diameter, their low precision methods of fabrication and their severe operating conditions. Those factors result in several types of imperfection at the sealing surface. This work explores the possibility to seal large rotary processors to positive pressure up to 1 atmosphere (14. 7 psig). First, an extensive theoretical analysis combined with on-site measurements evaluation was conducted to quantify the magnitude of each type of surface imperfection at the seal location. Against these results, the current typical seals used in the industry were evaluated and compared. The seals that featured compressed packing seals seem to show great possibility as they are already used in successful <b>positive</b> pressure large <b>seal</b> arrangement. A typical packing seal arrangement with a stuffing-box was studied thoroughly {{in order to understand}} its particularities. The data collected and calculated in the previous steps was gathered and settled the new seal requirements. A new seal arrangement is proposed and it features as principal characteristics: radial compression and adaptive flexible housing. Based on the stuffing-box available mathematical relations, the equations are re-evaluated to account for the new radially oriented arrangement. Meanwhile, a test rig is designed and built to measure the seal performance and observe its behaviour. The effect of several parameters can be studied such as temperature, gas pressure, magnitude of sealing surface imperfection, magnitude of radial compression and drum rotation speed. Finally, tests are conducted and the results are discussed {{in order to make a}} recommendation for the possible industrial application. In the light of this study the new proposed seal meets or surpasses the industrial application requirements.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of high supply (up to 84 bar) pressure testing of hole-pattern annular gas seals performed at the Texas A & M Turbomachinery Laboratory in College Station, TX. The test variables were chosen to determine the influence of pressure ratio, rotor speed, and negative preswirl on seal performance. Preswirl signifies the circumferential fluid flow entering a seal, and negative preswirl indicates a fluid swirl in the direction opposite of rotor rotation. Changes in pressure ratio had only small effects on most rotordynamic coefficients. Cross-coupled stiffness showed slightly different profiles through the mid-range of excitation frequencies. Pressure ratio showed some influence on direct and cross-coupled damping at low excitation frequencies. Rotor speed significantly affected both cross-coupled stiffness and cross-coupled damping. As rotor speed increased, the magnitude of cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients increased due to the positive fluid swirl induced by rotor rotation. For the low rotor speed, negative inlet preswirl was able to overpower the positive rotor induced fluid rotation, producing a negative cross-coupled stiffness. This outcome showed that, for hole-pattern <b>seals,</b> <b>positive</b> fluid swirl does indeed produce positive cross-coupled stiffness coefficients and negative fluid swirl produces negative cross-coupled stiffness coefficients. The addition of negative preswirl greatly reduced cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients, while direct rotordynamic terms were unaffected. Cross-over frequency signifies the excitation frequency where effective damping transitions from a negative value to a positive value with increasing excitation frequency. Peak effective damping was increased by 50 percent and cross-over frequency reduced by 50 percent for high-negative preswirl versus zero preswirl results. This led to the conclusion that a reverse swirl could greatly enhance the stability of hole-pattern balance piston seals. A two-control-volume model that uses the ideal gas law at constant temperature (ISOT) was used to predict rotordynamic coefficients and leakage. This model predicted direct rotordynamic coefficients well, but greatly under predicted cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients especially at high negative preswirls. The model predicted seal leakage well at low pressure ratios, but showed increasing error as the pressure ratio was increased. These results showed that the prediction model could not adequately estimate cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients for a hole-pattern seal with negative inlet preswirl and requires modification to do so...|$|R
40|$|More than sixty-five {{million people}} in the United States—more than one in four adults—have had some {{involvement}} with the criminal justice system that will appear on a criminal history report. A rapidly expanding, for-profit industry has developed to collect these records and compile them into electronic databases, offering employers an inexpensive and readily accessible means of screening prospective employees. Nine out of ten employers now inquire into the criminal history of job candidates, systematically denying individuals with a criminal record any opportunity to gain work experience or build their job qualifications. This is so despite the fact that many individuals with criminal records have never been convicted of a crime, as one-third of felony arrests never result in conviction. And criminal records databases routinely contain significant errors, including false <b>positive</b> identifications and <b>sealed</b> or expunged information. The negative impact of employers’ reliance on criminal records databases falls most heavily on Black and Latino populations, as studies show that the stigma of having a criminal record is significantly more damaging for racial minorities than for Whites. This criminal record “penalty” limits profoundly the chance of achieving gainful employment, creating new and vexing problems for regulators, employers, and minorities with criminal records. Our existing regulatory apparatus, which is grounded in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, is ill-equipped to resolve this emerging dilemma because it fails to address systematic information failures and the problem of stigma. This Article, therefore, proposes a new framework drawn from core aspects of anti-discrimination laws that govern health law, notably the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. These laws were designed to regulate the flow of information that may form the basis of an adverse employment decision, seeking to prevent discrimination preemptively. More fundamentally, they conceptualize discrimination through the lens of social stigma, which is critical to understanding and prophylactically curbing the particular discrimination that results from dual criminal record and minority status. This health law framework attends to the interests of minorities with criminal records, allows for more robust enforcement of existing laws, and enables employers to make appropriate and equitable hiring decisions, without engaging in invidious discrimination or contributing to the establishment of a new, and potentially enduring, underclass...|$|R
