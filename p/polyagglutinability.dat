50|$|The {{research}} {{spectrum of}} Bird centered around blood {{groups and their}} anthropological, biochemical, clinical, genetic, immunohaematological and oncological aspects. His main focus was on human red blood cells, haemoglobin variants, blood groups, malignancies, red blood cell cryptantigens and <b>polyagglutinability.</b> His researches were published by way of over 200 medical papers and as reference manuals and chapters in many text books. A prolific speaker on haematology, he was also active in medical administration and was credited with automation and computerization of blood transfusion services during his career.|$|E
40|$|A 7 -week-old albino infant {{developed}} acute haemolytic anaemia {{following an}} operation for strangulated inguinal hernia. This {{was considered to}} be due to <b>polyagglutinability</b> of the red cells, the haemolysis subsiding as the cells returned to normal. The red cell changes were shown to be due to activation of T-antigen, reacting with anti-T in the adult blood transfused to the infant...|$|E
40|$|A {{woman with}} a clostridial septicemia {{manifested}} in vivo type I <b>polyagglutinability</b> of her erythrocytes, presumably due to activation of the latent T-receptor. A filtrate of the Clostridium culture was capable of causing T-activation of erythrocytes in vitro and bacterial products probably caused the T-activation in vivo. Moreover, there was evidence that anti-T in donor plasma caused lysis of T-active red cells...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{serotyping}} 966 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{showed that}} 72 % agglutinated specifically {{in one or}} another of the 16 typing antisera, but 28 % agglutinated in two or more and often in as many as 10 antisera; this <b>polyagglutinability</b> correlated with a high incidence of cross-reactivity among the antisera. Absorption of each typing antiserum with either cell suspensions of five O-type strains or with a suspension of a particular polyagglutinable strain (SMC 247) abolished cross-reactivity in the typing antisera without significantly reducing titers against the homologous strains. All but four of the polyagglutinable strains agglutinated specifically in one or another absorbed antisera. The cross-reactions of unabsorbed antisera were interpreted to have been caused by antibodies directed not against specific O antigens but against thermostable specificities that remain undefined...|$|E
40|$|A disease {{characterized}} by frequent association of enteritis and polyagglutinable cells often develops in weanling rabbits. The red cell lesion renders the cells susceptible to agglutination and hemolysis in normal rabbit sera. The degree of red cell abnormality varies among different animals and disappears when the animals recover. The abnormality {{of the red}} cells responsible for their <b>polyagglutinability</b> and susceptibility to hemolysis was resistant to the action of trypsin or papain and persisted in heated stroma preparations derived from polyagglutinable cells. The factors necessary for agglutination and hemolysis of the polyagglutinable cells are present in normal rabbit sera but are lacking in the sera of affected rabbits. These factors returned to normal levels as the polyagglutinable cell lesion disappeared. The sera of rabbits with polyagglutinable cells contained normal levels of complement and properdin. Whereas the agglutinating factor in normal sera is heat-stable at 56 °C for 30 minutes, the hemolytic factor is heat labile. The hemolytic factor is apparently distinct from complement and properdin since it was adsorbed from normal rabbit serum by zymosan or by polyagglutinable cells at 0 °C. However, complement was fixed when normal rabbit serum was reacted with stroma from polyagglutinable cells. Hemolysis of polyagglutinable cells by normal rabbit serum at 25 °C was inhibited by preliminary incubation of the mixture at 0 °C prior to incubation at 25 °C. Evidence was obtained which indicated that this inhibition was due to progression of a reaction involving Ca++ independent of a reaction involving Mg++...|$|E
40|$|A human hematopoietic {{disorder}} {{designated as}} Tn syndrome or permanent mixed-field <b>polyagglutinability</b> has been ascribed to a stem cell mutation {{leading to a}} specific deficiency of UDP-Gal:GalNAc alpha 1 -O-Ser/Thr beta 1 - 3 galactosyltransferase (beta 3 Gal-T) activity in affected cells. To test {{for the possibility that}} an allele of the beta 3 Gal-T gene might be repressed instead of mutated, we have investigated whether 5 -azacytidine or sodium n-butyrate, both inducers of gene expression, would reactivate expression of beta 3 Gal-T in cloned enzyme-deficient T cells derived from a patient affected by the Tn syndrome. Flow cytometry revealed that a single treatment induced de novo expression of the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (Gal beta 1 - 3 GalNAc-R), the product of beta 3 Gal-T activity. In addition, a sialylated epitope on CD 43 (leukosialin), which is present on normal but not on beta 3 Gal-T-deficient T cells, was also reexpressed. Although no beta 3 Gal-T activity was detectable in untreated Tn syndrome T cells, after exposure to 5 -azaC,beta 3 Gal-T activity reached nearly normal values. Both agents failed to reactivate beta 3 Gal-T in Jurkat T leukemic cells, which also lack beta 3 Gal-T activity. These data demonstrate that Tn syndrome T cells contain an intact beta 3 Gal-T gene copy and that the enzyme deficiency in this patient is due to a persistent and complete but reversible repression of a functional allele. In contrast, the cause of beta 3 Gal-T deficiency appears to be different in Jurkat T cells...|$|E
40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was {{extracted}} and purified {{from three}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains {{isolated from the}} infected lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. Two of the strains could be typed by O-specific antibody (O: 3 and O: 9), and the third was polyagglutinable (O: 3 / 9). The separated LPS was characterized by chemical and serological methods. The main neutral sugar constituents (glucose, rhamnose, and heptose) were found in various proportions in the three strains, whereas the amounts of glucosamine, galactosamine, ketodeoxyoctonate, and phosphate were more constant. Ester-bound C 12, C 16, 3 -OH-C 10, and 2 -OH-C 12, together with amide-bound 3 -OH-C 12, fatty acids were present in equimolar proportions in all three strains. Considerable amounts of LPS were liberated in the culture supernatant of the O: 3 bacteria but not in those from the other two strains. This free LPS was shown to be immunologically identical to the cell-bound LPS and the extracted LPS. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, O: 3 and O: 9 LPS showed a ladder pattern characteristic of smooth LPS, while O: 3 / 9 LPS appeared rough. Rabbit antisera used for O-typing were found by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to contain anti-LPS antibodies that reacted strongly with homologous LPS, moderately with O: 3 / 9 LPS, and slightly with heterologous LPS. Immunoblotting showed that common antigenic determinants in the core-lipid A part {{were involved in the}} observed cross-reaction. The <b>polyagglutinability</b> of P. aeruginosa may be explained by the antibodies to these common determinants that arose from the partial absence of O polysaccharides...|$|E
