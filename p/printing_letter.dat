He founded his own {{publishing}} imprint, Nobody Books, in 2005,  "to exercise maximum control over the publication process of his books" [...] and [...] "to make the book a finished expression of the photographs, rather than just a shell to house them in". Most books were produced using offset printing, though he often experiments with a hands-on, tactile approach, including materials and techniques such as lino cut <b>printing,</b> <b>letter</b> press printing, mono prints, spray paint and rubber stamps. On occasion, entire books are manufactured and assembled in his studio9 by himself and his assistant Richard, who also distribute the books. His books have received wide international acclaim. Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian in 2010, said [...] "In Britain, Stephen Gill is perhaps the best-known contemporary self-published photographer". In 2011, PHotoEspaña awarded Stephen Gill’s imprint Nobody [...] "Outstanding Publishing House of the Year" [...] award.|$|E

Land and housing tax represent government tax that in implementation handled by local government. Therefore Land and housing tax represent very potential income source to be dug and developed. Efficacy of Local Government {{in developing the}} source of earnings in the region {{will be used to}} defray development in pertinent area so that a means to develop the area potencies will decrease depended local government to central government appropriate with the purpose of region autonomy. Problems which taken in this research was how effort does conducted by Earnings Department Malang Regency in improving acceptance of Land and housing tax. The purpose of this research is to know how effort does conducted by Earnings Department Malang Regency in improving acceptance of Land and housing tax as one of source region native income. In this research, its research type is descriptive analysis, where activity of research to descript condition that happened in a research object. Nature of this research doesn’t conduct hypothesis, but descript information and analysis as according to condition researched and interpretation it. While for data collecting technique, researcher uses documentation and interview. Then data obtained to be searched its relation systematically, later on classified according to category of each indicator with pertinent variable. To make easier written data analysis systematically, hence concluded using descriptive qualitative approach. Base on result of research which was conducted indicate that acceptance of PBB Malang regency on year 2002 and year 2005 didn’t fulfill target, but on year 2003 and year 2004 acceptance of PBB fulfill acceptance target which have been determined. The goals of PBB acceptance didn’t reach because in effort to increase acceptance of land and housing tax was conducted by Earnings Department experience many weakness and insufficiency particularly in the facilities case so that it counseling performance and collection less effective in order to improve awareness of society for order to pay tax. Besides in administration process also less optimal because it still often happen mistake and or lacking in <b>printing</b> <b>Letter</b> of Information In debt Tax. Thus, the earnings Department has to optimizer entire system related with a means to increase acceptance of PBB so that a means to increase acceptance PBB as one of source of region native income able to run effectively and appropriate with target has determined. The last expectation of researcher wish this research able to give benefit to related parties so that will give comprehension how important payment PBB for development...|$|E

One represents a separate acquisition of the uppercase and lowercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters</b> (sequentially) and the other deals with letters simultaneously. In practice, teachers often asked themselves, especially in times of reforms in literacy, which model of the acquisition of the letters in initial literacy is more efficient. The research focused on the effect of the two most frequently chosen procedures for acquiring letters of structured literacy in Slovenia, namely the simultaneous treatment of the uppercase and lowercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters</b> (lowercase cursive letters and upper-case cursive letters) and consecutive treatment of <b>letters</b> (uppercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters,</b> lowercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters,</b> lowercase cursive letters, and at last, uppercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters).</b> Furthermore, the focus of the research was on the impact of gender on the ability to write. The incidence of errors was observed in terms of selected procedures for acquiring the letters in groups and gender. At the same time, the effect of consolidation of writing individual letters (uppercase and lowercase <b>printed</b> <b>letters</b> in 2 nd class, and lowercase and uppercase cursive letters in 3 rd class), was examined...|$|R

The current study evaluated an instructive procedure for teaching early braille-reading skills with 4 school-aged children with degenerative visual impairments. Following a series of pretests, braille instruction involved providing a sample braille letter and teaching the selection of the corresponding <b>printed</b> <b>letter</b> from a comparison array.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of examining printed documents for potential forgeries and copyright infringement is the identification of source printer {{as it can be}} helpful for ascertaining the leak and detecting forged documents. This paper proposes a system for classification of source printer from scanned images of printed documents using all the <b>printed</b> <b>letters</b> simultaneously. This system uses local texture patterns based features and a single classifier for classifying all the <b>printed</b> <b>letters.</b> Letters are extracted from scanned images using connected component analysis followed by morphological filtering without the need of using an OCR. Each letter is sub-divided into a flat region and an edge region, and local tetra patterns are estimated separately for these two regions. A strategically constructed pooling technique is used to extract the final feature vectors. The proposed method has been tested on both a publicly available dataset of 10 printers and a new dataset of 18 printers scanned at a resolution of 600 dpi as well as 300 dpi printed in four different fonts. The results indicate shape independence property in the proposed method as using a single classifier it outperforms existing handcrafted feature-based methods and needs much smaller number of training pages by using all the <b>printed</b> <b>letters.</b> Comment: 11 page...|$|R
