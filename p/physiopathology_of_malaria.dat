40|$|The <b>physiopathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> is complex. More {{understanding}} {{would be}} useful for a better management of the disease. This study was undertaken to describe clinical presentation and some biochemical parameters in childhood malaria {{in order to identify}} some factors of disease severity. Eighty six (86) children (0 to 15 years old) were recruited in Douala, clinical data recorded and blood sample collected. Thirty one (31) healthy children were also targeted to serve as control. Blood glucose, hemoglobin, transaminases and nitric oxide were determined by spectrophotometry. C reactive protein (CRP) was also investigated. The results confirmed that severe malaria significantly affects children under 5 years. Severe malaria was associated with hyperpyrexia and prostration. Coma, convulsions and unconsciousness were more indicative of cerebral malaria. Hemoglobin and blood glucose levels decreased significantly in severe malaria patients compared with uncomplicated malaria patients or controls (P < 0. 001). On the contrary, blood transaminases and CRP levels increased significantly in malaria patients compared to controls (P < 0. 001). From these results, it is clear that childhood severe malaria is associated with prostration, coma, unconsciousness, convulsions and hyperpyrexia. Low levels of haemoglobin and glycemia, as well as high levels of transaminases and CRP has been identified as predictor of malaria severity...|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is {{expressed}} {{in a range of}} clinical complications that include increased disease severity in pregnant women, decreased fetal viability, intra-uterine growth retardation, low birth weight and infant mortality. The <b>physiopathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> in pregnancy is difficult to scrutinize and attempts were made in the past to use animal models for pregnancy malaria studies. Here, we describe a comprehensive mouse experimental model that recapitulates many of the pathological and clinical features typical of human severe malaria in pregnancy. We used P. berghei ANKA-GFP infection during pregnancy to evoke a prominent inflammatory response in the placenta that entails CD 11 b mononuclear infiltration, up-regulation of MIP- 1 alpha chemokine and is associated with marked reduction of placental vascular spaces. Placenta pathology was associated with decreased fetal viability, intra-uterine growth retardation, gross post-natal growth impairment and increased disease severity in pregnant females. Moreover, we provide evidence that CSA and HA, known to mediate P. falciparum adhesion to human placenta, are also involved in mouse placental malaria infection. We propose that reduction of maternal blood flow in the placenta is a key pathogenic factor in murine pregnancy malaria and we hypothesize that exacerbated innate inflammatory responses to Plasmodium infected red blood cells trigger severe placenta pathology. This experimental model provides an opportunity to identify cell and molecular components of severe PAM pathogenesis and to investigate the inflammatory response that leads to the observed fetal and placental blood circulatio...|$|E

Knowledge of the profiles of immune cells {{associated with the}} <b>physiopathology</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy-associated <b>malaria</b> (PAM) is scarce. We conducted a longitudinal, prospective study, both in Benin and Tanzania, including ∼ 1000 pregnant women in each site with systematic follow-up at scheduled antenatal visits until delivery. We used ex vivo flow cytometry to identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) profiles {{that are associated with}} PAM and anaemia, determining the phenotypic composition and activation status of PBMC in selected sub-groups with and without PAM both at inclusion and at delivery in a total of 302 women. Both at inclusion and at delivery PAM was associated with significantly increased frequencies both of B cells overall and of activated B cells. Infection-related profiles were otherwise quite distinct at the two different time-points. At inclusion, PAM was associated with anaemia, with an increased frequency of immature monocytes and with a decreased frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg). At delivery, infected women presented with significantly fewer plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC), more myeloid DC expressing low levels of HLA-DR, and more effector T cells (Teff) compared to uninfected women. Independent associations with an increased risk of anaemia were found for altered antigen-presenting cell frequencies at inclusion, but for an increased frequency of Teff at delivery. Our findings emphasize the prominent role played by B cells during PAM whenever it arises during pregnancy, whilst also revealing signature changes in other circulating cell types that, we conclude, primarily reflect the relative duration of the infections. Thus, the acute, recently-acquired infections present at delivery were marked by changes in DC and Teff frequencies, contrasting with infections at inclusion, considered chronic in nature, that were characterized by an abundance of immature monocytes and a paucity of Treg in PBMC...|$|R
40|$|The <b>physiopathology</b> <b>of</b> {{experimental}} cerebral <b>malaria</b> (CM), {{an acute}} neurological complication of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection, involves interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), two cytokines {{that are known}} to modulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether the genetic susceptibility to CM is related to the constitutive or IFN-gamma-induced expression of MHC molecules on brain microvessels. To this end, brain microvascular endothelial cells (B-MVEC) were isolated from CM-susceptible (CM-S, CBA/J) and resistant (CM-R, BALB/c) mice. By flow cytometry, we found that less than 5 % of CM-S B-MVEC constitutively expressed MHC class I molecules, in contrast to up to 90 % of CM-R B-MVEC. Upon stimulation with IFN-gamma, the percentage of positive cells for MHC class I molecules in CM-S B-MVEC became comparable to CM-R B-MVEC, but a higher fluorescence intensity existed on CM-S B-MVEC compared with CM-R B-MVEC. MHC class II molecules were not constitutively expressed on B-MVEC from either strain. IFN-gamma-induced expression of MHC class II (I-A, I-E) molecules was significantly higher in CM-S than CM-R B-MVEC both in percentage of positive cells and fluorescence intensity. These data demonstrate that absent or low MHC class I and higher inducibility of MHC class II expression on B-MVEC are associated with the genetic susceptibility to CM...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is a vector born {{infectious}} disease that represents an enormous health and socio-economic burden worldwide, particularly for communities from tropical and subtropical regions, {{where more than}} 500 million of clinical cases are recorded every year. Human malaria is produced by four different Plamodium species, from which P. falciparum and P. vivax are the prevalent species. The clinical manifestations <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> are very pleomorphic and could range from febrile episodes of short duration if an effective and opportune treatment is installed, to severe systemic complications and death. One of the most frequent and severe, malaria complication is anemia that {{represents one of the}} major obstacles for the development of endemic areas, due to its negative impact for children performance at school as well as for adult productivity. The <b>physiopathology</b> <b>of</b> anemia is poorly understood, but it is accepted that the overall anemia burden is produced through multiple mechanisms that include the destruction of both infected and non-infected red blood cells, erythrophagocytoses and a potential arrest of erythropoyesis. Anemia contributes significantly to the severity <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> and to its mortality.

40|$|Abstract – Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline, including memory loss, behavioral and psychological symptoms and personality changes. The neuropathological hallmarks of AD are the presence of neuritic (senile) plaques (NP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), along with neuronal loss, dystrophic neurites, and gliosis. Neuritic plaques are extracellular lesions and their main constituent is the amyloid-β 42 peptide (Aβ 42). Neurofibrillary tangles are intracellular lesions that {{are mainly composed of}} hyperphosphorylated TAu protein. In this article, we review the major hypotheses concerning the <b>physiopathology</b> <b>of</b> AD, focusing on the β-amyloid cascade as primary events (supported by the “βaptists”) and cytoskeletal abnormalities secondary to the hyperphosphorylation of protein TAu (as advocated by the “Tauists”).
