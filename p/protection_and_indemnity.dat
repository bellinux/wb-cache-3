500|$|New Carissa was a Panamanian-flagged {{dry bulk}} {{freighter}} optimized for carriage of woodchips. She {{was owned by}} the Japanese shipping concern Nippon Yusen Kaisha via a subsidiary, Green Atlas Shipping. The ship's operator and manager, Taiheiyo Kaiun Co. Ltd. and TMM Co. Ltd. respectively, were also based in Japan. The vessel was built by Imabari Shipbuilding Co. in Japan using an all-steel construction, and was laid down on August 30, 1989. The freighter was 195meters (639ft) long and 32meters (106ft) wide, with a draft of 10.8m(35.5ft) when fully loaded. She had a gross tonnage of 36,571tons, a net tonnage of 16,524tons, and was powered by an [...] direct-drive diesel engine. She had a maximum crew complement of 26 sailors, and was in service hauling woodchips (used for paper pulp production).

Negotiating agreements that govern the shared use of infrastructure can be challenging, especially on issues such as liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity.</b> As requested, this report discusses (1) the liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions in agreements among passenger and freight railroads, and the resulting implications of these provisions; (2) federal and state court opinions and Surface Transportation Board (STB) decisions related to contractual liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions of passenger and freight railroad agreements; (3) factors that influence the negotiations of liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions among passenger and freight railroads; and (4) potential options for facilitating negotiations of liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions. GAO obtained information from all existing and proposed commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and major freight railroads through site visits or telephone interviews.

40|$|The {{first section}} {{describes}} {{the historical development of}} contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity,</b> from {{a contractual obligation}} to a court implied obligation followed by an expansion to various federally regulated fields.

The third section examines the position of the various federal courts on the issue of contribution or <b>indemnity</b> <b>and</b> their rationales, along with that of the commentators. Since ERISA generally does not permit actions against nonfiduciaries, this article excludes those opinions dealing with contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> between a fiduciary and a non-fiduciary, most of which appeared prior to the Supreme Court's pronouncement with respect to non-fiduciaries. The fourth section provides the solution pursuant to the Supreme Court's directive for finding contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> for a federal statute, finds that the statutory language does not support contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity,</b> <b>and</b> shows that the solution of disallowing contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> comports with the legislative history and the purposes of ERISA...|$|R

5000|$|A {{marine policy}} {{typically}} covered only three-quarter of the insured's liabilities towards third parties. The typical liabilities arise {{in respect of}} collision with another ship, known as [...] "running down" [...] (collision with a fixed object is a [...] "allision"), and wreck removal (a wreck may serve to block a harbour, for example). In the 19th century, shipowners banded together in mutual underwriting clubs known as <b>Protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>Indemnity</b> Clubs (P&I), to insure the remaining one-quarter liability amongst themselves. These Clubs are still in existence today and have become the model for other specialized and noncommercial marine and non-marine mutuals, for example in relation to oil pollution and nuclear risks. Clubs work {{on the basis of}} agreeing to accept a shipowner as a member and levying an initial [...] "call" [...] (premium). With the fund accumulated, reinsurance will be purchased; however, if the loss experience is unfavourable one or more [...] "supplementary calls" [...] may be made. Clubs also typically try to build up reserves, but this puts them at odds with their mutual status.Because liability regimes vary throughout the world, insurers are usually careful to limit or exclude American Jones Act liability.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} co-operative self-regulation, or co-management, in safety and environmental regulation in the shipping industry. The focus is on <b>Protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>Indemnity</b> (P&I) Clubs in which third-party liabilities of 90 % of the world's fleet (by tonnage) are insured. In theory, this creates a mutual interest amongst shipowners in minimising risk. The paper examines how this mutual interest is translated into individual behaviour, and the institutional challenges involved in maintaining mutuality within and between the Clubs. There follows {{an evaluation of the}} legitimacy of enrolling private interest groups in regulation in which a wide range of actors hold a stake. The paper concludes that P&I Clubs make a modest contribution to safety and environmental regulation, but also have some potentially unfavourable wider social implications.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the Norwegian marine insurance market {{by identifying the}} threats and possibilities for an insurance company to expand on the Norwegian market.

This is done by identifying the competitors on the market and analyzing them one by one. In addition theme interviews with marine insurance brokers {{and a member of the}} Nordic marine insurance organization are held where the industry in general is analyzed. The analysis shows that the Norwegian market in general is stable and experiencing slow growth. This means that the competition is a market share competition.
