5|$|The oldest gymnasiums in {{the country}} are Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík and Menntaskólinn á Akureyri. Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík traces its origin to 1056, when a school was {{established}} in Skálholt. The school was moved to Reykjavík in 1786, but <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> conditions forced it to move again in 1805 to Bessastaðir near Reykjavík. In 1846 the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjavík.|$|E
5|$|Among the ECSC's {{greatest}} achievements {{are those}} on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely <b>poor</b> <b>housing.</b> Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers {{to buy a}} home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.|$|E

5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> conditions.|$|E

25|$|The professional, {{education}} and health care sectors of the Northwest Arkansas economy have been growing steadily since 2007. Between 2007 and 2013, the region has seen a growth of 8,300 jobs in the region, with 6,100 added in {{education and}} health professions and 4,300 jobs added in the leisure and hospitality jobs related to the region's cultural amenities. The government and transportation sectors have remained relatively constant between 2007 and 2013, however the manufacturing sector has seen steady decline, mirroring national averages. The construction and real estate sectors saw large declines attributable to the <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> market during the economic downturn.|$|E
25|$|Henderson Street {{was built}} {{as part of}} the Leith Improvement Scheme, a Bill which became an Act of Parliament known as the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Act, (Leith Improvement Scheme) in 1880. The {{construction}} of the street required that 18 pre-existing closes be demolished in order {{to make way for the}} new buildings and layout. At that time, housing conditions in this part of Leith were very <b>poor.</b> <b>Housing</b> was overcrowded, poverty and ill health were rife and infant mortality was particularly high. Consequently, it was hoped that the creation of Henderson Street would improve living conditions for the local residents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Poor</b> <b>housing</b> {{quality and}} low incomes {{contributes}} to fuel poverty, a phenomenomen {{that is more}} common among lower-income household than among households in general. Over the past decade home energy costs have risen in American homes in general. For low-income households this cost increase is even more pressing, for which home energy expenditures can {{be as high as}} a fifth of household income and {{more than a quarter of}} total housing costs. For that reason, improving energy efficiency has been pointed out as one of the challenges for American housing by the Joint Center for Housing Studies.|$|E

With the program, bonded labor, it was guaranteed that the workers were going to receive a visa, {{that would allow them}} to live and work in the United States. Upon arrival, the company made a false statement to lure the workers and having a higher recruitment. The fees that were imposed to the farm workers were so high, that the debt was impossible to pay with the employment they were given. Many were living in <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> conditions (up to a dozen living per home),threats, and even physical assaults.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Farrington {{of a sample}} of London males {{followed}} between age 8 and 48 included studying which factors scored 10 or more on the PCL:SV at age 48. The strongest factors included having a convicted parent, being physically neglected, low involvement of the father with the boy, low family income, and coming from a disrupted family. Other significant factors included poor supervision, harsh discipline, large family size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and <b>poor</b> <b>housing.</b> There has also been association between psychopathy and detrimental treatment by peers. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine the extent of an environmental influence on the development of psychopathy because of evidence of its strong heritability.|$|E
25|$|The {{regeneration}} of {{the city}} during the 1990s and 2000s also saw many residential areas {{of the city}} substantially altered. A notable example was the Pype Hayes council estate in the Erdington area of the city, which was built in the interwar years but was eventually completely redeveloped due to structural defects. Many of the city's 1960s council properties, mostly multi-storey flats and maisonettes, have also been demolished in similar redevelopments, including the large Castle Vale estate in the north-east of the city, where all but two of the estate's 34 tower blocks were demolished as part of the regeneration of an estate which had been blighted by crime, unemployment and <b>poor</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Orville was {{actively}} involved in his community, making a point to give back and help those less fortunate. One of the big problems then and now was poverty. As a result, Jefferson County established a <b>poor</b> <b>house</b> system paid for by appropriations from each town. In 1826, Hungerford was appointed {{as one of the}} first superintendents of the <b>poor</b> <b>house</b> located on the 150-acre Dudley Farm in Le Ray, New York.

25|$|Before the 1970s, Cantonese {{immigrants}} had vastly dominated Chinese {{immigration to}} New York City; however during the 1970s, the Taiwanese immigrants {{were the first}} wave of Chinese immigrants who spoke Mandarin rather than Cantonese to arrive in New York City. Due to the dominance of Cantonese-speaking immigrants, who were largely working-class in Manhattan's Chinatown, as well as the language barrier and <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> conditions there, Taiwanese immigrants, who {{were more likely to have}} attained higher educational standards and socioeconomic status, could not relate to Manhattan's Chinatown, and chose to settle in Flushing instead. As the Taiwanese population grew, a Flushing Chinatown was created with a higher standard of living and better housing conditions.|$|E
25|$|Nazi Germany kept French POWs as forced labourers {{throughout}} the war. They added compulsory (and volunteer) workers from occupied nations, especially in metal factories. The shortage of volunteers led the Vichy government {{to pass a}} law in September 1942 that effectively deported workers to Germany, where they constituted fifteen percent of the labor force by August 1944. The largest number worked in the giant Krupp steel works in Essen. Low pay, long hours, frequent bombings, and crowded air raid shelters added to the unpleasantness of <b>poor</b> <b>housing,</b> inadequate heating, limited food, and poor medical care, all compounded by harsh Nazi discipline. They finally returned home in the summer of 1945. The forced labour draft encouraged the French Resistance and undermined the Vichy government.|$|E

500|$|Concurrently with {{designing}} {{churches and}} building railways, Sharpe was {{heavily involved in}} the civic life of Lancaster, particularly in pioneering sanitary reform. [...] By political persuasion he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, {{the core of the}} Lancaster Conservative Association. He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission. [...] He was also a visitor to the national schools, and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year, at that time a position more like that of a [...] "chief magistrate". Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town, and resolved to improve it. The town was overcrowded, it suffered from <b>poor</b> <b>housing,</b> open sewers, overflowing cesspits, and a very poor water supply, mainly from wells polluted by infiltration. [...] Many people suffered from typhus, and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera. The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title, including [...] "cleansing, lighting and watching" [...] the town. However, there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers. [...] The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849. The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health.|$|E
