One is a soft plastic 10-inch version that includes a series of projected stills from the film on his stomach, which can be changed when the figure's arm is moved, and which emits accompanying sounds. Deluxe Flying Baymax, which retails for $39.99, depicts the armored version of the character and features lights and sounds that activate at the <b>push</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. Placing the Hiro figurine on his back changes the sounds into speech and when the figure is tilted, the sounds are those of flying. The Armor-Up Baymax (original retail cost $19.99) comes with 20 pieces of armor that can be assembled onto the robot by the owner. The other characters from the film, including the other members of team and Professor Callaghan (who is called Yokai) are issued in 4-inch action figures, each of which have eight points of articulation.|$|E

25|$|Mawari-butai (revolving stage) {{developed}} in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage <b>pushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The kuraten (“darkened revolve”) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for akaten (“lighted revolve”), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early eighteenth century.|$|R

2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle.

Another form is an O-T-F (out-the-front) switchblade, which only {{requires}} the <b>push</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed.

2500|$|Marshall {{began to}} see more {{competition}} from American amplifier companies such as Mesa Boogie and Soldano. Marshall then updated the JCM800 range with additional models and new features such as [...] "channel switching", which meant that players could switch between clean and distorted tones with the <b>push</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foot-operated switch. This feature debuted in the 2205 (50 watt) and 2210 (100 watt) series and these amps contained more pre-amp gain than ever thanks to a new innovation; diode clipping. This meant a solid-state diode added additional distortion to the signal path, akin to adding a distortion pedal. As such the split channel JCM800s were the highest gain Marshalls yet built – [...] "When they were first released, many players were shocked (some were even put off) by its bright, intense distortion – far {{more than any other}} amp of the day." [...] While hotly criticised today among valve purists, these amps were more popular than ever, finding mass acceptance within the hard rock community and still in use today by many. The split-channel JCM800s are still used by Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and were played exclusively by Michael Schenker (UFO) for many years.|$|E
2500|$|Pontiac {{produced}} cars offering [...] (3.25x3.75 in, 82.5x95mm) L-head straight 6-cylinder {{engines in}} the Pontiac Chief of 1927; its stroke was the shortest of any American {{car in the}} industry at the time. The Chief sold 39,000 units within six months of its appearance at the 1926 New York Auto Salon, hitting 76,742 at twelve months. The next year, it became the top-selling six in the U.S., ranking seventh in overall sales. By 1933, it had moved up to producing the least expensive cars available with straight eight engines. This was done by using many components from the 6-cylinder Chevrolet Master, such as the body, but installing a large chrome strip {{on the top and}} center of the front hood Pontiac called the [...] "Silver Streak". In the late 1930s, Pontiac used a Buick [...] "torpedo" [...] body for one of its models, just prior to its being used by Chevrolet, earning some media attention for the marque. An unusual feature of the [...] "torpedo"-bodied exhibition car was that, with <b>push</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button, the front half of the body would open showing the engine and the car's front seat interior. In 1937, the eight-cylinder had a [...] wheelbase, while the six-cylinder had a [...] wheelbase. In 1940, Pontiac introduced the Torpedo as a production model. On 2 February 1942, a Pontiac was the last civilian automobile manufactured in the United States during World War II, as all automobile factories converted to military production.|$|E
