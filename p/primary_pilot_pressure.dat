25|$|Many pilot {{training}} installations discontinued {{training in}} 1945. The last contract <b>primary</b> <b>pilot</b> schools ended their operations in October. By that time, only Goodfellow Field, Texas, and Tuskegee Field, Alabama, continued to offer <b>primary</b> <b>pilot</b> training. The last class of black <b>pilots</b> graduated from <b>primary</b> training at Tuskegee on 20 November. Goodfellow's last primary class transferred to Randolph Field to finish training. Randolph began primary training on 26 December.|$|R
40|$|Electro-hydraulic {{proportional}} {{flow valves}} {{are widely used}} in hydraulic industry. There are several different structures and working principles. However, flow valves based on the existing principles usually have some shortcomings such as {{the complexity of the}} system and additional energy losses. A concept for a two-stage poppet flow valve with <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> drop – <b>pilot</b> spool opening compensation is presented, and the linear relationship between the pilot stage and main stage, the semi-empirical flow equation are used in the electronic flow controller. To achieve the accurate control of the outlet flow, the actual input voltage of the pilot spool valve is regulated according to the actual <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> drop, the desired flow rate and the given input voltage. The results show that the <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> drop – <b>pilot</b> spool opening compensation method is feasible, and the proposed proportional flow control valve with this compensation method has a good static and dynamic performance...|$|R

5000|$|The Quick Dump Valve is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the choices of valves for spudding. A QDV is a spool valve that is balanced under pressure with {{one end of the}} spool oriented toward the barrel. The spool is manually unbalanced allowing pressure between the end of the spool and the projectile in the barrel. The air pressure then forces the spool back and the projectile forward. Since the valve is triggered with no <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure,</b> the valve snaps open with no <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> to hinder it. Currently it is not commercially for sale and must be hand built by the hobbyist like most piston valves.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} use of sensors in mobile hydraulic equipment, the need for hydraulic pilot lines is decreasing, being replaced by electrical wiring and electrically con-trollable components. For controlling some of the existing hydraulic components there are, however, still a need for being able to generate a hydraulic <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this paper con-trolling a hydraulic variable pump is considered. The LS-pressure is measured electrically and the hydraulic <b>pilot</b> <b>pressure</b> is generated using a small spool valve. From a control point of view there are two approaches for controlling this system, by either generating a copy of the LS-pressure, the LS-pressure being the output, or letting the output be the pump pressure. The focus of the current paper is on the controller design based on the first approach. Specif-ically a controlled leakage flow is used to avoid the need for a switching control structure. ...|$|R

5000|$|Shunsuke Akagi (voiced by Kentarou Itou) — The <b>primary</b> <b>pilot</b> of Dai-Guard. The headstrong, idealistic and impulsive, 25 {{year old}} Akagi {{can be seen}} as the heart and brawn of the three Dai-Guard pilots. Beforehand, he was merely an office worker for the 21st Century Defense Security Corporation, but he manages to achieve his dreams of {{becoming}} a [...] "Giant Robot pilot." [...] During the return of the Heterodynes, he and his two friends Ibuki and Aoyama become the pilots of Dai-Guard, and intend to put it to use in order to fight off the Heterodyne threat. Akagi loves his job a little too much and manages to stick out among his fellow workers as the more enthusiastic one. Akagi always has the best intentions, even though they usually get him into trouble. Intriguingly, his distinctive personality makes him a natural as Dai-Guard's <b>primary</b> <b>pilot</b> and his cartoon-samurai ethical code quickly wins him a place in the hearts of the public. He refuses to take or allow actions that will endanger civilian lives and/or property if there is any alternative whatsoever.|$|R
