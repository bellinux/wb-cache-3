40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the variations in trophic relationships among species of blue crabs, which may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that enable closely related species to exploit the same trophic niche. Callinectes sapidus, C. rathbunae, and C. similis from Tamiahua Lagoon, Mexico, were used in the present study to investigate this question. A total of 4, 038 crab-gut contents were analyzed. Of these 1, 350 belonged to C sapidus, 1, 128 to C rathbunae, and 1, 560 to C similis. Six groups of food items were identified: plant fragments (Halodule spp.), micromolluscs (Mulinia lateralis and Macoma atenta, crustaceans (<b>Penaeus</b> <b>spp.</b> and Callinectes spp.), animal residues, and sand and mud. A seasonal variation in prey composition was observed, as well as differences among ages of the three species. In general, as the size class increased, plant matter, sediment, and animal residues decreased, and micromolluscs and crustaceans increased. A clear overlap was detected for C sapidus-C. rathbunae of their trophic niches, with a maximum overlap in winter when both species ate practically the same type of food. The same pattern was observed also for C sapidus-C. similis. Callinectes similis-C rathbunae show overlap in spring and winter, when ovigerous females are on their breeding grounds. Ontogenetic changes in the diet and niche overlap in relation to seasonal changes in reproductive behavior allow the three species to utilize the same resources at Tamiahua Lagoon, Mexico...|$|E

The most evident effect in P borealis was {{the decrease in}} the relative amount of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and a concomitant {{increase in the number}} and intensity of bands of molecular size about 100 kDa cross-reacting with anti-MHC antiserum. MHC degradation of P borealis was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of partially isolated native myosin. Other prominent features were the disappearance of bands of about 67 and 50 kDa after 24 h and the appearance of a band of slightly less than 50 kDa after 5 h of ice-storage. These last bands showed the potential to be used as freshness markers. One spot tentatively identified as desmin did not suffer significant changes in any of the three species. Two bands (about 100 and 96 kDa) gave a positive reaction with the ¿-actinin antibody in the zero-time extract of P borealis, but after 24 h only one faint 96 kDa band was detected. In contrast, the extracts of P japonicus and P monodon did not suffer significant alterations during the examined period, and even after 92 h of ice-storage only the 100 kDa anti-¿-actinin cross-reacting band was clearly visible in the high-salt extract of P japonicus. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Shrimp {{farming is}} one of the most {{important}} industries in coastal China. During the period from 1988 to 1992, more than one million people were employed in the field and about 200, 000 t of shrimp was produced each year. But since 1993, the industry has been frustrated by problems. This paper briefly introduces the developmental history and the current status of shrimp farming in China. Some key constraints to sustainable shrimp culture include disease, impacts on the environment, and seedstock quality. Achievements in scientific research which have been gained in recent years are epizootic pathogen research, diagnostic techniques, comprehensive culture techniques, polyculture and methods of culture in lower salinities. The priority issues for future research are high health seedstock, healthy culture systems, fast diagnosis of shrimp diseases, development of vaccines and immunostimulants, high quality formulated feed and techniques for ecosystem optimisation. Brief Review There are about 100 penaeid shrimp species in China’s coastal waters, of which a dozen <b>Penaeus</b> <b>spp.</b> and Metapenaeus spp. have commercial value (Liu 1989 a). The main species cultured in China are Penaeus chinensis, P. monodon, P. japonicus, P. merguinsis and P. penicillatus. Chinese shrimp farms are distributed along almost 18, 000 km of coastline from Hainan Province in the tropics to Liaoning Province in the temperate zone. Farmers usually culture two crops of shrimp per year in southern China, while to the north of Yangzi River farmers can harvest only one crop. More than 80 % of shrimp farms use low intensity culture technology. Air blowers or paddlewheel aerators are rare. The modern shrimp farming industry in China has a history of only about two decades but it has gone through an extraordinary experience which can be roughly divided into four stages: steady increas...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on the {{biodiversity}} {{in relation to}} conservative and non-conservative parameters in the Mangalavanam mangrove ecosystem, located in the northern fringes of Cochin City {{have been carried out}} from January to June 2002. The mangrove ecosystem is regularly under tidal influence and hence submergence and emergence of land takes place depending on the tidal amplitude. The average dissolved oxygen of the water was found to be 3. 5 ml/l despite the fact, phytoplankton was abundant in the ecosystem. It reveals that respiratory demand of the aquatic biota has exceeded the photosynthetic oxygen production. The indirect relationship exhibited by the quantity of phytoplankton and oxygen is attributed to anthropogenic activities, which resulted in to the eutrophication of the mangrove ecosystem. The general nutrient load was at a higher level. The macrophytic vegetation was dominated by A^icennia marina, Rhizdphora mucronata and Acanthus ilicifolius. The presence of Avicennia and Acanthus in majority of the area that showed decrease in salinity and more freshwater influx. The phytoplankton community was dominated by djatoms represented Naviculaceae followed by Coscinodisceae, which Is evidenced by the presence of high quantity of silicate. The Zooplankton was dominated by copepods. Benthic community is dominated by the infauna such as polychaetes and decapods. Juveniles of common brackish water fishes. Chanos spp., Liza spp., Etroplus spp., Silago spp., Lethrinus spp. and Lutjanus spp., and species of crustaceans like <b>Penaeus</b> <b>spp.,</b> Metapenaeus spp., Macrobrachium spp., Acetes spp., Metaplex spp., Sesarma spp., Uca spp., and Scylla spp., {{have been found to be}} the residents of the mangrove ecosystem. Avian fauna comprises mostly little cormorants (Phalactocorax niger) and black crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax). Other arboreal fauna is dominated by Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus). An evaluation on {{the biodiversity}} of the mangrove ecosystem in the light of the present investigations reveals that species diversity Is less, but moderate population density of available species could be observed. To put It In a nutshell, human interventions on the environment has been detrimental and a general degradation of the ecosystem has been evidenced by the emergence of terrestrial vegetation and shrinking of the true mangrove areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{focuses on}} quality and safety {{management}} of tropical shrimp (<b>Penaeus</b> <b>spp.)</b> using Benin (West Africa) {{as an example}} of a shrimp exporting country. The entire supply chain, from fishing areas (brackish waters) to shrimp processing plants, was investigated. The steps of the chain prior to shrimp processing at the freezer plants were critical for shrimp quality and safety because of prevailing temperature abuse and inappropriate hygienic conditions. Combining culture-dependent (plate counts) and culture independent (DGGE, clone libraries analysis) approaches, it was found that bacterial concentration in shrimps was higher than that of their surrounding water and sediment. Conversely, bacterial diversity was higher in water or sediment than in shrimps. At species level, distinct bacterial communities were associated with sediment, water or shrimp samples. Spoilage evaluation of shrimps showed that during storage at 0 ºC, Pseudomonas spp. were dominant, whereas at 7 ºC and 28 ºC, H 2 S-producing bacteria were the dominant group of microorganisms. An empirical model predicting shrimp shelf-life as a function of constant storage temperature was developed. Isolates producing strong off-odor were identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing as mainly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Enterobacteriaceae at 28 ºC or 7 ºC and Pseudomonas spp. and LAB (Carnobacterium maltaromaticum) at 0 ºC. The fastest growing isolates namely, Pseudomonas psychrophila and C. maltaromaticum were selected for their spoilage activity and for modeling studies. P. psychrophila had a higher growth rate and a higher spoilage activity at 0 to 15 ºC, while at 28 ºC, C. maltaromaticum had a higher growth rate. Models predicting the growth of pseudomonads in shrimps as a function of temperature were constructed. These models were validated under dynamic storage temperatures simulating actual temperature fluctuation in the supply chain. Using different risk classification approaches, the main foodborne pathogen risks identified were Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella. The management of the risks posed by the main pathogens was addressed using different scenarios to meet the set food safety objectives. Based on quantitative and ecological studies, this thesis developed tools that can be used in decision-making regarding tropical shrimp quality and safety management.  ...|$|E
40|$|To assess {{potential}} {{indices of}} nutritional condition, we examined changes in lipid {{content and the}} blood refractive index (BRI) of postlarval, juvenile and adult prawns (<b>Penaeus</b> <b>spp.)</b> that had been starved or fed to different levels of satiation. The whole-body lipid content (WBL) of small juvenile P. esculentus (20 - 120 mg wet weight) decreased significantly after 12 h of starvation. The WBL of postlarval P. monodon (4 - 10 mg wet weight) also decreased during starvation, with WBL almost halving after 5 days. Juvenile P. monodon (0. 5 - 1. 3 g wet weight) fed at 25 or 50 % of the satiation ration for 6 days had significantly lower WBL than satiated prawns. The lowest concentrations of WBL were recorded for starved prawns and those fed to 25 % of satiation. In larger juvenile P. semisulcatus (0. 3 - 1. 2 g wet weight) the WBL was also sensitive to starvation, declining significantly after only 1 day. The blood lipid content and digestive gland lipid of adult P. semisulcatus (28 - 43 g wet weight) decreased significantly after 4 days of starvation. The BRI of starved prawns and those fed to satiation correlated well with the WBL {{in the case of}} smaller prawns (r > 0. 96) and with the blood lipid of adult P. semisulcatus (28 - 43 g wet weight). However, there was a weaker correlation between BRI and WBL in prawns whose feed allocations were between starvation and satiation (r = 0. 86). These results from several prawn species and different size classes show that both the BRI and WBL have potential as indices of nutritional condition. Although BRI is much easier and cheaper to measure than WBL and can be measured in the field, it is suitable only for prawns from which sufficient blood can be obtained - generally those larger than 300 mg wet weight (7 mm carapace length). In contrast, WBL can be measured with a good level of precision in individual prawns as small as 20 mg wet weight (3 mm carapace length) using relatively simple laboratory equipment...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} {{for three years}} study of distribution and abundance of penaeid eggs, larvae and postlarvae in Manora Channel and Korangi Creek was obtained through regular sampling (three to four times in a month) in the two areas. In Manora Channel 399 eggs and 5639 larvae were caught in 74 positive hauls and in Korangi Creek 1339 eggs and 5496 larvae were caught in 235 positive bauls. The larvae were identified to genus level. Parapenae-opsis larvae were the most abundant while Metapenaeus and Penaeus larvae were second and totally absent from the samples. The larvae belonging to other than the above mentioned three commercial genera were scarce. In the two inlets the eggs appeared in significant numbers only during January to March, while larvae abundant in the summer months The distribution and abundance of penaeid eggs, larvae and postarvae were studied in the coastal waters of Pakistan through samples colleted during R/V, Dr. Fridt-jof Nansen curises (January to June 1977). A total of 3761 penaeid eggs and 1072 penaeid larvae were taken in 87 positive surface hauls. 1145 penaeid eggs and 161 penaeid larvae were caught in 31 positive oblique hauls. The most productive area in respect of penaeid eggs, larvae and postlarvae was located inbetween Ormara and Indus Delta. Penaeid eggs were most abundant in the coastal waters of Pakistan in January-February and gradually decreased in number towards June. They were more abundant in the off-shore than in the inshore waters. The larvae were found distributed more closely to the coast. The larvae were identified to genus level.
