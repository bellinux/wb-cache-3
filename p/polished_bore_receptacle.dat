40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. There are two important omissions {{in the literature on}} <b>bore</b> <b>polishing,</b> firstly {{there is no evidence of}} the successful development of a reliable tribo test device to simulate <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> and secondly, the mechanism of <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> has not been fully defined. The aims of this study were: 1. To establish the principal characteristics of <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> In engines. 2. To produce <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> in the laboratory. 3. Differentiate between two reference oils in a laboratory tribo test. 4. To understand the mechanism of <b>bore</b> <b>polishing.</b> The principal characteristics of <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> have been identified by the examination of Tornado cylinder bores from an engine test. The graphite structure is visible on the surface which has a surface finish of less then 0. 125 micro-m in C. L. A. value. The components used in these tests were a grey cast iron piston ring running on a grey cast iron cylinder bore typically used in commercial engines. A reciprocating tribo test was used to distinguish between the two reference oils. The result showed higher friction, wear and a smoother surface with the oil causing <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> compared to the other oil which did not produce <b>bore</b> <b>polishing.</b> Adding carbon, taken from the wall of a piston used in an engine test, to the lubricant in the laboratory tribo test produced a phenomenon resembling <b>bore</b> <b>polishing.</b> Comparisons have been made between the tribo test results and service engines and a good correlation has been obtained. Several analytical techniques have been used and the knowledge of <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> has been advanced. In particular, it is suggested that a combination of two processes, one mechanical and the other chemical, are associated with <b>bore</b> <b>polishing.</b> Four wear mechanisms were identified during this investigation; abrasion, delamination, corrosion and adhesion...|$|R

40|$|Micro bore {{finishing}} for {{metal and}} ceramic materials {{has been a}} challenge in the manufacturing industry. Unfortunately, little is understood about how to <b>polish</b> a micro <b>bore</b> and how to assess its inner wall quality because {{it is difficult to}} access the micro <b>bore</b> for either <b>polishing</b> or measurement. This article reports on a feasibility study of the abrasive flow <b>polishing</b> of micro <b>bores</b> of 260 similar to 500 -mum diameters and 25 similar to 50 length/diameter ratios for both metal and ceramic materials. An abrasive flow polishing machine was designed and built with turbulent flow characteristics. Polishing of steel S 45 C bores of 400 - and 500 -mum diameters, stainless steel 304 bores of 500 -mum diameter, and zirconia bores of 260 -mum diameter was conducted. Surface roughness and topography of the polished inner walls of micro bores were characterized using profilometry and optical interferometry from the three-dimensional point of view. Significant reduction in surface roughness of the micro bore inner walls has been made in the polishing processes. The results indicate that it is feasible to apply the abrasive flow polishing technology for metal and ceramic micro bores of diameters of 260 mum or larger and the length/diameter ratios of 25 or higher. It is found that surface roughness of the <b>polished</b> micro <b>bore</b> inner walls decreases with an increase of the abrasive flow passes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, the {{acoustic}} dissipation is investigated experimentally in wooden pipes of different species {{commonly used in}} woodwind instrument making: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), pear wood (Pyrus communis L.), boxwood (Buxus sempervirens), and African Blackwood (Dalbergia melanoxylon). The pipes are parallel to the grain, except one which forms an angle of 60 ° with the fiber direction. An experimental method, involving input impedance measurements with several lengths of air column, is introduced to estimate the characteristic impedance and the attenuation factor in the pipes. Their comparison reveals significant differences of acoustic dissipation among the species considered. The attenuation factors are ranked {{in the following order}} from largest to smallest: maple, boxwood, pear wood, and African Blackwood. This order is the same before and after <b>polishing</b> the <b>bore,</b> which is an essential step in the making process of wind instrument. For maple, changing the pipe direction of 60 ° considerably increases the attenuation factor, compared to those of the other pipes, parallel to the grain. Further, polishing tends to reduce {{the acoustic}} dissipation in the wooden pipes, especially for the most porous species. As a result, the influence of polishing in the making procedure depends on the selected wood species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Stents {{have been}} used for the {{treatment}} of cardiovascular diseases and are often placed inside coronary arteries. The manufacture of metal stents is a challenging issue because of the features, like geometry and the material of stents. An improved manufacturing process of stents is presented. The proposed processes consist of the following steps: <b>boring</b> and <b>polishing,</b> laser cutting, vacuum annealing and surface finishing (ultrasonic cleaning, acid pickling, and electrolytic <b>polishing).</b> The precision <b>boring</b> operation is used to obtain the required wall thickness from off-the-shelf seamless tube. The laser cutting is performed to change the shape of the stent, and the finishing operations is selected to modify the surface features, like smoothness and texture of stents. 316 LVM stainless steel sample with an outside-diameter of 3 mm, a wall thickness of 0. 1 mm, and a length of 25 mm, had been manufactured and demonstrated the proposed manufacture technology. The surface roughness of a stent manufactured is the value of Ra 14. 3 nm which basically meets the design requirement for further performance evaluation. It is hoped that the above finding can be used for future study of stents...|$|R
40|$|Lamellar {{graphite}} iron (LGI) {{is commonly used}} in diesel engine applications such as piston rings–cylinder liner where an excellent combination of physical and tribological properties is essential to avoid scuffing and <b>bore</b> <b>polishing</b> issues. The excellent tribological behaviour of LGI alloys {{is related to the}} graphite lamellas, which act as solid lubricant agents by feeding onto the tribosurfaces under sliding conditions. However, increasingly tighter emissions and fuel economy legislations and the higher demands on enhanced power and durability have encouraged both engine designers and manufacturers to introduce pearlitic compacted {{graphite iron}}s (CGI) as an alternative material replacing LGI, although the poor machinability of pearlitic CGI alloys compared to the LGI remains a challenge. The focus of this study is placed on investigating how the microstructure of LGI and CGI alloys affects their mechanical and tribological properties. This was initially undertaken by investigating representative, worn lamellar cast iron piston rings taken from a two-stroke large-bore heavy-duty diesel engine. As known that it is tribologically essential to keep the graphite open under sliding conditions, in particular under starved lubrication regimes or unlubricated conditions to avoid scuffing issues; however, this study revealed the closure of a majority of graphite lamellas; profoundly for those lamellas that were parallel to sliding direction; due to the severe matrix deformation caused by abrasion. Both microindentation and microscratch testing, which were used to crudely simulate the abrasion under starved lubricated condition in combustion chamber, suggested a novel mechanism of activating the graphite lamellas to serve as lubricating agents in which the matrix deformation adjacent to the graphite initially resulted in fracturing and then extrusion of the graphite lamellas. Additionally, in order to investigate the relation between matrix constituents, mechanical properties and machinability of cast iron materials, solution-strengthened CGI alloys were produced with different levels of silicon and section thicknesses. The results showed significant improvements in mechanical properties and machinability while deteriorating the ductility. Moreover, multiple regression analysis, based on chemical composition and microstructural characteristics was used to model the local mechanical properties of high Si ferritic CGI alloys, followed by implementing the derived models into a casting process simulation which enables the local mechanical properties of castings with complex geometries. Very good agreement was observed between the measured and predicted microstructure and mechanical properties...|$|R
