500|$|Traditional Navajo weaving used upright looms with no moving <b>parts.</b> <b>Support</b> poles were {{traditionally}} {{constructed of}} wood; steel pipe {{is more common}} today. The artisan sits on the floor during weaving and wraps the finished portion of fabric underneath the loom as it grows. [...] The average weaver takes anywhere from 2 months to many years to finish a single rug. [...] The size greatly determines {{the amount of time}} spent weaving a rug. The ratio of weft to warp threads had a fine count before the Bosque Redondo internment and declined in the following decades, then rose somewhat to a midrange ratio of five to one for the period 1920-1940. 19th-century warps were colored handspun wool or cotton string, then switched to white handspun wool in the early decades of the 20th century.|$|E
