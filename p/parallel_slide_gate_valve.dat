30|$|Three {{independent}} {{wind tunnel}} segments {{are connected to}} the downstream parts of the air diverter plenum. Three additional Kunkle 913 BFEM 03 pressure relief valves and a burst disk are additionally mounted on the air diverter plenum for pressure relief in the unlikely event of over-pressurization. A spectacle blind valve or a circular <b>sliding</b> <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is located at the inlet to each of the wind tunnel segments. To conduct a test with one such segment, the associated inlet valve is open, whereas valves at the inlets of the other segments are closed. The research test section, which is employed for the present study, is used as one of the wind tunnel segments. This segment includes a spectacle blind valve, which is followed by a straight inlet duct, a converging/diverging supersonic nozzle, the test section, an exhaust diffuser and plenum, and an exhaust piping system with three independent noise baffles. Each noise baffle bolts to the associated 203 [*]mm exhaust duct by means of a flange, and is approximately 1 [*]m in length, with an inner diameter of 203 [*]mm.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} and safe operation of piping systems {{depends on the}} precision of parameter regulation of the conducting medium with a minimum energy expenditure. The authors analyzed the use of gate and wedge shut-off valves by operating organizations {{in the mode of}} regulation of parameters of working media. The unintended use of pipe fittings causes its rapid failure. The authors have developed, manufactured and tested shut-off and regulating devices that have broad capabilities in the implementation of the throughput characteristics and requiring to control a drive of a smaller capacity. When the device opens or closes the opening in the gate, a closed controlled valve acts as a bypass, as in the flow of a working medium through an orifice the pressure is aligned in the inlet and outlet nozzles. After pressure equalization (reducing pressure drop), the gate is unloaded and its lifting and lowering require less power, while for the shut-off and regulating device with the electric drive, the latter step requires with lower power consumption. On the basis of the energy created by <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> saving shut-off and regulating device with a wide implementation in the throughput characteristics, methods of its calculation and experimental research and rational parameters are defined...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Superconducting {{cavities}} {{have been}} chosen to replace the existing copper cavities for the future upgrade of CESR. The use of superconducting cavity modules, specially designed for a high current collider, allows us to lower the cavity impedance and the loss factor of the accelerating system and thereby increase the threshold for multi- and single-bunch instabilities [1, 2]. The prototype superconducting cavity assembly was developed at the Laboratory of Nuclear Studies, Cornell University [3, 4] and successfully tested recently in a beam test in the CESR storage ring [5]. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the entire module which includes the cavity, the 24 cm round beam pipe, the fluted beam pipe, the ferrite HOM loads, <b>sliding</b> joints, <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> and tapers to the CESR beam pipe. The beam tubes were designed so {{that all of the}} higher order modes (HOMs) propagate out of the cavity and are damped by ferrite HOM loads which are located outside the cryostat and which are an i...|$|R
40|$|Most dams have a {{low-level}} outlet {{that consists of}} a closed conduit through the dam with a <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> or <b>valve</b> to regulate flow. These outlets are used mainly for irrigational purposes but also for flushing the reservoir and controlling the reservoir elevation. When discharging through the low-level outlet works, negative pressures can develop on the downstream side of the gate creating a potential for cavitation damage and vibration. To minimize these effects, air vents (vented to the atmosphere) are installed on the downstream side of the gate to limit downstream pressure to something above vapor pressure (i. e., near atmospheric pressure). Previous air venting studies have been mostly limited to large dam outlet geometries, which typically feature a vertical gate in a flat-bottomed discharge tunnel. The large-dam air demand analysis {{has been based on}} the Froude number of the supercritical flow at the vena contract (located between the gate and the hydraulic jump) and the water flow rate. Small to medium-sized embankment dams typically utilize a <b>slide</b> <b>gate</b> installed on the sloped upstream face for flow control, followed by a vertical elbow connected to a sloping pipe. With this outlet geometry, there is no 1 -D vena contracta flow, no classical hydraulic jump, and no representative Froude number. Additionally, no head-discharge characteristic data have been found for inclined <b>slide</b> <b>gates</b> (vented or non-vented) for small to medium-sized dams. Consequently, unless a flow measurement structure is installed in the discharge channel downstream of the dam, determining the water discharge rate based on gate opening and head on the gate, and consequently the air demand is problematic. This study focuses on quantifying air demand and air vent sizing for the small to medium-sized embankment dam low-level outlet geometries by providing: 1. Cd values as a function of gate openings and air demand; to better estimate flow rates from outlet works of similar geometries. 2. Flow conditions for varying operating conditions. 3. A new relationship for sizing air vents as a function of driving head and gate opening. 4. The magnitude of negative pressures for non-vented conduits. 5. A foundation for future studies and development of air demand research. This thesis presents the findings of this study...|$|R

5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up <b>slides</b> a <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|R

5000|$|A <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. <b>Gate</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|R

40|$|The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{is funding}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in {{performing}} research investigating {{the performance of}} <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> subjected to pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> difficult to open. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause {{the pressure of the}} fluid in the bonnet (and, in most <b>gate</b> <b>valves,</b> between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. Thermal binding can occur when thermal expansion/contraction effects cause the disc to be squeezed between the valve body seats. If the loads associated with pressure locking or thermal binding are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The authors tested a flexible-wedge <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> and a double-disc <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> under pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. The results show that these valves are susceptible to pressure locking; however, they are not significantly affected by thermal binding. For the flexible-wedge <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> pressure locking loads (in terms of stem thrust) were higher than corresponding hydrostatic opening loads by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 5. For the parallel disc <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> pressure locking loads were higher by a factor of 2. 05 to 2. 4.

Depending on the accuracy, cost consideration, and available space, the flowmeter selected could be an insertion type or fixed type such as orifices or venturi meters. Insertion flow sensors or flowmeters are mostly preferred for use in existing buildings because of their ease of installation, removal and reinstallation. Two types of commercially available insertion type flowmeters, series 225 B and SDI- 000125, both from Data Industrial[TR], were tested at different angles of orientation (0 ?, 45 ?, and 90 ?) and at different locations downstream of a 4 -inch <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> in straight sections of PVC pipe with flow rates between 80 gpm (2 ft/s) and 320 gpm (8 ft/s).
