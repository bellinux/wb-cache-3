He had exactly the sensation one gets when some hitherto intractable <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> one is putting together, clicks neatly and beyond all hoping, into its place. He found himself working in the old style, with the hours slipping by disregarded. He sent out Durgan to get him tobacco and tea and smoked-salmon sandwiches, and {{he stayed in the}} laboratory all night. He went home about half-past five, and found a white-faced, red-eyed Marjorie still dressed, wrapped in a travelling-rug, and crumpled and asleep in his study arm-chair beside the grey ashes of an extinct fire.|$|E
5000|$|In his Manifesto Josiah Warren writes: The forming of {{societies}} {{or any other}} artificial combinations IS the first, greatest, and most fatal mistake ever committed by legislators and by reformers. That all these combinations require the surrender of the natural sovereignty of the INDIVIDUAL over her or his person, time, property and responsibilities, {{to the government of}} the combination. That this tends to prostrate the individual—To reduce him to a mere <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> involving others in responsibility for his acts, and being involved in responsibilities for the acts and sentiments of his associates he lives & acts, without proper control over his own affairs, without certainty as to the results of his actions, and almost without brains that he dares to use on his own account; and consequently never realizes the great objects for which society is professedly formed.|$|E
40|$|Methodology: Agriculture is as {{indigenous}} to Nebraska as tall prairie grass. It was the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1850 that made over 10 million acres accessible to farmers. Dually, with the {{installment of the}} modern railroad, a network for the movement of Nebraska goods was founded. All this {{could not have been}} possible without the evolution of the agricultural machinery by modern invention. At the birth of the state, the steam tractor (an adaptation derived from locomotion) was a modern farmhand. This piece of machinery (that only pulled) spawned many tributaries of agricultural equipment today. GPS driven combines, plows, balers, and mowers are all off-chutes from the introduction of machinery to agriculture. Without invention, we would not have progress. By studying objects around a site on a Macro and Micro level, I believe the prior life of the site can be expressed in an alternate way. Not by studying a place in mind, but studying the other existing and often ignored objects that evolved through time [...] their site. This notion of site is not the physical location, but the defining constraints of a system. On the Macro level, cars, trains, electronics, service lines, and many other modes of transportation serve as ideal measurements. However, on the Micro level, the smallest mechanical part can give clues to a greater association to its omnitude. Discovering the macro and micro agricultural intricacies of the site along with an understanding of the direction of invention will help reveal design opportunities along a historically intact vector. Process: By identifying the machine as a self-sufficient entity and then dissecting its associative parts, I assume a better understanding of its function within the agricultural spectrum will emerge. If we zoom into the agricultural machinery, even down to the smallest machine parts, we will find many necessary components for agriculture, but at a variety of scales. What story can a singular part on the micro scale tell us? If we find a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine,</b> we can start to manufacture adjoining parts based on the mechanical language of the part. Each part has visual connections and residual traces of adjoining parts. We first see traces of jigsaw puzzle-like qualities and flat edges to the likeness of the adjacent part. The bolt holes and pin connections of the two parts align to complete the puzzle. This is the language of the machine, the ability to physically communicate to the system. Each individual part is a precedent to the next. If we applied a random part that’s only logic is to attach to the previous and communicate at the micro level, would this be a chaotic disaster or a beautiful opus of assemblage? To further consider the role of smaller constituent components in architecture, let’s compare this to modern-American timber construction. The detail of the parts has been subsumed. A nail is not an integral part, but one of many to form a “democratic” system, rather than an “autocratic”. Conversely, by examining a machine part, we can see evidence of its unique placement or membership to a greater whole. Macro/Micro: With the results of the process, I intend to investigate the abstract relationships of Nebraska by discerning the chiasmic relationship between the Micro and Macro site. The site is a location of an event constrained by what is adjacent to it. This is the parallel between the Micro and Macro site, the influence of accompanying objects that coexist in the greater system. The Micro site of a machine piece contains clues to its placement. The Micro site of each piece is just as inspirational as an empty portion of land or wilderness. The examples in figure 2 express the definition of “site” on the two levels. Even though one is an aerial view of a conventional building site, and another is a shattered engine block, we can analyze both based upon their constraints and boundaries. The Micro and Macro scale offer a solution from the study of agricultural equipment that has had site influences over time. The rigorous dissecting of the sites at both levels will voice architectural motives to inspire a more comprehensive solution. How will the engagement of the two levels react? Does the precision and exactness of the Micro level push the Macro level to an overly imperial design? Does the lax wilderness and haphazard organization of the Macro procure instability at the micro level? Or do both carry clues as if pieces of a genetic DNA and feed-off one another in a harmonious balance? We know both levels exist, but the strands that connect them have yet to be exploited...|$|E

The original writing instrument, either a quill or a brush, was replaced with a stylographic fountain pen. Once repaired the automaton began to produce elaborate sketches and poems.

Under the day-work system, matters settle down to an easy-going pace, and the employer pays extravagantly for his product. With regard to piece work, Halsey discusses at length the evils of rate-cutting. He presents as an objection to the piece-work plan an argument that may in many cases be a strong one in its favor, namely, that it requires a knowledge and record of the cost <b>of</b> each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complicated <b>machine,</b> and oftentimes of each operation on each piece, thus limiting its application to products which are produced in considerable quantities...|$|R

I confess {{it seems to me}} it is <b>a</b> shadow <b>of</b> what will come, unless the world is to come to a conclusion that is perfectly frightful; some kind of scheme of education like that, presided over by the wisest and most sacred men that can be got in the world, and watching from a distance--a training in practicality at every turn; no speech in it except that speech that is to be followed by action, for that ought to be the rule as nearly as possible among them. For rarely should men speak at all unless it is to say that thing that is to be done; and let him go and do his part in it, and to say no more about it. I should say there is nothing in the world you can conceive so difficult, prima facie, as that <b>of</b> getting <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> men gathered together--rough, rude, and ignorant people--gather them together, promise them a shilling a day, rank them up, give them very severe and sharp drill, and by bullying and drill--for the word [...] "drill" [...] seems as if it meant the treatment that would force them to learn--they learn what it is necessary to learn; and there is the man, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animated <b>machine,</b> <b>a</b> wonder <b>of</b> wonders to look at. He will go and obey one man, and walk into the cannon's mouth for him, and do anything whatever that is commanded of him by his general officer. And I believe all manner of things in this way could be done if there were anything like the same attention bestowed. Very many things could be regimented and organized into the mute system of education that Goethe evidently adumbrates there. But I believe, when people look into it, it will be found that they will not be very long in trying to make some efforts in that direction; for the saving of human labour, and the avoidance of human misery, would be uncountable if it were set about and begun even in part.|$|R
