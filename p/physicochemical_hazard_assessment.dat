40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} {{stations are}} facing many hazard factors, therefore, {{it is necessary}} to make <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> for them. In this study, a novel <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> method called extended set pair analysis (ESPA) is proposed based on set pair analysis (SPA). However, the calculation of the connection degree (CD) requires the classification of hazard grades and their corresponding thresholds using SPA for the <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment.</b> In regard to the <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> using ESPA, a novel calculation algorithm of the CD is worked out when hazard grades and their corresponding thresholds are unknown. Then the CD can be converted into Euclidean distance (ED) by a simple and concise calculation, and the hazard of each sample will be ranked based on the value of ED. In this paper, six biomass gasification stations are introduced to make <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> using ESPA and general set pair analysis (GSPA), respectively. By the comparison of <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> results obtained from ESPA and GSPA, the availability and validity of ESPA can be proved in the <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> for biomass gasification stations. Meanwhile, the reasonability of ESPA is also justified by the sensitivity analysis of <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> results obtained by ESPA and GSPA...|$|R

A key element in the Integrated Safety Process is the use of <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> techniques to evaluate process design changes in parallel or concurrently with process design and development. This concurrent <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> method recently was employed for the B 61 - 0, 2 & 5 and W 69 nuclear explosive dismantlement activities. This paper reviews the SS- 21 <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> process and summarizes the results of the concurrent <b>hazard</b> <b>assessments</b> performed for the B 61 and W 69 dismantlement programs.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on a cloud model {{approach}} for considering debris-flow <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment,</b> in which the cloud model provided a model for transforming the qualitative and quantitative expressions. Additionally, the entropy method and analytical hierarchy process were united for calculating the parameters weights. The weighting method avoids the disadvantages inherent in using subjective or objective methods alone. Based on the cloud model and component weighting method, a model was established {{for the analysis of}} debris-flow <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment.</b> There are 29 debris-flow catchments around the pumped storage power station in the study area located near Zhirui (Inner Mongolia, China). Field survey data and 3 S technologies were used for data collection. The results of the cloud model calculation process showed that of the 29 catchments, 25 had low debris-flow <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment,</b> three had moderate <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment,</b> and one had high <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment.</b> The widely used extenics method and field geological surveys were used to validate the proposed approach. This approach shows high potential as a useful tool for debris-flow <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> analysis. Compared with other prediction methods, it avoids the randomness and fuzziness in uncertainty problems, and its prediction results are considered reasonable...|$|R

40|$|Volcanic <b>hazards</b> <b>assessment</b> {{tools are}} {{essential}} for risk mitigation of volcanic activities. A number of offline volcanic <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> tools have been provided, but in most cases, they require relatively complex installation procedure and usage. This situation causes limited usage of volcanic <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> tools among volcanologists and volcanic hazards communities. In addition, volcanic eruption chronology and detailed database of each volcano {{in the world are}} essential key information for volcanic <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment,</b> but most of them are isolated and not connected to and with each other. The Volcanic <b>Hazard</b> <b>Assessment</b> Support System aims to implement a user-friendly, WebGIS-based, open-access online system for potential <b>hazards</b> <b>assessment</b> and risk-mitigation of Quaternary volcanoes in the world. The users can get up-to-date information such as eruption chronology and geophysical monitoring data of a specific volcano using the direct link system to major volcano databases on the system. Currently, the system provides 3 simple, powerful and notable deterministic modeling simulation codes of volcanic processes, such as Energy Cone, Titan 2 D and Tephra 2. The system provides deterministic tools because probabilistic assessment tools are normally much more computationally demanding. By using the volcano <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> system, the area that would be affected by volcanic eruptions in any location near the volcano can be estimated using numerical simulations. The system is being implemented using the ASTER Global DEM covering 2790 Quaternary volcanoes in the world. The system can be used to evaluate volcanic hazards and move this toward risk-potential by overlaying the estimated distribution of volcanic gravity flows or tephra falls on major roads, houses and evacuation areas using the GIS-enabled systems. The system is developed for all users in the world who need volcanic <b>hazards</b> <b>assessment</b> tools...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{probabilistic}} volcanic <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> is {{to translate}} complex volcanological data and numerical models into practical hazard estimates for communities potentially affected by volcanic eruptions. Probabilistic volcanic <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> quantifies volcanic <b>hazards</b> and illustrates uncertainties about {{the magnitude and}} consequences of volcanic activity.

40|$|Because a biomass {{gasification}} station includes various <b>hazard</b> factors, <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> {{is needed}} and significant. In this article, the cloud model (CM) is employed to improve set pair analysis (SPA), and a novel <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> method for a biomass gasification station is proposed {{based on the}} cloud model-set pair analysis (CM-SPA). In this method, cloud weight is proposed to be the weight of index. In contrast to the index weight of other methods, cloud weight is shown by cloud descriptors; hence, the randomness and fuzziness of cloud weight will make it effective to reflect the linguistic variables of experts. Then, the cloud connection degree (CCD) is proposed to replace the connection degree (CD); the calculation algorithm of CCD is also worked out. By utilizing the CCD, the <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> results are shown by some normal clouds, and the normal clouds are reflected by cloud descriptors; meanwhile, the hazard grade is confirmed by analyzing the cloud descriptors. After that, two biomass gasification stations undergo <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> via CM-SPA and AHP based SPA, respectively. The comparison of assessment results illustrates that the CM-SPA is suitable and effective for the <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> of a biomass gasification station and that CM-SPA will make the assessment results more reasonable and scientific...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{landslide}} <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment,</b> when {{based on}} the deterministic diagnosis of the processes, can be pursued only through the interpretation and the geo-hydro-mechanical modelling of the slope equilibrium. In practice, though, landslide <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> is still seldom dealt with slope modelling, in particular when it addresses vast areas, where either heuristic or statistical methods do not entail any geo-hydro-mechanical knowledge of slope features and stability. The Multiscalar Method for Landslide Mitigation (MMLM) is an original methodological approach for intermediate to regional landslide <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment.</b> It is {{based on the}} geo-hydro-mechanical knowledge achieved from the application of a stage-wise diagnostic methodology of the landslide mechanism at the slope scale. The paper discusses the main steps of the MMLM aiming at diagnoses of landslide hazard based on hydro-mechanics, for small scale hazard mapping (at the large area) ...|$|R
