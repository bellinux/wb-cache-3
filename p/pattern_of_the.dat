5|$|During these missions, {{objectives}} and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects and environments in the game. The tutorial system used to demonstrate routine gameplay {{elements such as}} object interaction and movement is disguised as the first level of Gravity Bone. Here, the player is tasked with the delivery of a contaminated drink to an unspecified non-player character. After the first level is completed, the player {{is sent to the}} second level of the game, which follows the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first; the player is assigned a set of actions and goals involving platforming sequences.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E
5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trip {{was that he would}} be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager to be seen with Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E

He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E
5|$|Many Indonesian batik {{patterns}} are symbolic. Infants are carried in batik slings decorated with symbols {{designed to bring}} the child luck, and certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms, {{as well as their}} families. Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batik he or she wore. Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of fractal geometry in traditional designs.|$|E

5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} expert Dr. William M. Gray on April 4 predicted twelve named storms, {{with eight}} reaching hurricane strength {{and three of}} the eight reaching Category3 strength. The prediction issued on May 30 was similar, increasing the named storms to fourteen. The synoptic <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season prior to June 1 resembled other previous seasons, with the 1952, 1954, 1964, 1966, and 1998 seasons considered the best analogs for the season. The prediction also included a 68%probability for a hurricane landfall along the United States.|$|E

5|$|Sphecius grandis can be {{distinguished}} from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can {{be distinguished}} by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|E

5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E

It also discusses the overall <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flora and fauna including the fact that the islands can be divided, by what would eventually become known as the Wallace line, into two parts, those whose animals are more closely related to those of Asia and those whose fauna is closer to that of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate, do not extend between the molars. The palate ends beyond the third molars and is perforated by posterolateral palatal pits there. Behind it, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities. The auditory bullae, which house the inner ear, are large. Usually, the mastoid bone lacks openings (fenestrae), which are present in T.talamancae. The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arteries in the head is primitive, as indicated by the condition of various foramina (openings) and grooves in the skull.|$|E

5|$|The present civil {{services}} of India is mainly {{based on the}} <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Indian Civil Service of British India. The civil services {{were divided into two}} categories - covenanted and uncovenanted. The covenanted civil service consisted of only Europeans (i.e., English personnel) occupying the higher posts in the government. The uncovenanted civil service was solely introduced to facilitate the entry of Indians at the lower rung of the administration.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
5|$|This formula neglects the {{cracking}} pressure required to open both {{first and second}} stages of the regulator, and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the regulator, {{both of which are}} variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator, and flow rate, which depends on the breathing <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E
