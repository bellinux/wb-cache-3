50|$|<b>Princess</b> <b>lace</b> was {{introduced}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in Belgium. The most famous cities for <b>princess</b> <b>lace</b> were Aalst, Ninove, Geraardsbergen, Dendermonde and Liedekerke. It is reputed to be called <b>Princess</b> <b>lace</b> because the Belgium Royal Family used it.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Princess</b> <b>lace</b> is a tape lace. It {{is made of}} {{straight}} machine-made lace tapes also called <b>princess</b> <b>lace.</b> [...] The lacemaker bends and folds these {{into the shape of}} flowers and leaves, and sews them into position.|$|E

50|$|Battenberg lace {{is a type}} of tape lace. The {{name for}} this American lace was chosen in honour of a wedding of the Battenberg family, which {{occurred}} about the time a patent for making the lace was applied for at Washington. Originally Battenberg lace was heavier than the other machine tape laces such as <b>Princess</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Princess</b> <b>lace</b> is also {{a needle}} work. It's an {{application}} on a netting. Machine made nettings are used since 1850 {{in the production of}} lace. These first nettings were produced in the hope it could save time and that lacemakers could be able to finish a work faster. In the early 20th century the machine made netting that could be produced were from a different quality, more regular, bigger quantities. The production of <b>Princess</b> <b>lace</b> started at that time, but it was after world war II that this lace really became famous. It's the last handmade lace work that's still fine enough to be used for wedding veil and christening gowns.As these 2 types of laces are using a machine made base (the tape or the netting) some purists don't accept these techniques received the 'Handmade Belgian lace' tag. Discussions are not closed about this. Only thing everybody agrees : these 2 modern technics of lace making asks a lot of handwork (80%) to be realized, they're art works and it's unfortunately a dying art.|$|E
