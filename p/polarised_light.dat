5|$|The mass of spores is blackish brown, {{or brown}} if viewed under <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> The surface texture ranges from almost smooth to warty, and the spores measure 7–9µm in diameter. Material {{collected}} from Oregon, however, varies from European material in several ways: the fruit body is brown; the branching of the capillitium from the columella differs (having {{primary and secondary}} branches instead of radiating branches from an expanded tip); the spore mass is tan, and individual spores measure 10–12µm.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, {{has generally been}} described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{has been found to}} have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} if the ordinary light microscope is a useful tool in the detection and identification of crystals in synovial fluid 63 fluids (13 with monosodium urate (MSU), 14 with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD), one with both types of crystal, and 35 without crystals) were examined blindly by two observers, first with an ordinary light microscope, then with a <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscope. Tentative identification of the crystals by their shape was attempted. The sensitivity of the ordinary light microscope {{for the detection of}} crystals was 96. 2 % and 100 %, with specificity of 100 % and 97. 1 % for observers 1 and 2, both with respect to the <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscope. The concordance between observers for the ordinary light microscope was chi = 0. 90 (0. 897, 0. 902) and for the <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscope chi = 0. 96 (0. 958, 0. 961). The specificity for identification of MSU and CPPD crystals by their shape with respect to the <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscope was 92. 3 % and 85. 7 % for observers 1 and 2. When a <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscope is not available examination of synovial fluid by an ordinary light microscope may allow a provisional diagnosis; definitive identification of the crystals requires a <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscope...|$|R

5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive <b>polarised</b> <b>light,</b> and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{left the}} Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began {{attending}} {{classes at the}} University of Edinburgh. He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very demanding, and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> may be used).|$|E

25|$|An October 2014 {{publication}} {{by researchers}} from the University of Queensland stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of neurons, because they are sensitive to detecting <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera {{through the use of}} aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering microvilli on top of photodiodes. In February 2016 it was also revealed that the shrimps are using a form of reflector of <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> not seen in nature or human technology before. It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} {{species have been}} {{reported}} to be able to detect circularly <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> Some of their biological quarter-wave plates perform more uniformly over the visual spectrum than any current man-made polarizing optics, and it has been speculated that this could inspire a new type of optical media that would outperform the current generation of Blu-ray disc technology.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} simultaneous shape and refractive index recovery from multispectral polarisation imagery captured from a single viewpoint. The focus of this paper is on dielectric surfaces which diffusely <b>polarise</b> <b>light</b> transmitted from the dielectric body into the air. The diffuse polarisation of the reflection process is modelled using a Transmitted Radiance Sinusoid curve and the Fresnel transmission theory. We provide a method of estimating the azimuth angle of surface normals from the spectral variation of the phase of polarisation. Moreover, to render the problem of simultaneous estimation of surface orientation and index of refraction well-posed, we enforce a generative model on the material dispersion equations for the index of refraction. This generative model, together with the Fresnel transmission ratio, permit the recovery of the index of refraction and the zenith angle simultaneously. We show results on shape recovery and rendering for real world and synthetic imagery. 1...|$|R
25|$|The midband {{region of}} its eye {{is made up}} of six rows of {{specialised}} ommatidia—a cluster of photoreceptor cells. Four rows carry up to 16 different photoreceptor pigments: 12 for colour sensitivity, others for colour filtering.

Their eyes (mounted on mobile stalks and capable of moving independently of each other) are similarly variably coloured and are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} at least 16 {{photoreceptor}} types, which are divided into four classes (their spectral sensitivity is further tuned by colour filters in the retinas), 12 for colour analysis in the different wavelengths (including six which are sensitive to ultraviolet light) and four for analysing <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> By comparison, most humans have only four visual pigments, of which three are dedicated to see colour, and human lenses block ultraviolet light. The visual information leaving the retina seems to be processed into numerous parallel data streams leading into the brain, greatly reducing the analytical requirements at higher levels.|$|E
25|$|Migratory songbirds use the Earth’s {{magnetic}} field, stars, the Sun, {{and other}} unknown cues {{to determine their}} migratory direction.

This suggested that skylight polarisation patterns are the primary calibration reference for all migratory songbirds.

25|$|Most {{sources of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation contain {{a large number}} of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated, in which case the light is said to be unpolarised. If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is partially polarised. If the polarization is consistent across the spectrum of the source, partially <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely polarised one.

The research was to highlight the phenomenon of light polarisation. About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the intensity of light reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates; and in 1862 he prepared for the British Association a valuable report on double refraction, a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes. Perhaps the best known crystal is Iceland spar, transparent calcite crystals.|$|E
25|$|Light {{reflected}} by shiny transparent materials is {{partly or fully}} polarised, except when the light is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. It was this effect that allowed the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus to make the measurements that allowed for his development of the first mathematical models for <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> Polarization occurs when light is scattered in the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and colour in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be taken advantage of using polarizing filters to darken the sky in photographs.

Thermorheological testing was developed as a fast screening method for predicting the processability of dispersions for spray chilling preparation. Spray chilled piroxicam loaded microspheres were spherical in shape with a median diameter of circa 150 ?µm. DSC indicated no interaction between piroxicam and lipid matrix, while HSM studies performed in polarized light mode indicated that the spheres contained distinct drug crystals. <b>Polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscopy and small-angle XRD investigations on the hydration behaviour of the lipid and the spray chilled microspheres revealed the formation of liquid crystalline phases depending on the degree of hydration. The dissolution behaviour of the piroxicam loaded microspheres showed significant improvements compared to drug alone. The particle size, drug loading and aging of the microspheres were all found to have an influence on the release behaviour. It was proposed that Gelucire 50 / 13 microspheres release the entrapped piroxicam via formation of a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, which allows dissolution of the drug particles in a finely divided, high surface area and well-wetted state...|$|R

Water samples for primary production rates, community structure, chlorophyll a [Chl a], calcite [PIC], particulate organic carbon [POC] and biogenic silicic acid [BSi] were collected from predawn casts from six light depths (55 %, 20 %, 14 %, 7 %, 5 % and 1 % of incident PAR).

25|$|Rows 1–4 of the midband are {{specialised}} for colour vision, from ultraviolet to longer wavelengths. Their UV vision {{can detect}} five different frequency bands {{in the deep}} ultraviolet. To do this they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different colour filters. They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.|$|E
500|$|Spiral coils, formed of helicoidally stacked {{cellulose}} microfibrils, create Bragg {{reflection in}} the [...] "marble berries" [...] of the African herb Pollia condensata, resulting in the most intense blue coloration known in nature. The berry's surface has four layers of cells with thick walls, containing spirals of transparent cellulose spaced so as to allow constructive interference with blue light. Below these cells is a layer two or three cells thick containing dark brown tannins. Pollia produces a stronger colour than the wings of Morpho butterflies, {{and is one of}} the first instances of structural coloration known from any plant. Each cell has its own thickness of stacked fibres, making it reflect a different colour from its neighbours, and producing a pixellated or pointillist effect with different blues speckled with brilliant green, purple and red dots. The fibres in any one cell are either left-handed or right-handed, so each cell circularly polarizes the light it reflects in one direction or the other. Pollia is the first organism known to show such random polarization of light, which, nevertheless does not have a visual function, as the seed-eating birds that visit this plant species are not able to perceive <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> Spiral microstructures are also found in scarab beetles where they produce iridescent colours.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of an endogenous surfactant present in Eudragit NE 30 D {{on the structure}} and drug release (clenbuterol) properties of thin matrices has been examined. Both drug-free and drug-loaded matrices {{were found to be}} non-isotropic in structure, the former having a marbled appearance under the <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscope, and the latter showing numerous needle-shaped crystals. At loading above approx. 10 % w/w clenbuterol it was also possible to observe aggregates of the drug. Differential scanning calorimetry enabled the identification of melting peaks at approx. 50 °C for the needle-shaped crystals and approx. 80 °C for the larger drug aggregates. The former are composed of a surfactant used by the manufacturer for the synthesis of Eudragit NE 30 D by emulsion polymerization. This surfactant undergoes a phase separation from the polymer on storage at room temperature. It could, however, be extracted from the polymer by refluxing in water to yield an isotropic system. The extract showed a melting peak at 50 °C and also UV, IR, NMR, and mass spectra in accordance with an o-substituted nonyl phenol surfactant.

40|$|Background: Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a {{group of}} rare {{autosomal}} recessive disorders that variably affect a wide range of organs derived from the neuroectoderm. The key diagnostic feature is sparse, brittle, sulfur deficient hair that has a 'tiger-tail' banding pattern under <b>polarising</b> <b>light</b> microscopy. Patients and methods: We describe two male cousins affected by TTD associated with microcephaly, profound intellectual disability, sparse brittle hair, aged appearance, short stature, facial dysmorphism, seizures, an immunoglobulin deficiency, multiple endocrine abnormalities, cerebellar hypoplasia and partial absence of the corpus callosum, in the absence of cellular photosensitivity and ichthyosis. Obligate female carriers showed 100 % skewed X-chromosome inactivation. Linkage analysis and Sanger sequencing of 737 X-chromosome exons and whole exome sequencing was used to find the responsible gene and mutation. Results: Linkage analysis localised the disease allele to a 7. 75 Mb interval from Xq 23 -q 25. We identified a nonsense mutation in the highly conserved RNF 113 A gene (c. 901 C>T, p. Q 301 *). The mutation segregated with the disease in the family and was not observed in over 100 000 control X chromosomes. The mutation markedly reduced RNF 113 A protein expression in extracts from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the affected individuals. Conclusions: The association of RNF 113 A mutation with non-photosensitive TTD identifies a new locus for these disorders on the X chromosome. The extended phenotype within this family includes panhypopituitarism, cutis marmorata and congenital short oesophagus...|$|R
