In the process, some of the organic acid becomes <b>peroxy</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>peroxy</b> <b>acid</b> reacts with olefins in the fatty acid side chains creating intermediate epoxides. The epoxides react further with water, organic acid, or <b>peroxy</b> <b>acid,</b> to ultimately form vicinal diols.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} atmospheric aerosol particles {{is composed of}} organic material with a highly complex but poorly characterized composition. For {{a better understanding of}} aerosol effects and processes in the atmosphere, a more detailed knowledge of aerosol components at a molecular level is needed. <b>Peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> might {{play a significant role in}} particle toxicity, due to their oxidizing properties, and they were recently found to be involved in particle formation. Because of the lack of appropriate standards, the identification and quantification of <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> is often highly uncertain. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool to characterize unidentified compounds in complex mixtures. However, so far there is only little information regarding the ionization and fragmentation behavior of <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> in mass spectrometers. To study their fragmentation patterns, we synthesized 12 <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> with C$_{ 8 }$ to C$_{ 10 }$ carbon backbones and mono- or diperoxy <b>acid</b> functionality. The <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> were separated using liquid chromatography, detected via negative mode electrospray ionization high-resolution MS, and their fragmentation patterns (MS/MS spectra) were identified. The MS/MS spectra of the <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> showed fragmentation patterns clearly different from the corresponding acid, with a strong similarity between compounds of different chain length but analogous functional groups. Neutral loss of CH$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 2 }$ was observed for all investigated linear <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> but not for carboxylic acids and could therefore serve as a diagnostic ion for <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids.</b> The obtained results are a large step toward unambiguous characterization of <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> in the atmosphere.

5000|$|The overall {{transformation}} is {{the conversion of}} the carbon-sulfur bonds to a carbon-carbon double bond. The original procedure involved halogenation of a sulfide, followed by oxidation to the sulfone. Recently, the preferred method has reversed the order of the steps. After the oxidation, which is normally done with a <b>peroxy</b> <b>acid,</b> halogenation is done under basic conditions by use of dibromodifluoromethane for the halogen transfer step.

40|$|<b>Peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> might {{contribute}} significantly to particle toxicity and were recently found {{to be involved in}} new particle formation in the atmosphere. However, a lack of suitable analytical methods for the detection and characterization of <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids</b> in the particle phase is currently hindering the quantitative investigation of their contribution to these important atmospheric processes. Further development of appropriate techniques and relevant standards is therefore urgently needed. In this study, we synthesized three peroxypinic acids, developed a liquid chromatography separation method and characterised them with tandem mass spectrometry. The observed fragmentation patterns clearly distinguish the different peroxypinic acids from both the acid and each other, showing several neutral losses previously already observed for other <b>peroxy</b> <b>acids.</b> Both monoperoxypinic acids were found to be present in secondary organic aerosol generated from ozonolysis of α-pinene in laboratory experiments. The yield of monoperoxypinic acid formation was not influenced by humidity. Monoperoxypinic acid quickly degrades on the filter, with about 60  % lost within the first 5 hours. This fast degradation shows that time delays in traditional off-line analysis will likely lead to severe underestimates of peroxy compound concentrations in ambient particles...|$|R

[...] It is the most reactive of the organic peroxy acids, allowing it to successfully oxidise relatively unreactive alkenes to epoxides where other peroxy acids are ineffective. It can also oxidise the chalcogens in some functional groups, such as by transforming selenoethers to selenones. It is a potentially explosive material and is not commercially available, but can be quickly prepared immediately prior to use when needed.

50|$|Sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS) is an {{important}} component of laundry detergents and bleaches. It is known as a bleach activator for active oxygen sources, allowing formulas containing hydrogen peroxide releasing chemicals (specifically sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide to effect bleaching at lower temperatures. NOBS was developed by Procter & Gamble in 1983 and was first used in American laundry detergents in 1988. NOBS is the main bleach activator used in the U.S.A. and Japan. Compared to TAED, which is the predominant bleach activator used in Europe, NOBS is efficient at much lower temperatures. At 20 °C NOBS is 100 times more soluble than TAED in water. When attacked by the perhydroxyl anion (from hydrogen peroxide), NOBS forms the <b>peroxy</b> <b>acid</b> peroxynonanoic acid and releases the leaving group sodium 4-hydroxybenzene sulfonate, which is an inert by-product.|$|E
