5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, {{and it may be}} that the 260-day count is based on the human gestation period. This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> occurred.|$|E
5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any <b>particular</b> <b>day.</b> For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E
5|$|The annual Thanksgiving holiday is {{a fairly}} recent creation. Throughout the early 19th century, the U.S. {{government}} had declared a <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> as a national day of Thanksgiving, but these were one-time declarations meant to celebrate a significant event, such as victory in a battle. The northeastern states began adopting an annual day of Thanksgiving in November shortly {{after the end of}} the War of 1812. Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Boston's Ladies' Magazine, wrote editorials beginning in 1827 which called for the nationwide expansion of this annual day of thanksgiving to commemorate the Pilgrim's first harvest feast. After nearly 40 years, Abraham Lincoln declared the first modern Thanksgiving to fall on the last Thursday in November in 1863. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Congress ultimately moved it to the fourth Thursday in November. After some sparring as to the date, the holiday was recognized by Congress as an official federal holiday in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{concluded}} as {{the worst}} day for the United States Air Force in Vietnam since 2 December 1966, when they had lost five aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam in a single day. Consequently, the actions of 23 August became known as ‘Black Wednesday’ amongst U.S. pilots who participated in air operations over Hanoi on that <b>particular</b> <b>day.</b> The USAF officially confirmed the loss of three F-4D fighters during the raid against the Yen Vien rail yard, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of Weapon Systems Officers Captain Ronald N. Sittner (66-0238, 8th TFW) and First Lieutenant Charles Lane (66-00247, 8th TFW). Major Charles R. Tyler, Captain Larry E. Carrigan, Major Robert R. Sawhill and First Lieutenant Gerald L. Gerndt ejected safely from their aircraft, but they were captured alive and became prisoners of war. Major C.B. Demarque and his Weapons System Officer, First Lieutenant J.M. Piet were rescued shortly after they ejected from their malfunctioned aircraft over Thai airspace.|$|E

50|$|The {{first version}} of the UVVRP was {{implemented}} in 1995. During the 1990s, there were many road and railway infrastructure projects being built throughout Metro Manila; {{in order to address}} the resulting increase in congestion, the MMDA issued Regulation No. 95-001 or the “Odd-Even Scheme.” The scheme banned private vehicles with less than three passengers from passing restricted roads during AM and PM peak periods on <b>particular</b> <b>days.</b> The scheme banned private vehicles with less than three passengers from passing restricted roads during AM and PM peak periods on <b>particular</b> <b>days.</b> Vehicles in use for public transportation, emergencies, police and military, school buses, diplomatic matters and official media were exempted from this regulation.|$|R

25|$|Other {{approaches}} to the chronology of Jesus have been suggested over the centuries, e.g. Maximus the Confessor, Eusebius, and Cassiodorus asserted that the death of Jesus occurred in AD31. The 3rd/4th century Roman historian Lactantius states that Jesus was crucified on a <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> in AD29, {{but that did not}} correspond to a full moon.|$|E
25|$|Social {{psychologists have}} studied {{attitude}} formation, {{the structure of}} attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, {{and the relationship between}} attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a <b>particular</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
25|$|The nine odes of the kanon were {{dissimilar}} {{by their}} metrum. Consequently, an entire heirmos comprises nine independent melodies (eight, because the second ode was usually omitted outside Lenten period), which are united musically {{by the same}} echos and its melos, and sometimes even textually by references to the general theme of the liturgical occasion—especially in acrosticha composed over a given heirmos, but dedicated to a <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> of the menaion.|$|E

25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that <b>particular</b> <b>day.</b> The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish {{tradition}} dates {{at least}} to the 15th century, and there is even a <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> for the purpose, Våffeldagen (waffle day), which sounds like Vårfrudagen ("Our Lady's Day"), and is therefore used for the purpose. This is March 25 (nine months before Christmas), the Christian holiday of Annunciation. They are usually topped with strawberry jam, bilberry jam, hjortron jam, raspberry jam, bilberry and raspberry jam, sugar and butter, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.

50|$|The tonnage {{and basic}} {{weaponry}} of most capital ships and aircraft are also public, and their speeds and ranges {{can often be}} reasonably estimated by experts, often just from photographs.
