5000|$|The Royal Corinthian Yacht Club {{commissioned}} Major Malden Heckstall-Smith and Mr. William McMeek {{to design}} the new 35' yachts. The resulting design was of outstanding interest: a full bow sections and a very sharp turn to her garboards, and a transom stern and <b>outside</b> <b>rudder</b> raked to no less than 45°. They combined an inexpensive form of stern with a racing hull, and {{by virtue of the}} transom stern they would also benefit slightly in the way of rating. The first two boats of this new [...] "Corinthian 35" [...] design were the Phryna and the Joyrena, both built in 1937.|$|R
50|$|In aircraft, an aneroid {{barometer}} measures the atmospheric pressure from a static <b>port</b> <b>outside</b> the aircraft. Air pressure decreases {{with an increase}} of altitude—approximately 100 hectopascals per 800 meters or one inch of mercury per 1000 feet near sea level.|$|R

50|$|Mappy Arrangement was {{the most}} similar to its {{original}} game, though it featured a split-screen display. 2 player is optional, with player two having an orange Mappy instead of the original blue one.

50|$|The {{capacity}} of the Tanggu and Tianjin river port was limited, and so the Japanese occupation forces started in 1940 {{the construction of the}} Tanggu Xingang seaport (later the Tianjin Xingang <b>port)</b> <b>outside</b> the river estuary. By the end of the war, the new port was incomplete, and damage during the Chinese Civil War left it unusable by the time of its capture in 1949.|$|R
50|$|In August 1991 USS Independence {{took over}} the role of USS Midway as the only carrier home <b>ported</b> <b>outside</b> the USA, at Yokosuka, Japan. During this change the {{squadron}} stayed with the same carrier but moved air wings, from CVW-14 to CVW-5. This was, because the Midway air wing had been without F-14s, as the older ship could not accommodate the F-14's size and weight.|$|R
50|$|The Northumberland Strait {{is a minor}} {{shipping}} route, with ports such as Pugwash shipping salt, Summerside, Charlottetown, Georgetown and Souris shipping {{agricultural products}} and receiving petroleum and aggregate, and Pictou shipping forestry products and general cargo. Shipping has declined in recent decades with the decline of rail service to ports and the increased capacity of highways to larger <b>ports</b> <b>outside</b> of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which freezes in the winter.|$|R
5000|$|Currently {{the growth}} of port activity, {{increased}} value-added traffic (vehicles and containers of mostly liquids and solids) for storage requiring a lot of already scarce ground, and insufficient depth for some types of ships, is forcing the Port Authority to consider the long-term construction of a <b>port</b> <b>outside</b> the bay.

5000|$|The Port of Maryborough, Queensland, {{was opened}} in 1847 and in 1859 it was {{declared}} a port of entry, meaning that overseas and intercolonial vessels could arrive and depart direct, although {{there appears to}} have been considerable uncertainty about the name of the <b>port</b> <b>outside</b> Queensland for some years.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} from fibreglass, with some surfaces fabric covered. The 7.2 m span wing is semi-tapered, tapering <b>outside</b> the <b>rudders</b> and employs a Fauvel F4 17% airfoil. The fuselage is just 2.00 m in length, making the aircraft very compact. The landing gear is monowheel gear, {{with a small}} tail wheel and outrigger wheels at midspan.|$|R
50|$|Lying at {{the western}} edge of the Ayeyarwady River delta, on the Pathein (Ngawan) River 118 mi west of Yangon, Pathein is {{accessible}} to large vessels and despite its distance from the ocean, it is the most important delta <b>port</b> <b>outside</b> of Yangon. The city is also a terminus of a branch of the main railroad line which connects it to Hinthada, Letpadan and Yangon. In the 1990s, the road network along the Irrawaddy to Monya was improved.|$|R
50|$|The United States was {{the third}} country to {{establish}} formal diplomatic relations with the UAE and has had an ambassador resident in the UAE since 1974. The two countries have enjoyed friendly relations {{with each other and}} have developed strong government-to-government ties including a close security cooperation. The quality of U.S.-UAE relations increased dramatically {{as a result of the}} U.S.-led coalition's campaign to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with <b>ports</b> <b>outside</b> of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|R

The same names were also carried by {{three of the four}} BYMS class minesweepers operated by the Finnish Navy in the 1950s. For the new class of vessels, the Finnish Navy has adopted a new prefix [...] "MHC" [...] which stands for [...] "Mine Hunter Coastal".|$|R

The port would be located at the site of Jaizkibel's outer cliffs in an area of special natural interest in many respects. This has come up against fierce opposition of many local environmentalist groups and agencies, who try hard to prevent the scheme from being carried out.|$|R

50|$|According to the Panama government, {{one of the}} key {{reasons for}} this road {{expansion}} project is to service a proposed deep container <b>port</b> <b>outside</b> of Puerto Armuelles. The proposal is for this multi-purpose port to include 217 storage facilities, a deepwater container, future cruise ship port, and a marina. The idea is that the expanded road and the proposed port would create what the Panama government is callings a 4 lane “dry canal” highway connecting Puerto Armulles to Chiriqui Grande on the Caribbean side of Panama. They are hopeful that it would have a similar economic effect as the “wet canal” in Panama City.|$|R
