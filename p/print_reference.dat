In the late 1890s, the name [...] "ordinary" [...] began to be used, to distinguish them from the emerging safety bicycles; this term and [...] "hi-wheel" [...] (and variants) are preferred by many modern enthusiasts.|$|E

40|$|Research Findings: Environmental print {{provides}} {{children with}} their earliest print experiences. This observational {{study investigated the}} frequency of mother-child environmental <b>print</b> <b>referencing</b> and its relationship with emergent literacy. Thirty-five mothers and their children (aged 3 - 4 years) were videotaped interacting in an environmental print-rich play setting. The frequency of environmental <b>print</b> <b>referencing</b> of letters and words was measured. Children were assessed on emergent literacy skills (letter name and sound knowledge, print concepts, phonological awareness, name and letter writing, environmental print reading). Sixty-nine percent of mothers <b>referenced</b> environmental <b>print.</b> After controlling for child age, home literacy teaching, and maternal education, greater maternal <b>referencing</b> of environmental <b>print</b> {{was positively related to}} print concepts and name and letter writing.
