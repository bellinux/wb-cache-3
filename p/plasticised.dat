40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. Concern over the {{migration}} of low molecular weight plasticiser from flexible PVC used in toys and medical products has lead to the commercialisation {{of a number of}} <b>plasticising</b> polymers. In this study the <b>plasticising</b> behaviour of an ethylene/vinyl acetate/carbon monoxide terpolymer (Elvaloy® from Du Pont) was investigated. Blends of PVC, Elvaloy 742 and Di-octyl phthalate (DOP) were processed on a twin-roll mill and compression moulded into plaques. These materials were characterised in terms of their hardness, Tg, clarity, mechanical properties and plasticiser migration behaviour. The ratios of PVC/DOP/Elvaloy investigated were determined by experimental design. Using this approach it was possible to model the results and produce contour plots to map out the properties {{of a wide range of}} formulations. It was confirmed that Elvaloy 742 is compatible with PVC and has a <b>plasticising</b> effect: this was demonstrated both in terms of a reduction in Shore A hardness and a reduction in Tg. Plasticiser migration was reduced in proportion to the amount of liquid plasticiser replaced. <b>Plasticising</b> with Elvaloy gave an improvement in tear strength. However, at constant hardness there was no improvement in tensile strength from replacing DOP with Elvaloy...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{producing}} and characterising xylose-glycosylated peanut protein isolate (PPI-X) films by dissolving PPI-X powder in water {{at ambient temperature}} and further <b>plasticising</b> with glycerol. The effect of powder dissolution temperature (20 - 100 °C) and glycerol concentration (15. 0 - 45. 0 %, w/w) on mechanical properties and integrity of these films was quantified. The {{results showed that the}} powder dissolution temperature had no significant effect on the mechanical and water resistance properties of PPI-X films within the temperature range tested. With increasing concentration of glycerol, the tensile strength and water resistance of PPI-X films decreased and elongation increased. The films produced by dissolving the PPI-X powder at 20 °C and <b>plasticising</b> with 25. 0 % glycerol had comparable mechanical properties and better water resistance compared to some other plant protein films <b>plasticising</b> with glycerol. The results suggested that PPI-X films could potentially be used as biodegradable packaging materials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:Within {{the scope}} of the paper, three {{different}} process technologies for manufacturing polymer micro-elements are comparatively analyzed. First the different methods of ultrasonic <b>plasticising</b> and direct injection, expansion-injection-moulding and injection moulding in thermally low conductive mould materials are briefly introduced and their processing characteristics are explained. A comparison and a benchmark of these three technologies are made using an identical micro-mould and the same polymer. In order to verify their suitability for the production of polymer micro-elements, downscaled Campus tensile bars were produced (scale 1 : 16) and tested regarding their mechanical properties on polypropylene. Furthermore the morphology was investigated. It turns out that all methods can be utilized to produce polymer micro-elements. Only the components manufactured by the ultrasonic <b>plasticising</b> and direct injection show significantly lower mechanical properties in comparison to the other two methods. This is due among other things ascribable to the detected lower degree of crystallinity...|$|R

40|$|In this research, the <b>plasticising</b> {{mechanism}} of sodium gluconate (SG) retarder in cement paste containing a superplasticiser {{has been investigated}} in order to clarify {{the performance of the}} admixture combination in concrete. From adsorption and zeta-potential measurements, it is found that a lower viscosity occurs owing to (a) the electrostatic repulsion and (b) a lower particle volume fraction. Moreover, the gluconate anion is expected to enhance the formation of a homogenous polymer network on the cement grain surface, which explains the viscosity stabilisation time. In situ investigations of hydration using environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that SG induced modifications of the ettringite crystal morphology by reducing the amount and size of the ettringite needles. From pore solution analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectra, a mineral similar to syngenite is detected. These morphological changes lower the shear resistance and the paste viscosity. A thorough understanding of the <b>plasticising</b> mechanism will lead eventually to a more predictable concrete flow behaviour, which is particularly useful for concrete practitioners facing concerns related to combined use of admixtures...|$|R

Starch/glycerol cast films were prepared with 0, 2, 5, 10 and 15 wt% AcA (starch wt% basis) and the properties analysed. It was shown that AcA acted as both a cross-linking agent and also a strong <b>plasticising</b> agent. The 5 wt% AcA derived starch films were the most effectively cross-linked having the lowest solubility (28 wt%) and decreased swelling coefficient (35 vol. %) by approximately 3 times and 2. 4 times respectively compared to the control film submerged in water (23 °C). There was also {{a significant increase in the}} film elongation at break by approximately 35 times (compared to the control) with the addition of 15 wt% AcA, emphasising the <b>plasticising</b> effect of AcA.

40|$|Background: The {{method of}} {{porosity}} analysis by water absorption {{has been carried}} out by the storage of the specimens in pure water, but it does not exclude the potential <b>plasticising</b> effect of the water generating unreal values of porosity. Objective: The present study evaluated the reliability of this method of porosity analysis in polymethylmethacrylate denture base resins by the determination of the most satisfactory solution for storage (S), where the <b>plasticising</b> effect was excluded. Materials and methods: Two specimen shapes (rectangular and maxillary denture base) and two denture base resins, water bath-polymerised (Classico) and microwave-polymerised (Acron MC) were used. Saturated anhydrous calcium chloride solutions (25 %, 50 %, 75 %) and distilled water were used for specimen storage. Sorption isotherms were used to determine S. Porosity factor (PF) and diffusion coefficient (D) were calculated within S and for the groups stored in distilled water. anova and Tukey tests were performed to identify significant differences in PF results and Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn multiple comparison post hoc test, for D results (alpha = 0. 05). Results: For Acron MC denture base shape, FP results were 0. 24 % (S 50 %) and 1. 37 % (distilled water); for rectangular shape FP was 0. 35 % (S 75 %) and 0. 19 % (distilled water). For Classico denture base shape, FP results were 0. 54 % (S 75 %) and 1. 21 % (distilled water); for rectangular shape FP was 0. 7 % (S 50 %) and 1. 32 % (distilled water). FP results were similar in S and distilled water only for Acron MC rectangular shape (p > 0. 05). D results in distilled water were statistically higher than S for all groups. Conclusions: The results of the study suggest that an adequate solution for storing specimens must be used to measure porosity by water absorption, based on excluding the <b>plasticising</b> effect.
