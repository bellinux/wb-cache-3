25|$|Acoustic mirrors are <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> used {{to reflect}} {{and perhaps to}} focus sound waves.

500|$|Power {{dividers}} (also power splitters and, {{when used}} in reverse, power combiners) and directional couplers are <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> used mostly {{in the field of}} radio technology. They couple a defined amount of the electromagnetic power in a transmission line to a port enabling the signal to be used in another circuit. [...] An essential feature of directional couplers is that they only couple power flowing in one direction. [...] Power entering the output port is coupled to the isolated port but not to the coupled port. [...] A directional coupler designed to split power equally between two ports is called a hybrid coupler.|$|E
2500|$|One {{technology}} used {{under the name}} [...] "full-body scanner" [...] is the millimeter wave scanner, the active form of which reflects extremely high frequency radio waves off the body to make an image on which one can see some types of objects hidden under the clothes. Passive millimeter wave screening devices rely on only the raw energy that is naturally emitted from the human body or objects concealed on the body; <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> do not transmit millimeter waves.

40|$|Abstract — A {{simple and}} {{effective}} technique for designing transformer-type Marchand baluns {{is presented in}} this paper. The coupled-line sections required in a Marchand balun design are realized using planar transformers with a scalable model. The proposed design technique enables the prediction and opti-mization of Marchand balun performance {{over a wide range}} of layout and process parameters. To demonstrate the optimization process, Marchand baluns are designed for implementation using silicon and glass integrated <b>passive</b> <b>device</b> (IPD) technologies. Finally, experimental verification shows very good agreement between the modeled and measured results, thereby validating the IPD design optimization.

40|$|Shape {{optimization}} of {{an active}} and a <b>passive</b> drag-reducing <b>device</b> on a two-dimensional D-shaped bluff body is performed. The two devices are: Coanda actuator, and randomly-shaped trailing-edge flap. The optimization sequence is performed by coupling the genetic algorithm software DAKOTA to the mesh generator Pointwise and to the CFD solver OpenFOAM. For the the active device the cost functional is the power ratio, whereas for the <b>passive</b> <b>device</b> it is the drag coefficient. The optimization leads to total power savings of ≈ 70 % for the optimal Coanda actuator, and a 40 % drag reduction for the optimal flap. This reduction is mainly achieved through streamlining the base flow and suppressing the vortex shedding. The addition of either an active or a <b>passive</b> <b>device</b> creates two additional smaller recirculation regions in the base cavity that shifts the larger recirculation region {{away from the body}} and increases the base pressure. The results are validated against more refined URANS simulations for selected cases...|$|R
