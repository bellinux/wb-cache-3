5|$|Various {{explanations}} for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed <b>plausible</b> at first have since been rejected.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first <b>plausible</b> evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E
5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically <b>plausible</b> values.|$|E
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not <b>plausible.</b> Matthew's account is more <b>plausible,</b> but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a <b>plausible</b> use for the device. The argument is bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E
5|$|Arrian and Plutarch {{claimed that}} Alexander was {{speechless}} by this point, implying {{that this was}} an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more <b>plausible</b> story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{proximity}} and Sun-like properties of Epsilon Eridani, in 1985 physicist and author Robert L. Forward considered {{the system as}} a <b>plausible</b> target for interstellar travel. The following year, the British Interplanetary Society suggested Epsilon Eridani as one of the targets in its Project Daedalus study. The system has continued to be among the targets of such proposals, such as Project Icarus in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Both Wessex's sudden rise {{to power}} in the late 820s, and the {{subsequent}} failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. One <b>plausible</b> explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is <b>plausible</b> that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems {{to be part of}} southern English politics {{during the first half of}} the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|He {{added that}} while he regretted that his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare <b>plausible</b> deniability.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the Anne Frank House {{published}} {{new research}} pointing to investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a <b>plausible</b> {{explanation for the}} raid {{that led to the}} arrest of the Franks. The report states that other activities in the building may have led authorities there, including activities of Frank's company. However, it does not rule out betrayal.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) {{rejected}} {{an injunction}} petition {{to halt the}} LHC's operation as unfounded, without hearing the case, stating that the opponents had failed to produce <b>plausible</b> evidence for their theories. A subsequent petition {{was rejected by the}} Administrative Court of Cologne in January 2011. An appeal against the latter ruling was rejected by the Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's theory {{centers on}} the notion that justice is the {{essential}} characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with <b>plausible</b> formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E
5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is <b>plausible.</b> Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|Spence was {{scheduled}} to have a medical examination on 11 March and it was considered <b>plausible</b> {{that he may have}} taken extra insulin to prepare himself for the examination. An overdose of insulin, or irregular doses, can distort the senses and cause the muscles to be unco-ordinated.|$|E
5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least <b>plausible)</b> events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|The {{parameters}} {{of this planet}} was initially very weakly constrained, with a period in excess of 8 years with a high eccentricity and a minimum mass of approximately two times the mass of Jupiter. Continued observations restrained the <b>plausible</b> solutions substantially, resulting in the current parameters published in 2008.|$|E
5|$|While Georgian and Classical {{evidence}} {{makes the}} contemporaneous Kartlian {{links with the}} Seleucids <b>plausible</b> (Toumanoff has even implied that the kings of Kartli might have aided the Seleucids in holding the resurgent Orontids of Armenia in check), Pharnavaz's alleged reform of the eristavi fiefdoms is most likely a back-projection of the medieval pattern of subdivision to the remote past.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's numbers is size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic strength in Alsace of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem <b>plausible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa excitedly {{discuss their}} visit to Kamp Krusty, {{a summer camp}} run by Krusty the Clown. Homer has made Bart's visit {{conditional}} on him getting at least a C- average on his report card. Bart receives a D- in each subject from Ms. Krabappel, so he changes each grade into straight A+. Homer chides Bart for not faking <b>plausible</b> grades, but lets him go to camp anyway, {{because he does not}} want Bart hanging around throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} in the public, in 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically <b>plausible.</b>|$|E
5|$|During dialogue, diction is {{dependent}} on the character's social background: Sumardjo writes that Marsiti speaks as a poor villager with little education would, and that Aij Tjeng's father and father-in-law use constructions and give advice only <b>plausible</b> if coming from older people. He finds only one character, the Columbia University-educated Bian Koen, to be unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it unfitting of an individual with the character's education and life experiences. In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of ellipses, a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary silat (traditional martial arts) stories.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain <b>plausible.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{narrative}} {{history the}} principal sources are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Irish annals. The evidence from charters {{created in the}} Kingdom of England provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain. While Scandinavian sagas describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed. Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint Cathróe of Metz, a work of hagiography written in Germany {{at the end of}} the 10th century, provides <b>plausible</b> details of the saint's early life in north Britain.|$|E
5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least <b>plausible,</b> since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken up at an earlier perihelion passage. The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was <b>plausible.</b> It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is a fragment of X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E
5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for <b>plausible</b> deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, {{he and his}} two sisters were raised primarily by his mother {{with the help of}} various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair considers it <b>plausible,</b> citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Many modern historians, {{who usually}} {{consider}} Herodotus more reliable, add the 1,000 Lacedaemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men {{as a standard}} number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians. However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are <b>plausible.</b> Furthermore, the numbers changed {{later on in the}} battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).|$|E
5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a <b>plausible</b> structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not <b>plausible</b> that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a <b>plausible</b> Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or <b>plausible,</b> just that it is logically possible.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically <b>plausible</b> than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were <b>plausible</b> but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most <b>plausible</b> candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time. Other <b>plausible</b> uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E
