40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{equilibrium}} in a two-tree (sector) economy with two regimes. The output of each tree {{is driven by}} a jump-diffusion process, and a downward jump in one {{sector of the economy}} can (but need not) trigger a shift to a regime where the likelihood of future jumps is generally higher. Furthermore, the true regime is unobservable, so that the representative Epstein-Zin investor has to extract the probability of being in a certain regime from the data. These two channels help us to match the stylized facts of countercyclical and excessive return volatilities and correlations between sectors. Moreover, the model reproduces the predictability of stock returns in the data without generating consumption growth predictability. The uncertainty about the state also reduces the slope of the term structure of equity. We document that heterogeneity between the two sectors with respect to shock <b>propagation</b> <b>risk</b> can lead to highly persistent aggregate price-dividend ratios. Finally, the possibility of jumps in one sector triggering higher overall jump probabilities boosts jump risk premia while uncertainty about the regime is the reason for sizeable diffusive risk premia...|$|E

40|$|I. Systemic {{risk and}} its {{prevention}} The recent financial crisis was unprecedented in scale {{and speed of}} propagation. A well recognized {{reason is that the}} original shock (started in US real estate funding structures heavily distorted by regulatory arbitrage) was severely compounded by the extreme funding fragility built up by banks (Brunnermeier, 2009). Bank risk absorbing capacity had been reduced not just by lower capital buffers, but by extremely short term funding. The panic withdrawals of wholesale short term investors (Gorton, 2009) propagated and compounded losses as it forced massive distress sales. These in turn caused rapid asset price declines, triggered further margin calls and thus more fire sales across markets. The resulting uncertainty undermined access to new financing, leading to inefficiently rapid deleveraging (Brunnermeier, 2009). After wholesale money markets had been severely dysfunctional for over a year, barely contained by massive liquidity provision, practically all uninsured bank liabilities had to be bailed out after panic broke out in September 2008. The crisis led to a consensus on the need to control <b>propagation</b> <b>risk.</b> Last February we proposed a new macro prudential tool, liquidity risk charges, to discourage liquidity risk creation by banks (Perotti and Suarez, 2009).

40|$|International audiencePast fire {{recurrence}} impacts {{the vegetation}} structure, {{and it is}} consequently hypothesized to alter its future fire behaviour. We examined the fire behaviour in shrubland-forest mosaics of southeastern France, which were organized along a range of fire frequency (0 to 3 - 4 fires along the past 50 years) and had different time intervals between fires. The mosaic was dominated by Quercus suber L. and Erica-Cistus shrubland communities. We described the vegetation structure through measurements of tree height, base of tree crown or shrub layer, mean diameter, cover, plant water content and bulk density. We used the physical model Firetec to simulate the fire behaviour. Fire intensity, fire spread, plant water content and biomass loss varied significantly according to fire recurrence and vegetation structure, mainly linked to the time since the last fire, then the number of fires. These results confirm that past fire recurrence affects future fire behaviour, with multilayered vegetation (particularly high shrublands) producing more intense fires, contrary to submature Quercus woodlands that have not burnt since 1959 and that are unlikely to reburn. Further simulations, with more vegetation scenes according to shrub and canopy covers, will complete this study {{in order to discuss}} the fire <b>propagation</b> <b>risk</b> in heterogeneous vegetation, particularly in the Mediterranean area, with a view to a local management of these ecosystems.

Organisms {{that rely on}} asexual <b>propagation</b> <b>risk</b> extinction due {{to the loss of}} genetic diversity and the inability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The fungus-growing ant species Mycocepurus smithii was thought to be obligately asexual because only parthenogenetic populations have been collected from widely separated geographic localities. Nonetheless, M. smithii is ecologically successful, with the most extensive distribution and the highest population densities of any fungus-growing ant. Here we report that M. smithii actually consists of a mosaic of asexual and sexual populations that are nonrandomly distributed geographically. The sexual populations cluster along the Rio Amazonas and the Rio Negro and appear to be the source of independently evolved and widely distributed asexual lineages, or clones. Either apomixis or automixis with central fusion and low recombination rates is inferred to be the cytogenetic mechanism underlying parthenogenesis in M. smithii. Males appear to be entirely absent from asexual populations, but their existence in sexual populations is indicated by the presence of sperm in the reproductive tracts of queens. A phylogenetic analysis of the genus suggests that M. smithii is monophyletic, rendering a hybrid origin of asexuality unlikely. Instead, a mitochondrial phylogeny of sexual and asexual populations suggests multiple independent origins of asexual reproduction, and a divergence-dating analysis indicates that M. smithii evolved 0. 5 – 1. 65 million years ago. Understanding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of asexual reproduction in this species contributes to a general understanding of the adaptive significance of sex...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} {{for the design}} of safety critical product lines for control automation software. The functional failure identification and <b>propagation</b> <b>risk</b> assessment method is used in the early design phase of the mechatronic system. The applied methodology starts with the decomposition of the system into functions that are connected by energy, material and signal flows. This results in a functional model that does not make any assumptions on what components are used to realize the functions. The functions are mapped to mechatronic components in a model that can be simulated: the configuration flow graph. Functional failure logic is executed in parallel to the simulation to monitor the simulation signals and to determine the health of each function. The functional health results of the simulation, when critical events are injected, are used to identify the propagation of functional failures. Alternative designs that are described with a feature model, combinations of component parameter values and changes in the critical event scenario can be simulated. System designs that result in undesirable behavior are rejected. The purpose is to identify risks and to determine mechatronic designs with adequate safety characteristics before the design process branches into software, electrical and mechanical domains. The final deliverable of the mechatronic system design phase is a feature model capturing the design alternatives with acceptable safety characteristics. The aspect of this model containing software is the starting point for software product line engineering. In control automation, programmable logic controller targets are used, so a methodology and toolchain for supporting software product line configuration for such platforms has been developed using the PLCopen standard.

They matched 12, 153 fraudulent physicians using the National Provider Identifier (NPI) [40] with their unique identity-matching algorithm. They decided against distinguishing between LEIE exclusion rules/codes and instead used every listed physician. It is unclear whether the authors accounted for waivers, exclusion start dates or {{the length of the}} associated exclusion during their fraud label mapping process. These details are important in reducing redundant and overlapping exclusion labels and for assessing accurate fraud detection performance. Therefore, due to this lack of clarity in the exclusion labeling methodology, the results from their study cannot be reliably reproduced and can be difficult to compare to other research. They developed a method for pinpointing fraudulent behavior by determining the fraud risk through the application of network algorithms from graphs. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the data, the authors used a 50 : 50 class distribution, retaining 12, 000 excluded providers while randomly selecting 12, 000 non-excluded providers. They put forth a few groups of algorithms and determined their fraud detection results based on the real-world fraudulent physicians found in the LEIE dataset. One set of algorithms, which they denote as Behavior–Vector similarity, determines similarity in behavior for real-world fraudulent and non-fraudulent physicians using nominal values such as drug prescriptions and medical procedures.

Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is rapidly becoming a most sought after research area due {{to the influence of}} recent supply chain disruptions on global economy. The thesis begins with a systematic literature review of the developments within the broad domain of SCRM over the past decade. Thematic and descriptive analysis supported with modern knowledge management techniques brings forward seven distinctive research gaps for future research in SCRM. Overlapping research findings from an industry perspective, coupled with SCRM research gaps from the systematic literature review has helped to define the research problem for this study. The thesis focuses on a holistic and systematic approach to modelling risks within supply chain and logistics networks. The systems thinking approach followed conceptualises the phenomenon of <b>risk</b> <b>propagation</b> utilising several recent case studies, workshop findings and focus studies. <b>Risk</b> <b>propagation</b> is multidimensional and propagates beyond goods, finance and information resource. It cascades into technology, human resource and socio-ecological dimensions.

The prevention policy promotes the major role of forest layout, {{for which it is}} necessary to build appropriate facilities such as reducing ignition and fire <b>propagation</b> <b>risks</b> near the borders of roads and tracks, creating forest tracks to allow firefighters to move safely through the forest during a fire, creating fuel breaks in order to divide up forests and limit the propagation of fire. Land - clearing along a forest track consists in creating discontinuity between the herbaceous stratum and the tree stratum by eliminating the shrubby stratum and cutting tree crowns. It avoids fire propagation by convection, and enables firefighters to deal with the fire in safety. The main difficulty for forest officers is to identify an optimized method to select appropriate tracks to clear, because it is impossible to clear all the tracks each year. Remote sensing tools would seem to be particularly useful for obtaining the best strategic and economic overview of forest tracks at departmental scale. This theme “land - clearing evaluation method” was selected as a target application for the images derived from the new Pleiades sensors: products and services required by end users. The objective of this work is to assess the real potentiality of such Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) imagery for land-clearing management. The methodology used consists in image classification and spatial analysis in order to extract land-clearing quality, and also evaluation of land-clearing quality based on field questionnaires validated through interactions with firefighters and rangers.

Conventional risk management is often driven by human (subjective) assessment of how one risk influences the other, respectively, how security incidents can affect subsequent problems in interconnected (sub) systems of an infrastructure. Using percolation theory, a well-established methodology in the fields of epidemiology and disease spreading, a simple simulation-based method is described to assess <b>risk</b> <b>propagation</b> system-atically. This simulation is formally analyzed using percolation theory, to obtain closed form criteria that help predicting a pandemic incident propagation (or a propagation with average-case bounded implications). The method is designed as a security decision support tool, e. g., to be used in security operation centers. For that matter, a flexible visualization technique is devised, which is naturally induced by the percolation model and the simulation algorithm that derives from it. The main output of the model is a graphical visualization of the infrastructure (physical or logical topology). This representation uses color codes to indicate the likelihood of problems to arise from a security incident that initially occurs at a given point in the system. Large likelihoods for problems thus indicate “hotspots”, where additional action should be taken.

40|$|Excerpt] Macro {{financial}} <b>risk</b> <b>propagation</b> and {{its implications}} on financial stability have emerged as major concerns of governments and financial institutions, particularly those with large financial asset pools. The global financial crisis in 2008 – 2009 was essentially centered on credit risk involving money markets, and the <b>propagation</b> of such <b>risk</b> across and among financial institutions and sovereigns is related to how connected they are. To {{understand the concept of}} connectedness, Merton provides a brief review of the concepts of credit, credit risk, and guarantees. He asserts that risk- free credit is essentially risky credit coupled with a guarantee of payment {{in the event of a}} default. That is, risky debt is nothing but risk-free debt less a guarantee of repayment. We note that in complete contingent markets, the holder of debt always has the option to purchase insurance on the debt, pretty much like the credit default swaps that are available in advanced financial markets today. The guarantee could be issued by a financial institution or a sovereign government, and effectively transfers the risk of default from the borrower to the guarantor. From the perspective of the lending institution, however, the instrument or asset it is holding is now essentially risk-free debt. Merton stresses that the guarantees attached to risky debt are in fact insurance on the risk of default, and are akin to put options on assets of borrowers, with maturities similar to those of the debt instrument being guaranteed and a strike price equivalent to the promised payment of debt...|$|R
40|$|Causality is a widely-used {{concept in}} {{theoretical}} and empirical economics. The recent financial economics literature has used Granger causality to detect the presence of contemporaneous links between financial institutions and, in turn, to obtain a network structure. Subsequent studies combined the estimated networks with traditional pricing or risk measurement models to improve their fit to empirical data. In this paper, we provide two contributions: we show {{how to use a}} linear factor model as a device for estimating a combination of several networks that monitor the links across variables from different viewpoints; and we demonstrate that Granger causality should be combined with quantile-based causality when the focus is on <b>risk</b> <b>propagation.</b> The empirical evidence supports the latter claim...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} interconnection {{of various}} urban transportation systems {{results in a}} multitude of logical and physical interdependencies. Taken together, individual urban transport networks form a "network of networks". The paper deals with methods concerning automated risk assessment of incidents (e. g. terrorist attacks, natural disasters or major events) affecting the operation or security status of the "network of networks" and being {{the purpose of the}} EU project STAR-TRANS. Particular emphasis is placed on cascading incidents (triggered by initial incidents) and the <b>propagation</b> of their <b>risks.</b> Using a strategic software tool, decision and policy makers should be able to simulate such scenarios and receive appropriate actions in advance to prepare contingency and response planning...|$|R
