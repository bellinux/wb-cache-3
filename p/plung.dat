Tarzan then calls out the famous ape man cry as he raises up the dead body of his foe. Visually, the Disney Sabor is highly stylized in design, with body and head at strange angles, very long thin fangs, and scarce spots unlike those of a real leopard. Sabor is a feral and violent character, contrasting sharply with the more realistic and kid-friendly design of other animal characters in the movie, and is the only major animal character in Tarzan to not talk.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1905, the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad was completed. The line passed only 20 {{miles from}} Searchlight and 15 {{miles from the}} Copper World Mine. With this {{competition}} in early 1907, the Santa Fé railroad completed a 23-mile extension to Searchlight, the Barnwell and Searchlight Railway. To prevent confusion with a town in Texas, Manvel was renamed Barnwell. Unfortunately the rail line was finished just as Searchlight’s production began to <b>plung.</b> A depression followed in October. When blue pieces of scrip were introduced in Barnwell as money, families began to leave. In September 1908, a fire destroyed most of Barnwell’s business district, including the depot and the Brown-Gosney Company’s store. The depot never reopened and the Brown-Gosney Company which had earlier moved its headquarters to Searchlight, closed its store in Barnwell in February, 1910 and the town had another fire in May. After production at Searchlight fell drastically in 1911, T. A. Brown moved his family away in 1912. The railroad closed its agency in 1914. The post office was discontinued in April, 1915. The school district was abolished in 1918. All train service was discontinued in late 1923, and the rails were torn up.|$|E
40|$|In adult {{high-frequency}} oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), {{stroke volume}} (SV) and mean lung pressure (<b>PLung)</b> {{are important for}} lung protection. We measured the airway pressure at the Y-piece and the lung pressure during HFOV using a lung model and HFOV ventilators for adults (R 100 and 3100 B). The lung model was made of a 20 -liter, airtight rigid plastic container (adiabatic compliance: 19. 3 ml/cmH 2 O) {{with or without a}} resistor (20 cmH 2 O/l/sec). The ventilator settings were as follows: mean airway pressure (MAP), 30 cmH 2 O;frequency, 5 - 15 Hz (every 1 Hz);airway pressure amplitude (AMP), maximum;and % of inspiratory time (IT), 50 % for R 100, 33 % or 50 % for 3100 B. The measurements were also performed with an AMP of 2 / 3 or 1 / 3 maximum at 5, 10 and 15 Hz. The <b>PLung</b> and the measured MAP were not consistently identical to the setting MAP in either ventilator, and decreasing IT decreased the <b>PLung</b> in 3100 B.

Elizabeth {{died when she was}} twenty, as well as Delmira, and her death after a long and painful illness, seemed having given the fatal blow to the health of her father, who actually died a month later. The episode, struck the imagination of his contemporaries who found in it a form of nemesis for regicide committed. The second, Orinda is a direct reference to the Welsh poet Katherine Philips, whose poetic production concerned only about love, marriage, on love relationships in general, arousing interest and scandal for his theories on Love between women, and whose nom de plume was The Matchless Orinda.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to reveal whether there was {{non-randomness}} in the occurrence of metastasis and, if the non-randomness was denied, whether there were specific metastatic patterns in lung cancer patients. Patients who presented with pathologically diagnosed lung cancer between January 1986 and March 2009 at our hospitals were included. A statistical method and conditional probability analysis were used to analyze the data. Under the condition of one metastatic organ A (lung, bone, brain, liver or adrenal gland; the 5 most common metastatic organs), we determined the conditional probability of distant metastasis to a specific organ B, which was written as P(B | A), and compared it with the probability of distant metastasis P(B). The study group consisted of 1, 994 patients. Of the 1, 994 patients, 839 (42. 1 %) had distant metastases at the time of the initial diagnosis of lung cancer. With the exception of the comparisons between <b>P(lung)</b> and <b>P(lung</b> | adrenal gland) and between P(adrenal gland) and P(adrenal gland | lung), there were statistically significant differences between P(B | A) and P(B) in the 5 metastatic organs. In addition, P(B | A) and P(C | B | A) varied according to each organ and P(confined to A), P(confined to A and B) and P(confined to A, B and C) were different in each metastatic organ. In lung cancer patients, distant metastasis occurred non-randomly and there may be certain specific patterns of distant metastasis. The accumulation of knowledge of specific patterns of metastasis may aid the approach to individualized treatments...|$|E

Then the air bubble diffusion is analysed analytically in the near-flow field of both circular and two-dimensional plunging jets. The theoretical developments are compared with existing circular plunging jet data and new experiments performed with a two-dimensional vertical supported jet. The study highlights two mechanisms of air entrainment at the <b>plung</b> point depending upon the jet impact velocity and results suggest that the dispersion of air bubbles within the shear layer is primarily an advective diffusion process...|$|E

40|$|Bio-inspired ” wing sections, so {{aptly named}} because their profile {{is defined by}} {{corrugated}} sections observed from actual insect species, have attracted more and more attentions in aircraft wing design. Existing literature has shown that corrugated airfoils, {{as well as their}} profiled counterparts, while possessing an unconventional shape, show very little contribution in drag when compared to more technical airfoils such as a flat plate and a cambered conventional airfoil with respect to cruising flight of fixed-wing aircraft. In addition, the corrugated airfoils were shown to delay stall as well provide an increase in translator lift. With this in mind, this study presents a series of computations using two bio-inspired airfoils and two technical airfoils in a flapping motion for various reduced frequencies and Strouhal numbers. We find that for certain values of reduced frequencies and Strouhal numbers that the wake shows no appreciable difference between the four different airfoils. With increasing reduced frequencies and Strouhal numbers we find that the wake begins to vary widely from each other.

40|$|Micro Air Vehicles (MAV’s) {{have small}} size and extreme {{maneuverability}} {{which makes them}} ideal for surveillance. Propulsion mechanisms include propellers, rotors, and flapping airfoils. Flapping motions, along with biologically-inspired wing profiles, are of interest due to their use of natural physics. Corrugated airfoil structures appears to have poor aerodynamic performance at higher Reynolds numbers, but serve well at Re< 10, 000. Understanding flow structures around corrugated profiles and comparing them to a standard airfoil will aid in understanding how these corrugated profiles perform well and have been adopted by some of nature’s most acrobatic flyers. Motivation for this investigation is to compare static flow visualizations of corrugated profiles to a standard National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) airfoil from low to high angles of attack and further observe flow structure development of a pitching and plunging flat plate at a Re< 10, 000 and a Strouhal number relevant to natural fliers. The static visualization was conducted at Re= 1, 000 with a NACA 0012 airfoil and two corrugated models.
