5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and <b>purge</b> <b>gas,</b> as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{analysis}} of volatile compounds, a purge and trap (P) concentrator system {{may be used to}} introduce samples. [...] The target analytes are extracted and mixed with water and introduced into an airtight chamber. [...] An inert gas such as Nitrogen (N2) is bubbled through the water; this is known as purging or sparging. [...] The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a pressure gradient (caused by the introduction of the <b>purge</b> <b>gas)</b> out of the chamber. [...] The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a 'trap'. [...] The trap is a column of adsorbent material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase. [...] The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC-MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split inlet system. [...] P GC-MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and BTEX compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).|$|E
2500|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} {{is stored}} as a liquid. The presently accepted upper limit of safety {{as a health}} hazard [...] is 500 ppm. [...] Often, the storage containers for the product vinyl chloride are high capacity spheres. The spheres have an inside sphere and an outside sphere. Several inches of empty space separate the inside sphere from the outside sphere. This void area between the spheres is purged with an inert gas such as nitrogen. As the nitrogen <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> exits the void space it passes through an analyzer {{that is designed to}} detect if any vinyl chloride is leaking from the internal sphere. If vinyl chloride starts to leak from the internal sphere or if a fire is detected {{on the outside of the}} sphere then the contents of the sphere are automatically dumped into an emergency underground storage container. Containers [...] used for handling vinyl chloride at atmospheric temperature are always under pressure. [...] Inhibited vinyl chloride may be stored at normal atmospheric conditions in suitable pressure vessel. Uninhibited vinyl chloride may be stored either under refrigeration or at normal atmospheric temperature in the absence of air or sunlight but only for a duration of a few days. If for longer periods, regular checks should be made for the presence of polymers.|$|E
40|$|A {{continuous}} hydrogen-removal method from aluminum melt, spray degassing, is presented. The equilibrium {{equation of}} this method is discussed theoretically. Theoretical equilibrium analysis shows that the final hydrogen content of the melt is only affected by the <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and the melt mass flow rate. The hydrogen content of the outlet melt always contains a constant during the whole degassing time. The final hydrogen content of the melt decreases with increasing <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and increases with increasing melt mass flow rate. Compared with the rotary impeller degassing method, spray degassing consumes less treatment time and <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> volume. Experiments were conducted using the method to remove the hydrogen in aluminum melt. The experimental results show that, the spray degassing is a good hydrogen-removal method.

Channels (2 - 4) opened {{in a direction}} of the gasket or the film is formed in parts (5. 1, 5. 2) of the housing at a region around the chamber. The channels are provided on or in the gasket. Inert <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> or fluid removed from a measuring cell is conducted through the channels {{in such a way}} that the <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> or the fluid immediately flows along a surface of the gasket and/or of the film. USE - Sealing for determining permeation rate of a film or solid within a chamber (all claimed). Uses include but are not limited to determine permeation rate of a film or solid for selected molecules e. g. water, oxygen or methane, or atoms of substances and/or chemical elements or chemical compounds. ADVANTAGE - The inert <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> or fluid removed from the measuring cell are conducted through the channels {{in such a way that}} the <b>purging</b> <b>gas</b> or the fluid immediately flows along the surface of the gasket and/or of the film, thus avoiding penetration of substances into the chamber, and hence providing a secure sealing of the chamber against external influences...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} operation, {{the amount of}} <b>purged</b> {{nitrogen}} <b>gas</b> must be calculated.

50|$|Argon is {{heavier than}} air. When {{used as a}} <b>purge</b> <b>gas,</b> it should be slowly {{introduced}} {{into the bottom of}} the cavity and allowed to push the ambient gas out of the exhaust port.

50|$|In cocurrent systems, the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> is 50 °F to 100 °F {{hotter than}} the soil {{discharge}} temperature. The {{result is that}} the <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> exit temperature may range from 400 °F to 1,000 °F and cannot go directly to the baghouse. <b>Purge</b> <b>gas</b> first enters an afterburner to decontaminate the fine particles, then goes into a cooling unit prior to introduction into the baghouse. Because of the higher temperature and volume of the <b>purge</b> <b>gas,</b> the baghouse and all other downstream processing equipment must be larger than in a countercurrent system. Cocurrent systems do have several advantages over countercurrent systems: The afterburner is located upstream of the baghouse ensuring that fine particles are decontaminated; and because the heated <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> is introduced at the same end of the drum as the feed soil, the soil is heated faster, resulting in a longer residence time. Higher temperatures and longer residence time mean that cocurrent systems can be used to treat soils contaminated with heavier petroleum products. Cocurrent systems are effective for light and heavy petroleum products including No. 6 fuel oil, crude oil, motor oil, and lubricating oil.|$|E

The components argon and methane are inert gases within the ammonia synthesis loop, but would enrich there and call for a <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> system with synthesis gas losses or additional expenditures for a <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> separation unit. The main sources for the supply of feed gases are partial oxidation processes.|$|E

Stable isotope measurements of water samples were performed by cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Both plasma and <b>purged</b> <b>gas</b> treated samples resulted enriched in 2 H and 18 O, contrary to untreated water.

50|$|Besides the {{direction}} of <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> flow relative to soil feed direction, there is one major difference in configuration between countercurrent and cocurrent rotary dryers. The <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> from a countercurrent rotary dryer is typically only 350 °F to 500 °F and does not require cooling before entering the baghouse where fine particles are trapped. A disadvantage is that these particles {{may not have been}} decontaminated and are typically recycled to the dryer. Countercurrent dryers have several advantages over cocurrent systems. They are more efficient in transferring heat from <b>purge</b> <b>gas</b> to contaminated soil, and the volume and temperature of exit gas are lower, allowing the gas to go directly to a baghouse without needing to be cooled. The cooler exit gas temperature and smaller volume eliminates the need for a cooling unit, which allows downstream processing equipment to be smaller. Countercurrent systems are effective on petroleum products with molecular weights lower than No.2 fuel oil.|$|E

50|$|Rotary dryer systems use a {{cylindrical}} metal reactor (drum) that {{is inclined}} {{slightly from the}} horizontal.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of employing lignite coal as a fuel in a Direct Carbon Fuel Cell (DCFC) of the type: lignite|Co–CeO 2 /YSZ/Ag|air is investigated. The impact of several parameters, related to anodic electrode composition (20, 40 and 60 wt. % Co/CeO 2), cell temperature (700 – 800 °C), carrier gas composition (CO 2 /He mixtures), and total feed flow rate (10 – 70 cm 3 /min), was systematically examined. The effect of molten carbonates on DCFC performance was also investigated by employing a eutectic mixture of lithium and potassium carbonates as carbon additives.
