When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails <b>processing,</b> <b>belt</b> filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|E

50|$|Wash deinking {{consists}} of a washing stage where dispersants are added to wash out the printing inks. When the pulp slurry is dewatered (thickened), the medium to fine particles are washed out. This process is most useful for removing particles smaller than about 30 µm, like water-based inks, fillers, coating particles, fines and micro stickies. This process is more common when making deinked pulp for tissue. The <b>processing</b> equipment are <b>belt</b> filters, pressure belt filters, disk filters and static filters. This stage is much more efficient than normal washing / dewatering stages.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{significant}} {{advantage of}} IQF technology {{is its ability}} to separate the products during the freezing process, which results in products of higher quality when compared to those which are block frozen for example. This advantage is also important for food sustainability as it allows the defrost and use of the exact needed quantity as opposed to defrosting a bigger block and dispose of the unneeded or unused portion. There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer {{with the help of a}} <b>processing</b> line <b>belt</b> or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. The transportation of the product inside the freezer can be achieved through different technologies depending on the IQF freezer’s brand. There are solutions based on transportation belts inside the freezer which is similar to a conveyor belt. Other latest innovations include bed plates on which the product lands and an asymmetrical movement is used for making the product advance by itself in the freezer.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{performance}} {{improvements in}} navigational tests were observed (over and above those experienced by control subjects {{during the same}} period with the same training) and, for half of the participants, the perception of the belt's vibration underwent a profound change from simple tactile innervation to approach a genuine and direct sense of allocentric orientation: in other words, could perceive north as an entity distinct from the vibrating transducer on the waist, like one perceives a glass on a table as an entity distinct from the impact of reflected photons on the retina. Further, tests of the influence of the belt information on the rotational nystagmus effect suggested that, after training, the <b>processing</b> of the <b>belt</b> information became subcognitive.|$|R
40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system of}} monkeys includes {{a large number}} of interconnected subcortical nuclei and cortical areas. At subcortical levels, the structural components of the auditory system of monkeys resemble those of nonprimates, but the organization at cortical levels is different. In monkeys, the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate complex projects in parallel to a core of three primary-like auditory areas, AI, R, and RT, constituting the first stage of cortical processing. These areas interconnect and project to the homotopic and other locations in the opposite cerebral hemisphere and to a surrounding array of eight proposed belt areas as a second stage of cortical <b>processing.</b> The <b>belt</b> areas in turn project in overlapping patterns to a lateral parabelt region with at least rostral and caudal subdivisions as a third stage of cortical processing. The divisions of the parabelt distribute to adjoining auditory and multimodal regions of the temporal lobe and to four functionally distinct regions of the frontal lobe. Histochemically, chimpanzees and humans have an auditory core that closely resembles that of monkeys. The challenge for future researchers is to understand how this complex system in monkeys analyzes and utilizes auditory information...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contributes}} {{an original}} integrated model of an open-pit coal mine for supporting energy-efficient decisions. Mixed integer linear programming {{is used to}} formulate a general integrated model of the operational energy consumption of four common open-pit coal mining subsystems: excavation and haulage, stockpiles, <b>processing</b> plants and <b>belt</b> conveyors. Mines are represented as connected instances of the four subsystems, in a flow sheet manner, which are then fitted to data provided by the mine operators. Solving the integrated model ensures the subsystems’ operations are synchronised and whole-of-mine energy efficiency is encouraged. An investigation on {{a case study of}} an open-pit coal mine is conducted to validate the proposed methodology. Opportunities are presented for using the model to aid energy-efficient decision-making at various levels of a mine, and future work to improve the approach is described...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part I: Journal of Systems and Control Engineering [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] engineering, combining a number of solutions and technologies can result in more effective systems than using only one approach on its own. In particular, {{it has been shown}} that in condition monitoring (CM), smarter maintenance systems may be obtained by integrating various sensors together. This paper extends this idea by integrating various non-homogeneous technologies horizontally. The proposed system is an internet-based condition monitoring (e-CM) prototype that can identify abnormal tension in moving belts. It is shown that by applying a classification technique, known as novelty detection, it is possible to decide the status of <b>belt</b> tension by <b>processing</b> the <b>belt</b> vibration signals from an optical sensor (i. e. an indirect sensing approach). A novel method for industrial network communication using XML to create a single standard format for sensor information is also used to link the sensor to the process controller via the internet using the flexible CAN bus technology; this is used together with low-cost microcontrollers with a built-in ethernet link for data acquisition and transmission. The resulting integrated approach is more efficient because: (a) it can reduce waste by minimizing process interruptions caused by direct belt inspection methods while obtaining high detection accuracy (99. 67 per cent) and (b) it can provide on-line remote CM that is cost-effective, simple, standardized, and scalable across a wide area and for a relatively large number of sensors. This improvement is especially important when applied to bottleneck processes and critical components...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the UJI Industrial Robotics Telelaboratory, which lets Ph. D. and Master’s degree students perform robotics and computer vision tele-experiments. By using this system, {{students are able}} to program experiments remotely via the Web, in order to combine the use of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to provide real-time vision <b>processing,</b> a conveyor <b>belt,</b> and a Motoman industrial manipulator. This paper introduces the novel SNRP protocol (i. e., Simple Network Robot Protocol), which permits the integration of network robots and sensors within an e-learning platform in a simple and reliable manner. As long as the {{students are able to}} interact remotely with a real robotic scenario, this system helps students very much to learn robotics control techniques like visual servoing control, vision for industrial applications, and robotics manipulation. The various components of the system are connected via a 100 BaseT Ethernet network and follow the SNRP protocol, which grants simple access to generic networked devices using enhanced HTTP-based connections. Moreover, the whole telelaboratory is connected to the Internet through a router that permits the user to control the networked devices according to security constraints. The SNRP architecture is compared with a Common Object Request Broker Architecture-based approach, which was used in a previous telelaboratory. This paper describes two principle contributions: the design of a novel SNRP network architecture for the tercommunication of robots and sensors within an e-learning telelaboratory and the integration of a programmable FPGA vision system, which allows students to learn not only robotic techniques but also the design of high-performance circuits for industrial vision applications.

40|$|Development and {{implementation}} of automated monitoring, control and optimization systems for mineral processing applications require accurate online mass flow measurements from the processes. The mass flow sensors used in mineral processing plants are designed to monitor the production volumes of the end products. Belt scale {{is the most common}} online bulk material mass flow sensor used in the mineral <b>processing.</b> The <b>belt</b> scale provides an accurate online mass flow measurement from the process. However, the high unit price of the sensor prevents the installation of multiple belt scales in a single mineral processing plant. In addition to the online mass flow measurements of the belt scales, offline mass flow measurements might be also carried out at the plants. Offline mass flow sensors include wheel loader scales and truck scales. The high unit price, low measurement frequency and variable measurement delays prevent the offline mass flow sensors to be used in automated process control. The main goals of this work are determined by the three research questions formulated for this work. The first goal is to analyse the correlations of four measurement signals of the online mass flow sensors against the reference mass flow measurement of the belt scale. The fitting of the measurement signals is performed by linear regression method. The analysis of the signals is performed by measures of fit methods, the root mean square RMSE and correlation analysis method R-squared. The second goal is to analyse the accuracies of three mass flow estimation models. The third goal is to perform comprehensive analysis of the features, benefits and restrictions of each online mass flow sensor. This analysis can be utilized, if the presented online mass flow sensors are implemented in a mineral processing plant. The online mass flow sensors used in this work are a power transducer, laser profilometer, ultrasonic sensor and strain gauge. In order to answer the research questions, an experimental measurement setup was designed and installed at the test plant. An aggregate production plant is used as an example of mineral processing application in this work. The presented online mass flow sensors can also be applied to other mineral processing applications handling solid materials on belt conveyors. The results of this work indicate that all of the measurement signals of the online mass flow sensors correlate well with the reference mass flow measurement of the belt scale. The mass flow estimation models of the power transducer and laser profilometer were proven accurate. The results indicate that the online mass flow measurements can be utilized more effectively in the process control and optimization of the mineral processing plants. However, a reference mass flow measurement is required for calibration of the presented online mass flow sensors. Future research proposals are presented in the field of online mass flow estimation in mineral processing...|$|R
