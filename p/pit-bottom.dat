50|$|At the downcast shaft, a {{complete}} new <b>pit-bottom</b> and mine-car haulage system {{was constructed in}} the deeper 2nd Waterloo seam, with the shaft itself being deepened by driving up from below, whilst in the upcast <b>pit-bottom,</b> a compact mine-car circuit was constructed, with the coal now being transported almost to the shaft-side by powerful trunk conveyor belts.|$|E
50|$|At {{about this}} time, {{cross-measure}} drifts were also being driven {{down to the}} underlying Piper seam {{to the south of}} the <b>pit-bottom</b> and a new face was headed out. This face advanced below the earlier workings in the Deep Hard until it had reached a position beyond their final working point. Near to the <b>pit-bottom,</b> the Piper seam was separated from the Deep Hard by about 10yds but as the face moved out, the distance decreased until they were separated by only a short distance. At this point short drifts were driven up into the Deep Hard and new faces were then opened out back in this seam and within a short distance they were working a combined thickness of coal of about 2 - 2.5 m. Two other faces had been opened out closer to the <b>pit-bottom</b> in the Piper, but no further development took place in that seam except for a parallel one running back towards the <b>pit-bottom.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1957 Pleasley saw {{the launch}} of a short {{enclosed}} tunnel carrying the trunk conveyor from the main intake airway through into a return airway close to the <b>pit-bottom.</b> With typical mining humour, it was named Sputnik by the men. Its official name has been long forgotten.|$|E

40|$|BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal {{is seeking}} ways to {{significantly}} increase gas capture rates from in seam drilling programs in its underground coal mining operations. Hydraulic Fracture Technology (HFT), {{a joint venture}} between SCT Operations Pty Ltd and CSIRO Petroleum, is working with Illawarra Coal to develop the capability to enhance gas drainage rates in the Bulli Seam using sand-propped hydraulic fracturing based on HFT’s experience at Dartbrook Mine where gas drainage rates were increased by 5 to 180 times. One of the principal challenges for implementing sand-propped hydraulic fracturing in the Bulli Seam is the high vertical stresses that cause borehole breakout in horizontal holes drilled in coal. Borehole breakout effectively precludes the use of open hole straddle packers which are a convenient tool for placing multiple sand-propped hydraulic fractures in in-seam holes. Results of an initial six week trial undertaken at Douglas Project <b>pit-bottom</b> are described, which is aimed to developing the capability to install, grout and perforate casing so that straddle packers can be used for sand-propped hydraulic fracturing in overstressed boreholes. The primary goals of the pitbottom trial at Douglas were to confirm that horizontal boreholes in Bulli coal at 500 m overburden depth are overstressed and unsuitable for use of open hole straddle packers, and to establish a method for installing, cementing and slotting casing so that straddle packers can be used to place hydraulic fractures. Both these goals were successfully achieved...|$|E
40|$|During rescue {{excavations}} in Gabułtów, district Kazimierza Wielka, {{a series}} of skeleton graves was discovered. Three of them represent the Trzciniec culture of the older stage of the Bronze Age. Excavations conducted in this group of graves lead to collecting com-pletely preserved vessels together with bronze ware's (grave 2) as well as not numerous series of pottery fragments with one stone object, later on recognised as a tool (grave 4). The grave number 6 was empty (comp, paper by J. Górski and P. Jarosz in this volume). The mentioned artifact {{was found on the}} <b>pit-bottom</b> of the grave 4 and therefore it is clear that belongs to the grave goods. The half-product of this tool was an massive, oval in shape thick flake of the tiny-grain sandstone, most probably of the Carpathians provenience: length 10. 2 cm, width 8. 0 cm, thickness 4. 2 cm. The platform is completely covered by the negatives of preparation, the bulb of force is divided into twin points, ripple marks on the ventral side are not well visi-ble. Both surfaces of artefact, dorsal and ventral were sparse and irregular retouched. This was made by one reduction series only. As effect the thick backed knife, characterised by bimarginally, not a bit denticulate worked edge was formed (for terminology and descrip-tion criteria comp. Andrefsky 2005). The lithic industry of the Trzciniec culture from Lesser Poland Upland was summa-rised by J. Budziszewski (1998). Also the publication of the Nowa-Huta (Kopacz 1987) as well as Opatów (Więckowska 1971) should be remember here. In all this works in the first line the flint industry was analysed. Stone tools made of other raw materials were also mentioned by J. Budziszewski. As known, the tendency of use such raw material like quartzite or sandstones is well documented in the Otomani-Füzesabony culture in Danube river basin, contemporar...|$|E
