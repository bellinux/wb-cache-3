40|$|Polymeric nanocomposites are novel {{materials}} of huge interest owing to their favourable cost/performance ratio with low amount of nanofillers, improved thermal resistance, flame retardancy and mechanical properties {{in relation to}} their matrices. In this work, composites based on post-industrial waste or primary recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> and 5 [*]wt. % of organic modified montmorillonite clays were melt compounded using a twin-screw extruder. A 2 (2) factorial experimental design was used to study the compounding and processing variables: Organic modified montmorillonite with one or two hydrogenated tallow (initial basal spacing) and screw speed of the extruder. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy suggest that a partial exfoliation of the organoclay in the recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> matrix was achieved for organic modified montmorillonite with lower initial basal spacing. On the other hand, formulations containing organic modified montmorillonite with higher initial basal spacing showed only intercalated structure. The recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -organic modified montmorillonite nanocomposites did not drip flaming material during burning tests. Storage of dynamic-mechanical, tensile and flexural moduli of the recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -organic modified montmorillonite were improved when compared with both virgin and recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> s, mainly for nanocomposites formulated at a lower initial basal spacing organoclay. This could be related to a better diffusion of polymer into organic modified montmorillonite layers compared with the higher initial basal spacing organoclay. The improvements on the physical properties of recycled <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> showed the feasibility to add value to primary recycled engineering thermoplastics with a very small amount of organic modified montmorillonite...|$|R

40|$|The {{toughening}} of an aromatic amine-cured {{diglycidyl ether}} of bisphenoI-A epoxy with particles of crystalline polymers was studied. The crystalline polymers were <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate),</b> nylon 6, and poly(vinylidene fluoride). Nylon 6 and poly(vinylidene fluoride) {{were found to}} toughen the epoxy {{about as well as}} did an equivalent amount of CTBN rubber. <b>Poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> was found to toughen the epoxy about twice as well as did the rubber. The toughness of <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -epoxy blends was independent of par-ticle size for sizes in the range of tens of micrometres, but the toughness of the nylon 6 -epoxy blends decreased with increasing particle size for sizes smaller than about 40 #m. There was no loss of either Young's modulus or yield strength of the epoxy with the inclusion of either nylon 6 or <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> and less loss of these with the inclusion of poly(vinylidene fluoride) than with the inclusion of rubber. Toughness seems to have arisen from a combination of mechanisms. The <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> -epoxy blends alone seem to have gained toughness from phase-transformation toughening. Crack path alteration and the formation of steps and welts and secondary crack bridging seem to have accounted for an especially large part of the fracture energy of the poly(vinylidene fluoride) -epoxy blends. Secondary crack nucleation contributed to the toughness of the nylon 6 -epoxy blends. 1...|$|R

The resulting intensity and integrated intensity distribution in the joining zone are calculated for both polymers. They give rise to different temperature fields. The dimensions of the model seam are approximated by the dimensions of the melt isotherm. For polycarbonate the seam generated by a Gaussian beam has a non-homogeneous thickness and a width that is smaller than the beam diameter. For an M-shape beam it has a homogeneous thickness and its width scales with the width of the integrated intensity.

The TPES and TPEES were synthesized by catalyzed two-step transesterification from dimethyl terephthalate, (DMT), 1, 4 -butanediol, (BD) and a siloxane-prepolymer. Incorporation of dicarboxypropyl- or disilanol-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) s (PDMS) into the polar <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> chains resulted in rather inhomogeneous TPES copolymers, {{which was a}} consequence of a prononuced phase separation of the polar and non-polar reactants during synthesis.

40|$|Mechanisms were {{explored}} by which particles of <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> (PBT) {{are able to}} toughen a brittle epoxy. The epoxy studied was an aromati(z amine-cured diglycidyl ether of bisphenoI-A, which was toughened at about twice the rate with particles of <b>poly(butylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> as with particles of nylon 6, poly(vinylidene fluoride), or CTBN rubber. Many of the mechanisms of toughening are visible on the fracture surface of the PBT-epoxy blend, but a mechanism suggested to account for perhaps half of the increased toughness with PBT, phase transformation toughening, is not. The two types of experiment performed to detect phase transformation toughening were: (1) measurements of the rubber cavitation zone in PBT-CTBN rubber-epoxy ternary blends, which would detect {{an expansion of the}} PBT particles during fracture if it occurred, and (2) measurements of the fracture energy in PBT-epoxy blends in which the various mechanisms of toughening were selectively suppressed.

The change in the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PC has been studied as function of blending conditions, the addition of titanate catalyst inactivator, the content of Li-residues and the molecular weight of the polymers. A correlation is made between the degree of transesterification and the lowering of the glass transition. Triphenyl phosphite (TPPi) (0 – 2. 2 wt %) was used as titanate catalyst inactivator.
