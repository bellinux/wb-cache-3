40|$|The dynamic {{patterning}} of {{the plant}} hormone auxin and its efflux facilitator the PIN protein are the key regulator for the spatial and temporal organization of plant development. In particular auxin induces the polar localization of its own efflux facilitator. Due to this positive feedback auxin flow is directed and patterns of auxin and PIN arise. During the earliest stage of vein initiation in leaves auxin accumulates in a single cell in a rim of epidermal cells from which it flows into the ground meristem tissue of the leaf blade. There the localized auxin supply yields the successive polarization of PIN distribution along a strand of cells. We model the auxin and <b>PIN</b> <b>dynamics</b> within cells with a minimal canalization model. Solving the model analytically we uncover an excitable polarization front that triggers a polar distribution of PIN proteins in cells. As polarization fronts may extend to opposing directions from their initiation site we suggest a possible resolution to the puzzling occurrence of bipolar cells, such we offer {{an explanation for the}} development of closed, looped veins. Employing non-linear analysis we identify the role of the contributing microscopic processes during polarization. Furthermore, we deduce quantitative predictions on polarization fronts establishing a route to determine the up to now largely unknown kinetic rates of auxin and <b>PIN</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, supplemental information included, accepted for publication in Eur.

40|$|Cell {{polarity}} establishment, maintenance, and alteration {{are central}} to the developmental and response programs of nearly all organisms and are often implicated in abnormalities ranging from patterning defects to cancer. By residing at the distinct plasma membrane domains polar cargoes mark the identities of those domains, and execute localized functions. Polar cargoes are recruited to the specialized membrane domains by directional secretion and/or directional endocytic recycling. In plants, auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins display polar localizations in various cell types and play major roles in directional cell-to-cell transport of signaling molecule auxin that is vital for plant patterning and response programs. Recent advanced microscopy studies applied to single cells in intact plants reveal subcellular <b>PIN</b> <b>dynamics.</b> They uncover the PIN polarity generation mechanism and identified important roles of AGC kinases for polar PIN localization. AGC kinase family members PINOID, WAG 1, and WAG 2, belonging to the AGC- 3 subclass predominantly influence the polar localization of PINs. The emerging mechanism for AGC- 3 kinases action suggests that kinases phosphorylate PINs mainly at the plasma membrane after initial symmetric PIN secretion for eventual PIN internalization and PIN sorting into distinct ARF-GEF-regulated polar recycling pathways. Thus phosphorylation status directs PIN translocation to different cell sides. Based on these findings a mechanistic framework evolves that suggests existence of cell side-specific recycling pathways in plants and implicates AGC 3 kinases for differential PIN recruitment among them for eventual PIN polarity establishment, maintenance, and alteration...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{show how}} {{macroscopic}} friction {{can be used}} as a sensitive probe of chain dynamics at the surface of a glassy polymer. We present experiments in which a smooth poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) solid slides on flat surfaces presenting different densities of pinning sites available for polymer/substrate bond formation. These experiments indicate that: (i) at high pinning level, frictional dissipation occurs through the sudden flips of molecular-sized bistable regions localized in a nm-thick layer of confined chains, which responds to shear as an elasto-plastic solid, and (ii) in situations of weak pinning, dissipation appears to be governed by a process akin to that proposed for rubber friction. This suggests that some ``glass-to-rubber'' transition occurs at the polymer surface when its interaction with the substrate goes from strong to weak. The temperature-dependence of friction provides further support for the presence of a nrn-thick layer at the polymer surface, which exhibits a rubberlike response in situation of weak interaction with the countersurface. This behavior results from the interplay between viscous flow in this surface layer, and shear induced depinning of adsorbed surface chains. Moreover, a quantitative analysis of the results indicates that the <b>pinning</b> <b>dynamics</b> of polymer chains is controlled by localized 3 rotational motions at the interface...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} spherical colloidal particles relax to equilibrium slowly after they adsorb to a liquid-liquid interface, despite the large interfacial energy gradient driving the adsorption. The slow relaxation has been {{explained in terms of}} transient pinning and depinning of the contact line {{on the surface of the}} particles. However, the nature of the pinning sites has not been investigated in detail. We use digital holographic microscopy to track a variety of colloidal spheres [...] -inorganic and organic, charge-stabilized and sterically stabilized, aqueous and non-aqueous [...] -as they breach liquid interfaces. We find that nearly all of these particles relax logarithmically in time over timescales much larger than those expected from viscous dissipation alone. By comparing our results to theoretical models of the <b>pinning</b> <b>dynamics,</b> we infer the area per defect to be on the order of a few square nanometers for each of the colloids we examine, whereas the energy per defect can vary from a few $kT$ for non-aqueous and inorganic spheres to tens of $kT$ for aqueous polymer particles. The results suggest that the likely pinning sites are topographical features inherent to colloidal particles [...] -surface roughness in the case of silica particles and grafted polymer "hairs" in the case of polymer particles. We conclude that the slow relaxation must be taken into account in experiments and applications, such as Pickering emulsions, that involve colloids attaching to interfaces.

40|$|Irradiation {{hardening}} due to voids can be {{a significant}} result of radiation damage in metals, but treatment of this by elasticity theory of dislocations is difficult when the mechanisms controlling the obstacle strength are atomic in nature. Copper has long been used to approximate austenitic stainless steels in computer simulations because of their shared face-centered cubic structure and similar Stacking Fault Energy (SFE). Their stacking fault properties are however not identical; the SFE in stainless steel is significantly lower than that in Cu. Low values of SFE lead to wide dissociation of dislocations in their glide planes into Shockley partial dislocations, severely affecting the hardening process of the metal. Molecular Dynamics simulations have been conducted in order to highlight the implications of stacking fault energy on the interaction between dissociated dislocations and nanoscale voids. A recently developed set of interatomic potentials {{with a range of}} stacking fault energies based on FCC copper was used in order to investigate the Critical Resolved Shear Stress (CRSS) and other interaction details for a range of void sizes, temperatures, impact parameters and void separation distances for both edge and screw dislocations. Changes in SFE were found to affect the pinning interactions for dissociated edge dislocations in a relatively weak but systematic manner. The CRSS needed for any given dislocation to overcome the array of voids was in all cases shown to decrease with decreasing SFE and vice versa. This was also concluded for dissociated screw dislocations, but with an extra layer of complexity: The advent of complex cross-slip mechanisms sometimes lead to highly unpredictable void <b>pinning</b> <b>dynamics,</b> mainly through multiple cross-slip and its consequences; the creation of temporary immobile dislocation structures.

For homogeneous networks such as random small-world networks, the optimal driver nodes have almost the mean centrality value of the population (much lower than the centrality value of hub nodes), whereas the centrality value of optimal drivers in heterogeneous networks such as scale-free ones is much higher than the average and close to that of hub nodes.

In {{spite of the}} outward appearances the Abrikosov state is not the vortex lattice with crystalline long-range order because pinning disorders destroy this order in real superconductors (A. I. Larkin, 1970) and the Abrikosov's solution 1957 year is not valid in the ideal case (K. Maki and H. Takayama, 1972). Only long-range order - long-range phase coherence exists in the Abrikosov state. Therefore the vortex lattice melting theories are science fiction cond-mat/ 9811051. The phase transition interpreted erroneously as the vortex lattice melting is in reality a disappearance of long-range phase coherence. In spite of the widespread opinion these two transitions are different transitions when a suitable definition of phase coherence is used. The superconducting state without phase coherence differs in essence from the mythical vortex liquid. The vortex, as a singularity in superconducting state with phase coherence, can not exist without phase coherence.

The normalized magnetic relaxation rate S (= |dlnM/dlnt|) shows a temperature insensitive plateau behavior in the intermediate temperature range with a relatively high creep rate (S ∼ 0. 02 under zero field), which is interpreted in the framework of the collective creep theory. A crossover from the elastic to plastic creep is observed, while the fish-tail effect is absent for both H c and ab. Based on this observation, the origin of the fish-tail effect is also discussed.

For both square and rectangular pinning arrays, the critical depinning force shows maxima at only certain integer matching fields where the vortices can form highly ordered arrays. For rectangular arrays the depinning force and commensurability effects are anisotropic with a much lower depinning threshold for vortex motion in the easy flow directions. We find evidence for a crossover in pinning behavior in rectangular pinning arrays as the field is increased. We also show analytically, and confirm with simulations, that for B = 2 B_ϕ the strongest pinning can be achieved for rectangular pinning arrangements rather than square for one direction of driving force. Under an applied driving force we find a remarkable variety of distinct complex flow phases in both square and rectangular arrays. These flow phases include stable sinusoidal and intricate pinched patterns where vortices from different channels do not mix.

40|$|A generic {{distinct}} {{mechanism for}} the emergence of spatially localized states embedded in an oscillatory background is demonstrated by using 2 : 1 frequency locking oscillatory system. The localization is of Turing type and appears in two space dimensions as a comb-like state in either π phase shifted Hopf oscillations or inside a spiral core. Specifically, the localized states appear in absence of the well known flip-flop dynamics (associated with collapsed homoclinic snaking) that is known to arise in the vicinity of Hopf-Turing bifurcation in one space dimension. Derivation and analysis of three Hopf-Turing amplitude equations in two space dimensions reveals a local <b>dynamics</b> <b>pinning</b> mechanism for Hopf fronts, which in turn allows the emergence of perpendicular (to the Hopf front) Turing states. The results are shown to agree well with the comb-like core size that forms inside spiral waves.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pin 1 is an {{essential}} mitotic regulator consisting of a peptidyl− prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain flexibly tethered to a smaller Trp−Trp (WW) binding domain. Communication between these domains is important for Pin 1 in vivo activity; however, the atomic basis for this communication has remained elusive. Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of <b>Pin</b> 1 func-tional <b>dynamics</b> suggested that weak interdomain contacts within Pin 1 enable allosteric communication between the domain interface and the distal active site of the PPIase domain. 1, 2 A necessary condition for this hypothesis is that the intrinsic properties of the PPIase domain should be sensitive to interdomain contact.

We focus on conformal crystal structures obtained by conformally transforming a spatially uniform periodic array, as well as non-conformal gradient structures and structures with quasiperiodic order. The conformal structures feature a density gradient and local ordering. Using magnetization simulations we find that conformal pinning arrays exhibit enhanced pinning compared to non-conformal gradient arrays as well as compared to random, periodic, and quasiperiodic arrays, for {{a broad range of}} fields. The effectiveness of conformal arrays arises from the continuum of length scales introduced into the arrays by the conformal transformation, allowing for a broad range of local commensuration effects. At higher vortex fillings above the range of conformal effectiveness, we show that a non-conformal rectangular gradient array exhibits strong pinning due to a novel commensuration effect and vortex ordering. Using transport simulations where vortices are driven along the gradient and at an angle to the gradient, we confirm the effectiveness of conformal pinning at increasing the critical current. For a rotated drive, the gradient arrays produce a strong vortex guidance effect in the direction perpendicular to the gradient. Comment: 17 pages, 19 postscript figure...|$|R
40|$|Picosecond {{magnetization}} {{dynamics in}} the free and pinned layers of a microscale magnetic tunnel valve have been studied using time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy. A comparison of the observed dynamics with those of individual free and pinned layers allowed the effect of interlayer coupling to be identified. A weak interlayer coupling in the tunnel valve continuous film reference sample was detected in bulk magnetometry measurements, while focused Kerr magnetometry showed that the coupling was well maintained in the patterned structure. In the tunnel valve, the free layer precession was observed to have reduced amplitude and an enhanced relaxation. During magnetization reversal in the pinned layer, its frequency approached that of the low frequency mode associated with the free layer. At the pinned layer switching field, the linewidth of the free layer became {{similar to that of}} the pinned layer. The similarity in their frequencies promotes the formation of precessional modes that exhibit strong collective properties such as frequency shifting and enhanced linewidth, while inhomogeneous magnetization of the pinned layer during reversal may also play a role in these observations. The collective character of precessional dynamics associated with mixing of the free and <b>pinned</b> layer magnetization <b>dynamics</b> must be accounted for even in tunnel valves with a small interlayer coupling...|$|R
40|$|We study {{effects of}} <b>pinning</b> on the <b>dynamics</b> of a vortex lattice in a type II {{superconductor}} in the strong-pinning situation {{and determine the}} force [...] velocity (or current [...] voltage) characteristic combining analytical and numerical methods. Our analysis deals with a small density n_p of defects that act with a large force f_p on the vortices, thereby inducing bistable configurations that are a characteristic feature of strong pinning theory. We determine the velocity-dependent average pinning-force density 〈 F_p(v) 〉 and find that it changes on the velocity scale v_p ∼ f_p/η a_ 0 ^ 3, where η is the viscosity of vortex motion and a_ 0 the distance between vortices. In the small pin-density limit, this velocity is {{much larger than the}} typical flow velocity v_c ∼ F_c/η of the free vortex system at drives near the critical force-density F_c = 〈 F_p(v= 0) 〉∝ n_p f_p. As a result, we find a generic excess-force characteristic, a nearly linear force [...] velocity characteristic shifted by the critical force-density F_c; the linear flux-flow regime is approached only at large drives. Our analysis provides a derivation of Coulomb's law of dry friction for the case of strong vortex pinning. Comment: 24 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
