5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real <b>Presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in the Eucharist.|$|E

By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, Andreas Osiander, Johannes Brenz, and Justus Jonas. The debates were held from 1–3 October and the results were published in the fifteen Marburg Articles. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in the eucharist. Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.|$|E

Vermigli often gathered with other Marian exiles for study and prayer in his home. His lectures on Judges often addressed the political issues relevant for the exiles, such {{as the right to}} resist a tyrant. Since Vermigli's departure and the death of Bucer in 1551, Lutheranism had gained influence in Strasbourg under the leadership of Johann Marbach. Vermigli had been asked to sign both the Augsburg Confession and the Wittenberg Concord as a condition of being reinstalled as professor. He was willing to sign the Augsburg Confession, but not the Concordat, which affirmed a bodily <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in the Eucharist. He was retained and reappointed anyway, but controversy over the Eucharist as well as Vermigli's strong doctrine of double predestination continued with the Lutherans. Another professor in Strasbourg, Girolamo Zanchi, who had converted to Protestantism while under Vermigli in Lucca, shared Vermigli's convictions regarding the Eucharist and predestination. Zanchi and Vermigli became friends and allies. Vermigli's increasing alienation from the Lutheran establishment led him in 1556 to accept an offer from Heinrich Bullinger to teach at the Carolinum school in Zürich. John Jewel, a fellow Marian exile, came along with him.|$|E

25|$|The Protestant {{movement}} {{began to}} diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century. One {{of the central}} points of divergence was controversy over the Eucharist. Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation, which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. They disagreed with one another concerning the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and his body and blood in Holy Communion.|$|E

The bread and wine are held to be outward symbols of an inward and spiritual grace received by the faithful as the instruments of God's grace and Jesus' self-offering to the communicant.|$|E
25|$|The Reformed churches {{emphasize}} the , or sacramental <b>presence,</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> {{saying that the}} sacrament {{is a means of}} saving grace through which only the elect believer actually partakes of Christ, but merely with the bread and wine rather than in the elements. Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the sacrament but instead affirm that Christ is united to the believer through faith—toward which the supper is an outward and visible aid. This {{is often referred to as}} dynamic presence.|$|E

50|$|An early {{debate on}} the {{question}} {{took place in the}} 9th century, after Charles the Bald had posed the question if the body and blood <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> were to be a mystery of faith, or if they were truly present (in mysterio fiat an in veritate). Contrary positions were taken by Paschasius Radbertus and Ratramnus. Ratramnus held that the body <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> was present spiritually (spiritualiter) but not physically (corporaliter), while Paschasius emphasized the true <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the body <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> The dispute was resolved by Paschasius in a letter to Frudiger, in which he clarified his position to the effect that {{the true nature of the}} sacramental body <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> is spiritual, so that the true <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ's</b> body is necessarily spiritual and not physical in nature, so that its presence in the Eucharist is real and symbolic at the same time.|$|R
25|$|Adoration {{is a sign}} {{of devotion}} to and worship of Jesus Christ, who is {{believed}} by Catholics to be present Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity, under the appearance of the consecrated host, in the form of hosts, that is, consecrated altar bread. As a devotion, Eucharistic adoration, prayer, and meditation are more than merely looking at the Blessed Host, but are believed to be a continuation of what was celebrated in the Eucharist. From a theological perspective, the adoration is a form of latria, based on the tenet of the real <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in the Blessed Host.|$|E
25|$|First-generation Reformed theologians include Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531), Martin Bucer (1491–1551), Wolfgang Capito (1478–1541), John Oecolampadius (1482–1531), and Guillaume Farel (1489–1565). These reformers {{came from}} diverse {{academic}} backgrounds, but later distinctions within Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially {{the priority of}} scripture {{as a source of}} authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a covenantal theology of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper as visible signs of the covenant of grace. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in the Lord's supper. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of particular election (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for salvation). Martin Luther and his successor Philipp Melanchthon were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of justification by faith alone was a direct inheritance from Luther.|$|E
25|$|Calvinists {{broke from}} the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. Calvinism differs from Lutherans {{on the real}} <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in the Eucharist, {{theories}} of worship, {{and the use of}} God's law for believers, among other things. As declared in the Westminster and Second Helvetic confessions, the core doctrines are predestination and election. A basic principle is that they deny the Catholic teaching that humans can achieve salvation through their actions. The protestant part of this reformation was considering that the Bible be interpreted by itself, meaning the parts that are harder to understand are examined in the light of other passages where the Bible is more explicit on the matter. The term Calvinism can be misleading, because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse, {{with a wide range of}} influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it referring to French reformer John Calvin, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed.|$|E

500|$|By 1534, Bucer was a {{key figure}} in the German Reformation. He {{repeatedly}} led initiatives to secure doctrinal agreement between Wittenberg, the south German cities, and Switzerland. In December 1534, Bucer and Melanchthon held productive talks in Kassel, and Bucer then drafted ten theses that the Wittenberg theologians accepted. [...] In October 1535, Luther suggested a meeting in Eisenach to conclude a full agreement among the Protestant factions. Bucer persuaded the south Germans to attend, but the Swiss, led by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger, were skeptical of his intentions. Instead they met in Basel on 1 February 1536 to draft their own confession of faith. Bucer and Capito attended and urged the Swiss to adopt a compromise wording on the eucharist that would not offend the Lutherans. The true <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> was acknowledged while a natural or local union between Christ and the elements was denied. [...] The result was the First Helvetic Confession, the success of which raised Bucer's hopes for the upcoming meeting with Luther.|$|E
500|$|The {{main issue}} for Zwingli is that Luther puts [...] "the chief point of {{salvation}} in the bodily eating {{of the body}} of Christ". Luther saw the action as strengthening faith and remitting sins. This, however, conflicted with Zwingli's view of faith. The bodily <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> could not produce faith as faith is from God, for those whom God has chosen. Zwingli also appealed to several passages of scripture with John 6:63 in particular. He saw Luther's view as denying Christ's humanity and asserted that Christ's body is only at one place and that is at the right hand of God. The Marburg Colloquy did not produce anything new in the debate between the two reformers. Neither changed his position, but it did produce some further developments in Zwingli's views. For example, he noted that the bread was not mere bread and affirmed terms such as [...] "presence", [...] "true", and [...] "sacramental". However, it was Zwingli's and Luther's differences in their understanding of faith, their Christology, their approach and use of scripture that ultimately made any agreement impossible.|$|E

50|$|The real <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ's</b> true {{body and}} blood in the Lord's Supper was a {{controversial}} issue {{at the time of}} Luther. The Sacramentarians Andreas Karlstadt, Valentine Krautwald, Caspar Schwenckfeld, Huldrych Zwingli, and Johannes Oecolampadius were open combatants against Luther on this topic. Martin Bucer, while translating Johannes Bugenhagen's commentary on the Psalms, fraudulently replaced Bugenhagen's statements on the Lord's Supper with commentary aligning with Zwingli's views. Since this work included forewords from both Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, it gave the appearance that the Wittenberg faculty agreed with Zwingli. Later, Bucer, in the middle of translating Luther's sermons for publication, inserted his own comments rebutting Luther's teaching on the sacrament into the published book. Inspired by Bucer's tactics, Leo Jud put forth an essay in Zürich claiming that Luther agreed with the Swiss understanding of the Lord's Supper.|$|R
500|$|The tuft {{of grass}} {{sprouting}} from the roof's central truss above the figures conveys multiple meanings. Although the shrub is naturally rendered, Christus almost certainly placed it there for its symbolic value; its positioning suggests he followed {{a program of}} disguised iconography. The most obvious meaning is of new life and new beginnings. On a secular level, the shrub may have indicated Christus's membership in the Confraternity of the Dry Tree, which he joined sometime around 1462–63. [...] The confraternity was prestigious, including among its ranks Burgundian nobility, such as Philip the Good and his wife Isabella, wealthy foreign merchants and members from Bruges's upper classes. The tuft of grass also symbolizes the tree of life, and Upton theorizes that by placing it there, Christus [...] "has given expression to the legend" [...] of Adam's third son, Seth, whose quest for a branch was a popular legend in the medieval period. Furthermore, alludes to Moses and the burning bush. According to Upton, in Christus's Nativity Joseph assumes Moses's role of protector and law-bringer; just as Joseph has removed his pattens in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> Moses removed his shoes {{in the presence of}} the bush.|$|E
500|$|In March 1526, Bucer {{published}} Apologia, {{defending his}} views.

Bucer stated that his and Zwingli's interpretation on the eucharist was the correct one, but while he considered the Wittenberg theologians to be in error, he accepted them as brethren as they agreed on the fundamentals of faith. He also published two translations of works by Luther and Johannes Bugenhagen, interpolating his own interpretation of the Lord's Supper into the text. This outraged the Wittenberg theologians and damaged their relations with Bucer. [...] In 1528, when Luther published , detailing Luther's concept of the sacramental union, Bucer responded with a treatise of his own, [...] It {{took the form of}} a dialogue between two merchants, one from Nuremberg who supported Luther and the other from Strasbourg who supported Bucer, with the latter winning over his opponent. Bucer noted that as Luther had rejected impanation, the idea that Christ was [...] "made into bread", there was no disagreement between Luther and Zwingli; both believed in a spiritual <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in the eucharist.

It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught).
