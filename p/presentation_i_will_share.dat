40|$|Libraries {{have jumped}} on the User Experience {{bandwagon}} of late, rethinking our tools and services with a new focus on patron needs. But we still see things differently than our patrons. Where we see discrete services supporting our larger mission, patrons only see a confusing website. Where we test the usability of a single tool or service, patrons interact with multiple tools and services during one transaction. Without a holistic view of the entire user experience, we spend our time solving the wrong problems. In this <b>presentation,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>share</b> our experiences at Grand Valley State University where we worked to break down “data silos” and improve our patrons’ overall experience.

40|$|Thank you for {{inviting}} me to address this most important conference on restorative justice. Preparing this presentation has motivated me {{to learn more about}} the topic as well as to become knowledgeable of ways the principles of restorative justice are being adapted and implemented throughout the world, and often by Roman Catholics, lay women and men, women and men in religious life and the ordained in the Church, deacons, priests and bishops. Much of the preparation involved e-mailings, telephone interviews and pouring over much literature on the subject. Some of my sources told me outright, “You won’t find much that the Church teaches on this. ” While the Church may not explicitly teach much on restorative justice, when it has spoken, it has been clear and forceful, such as the United States Bishops ’ statement, Responsibility, Rehabilitation, and Restoration, A Catholic Perspective on Crime and Criminal Justice, approved by the full body of bishops at the Fall Assembly, November, 2000.

40|$|This {{talk was}} {{presented}} as part of Breakout Session 3 | Panel 3 : "Multi-literacies in the FYW Classroom. " These are the handouts from the talk. One {{of the biggest challenges}} I face in my ENG 100 classes is engaging students.  In the past, no matter how hard I worked to choose current, real-world, Hawaii-relevant topics, most of my efforts fell short. These problems appeared to be compounded {{with the advent of the}} UHCC acceleration mandate, as more first-year composition students would be entering our classes with weaker reading and writing skills. Last Fall, inspired by a unit from the Baltimore CC ALP program shared with me by Windward CC’s Jenny Webster, I tried teaching first-year composition by creating a theme-based unit comprised of a diverse collection of instructor-selected texts, from classic peer-reviewed articles to rap poetry, all centered around one or more guiding questions.  Not only did this method interest students, it increased students’ opportunities to write from sources from semester start, practice critical reading comprehension skills, and practice writing skills in low-stakes ways; modeled real-world research and non-genre-specific response; eliminated textbook cost; and engaged students in such a way that many [...] including ALP students [...] chose to rise to the challenge.  In this <b>presentation,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>share</b> my experience building a successful theme-based unit to inspire students to persist and succeed...|$|E

40|$|This journal suppl. entitled: 22 nd International Conference on Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Melbourne, AustraliaOrthognathic Surgery is {{a common}} {{procedure}} for the correction of dentofacial deformity. It {{may be associated with}} significant blood loss especially in bimaxillary osteotomies with segmentalization. Different haemostatic measures have been advocated including the use of hypotensive anaesthesia and haemostastic agents such as aprotinin, desmopressin, Yunnan baiyao. Tranexamic acid (TA) is a lysine analogue which acts as a clot stabilizer. It has been marketed for decades and it is an affordable drug. Several clinical trials were carried out in the last decade and showed preoperative intravenous bolus of TA could significantly reduce blood loss in orthognathic surgery. Two studies even tried to use TA topically during bimaxillary osteotomy. We performed a randomized controlled trial with 61 patients from 2005 to 2008 and demonstrated a 30 % reduction of mean blood loss in patients receiving a single preoperative bolus of TA with standard hypotensive anaesthesia during bimaxillary osteotomy. No adverse event or complication related to the use of TA was found. Although it appeared that TA was cost effective in reducing blood loss in orthognathic surgery, the studies available in the literature were based on small sample size. In the <b>presentation,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>share</b> and discuss our experience of using TA in orthognathic surgery.

40|$|Although {{the road}} to {{becoming}} a scientist is often riddled with many hurdles, the rewards of self-discovery and potential to revolutionize the world, are priceless. It is said that a PhD is pursued {{by those who are}} driven to do something original and those who are have the passion to discover the unknown; but also those that have dedication, persistence and resilience. My journey began at the intersection of College Ave and SW 30 th St back in 2004. As with many other Biology majors, I was unsure where my career path should lead to, but I knew it had to center around science. The turning point came in 2005, when I was challenged by an outstanding professor and mentor in Dr. Emily Schmitt to present a poster at the NSU Undergraduate Research Symposium. It served to awaken my appetite and passion for acquiring knowledge. Today I am a post-doctoral fellow in the Dermatology department of University of Miami Miller School of Medicine trying to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying wound healing and I am also an adjunct professor in the Halmos College of Natural Sciences. But on my road to acquiring a PhD, I’ve learned that a PhD is one of the toughest things to accomplish in the world (in educational terms); it is intellectually challenging, emotionally taxing and physically tiring.

I examine how Angelou’s focus on the singing body allows a critical re-imagining of black female embodiment in which {{the body and the}} mind are interconnected. I contend that the singing body is itself, as Spillers suggests, a form of writing— a “hieroglyphic” that speaks as much to the experience of black female being as the literary text. In this <b>presentation,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>share</b> selected recordings of Maya Angelou’s own singing to consider questions such as: What does it mean to consider music as an archive in Angelou’s work? Specifically, what does the singing body mean for a construction of black female identity or black feminist identity? In addition to exploring challenges of the process itself and what they reveal about our values and assumptions as scholars, I will examine the significance of re- thinking the boundary lines of the body (lived experience) and voice (the expression of the mind) and what lies at the intersection. In particular, I am interested in questioning what remains troubling about the mind/soul or body/spirit connection in the re-telling of one’s life and what it proffers to discussions about gender. I argue that the singing body in Angelou’s writing disrupts normalized narratives of black female subjectivity and internalizes a discussion of boundary and dislocation within the black female body...|$|E

40|$|Art {{historians of}} Byzantine manuscripts have {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} textual criticism for more than eighty-five years, but how often, in fact, do texts and their figural and non-figural decoration travel together? Specifically, if one examines the Greek texts of Gospel manuscripts that art historians have linked through their ornament and/or figural illustrations, what is the likelihood that their texts will have been associated by New Testament text critics? The answer is similar to those disclaimers that one finds in the fine print of a cosmetic advertisement: individual results may vary. In my experience, {{there is no way}} to anticipate if Byzantine Gospel manuscripts featuring similar figural or non-figural decoration will have related texts. The good news is that New Testament text critics have taken full advantage of new technologies so that the research is less tedious and the results more accurate than even a few years ago. The data generated by New Testament text critics will often lead the art historian down surprising paths, shedding light on relationships among manuscripts that are often counterintuitive. In this <b>presentation</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>share</b> the results of my forays into the field of New Testament text criticism.

The first assignment that I offer to students in ENG 100 begins to address each of the FYW Hallmarks. It {{is an exercise in}} writing to discover a research topic. Students respond to, by engaging with a topic of their choosing in, a text assigned to the entire class. The text is meant to provide students with material from which to brainstorm topics for their larger research projects, but also to provide them with “shared ground” for those topics so that they can respond to, in a shared discourse, each other’s work. The assignment challenges students to negotiate an approach to writing that they are generally not used to – formal, exploratory writing. Effective negotiation is only possible via attentiveness to audience and purpose. As such, the assignment addresses and unites the parts of the first hallmark. The students are given feedback on drafts of the paper by me and the class, with an eye to the paper, itself, as well as in anticipation of the research process (all of which addresses the second hallmark). As a formal writing assignment, they are working on the third hallmark, and by engaging specifically with the shared text in order to “inspire” and guide the exploration, the assignment begins to address the last two hallmarks. For this <b>presentation,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>share</b> copies of the assignment, explain how it is situated within the course goals (including the hallmarks), as well as within my pedagogy, and comment on the strengths and problems with the assignment...|$|E

40|$|Inter-disciplinary collaborations collaboration, {{theoretical}} lenses, inter-disciplinary Introduction: Early {{founders of}} occupational science such as Ann Wilcock envisioned an inter-disciplinary science however occupational scientists are predominantly occupational therapists. One way {{of developing the}} field of occupational science is to participate in inter-disciplinary research teams on research studies bringing an occupational perspective to the focus of inquiry. Indeed having a inter-disciplinary team increases the chances of the project being funded in many large research grant schemes. Intent: In this <b>presentation</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>share</b> my experience {{of being part of}} an inter-disciplinary team on a nationally funded project exploring loneliness and older people (Stanley et al, 2010). I was the only occupational therapist/ scientist on this team along with nurse researchers, sociologists and aged care administrators. The project was also conducted across two states with the chief investigator in another country and thus three different time zones. Argument: The presentation will focus on the strengths and limitations of working within an inter-disciplinary team. Whilst I anticipated that I could approach the data from an occupational perspective the data was far more occupational than I ever imagined and my team members could see that without adopting my occupational lenses. Some of the challenges of working as a team came from the different lenses that we brought to data analysis as well as the different expectations of the research process. These were resolved by keeping communication channels open and making space for robust discussions. Implications for occupational science: Recommendations from this experience for occupational scientists are to have early conversations about publications and authorship and document agreements made, as well as establishing good working relationships to enable frank, hones robust conversations when differences arise. The strength of the inter-disciplinary team comes from the contributions from multiple perspectives to build the depth of findings...|$|E
40|$|Non-Visual Laboratory Activities for Biology Ms. Deborah Fiore The {{discipline}} of biology is extremely visual; {{it relies on}} a person’s ability to observe and study the world around them. It {{is a challenge to}} teach the concepts of biology to individuals in a laboratory setting who are unable to use their sense of sight. General Principles of Biology is a very popular laboratory-based science course for many non-science majors at BSU. Each year this course enrolls approximately 1000 students. During the last 3 years there has been a consistent enrollment of visually impaired students in this course. There have been concerns that the sight-required laboratory activities were not optimal for the visually impaired and may be diminishing their overall lab experience. To address these concerns, non-sight required lab activities were pursued and piloted during the Fall 2015 semester. This session will introduce and demonstrate some of the nonvisual biology laboratory activities that were piloted. Rewarding Small Acts of Kindness and Commitment in the Classroom: What Students Say Dr. Polina Sabinin Do you give extra credit opportunities in your courses? Why? Why not?

40|$|Student {{employability}} {{has become}} a key concern of universities facing a more competitive environment in which recent graduates career destination is an important indicator in league tables. Higher education institutions are also anxious to present themselves {{at the cutting edge}} of innovation both in terms of research but also teaching, particularly in the light of the imminent introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework. The question that I would like to address in this presentation is whether these two concepts can be linked, and if so, whether this can occur in the language classroom. My believe is that language classes are a privilege space where we, the language teachers, can develop/enhance students’ employability skills and have a crucial role in raising the students’ international profile leading to increased job opportunities. Following a brief overview of language teaching and learning in the British higher education, I will discuss ways of connecting employability and innovation in the language classroom. In first instance, I will consider the concepts of innovation and employability. I will reflect on what we mean by innovation in language teaching and learning, where we stand today on the spectrum of innovative practices and if we are still moving forward in this area. Then I will ask what we mean by employability, and how it is defined by employers, specialised job sites and universities. In addition, I will consider why employability is a key factor in higher education, how it is reflected at institutional level and what is the impact from a student perspective. In an attempt to link theory to practice, I will explore how we can, as language teachers, link employability and innovative teaching.
