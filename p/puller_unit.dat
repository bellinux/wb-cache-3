40|$|The {{incorporation}} of split mandrel coldworking into a single-station, automated wing assembly machine ad-vances the technical quality of automated production. Coldworking innovations, including the CMX process and new <b>puller</b> <b>unit</b> development, combined with new clamp-up technology, have eliminated {{the need for}} man-ual dissasembly and deburring, both costly and time consuming procedures. These advances in automation are illustrated in the de-velopment of a next-generation automated unit created for wing production of the Airbus A 340 - 600 wide-body program. This paper describes the implementation of new fastener and coldworking technology {{that led to the}} development of this automated manufacturing system...|$|E

50|$|However {{the trial}} of push and pull working here, and later on the GER Ramsey Branch, was not successful, due to the {{inability}} of the unit to handle peak passenger loading, or to deal with mixed trains. During World War I the Lower Edmonton to Cheshunt line was reopened to passenger traffic, and the push and <b>pull</b> <b>unit</b> was transferred there; {{it may be that the}} less rural character of the service was more suited to the trains.|$|R

Whether the stages are moving linear or circular depends on the type of profiles to be manufactured. The minimum radius for a linear machine with rotating stages is approx. 2 m. For smaller radii a circular movement of the mould and gripper stage is necessary.|$|R
40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} using 6 -(2 -thienyl) - 4 H-thieno[3, 2 -b]indole (TTI) and isoindigo (ID) were synthesized {{and applied}} to the polymer solar cells. TTI as electron pushing unit and ID as electron <b>pulling</b> <b>unit</b> were incorporated in the push-pull types of conjugated polymers (PTTIID, PTTIID- 3, PTTIID- 5 and PTTIID- 7). The alternating copolymer with TTI and ID units was synthesized {{in addition to the}} corresponding random copolymers. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the random copolymers showed red-shifted maximum peaks and wider full width at the half maximum (fwhm) with raising percentages of ID contents. Synthesized polymers shows deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels with increased percentage of ID as electron <b>pulling</b> <b>unit.</b> As compared to the alternating copolymer PTTIID, the random copolymer PTTIID- 7 showed higher JSC and FF values caused by the better morphology and decent hole mobility, resulting in higher PCE value. The device comprising PTTIID- 7 and PCBM (1 : 2) with chloronaphthalene (CN) additive showed a VOC of 0. 63 V, a JSC of 12. 3 mA/cm 2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0. 52, giving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4. 03 %. clos...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} new {{conjugated}} polymers using dihydroindeno[2, 1 -a]indene moiety (ININE), electron-pushing unit with high planarity, for the organic solar cells (OSCs). Pull-push mode of conjugated polymers, P 1 and P 2, containing electron <b>pulling</b> <b>unit</b> of N-alkyl- 2, 2 ′-bithiophene- 3, 3 ′-dicarboximide (BTI) and electron-pushing unit of ININE were synthesized for the broader absorption {{of the solar}} radiation. By incorporation of electron <b>pulling</b> and pushing <b>units</b> using Stille polymerization with catalyst of Pd(0), the polymers were synthesized. Absorption peaks of the thin films of P 2, with thiophene unit linking the electron-pulling and pushing units, was shifted to the region of longer wavelength than P 1.

40|$|International audienceTransfers of photoexcited {{electrons}} between poly(thieno[3, 4 -c]pyrrole- 4, 6 -dione) -based copolymers (push-pull type) and fullerene or nanocrystals {{were studied}} by light-induced {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR). EPR tracing methodology has been used: EPR signatures of the various species {{taking part in the}} electron-transfer processes were determined and used to monitor potential charge transfers in the studied composites. The EPR tracing method combined with DFT calculations revealed that excited electrons are not only promoted from the HOMO of the polymer but also from its HOMO - 1 and even HOMO - 2, which are either exclusively centered on the push moiety or delocalized over both the push and <b>pull</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} game. Although the game is very competitive, {{it is not a}} good {{simulation}} of the campaign. The exploitation of breakthroughs by mechanized forces is absent as the opponent moves directly after combat, allowing him a chance to plug any holes in the line, and <b>pull</b> <b>units</b> out of threatened positions. A component of blitzkrieg warfare, tactical air power, is missing from the game. The time frame of Stalingrad covers parts of three years. During that time, the organization and order of battle of both armies changed significantly, but the game does not reflect any changes. In the numerous eastern front games that have followed after Stalingrad, game designers have addressed these and other issues of realism and playability.|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the unfolding pathway of proteins on the pulling speed is investigated. This is done by introducing a simple one-dimensional chain comprising $N$ units, with different characteristic bistable free energies. These units represent either each of the modules in a modular protein or each of the intermediate "unfoldons" in a protein domain, which can be either folded or unfolded. The system is pulled by applying a force to the last unit of the chain, and the units unravel following a preferred sequence. We show that the unfolding sequence strongly depends on the pulling velocity $v_{p}$. In the simplest situation, there appears a critical pulling speed $v_{c}$: for pulling speeds $v_{p} v_{c}$ it is the <b>pulled</b> <b>unit</b> that unfolds first. By means of a perturbative expansion, we find quite an accurate expression for this critical velocity. Comment: accepted for publication in JSTA...|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} years {{following}} nationalisation, services on the Norfolk & Suffolk line were busy on summer Saturdays but less patronised at other times when a single push and <b>pull</b> <b>unit</b> hauled by a GER Class M15 or a GER Class G69 sufficed. Reliance on summer traffic was not enough and when British Railways started making losses from 1952 onwards, attention was turned to pruning the network by closing unremunerative lines. Thus in 1953 when major repairs to Breydon Viaduct were required, {{it was decided that}} Lowestoft could be adequately served during the summer season by diverted trains via Norwich Thorpe, and so the ordinary passenger and freight services were withdrawn as from 20 September. A good service nevertheless continued between Yarmouth South Town and Lowestoft, as well as a Saturdays through train from Birmingham. In May 1956, Prince Philip visited Lowestoft to open the new South Pier Pavilion and LNER Thompson Class B1 No. 61399 was used to haul the train from Wickham Market Junction.|$|R

50|$|Many special police {{units were}} active in {{responding}} to the protests of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution including the Tiger and Leopard special forces groups of the Ministry of Interior, Berkut special police force, and SBU Alpha Group. On 18 February, after months of civil unrest protests took a harsher turn storming parliament. Troops thought to be SBU Alpha were seen heavily armed and carrying AKM rifles; military jets could also be seen flying over Kiev. By February 20 there were reports of snipers appearing on rooftops. This led to perhaps the most bloody standoff of the revolution, which resulted in over 100 sniper deaths which SBU is also suspected of covering up. By February 23 police presence in Independence Square had dissipated, which was unusual as it was not part of an agreement signed by the new government. This corresponded to the disappearance of president Yanukovich. Sensing a change in power, police forces likely abandoned their post.
