50|$|There {{are several}} methods and {{approaches}} {{used to create}} customer value models. All of these approaches appear to depend on substantial customer interaction and on-site interviews and observations of customers' challenges related to the product or service being valued.

50|$|Naylor in 1971 gives quite a {{detailed}} {{view of the}} contents, structure, and operating of management games. Today, this description by Naylor is still valid {{for most of the}} business simulation games. Business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms, whose decision-makers or managers are the participants of the game. Each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash, inventories, raw materials, plant and equipment, and so forth. Before each operating period the players make decisions. Naylor mentions that these decisions can concern, e.g., price, output, advertising, marketing, raw material acquisition, changes in plant capacity, and wage rate. This information is read into a computer that has been programmed {{on the basis of a}} set of mathematical models that provide a link between the operating results and operating decisions of the individual firms, as well as the external environment (the market). On the basis of (a) a set of behavioral equations, such as demand and cost functions, and a set of accounting formulas that have been programmed into the computer, and (b) the individual decisions of each firm, operating results are generated by the computer in the form of printed reports - for example, <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> <b>statements,</b> balance sheets, production reports, sales reports, and total industry reports - at the end of each operating period. Usually the environment can be changed by the administrator of the game by altering the parameters of the operating characteristics of the game. In each case, the firms find it necessary to react according to the magnitude and the nature of the change imposed by the external environment. Naylor mentions that some of the more complicated and more realistic games even permit multiple products, plants, and marketing areas, stochastic production periods, stochastic demand, labor negotiations, and the sale of common stock.

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} {{an issue of}} the <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> <b>statement.</b> The {{theoretical}} part of the thesis describes {{the nature of the}} financial statements, the individual elements of the financial statements and after that, it focuses on the one particular <b>statement</b> which is <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> <b>statement.</b> The thesis also describes the basic building blocks of this particular statement and further specifies its appearance. The analysis is conducted in terms of Czech accounting standards and IFRS. In the analytical part of the thesis, the main focus lies on the research of the explanatory power of the <b>profit</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> <b>statement</b> in practice. It analyzes the statement from the perspective of external users. The researched companies were randomly selected and they publish their financial statements prepared in accordance with Czech accounting standards and IFRS. The main approach used in this master thesis is the financial analysis, within which are carried out the horizontal and vertical analysis, ratios calculations and all results are compared over time and also among competitors. The income statement offers really important information to the users of financial statements, but for deeper explanation users have to always look into the other financial statements, because all of them are connected together...|$|R
5000|$|Below is {{an account}} of: ‘What Consumers’ Cooperation does,’ {{excerpted from the}} May, 1934, issue of Cooperation, which {{provides}} an outline of cooperative federalist thought::Consumers' Cooperation is the Economic System necessary to match the Age of Automatic Power Production. It is a democratic economic system based on [...] "cooperation for use" [...] and not [...] "competition for profit." [...] It is the Economy of Abundance instead of Scarcity. These are some of its proven Principles and Practices—which really make [...] "life, liberty {{and the pursuit of}} happiness" [...] possible for ALL.:Consumers' Cooperation means Consumers' Ownership and Control. In as much as consumers furnish the market, which is the most essential thing in an economy of abundance, organized consumers must have the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution so that they can regulate production to their needs of consumption, can supply themselves with pure products without adulteration, and do so without competitive wastes in the processes of production and distribution.:Consumers' Cooperation is Economic Democracy. Consumers, who are everybody, become the owners. Voting is by person and not by property -- one person, one vote. Proxy voting is eliminated -— members must attend meetings and be active. Membership is open to everyone. We now have management control largely in industry, not even stockholder control. Under a cooperative system consumers control and the management executes their will.:Consumers' Cooperatives Distribute Profits Justly. So-called profits, which in cooperatives are really overcharges or savings, are paid back to the consumer-member-owners on the basis of purchases, as patronage refunds. Those who produce the profits get them in proportion to the contribution they make towards them by their purchases. John T. W. Mitchell, the great leader of the C.W.S. says, [...] "Those who pay the profits should get them back.":Consumers' Cooperation results in Security -— not Speculation. Capital is hired at the lowest cost. A minimum rate of interest is paid. There are no excessive earnings for investors so there is no watering of stock to cover them up. Stock cannot be sold at more than par value. Consumers' cooperatives require no governmental stock market security regulation because there is no speculation in cooperative stocks.:Consumers' Cooperation Increases the Income of Every Consumer-Member. A 10% patronage refund on regular retail prices means one ninth more food, goods and services.:Consumers' Cooperatives Pay Fair Salaries. They are large enough to secure trained experts for managing large scale industry, but not excessive, as under the present management control of corporation policies and payrolls.:Consumers' Cooperatives Abolish Secrecy. Whatever cannot survive in the open in a democracy is wrong. Balance Sheets. <b>Profit</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loss</b> <b>Statements</b> and every other figure and fact are open to consumer-member-owners in a cooperative. It is the business of all.:Consumers' Cooperatives Strive for Cash Business, not Credit. Credit was said by {{one of the men who}} organized the first Rochdale Cooperative in England to be [...] "The invention of the Devil." [...] The only real reasons for credit business are competition for customers and inequality in the distribution of wealth, both of which cooperation eliminates. Under Consumers' Cooperation the money you invest buys a stock of goods which is carried on hand. The cash you then pay for each purchase enables the inventory to be replenished, ready for you the next time you need it.:Consumers' Cooperation Produces Pure Food and Goods, not shoddy products nor poison for profit. There is no reason for adulteration when consumers own their own business and buy for themselves. Deception is the result of the attempt to make more private profit for a few owners. Under cooperation the truth can be told in advertising and over the counter.:Consumers' Cooperation Prevents Waste and Produces True Economy. Duplicated milk wagons, delivery trucks, and all the wastes of competitive factories and distribution systems organized as a result of the urge for private profits are eliminated under cooperation. These wasted hours of working time can be saved and used for real culture and recreation and not for fighting one another like barbarians—even though today -men use gloved hands to grab the most.:Consumers' Cooperatives Promote Peace. They are the necessary economic foundation to prevent war, which is caused by competition for markets to dispose of the surpluses that capitalism cannot distribute among the workers who produce the food and goods. Cooperatives remove the barriers to trade.:Consumers' Cooperative Ownership and Control of Industry is the Key that we must adopt to open the door of Plenty for All. It will distribute the piled up surpluses which automatic power driven machinery has produced.:Consumers' Cooperative Organization Gives the People Ownership, which Workers' Organizations do not. We have thought of ourselves as producers and organized into occupational groups. [...] "For a century and a half," [...] says Professor Fairchild, who wrote the book [...] "Profits or Prosperity," [...] "we have been trained to think of ourselves as producers instead of as consumers -- one of the most remarkable instances of inverted logic on a large scale that mankind has ever displayed." [...] Organizing as producers is, as Beatrice Webb says, organizing the servant side of our lives, while organizing as consumers is organizing as masters of our lives. George W. Russell says, that when we organize as producers and not as consumers we are like an army that gives back to the enemy all it has won at the end of each week. Organizing as producers only is [...] "fighting with one hand behind our backs." [...] Organizing as consumers into Cooperatives will give us ownership and real power. The dollar we spend is more powerful than the dollar we get.:Consumers' Cooperative Organization Gives Us Democratic Liberty with Economic Justice which Political State Organizations Do Not. Political State organizations suppress liberty.—they are compulsory. Consumers' Cooperation gives us economic democracy—it is voluntary. While we are getting economic justice we must also have democratic freedom.:Consumers' Cooperation will Complete the Struggle for Liberty and Justice for ALL. We have deceived ourselves into thinking that religious, educational and political liberty were really possible without economic liberty and justice. Now we know they are not. Consumers' Cooperation finally fulfills liberty and justice for ALL. It gives every consumer equality in the control of business. It is democracy in our economic life.|$|E
