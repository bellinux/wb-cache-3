5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more <b>proactive</b> <b>in</b> attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E

Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm.

The results of structural equation modeling analyses conducted for 138 supervisor-subordinate dyads in Korean firms supported most of the propositions of the TPB. Learning goal orientation was found to be associated with proactive behavior through attitudes toward proactive behavior. Perceived organizational support was related to proactive behavior through the intervening mechanisms of subjective norms and intention. Job autonomy predicted proactive behavior through the mediating processes of perceived behavioral control and intention.

The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time, and walked up the players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand.

40|$|Two multisource studies {{address the}} {{interactive}} effects of personal and contextual variables on employees' <b>proactive</b> behavior. <b>In</b> line with previous work, we find positive main effects of transformational leadership, role breadth self-efficacy, and job autonomy on employee proactive behavior (personal initiative in Study 1 and prosocial <b>proactive</b> behavior <b>in</b> Study 2). As expected, a 3 -way interaction qualifies these main effects: In situations of high autonomy, transformational leadership relates positively to proactive behavior for individuals high (but not low) on self-efficacy. Vice versa, in situations low on job autonomy, transformational leadership relates positively to proactive behavior for individuals low (but not high) on self-efficacy. This pattern is found both for self-ratings and peer-ratings of employees' <b>proactive</b> behavior <b>in</b> Study 1 and for supervisor ratings of such behavior in Study 2.

500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to {{this form of}} custody arrangement. One main benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents are legal equals, which means that both parents influence important decisions in the child's upbringing, which leads to less animosity and negativity between the parents, along with encouraging both parents to be <b>proactive</b> <b>in</b> the child's upbringing. A second benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents exhibit a feeling of well being knowing they are working together in making decisions based on what their child's/children's needs are. This form of joint custody enables parents to focus solely on the children, {{with the emphasis on}} {{the health and well-being of}} the child/children. [...] By doing so, this has the potential to reverse some of the emotional effects on the children in the long-run. [...] Another benefit of joint legal custody is that it fosters an environment in which the parents of the child have some form of a means of communication in which open dialogue can lead to ensuring a safe, nurturing environment for the child.|$|E

Robert Weissman, the director for Commercial Alert, stated that based on AMC's website, [...] "it appears that the sponsorship arrangement will violate numerous provisions of the industry's self-regulatory marketing code." [...] He continued: [...] "There {{is no reason why}} a company should be able to escape normal enforcement and implementation of the Code simply because it chooses to violate the code in such brazen manner that curing the violation would cause non-trivial complications for a major television series." [...] In association with the complaint, Weissman urged in his letter that the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States become more <b>proactive</b> <b>in</b> regulating the distilleries' initiatives in the entertainment industry. [...] "Our complaint in this instance is not with the portrayal of heavy alcohol consumption, or even with the glorification of such heavy consumption; it is specific to industry sponsorship of and entwinement with such portrayals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this article}} was to examine, whether middle-aged and older adults spontaneously engage <b>in</b> <b>proactive</b> coping to prevent future {{problems}} associated with ageing and whether differences <b>in</b> <b>proactive</b> coping were associated with socio-economic status (SES). METHODS: As part of the cross-sectional Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP- 2, 2001), a representative sample of 3189 adults aged 50 - 70 years filled in a questionnaire measuring <b>proactive</b> coping. <b>In</b> addition, data were collected regarding the three main components of SES, namely educational level, income and occupational status, as well as participants' health status. RESULTS: We found that higher SES, especially with respect to income and education, was positively associated with proactive coping. This relationship was not moderated, but was partially mediated by physical health problems. CONCLUSION: People with higher income and higher educational level used more <b>proactive</b> coping strategies <b>in</b> their daily life to offset potential problems associated with ageing. Physical health status partially explained the SES-differences <b>in</b> <b>proactive</b> coping. It seems that people with lower SES undertake less future-oriented activities {{as a result of the}} fact that present health problems require attention and drain resources. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
