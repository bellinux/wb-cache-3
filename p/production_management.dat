5|$|Management in all {{business}} and organizational activities is {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource management, operations management (or <b>production</b> <b>management),</b> strategic management, marketing management, financial management, and information technology management, which was responsible for management information systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches marketing management, operations management, and strategic management.|$|E

500|$|FuseFX {{serves as}} the lead visual effects vendor for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., with {{additional}} work by Pixomondo, Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic. The series sees an average of 80 to 150 visual effects shots per episodes, with 10 to 12 days {{to work on the}} effects for one episode once background plates have been received from filming. This equates to approximately 2000 visual effects shots per season. [...] Mark Kolpack serves as visual effects supervisor for the series. David Altenau was the in-house supervisor at FuseFX for [...] "Pilot" [...] through episode eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for subsequent episodes. VFX producer Andrea D'Amico joined the team at FuseFX to work on the series in December 2015. Two separate <b>production</b> <b>management</b> and creative teams were established to work on the show, and producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time. Typical effects for the series include the creation of character-driving effects animation, photo-realistic vehicles, CG set extensions, pyrotechnics, and atmospheric effects. Some assets, such as a Quinjet and Helicarrier, are shared from Industrial Light & Magic, though [...] "those models are generally super heavy and dense with data" [...] and need to be made [...] "HD friendly or simply manageable to work in [...] TV schedule." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a <b>production</b> <b>management</b> company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra peeking out from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd, giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
