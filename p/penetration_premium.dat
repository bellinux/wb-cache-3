40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore factors {{potentially}} affecting the size of Albanian insurance market, over the period 1999 to 2009. The results of co- integration regression show that GDP and fraction urban population, both one lagged value, size of population and paid claims, both at contemporary value, have significant positive effect on aggregate insurance premium in Albania while the market share of the largest company in the insurance market, one lagged value, has significant negative effect on aggregate insurance premiums. Granger causality test shows statistically significance contribution of GDP growth to insurance premium growth, GDP drives insurance premium growth but not vice versa. The Albanian insurance market is under development, indicators as: insurance <b>penetration,</b> <b>premium</b> per capita, ect are still at low level and this can justify the insignificant role of the insurance in the econom...|$|E

25|$|Advanced economies {{account for}} the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most {{important}} region in 2010, followed by North America $1.409 trillion and Asia $1.161 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace. The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China. According to Sam Radwan of ENHANCE International LLC, low <b>premium</b> <b>penetration</b> (insurance <b>premium</b> as a % of GDP), an ageing population and the largest car market in terms of new sales, premium growth has averaged 15–20% in the past five years, and China {{is expected to be the}} largest insurance market in the next decade or two.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of {{insurance}} and economic growth, with empirical analysis for the Republic of Macedonia. We apply multiple regression and control for other relevant determinants of economic growth. The analysis used data for the period 1995 - 2010. In order to solve the model in the analysis will use the technique of least squares, followed by analysis of variability in order to identify the effects of each variable. Insurance development is measured by insurance <b>penetration</b> (insurance <b>premiums</b> in percentage of GDP). We used three different insurance variables - life insurance, non-life insurance and total insurance penetration. According to our findings, insurance sector development positively and significantly affects economic growth. The results are confirmed in terms of non-life insurance, and, total insurance, while the results show that life insurance negatively affect economic growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of labelling has been considerably increasing over recent years. This study analyses two main topics. The first one (chapters 1 and 2) regards Private Labels (PLs), {{while the second}} concerns Geographical Indications (GIs) and “Made-in” power (Chapter 3). Private Labels make up a significant share of market and have a wide offering, {{both in terms of}} different segments and number of products within each segment. PLs represent a strategic tool in the power balance between manufacturers and retailers. The relations between mass retail chains and suppliers/manufacturers are quite complex and involve economic, managerial and competition based issues. Among several strategies, we identify promotion as a crucial one. Promotional strategies have been changing over the last decade. Our study highlights the existence of a new defensive and supporting strategy. It can be considered a defensive strategy as its main task is to maintain the market share of PLs against NBs, while it can also be regarded as supporting in nature because it supports the introduction and <b>penetration</b> of <b>premium</b> (or organic) PLs, since directly promoting premium PLs using an offensive promotion strategy would lead to undesirable effects in terms of product perception and consumer behaviour. To test our hypothesis and reach our conclusion we perform several empirical analyses on a unique dataset provided by a leading retailer with stores in central Italy. Geographical Indications and “Made-in” labels constitute a valuable resource for companies and, more in general, countries and industries that have distinctive features in terms of quality, knowledge, traditions and excellence. Developing a mixed-method approach, the third chapter analyses GIs and “Made-in” power, initially through quantitative analyses on global trade and the behaviour of major countries. Then it individuates, through a proposed replicable method, the anomalies and the existence of a possible kind of arbitrage from companies of countries with high “Made-in” power and a favourable Export-Import price differential. In the second part of our study, we focus our attention on an analysis of Italy (a major hub in worldwide trade, with a significant “Made-in” power) and on a specific case study (i. e. the Fungo di Borgotaro IGP). For their special characteristics, which fit perfectly with the aim of our research (i. e. perishability and absence of significant value added), we chose two types of edible wild mushrooms and truffles (i. e. fresh/frozen and fried/powdered) to perform our analyses and to examine a focus country and an example of a GI (i. e. Fungo di Borgotaro IGP) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{insurance}} industry {{can play a}} material role in decreasing the vulnerability of developing countries and economies in transition to weather-related natural disasters while simultaneously supporting both its own market-based objectives and the objectives of sustainable development. Although insurance is not a "silver bullet" for the problems posed by natural disasters in emerging markets, public-private partnerships can enhance insurance's ability to spread the risks and manage the costs of weather-related disasters {{as well as to}} increase the pool of people who have access to coverage. (For simplicity in this report, the phrase "emerging markets" is intended to encompass developing countries and economies in transition.) Promising strategies for emerging markets involve establishing innovative products and systems for delivering insurance and using technologies and practices that both reduce vulnerability to disaster-related insurance losses and support sustainable development (including reducing greenhouse gas emissions). These strategies can enhance sustainable development efforts and increase the insurability of risks, making insurance markets in emerging markets more viable. Emerging markets are especially vulnerable to extreme weather events, which impede development by causing physical damage, compromising human and ecosystem health, diverting scarce resources to disaster relief and recovery, and deterring future investment and insurance availability by amplifying the risks faced by foreign interests. An average of 300 million people are affected or killed each year by weather-related disasters in emerging markets. Characteristics of emerging markets contributing to their particular vulnerability in contrast to developed nations include: greater frequency of poverty; weaker lifelines (transportation, communication, utilities, emergency response, and hospitals); poorer quality of construction and absence of or deficiencies in building codes and other regulations; and high dependence on resource-based industries (e. g., agriculture). Natural disasters such as drought often dislocate large groups of people, amplifying their vulnerability to future disasters. Development itself can compound these vulnerabilities by promoting population growth, urbanization, intensive coastal development, and concentrations of climate-sensitive physical and health-related hazards. With its pool of financial reserves, the global insurance market provides considerable adaptive capacity for weather-related damage to property, life, and health. The global insurance market [...] perhaps the world's largest industry [...] represented $ 2. 9 trillion in premiums in 2003, or approximately eight percent of global gross domestic product (GDP). To put this in perspective, the {{insurance industry}} s revenues make it equivalent to the third largest country in {{the world in terms of}} GDP. In 2003, total premiums in emerging markets represented $ 314 billion (up from $ 270 billion just a year earlier) or 11 percent of the global total, with growth rates often dramatically higher than those in the industrial world (twice as high, on average, between 1980 and 2000) and often exceeding GDP growth rates. Emerging markets are poised to represent half of world insurance premiums by the middle of this century. Insurance premiums are rising in part because the economic costs of natural disasters are growing, as is the insured share (up from a negligible level in the 1950 s to approximately 20 percent of the total today). Insurance market conditions vary regionally. Current insurance <b>penetration</b> (<b>premiums</b> per GDP) is lowest in Africa and Asia and highest in Latin America. Premiums as a percent of GDP are lowest in the Middle East/Central Asia and Latin America and highest in Africa. The smallest market by total premiums is the Middle East/Central Asia, and the largest is South and East Asia (excluding Japan). The economic costs of weather-related events are high, totaling $ 1 trillion worldwide from 1980 through 2003. During this period, insurance covered four percent of total costs of weather-related disasters in emerging markets compared to 40 percent in high-income countries. While relatively small, insurance payments to people in emerging markets associated with these losses were three-times the magnitude of international aid. The potential for changes in weather patterns, including both average conditions and extreme events, would likely raise the demand for insurance whether the changes are a result natural variability or human-induced climate change. At the same time, increases in weather-related damage create uncertainties and challenge insurers ability and willingness to assume or affordably price these new risks. Sustainable development can contribute to managing and maintaining the insurability of these risks and thereby reduce the need for individuals and governments to absorb the costs. Because of the multi-national structure of the insurance and reinsurance markets, and other factors, the economic consequences of extreme weather events are becoming increasingly globalized. The growth of foreign insurers premiums in emerging markets averaged more than 20 percent per year through the 1990 s. During the late 1990 s, the U. S. alone was collecting approximately $ 40 billion in premiums each year for policies placed in other countries. This globalization of the risks and consequences of natural disasters is a significant reason for the insurance industry to seek to reduce the risks of claims worldwide. Cost-effectively mitigating the damage from (and thus the costs of) natural disasters would be a boon not only to the insurance industry and developed nations but to public health and sustainable development in emerging markets. One of many strategies is curtailing deforestation, which reduces risks of wildfire, malaria, mudslides, and flooding as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable energy technologies can also mitigate risk; for example, distributed power systems coupled with efficient energy end-use technologies reduce business interruptions resulting from damage to the power grid. In sum, involving the insurers of extreme weather events in the development and execution of strategies that contribute to public health and sustainable development would enhance disaster resilience, reduce the magnitude of losses, and thus help increase insurers' willingness to establish, maintain, and expand a constructive presence in emerging markets...|$|R
40|$|The Health Insurance Authority (the Authority) {{commissioned}} Amárach Consulting {{to conduct}} a comprehensive research study of the private health insurance (PHI) market in Ireland. The overall research objectives were defined by the Authority as follows: Assess propensity to switch health insurers for different categories of consumer (particularly by age) Discover and understand reasons for switching between insurers Discover and understand reasons for taking out/discontinuing private health insurance cover Gauge likelihood of discontinuation e. g. due to premium rises Assess attitudes towards and knowledge/perceptions of the PHI market. A qualitative and quantitative research programme was undertaken. The quantitative element, which involved face-to-face interviews with a nationally representative sample of 1, 001 Irish adults forms {{the bulk of the}} research programme. As a pre-cursor to the quantitative stage, a smaller qualitative study was undertaken. Qualitative Phase The research objectives of the qualitative phase as defined by the Authority were as follows: Discover and understand reasons for switching between private health insurers Discover and understand reasons for taking up/discontinuing cover Gauge likely effect on <b>penetration</b> of <b>premium</b> rises Gauge likely effect on non-consumers of the introduction of late entry loadings Assess attitudes towards and knowledge/perceptions of the PHI market among consumers/non-consumers Identify consumers’ issues Provide guidance for formulation of quantitative study questionnaire. As part of the qualitative research programme seven focus groups and four in-depth interviews were conducted in Dublin and Cork in the weeks beginning the 4 th and 11 th of November 2002. Quantitative Phase Research objectives as defined by the Authority specific to the quantitative research programme were as follows: Assess propensity to switch insurers for different categories of consumers Assess propensity to have cover for different categories of persons Gauge likelihood of discontinuation e. g. due to premium rises Assess attitudes towards and knowledge/perceptions of market, consumers’ rights, etc. Differentiate behaviour, attitudes and knowledge by type of consumer Gain robust evidence for informing future policy decisions. In order to deliver on these objectives Amárach conducted a face-to-face survey with a sample of 1, 001 Irish adults aged 18 +. Interlocking quota controls were set in terms of age, gender, marital status, region and social class. Corrective weightings were subsequently applied to age, gender, marital status region and social class to ensure the sample was nationally representative. These findings were then weighted up to the forecasted total number of adults aged 18 + living in the Republic of Ireland in the year 2002 (an estimated 2. 884 million people {{according to the most recent}} 1 March 2003 CSO figures). The fieldwork was conducted between the 22 nd of November and the 20 th of December 2002. Surveys were conducted in respondents’ own homes, at over 100 locations throughout the Republic of Ireland.
