5|$|The {{production}} {{staff at}} the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, <b>props</b> and <b>draws</b> character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, ink and paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox {{three to four months}} later.|$|R
25|$|Unlike its predecessors, {{which used}} an engine based on 2D {{isometric}} graphics and sprites, SimCity 4 primarily uses a 3D engine to render its graphics. The landscape and moving props such as vehicles are modeled as fully polygonal and rotatable 3D objects. Small buildings and <b>props</b> are <b>drawn</b> as flat images, which are pasted onto billboards; polygons with their surface normal facing into the camera. Larger buildings are modeled using a hybrid approach; a simple polygonal model defines {{the shape of}} the building, then textures are added to create detail such as doors, windows and rooftop clutter.|$|R
50|$|After {{serving in}} the U.S. Navy, he went into radio and television, {{including}} a position as art director for The Johnny Cash Show, creating scenery and writing cue cards. In the early 1960s he also worked as an artist in WBTV’s (the CBS-affiliated television station in Charlotte, North Carolina) graphics department, where he would design sets and <b>props,</b> and <b>draw</b> images on the weather maps. He also would act on occasion, and wrote and voiced episodes of The Yellowjacket, a regular five-minute drive-time radio segment on WBT-FM influenced by the Batman show. Scancarelli had a successful career as a freelance magazine illustrator, and he did slide transparency art until computers made that job obsolete.|$|R

6000|$|CRAMPTON (his eyes shining hardly as he <b>props</b> his <b>drawn,</b> miserable face on his hands). Home! Home!! (He {{drops his}} {{arms on the}} table and bows his head on them, but {{presently}} hears someone approaching and hastily sits bolt upright. It is Gloria, who has come up the steps alone, with her sunshade and her book in her hands. He looks defiantly at her, with the brutal obstinacy of his mouth and the wistfulness of his eyes contradicting each other pathetically. She comes to the corner of the garden seat and stands with her back to it, leaning against the end of it, and looking down at him as if wondering at his weakness: too curious about him to be cold, but supremely indifferent to their kinship.) Well? ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1986 NPR interview, Diller {{said she}} had no idea what she was doing when she started playing clubs and in the {{beginning}} she never saw another woman on the comedy circuit. With no female role models in a male-dominated industry, she initially used <b>props</b> and <b>drew</b> from her educational and work background as a basis for satire, spoofing classical music concerts and advice columns. She wrote her own material and kept a file cabinet full of her gags, honing her nightclub act. Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, and Jonathan Winters were early influences, but Diller developed a singular comedic persona — a surreal version of femininity. This absurd caricature with garish baggy dresses and gigantic, clownish hair made fun of her lack of sex appeal while brandishing a cigarette holder (with a wooden cigarette because she didn't smoke), punctuating the humor with a hearty cackle to show she was in on the joke. At the time, Diller said, [...] "They had no idea what I was. It was like—'Get a stick and kill it before it multiplies!'" ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} DressUp, {{a computerized}} system for designing dresses with 3 D input using {{the form of}} the human body as a guide. It consists of a body-sized physical mannequin, a screen, and tangible <b>prop</b> tools for <b>drawing</b> in 3 D on and around the mannequin. As the user draws, he/she modifies or creates pieces of digital cloth, which are displayed on a model of the mannequin on the screen. We explore the capacity of our 3 D input tools to create a variety of dresses. We also describe observations gained from users designing actual physical garments with the system.

50|$|Muto was {{a classmate}} of Adventure Time creator Pendleton Ward at CalArts. When Ward was first {{working on the}} Adventure Time pilot for the Frederator {{incubator}} series Random! Cartoons, Muto assisted him by <b>drawing</b> <b>props.</b> Eventually, Muto went on {{to work on the}} television series, serving as a storyboard artist. During the show's first season, he was partnered with Elizabeth Ito, but during the show's second and third seasons, he was partnered with Rebecca Sugar. During the following year, he was promoted to creative director, and midway through the show's fifth season, he was promoted to supervising producer, then co-executive producer. He currently serves as the show's showrunner and executive producer, following Ward's stepping down sometime during the production of season five.|$|R
40|$|The {{events that}} have transpired {{in the wake of}} the passage of Prop 8 have raised several {{important}} questions that could shed light not only on the current circumstances in California but also on social psychological theory about intersecting social identities (for example, being gay and Black) and social judgments. Ghavami has recently begun a line comprised of three studies. Study 1, Comparing Sexual and Ethnic Minority Perspectives on Same-Sex Marriage, examines how “naive realism” (Robinson et al., 1995) led opponents of <b>Prop</b> 8 to <b>draw</b> erroneous inferences about the rationale underlying the votes cast by the Black voters, thereby fueling hatred and hostility. Study 2 investigates how the events surrounding the passage of Prop 8 have affected Black gay men and lesbians whose Black identity and gay/lesbian identity were challenged. Study 3 looks at how motivation guides an individual’s social perception and categorization of individuals with multiple identities...|$|R
5000|$|Haggar {{was born}} in Dedham, Essex, where he was apprenticed as a {{shipbuilder}} and later a watchmaker. An accomplished musician, Haggar left home {{at the age of}} eighteen and joined a troupe of travelling players, working as a stage carpenter. In 1870 he married Sarah Walton, daughter of Richard Walton proprietor of a travelling theatre. The Waltons were a well-known family of professional actors and pantomimists {{who had been in the}} entertaining business for many generations. Shortly after their marriage Haggar and Sarah set up their own company. The couple had eleven children, each born in a different county of England and Wales as their toured their show, each of their children brought up to the profession of the stage. Tragedy struck the family in 1890, when their eldest daughter, Nell, drowned in the River Wye while visiting Chepstow. In 1891 with the birth of their youngest daughter Lillian, the Haggars had eight surviving children, all of whom would later form the regular casts of his films.Moving the theatre deeper into industrial Wales, Haggar found an audience that brought him an unprecedented level of prosperity. The remote villages of Wales welcomed the travelling theatre, known as 'The Castle Theatre', which by now had a repertoire of over a hundred Victorian melodramas and comedies, to which Haggar later included a portable photographic studio having acquired a plate camera. 'The Castle Theatre', his fit-up theatre and their <b>props</b> were originally <b>drawn</b> by horseback, later he purchased a traction engine to do the job. The company travelled around mid and west Wales to the south Wales valleys, wintering in Aberdare.|$|R
