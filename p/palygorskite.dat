5|$|The testing {{showed that}} the base layer onto which the codex was painted is {{composed}} of gypsum, a material used as a base layer for paintings since antiquity. The black paint was analysed with RBS and {{found to be a}} carbon-based pigment consistent with other pre-Columbian Mexican codices. The red colour used in the codex is red ochre, an iron-based pigment. There is very little blue colouration in the Grolier Codex and the presence of the distinctive Maya Blue pigment could not be confirmed. Analysis by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) revealed the blue pigment used on the codex does not contain cobalt and does contain clay. Its elemental composition matches that of <b>palygorskite,</b> the main inorganic component of Maya Blue. However, some other materials such as lapis lazuli could not be ruled out since PIXE only identifies elements, not compounds. The investigators concluded that the codex does contain some original pre-Columbian materials but could not confirm that the document is authentic.|$|E

40|$|Near-IR {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to distinguish between <b>palygorskites</b> and sepiolites. Three near-IR spectral regions contain bands due to (a) the high frequency region between 6400 and 7400 cm− 1 attributed to the first overtone of the hydroxyl stretching mode, (b) the 4800 – 5400 cm− 1 region attributed to water combination modes and (c) the 4000 – 4800 cm− 1 region attributed to the combination of the stretching and deformation modes of the M–MgOH units of <b>palygorskites</b> and sepiolites. Near-IR bands are observed in the first region and are assigned to the first overtone of the hydroxyl stretching frequency observed at 3620 and 3410 cm− 1 in the mid-IR spectra. The near-IR bands observed in the second region are assigned to the combination of the water OH stretching and deformation vibrational modes. A complex set of low intensity bands are observed in the 4100 – 4600 cm− 1 region and are attributed to the combination of the cation hydroxyl stretching, deformation and translation modes. The difference between the near-IR spectra of <b>palygorskites</b> and sepiolites depends on the dioctahedral nature of the <b>palygorskites</b> and the trioctahedral structure of the sepiolites. Changes in the near-IR spectra are therefore related to the Mg 3 (OH) and Mg 2 (OH) units in the <b>palygorskites...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{determine}} the possible employment of three groups of phyllosilicates (two smectites, three <b>palygorskites,</b> and two sepiolites) as direct-compression tablet excipients. Compact lots of each material were obtained after application of three different compression loads and the elastic recoveries and tensile strengths of each lot were then determined. The results showed that, in comparison with laminar minerals (smectite samples), fibrous minerals (<b>palygorskites</b> and sepiolites) were found to have lower elastic recovery, regardless of the compression load. Almost all elastic recovery happened immediately after the ejection of the compacts. Then, and at least during the next 24 hr, smectite compacts maintained their dimensions without any significant variation, whereas fibrous compacts tended to continue increasing slightly their dimensions. On the other hand, compacts made with laminar particles had higher mechanical strength than those made with fibrous particles, except for one sepiolite sample in which the strength was similar. Both particle morphologies and {{the presence or absence of}} hydration water molecules were taken into account in order to explain these differences. According to the compact properties measured, at least two of the noncommercial sample...|$|R
50|$|Attapulgite clays are a {{composite}} of smectite and <b>palygorskite.</b> Smectites are expanding lattice clays, of which bentonite is a commonly known generic name for smectite clays. The <b>palygorskite</b> component is an acicular bristle-like crystalline form that does not swell or expand. Attapulgite forms gel structures in fresh and salt water by establishing a lattice structure of particles connected through hydrogen bonds.|$|E

50|$|The Maya blue pigment is a {{composite}} of organic and inorganic constituents, primarily indigo dyes derived from the leaves of añil (Indigofera suffruticosa) plants combined with <b>palygorskite,</b> a natural clay which, mysteriously, is not known to exist in abundant deposits in Mesoamerica.

50|$|<b>Palygorskite</b> or {{attapulgite}} is a magnesium aluminium phyllosilicate with formula (Mg,Al)2Si4O10(OH)·4(H2O) {{that occurs}} in a type of clay soil common to the Southeastern United States. It {{is one of the}} types of fuller's earth. Some smaller deposits of this mineral can be found in Mexico, where its use is tied to the manufacture of Maya blue in pre-Columbian times.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palygorskite</b> {{is known}} to have been a key {{constituent}} of the pigment called Maya blue, which was used notably by the pre-Columbian Maya civilization of Mesoamerica on ceramics, sculptures, murals, and (most probably) Maya textiles. The clay mineral was also used by the Maya as a curative for certain illnesses, and evidence shows it was also added to pottery temper.|$|E
50|$|Nubian {{sandstone}} exposures in sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid conditions produce {{soil that}} is red-sandy but {{very different in}} other aspects. Only in sub-humid zones do these soils contain a moderately developed profile, including a textural B horizon lacking soluble salts and carbonates. In semi-arid and arid zones, profile differentiation is either weak or does not exist. In arid zones soils are shallow and contain carbonates, and soluble salts, including gypsum. The sole clay common to all Nubian sandstone parent materials is Kaolinite, which is the major clay mineral in sub-humid zone soil. In semi-arid soils smectite is a second major clay component. In arid zones small amounts of smectite and <b>palygorskite</b> accompany kaolinite. It is likely that smectite and <b>palygorskite</b> are products of pedogenic neoformation. Aeolian material was probably introduced into the silt and fine sand fractions from semi-arid and arid soils. It {{is also possible that}} some contamination of clay fractions occurred.|$|E
5000|$|Attapulgite, {{unlike some}} {{bentonite}} (sodium rich montmorillonites can gel in sea water), forms gel structures in salt water {{and is used}} in special saltwater drilling mud for drilling formations contaminated with salt. <b>Palygorskite</b> particles {{can be considered as}} charged particles with zones of positive and negative charges. The bonding of these alternating charges allows them to form gel suspensions in salt and fresh water.|$|E
50|$|The Maya blue {{synthetic}} pigment {{was also}} manufactured in other Mesoamerican regions {{and used by}} other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Aztecs of central Mexico. The blue coloration seen on Maya and Aztec codices, and early colonial-era manuscripts and maps, is largely produced by the organic-inorganic mixture of añil leaves and <b>palygorskite,</b> with smaller amounts of other mineral additives. Human sacrificial victims in postclassic Mesoamerica were frequently daubed with this blue pigmentation.|$|E
50|$|Montmorillonite can be {{concentrated}} and transformed within cave environments. The natural weathering {{of the cave}} can leave behind concentrations of aluminosilicates which were contained within the bedrock. Montmorillonite can form slowly in solutions of aluminosilicates. High HCO3 concentrations and {{long periods of time}} can aid in its formation. Montmorillonite can then transform to <b>palygorskite</b> under dry conditions and to halloysite-10Å (endellite) in acidic conditions (pH 5 or lower). Halloysite-10Å can further transform into halloysite-7Å by drying.|$|E
5000|$|The rain dust is very alkaline. Some of {{the large}} {{particles}} contain mixtures of chemicals such as sulfate and sea salt (chiefly with sodium, chlorine and magnesium). Major minerals in order of decreasing abundance are: illite, quartz, smectite, <b>palygorskite,</b> kaolinite, calcite, dolomite and feldspars. [...] In Majorca a study finds that the size, by volume, 89% of the particles from rain dust fraction corresponded to silt (between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm) {{and that there was}} virtually no clay sized particles (less than 0.29%).|$|E
50|$|Attapulgite clays {{found in}} the Meigs-Quincy {{district}} are bundles of <b>palygorskite</b> clay particles between 2 and 3 μm long and below 3 nm in diameter. The bundles are surrounded by a matrix of smectite clays that are slightly swellable. Dry-process grades contain up to 25% nonattapulgite material {{in the form of}} carbonates and other mineral inclusions. Processing of the clays consist of drying and grinding the crude clay to specific particle size distributions with specific ranges of gel viscosity measured by a variety of means depending on the end use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{space group}} is B2/m, meaning {{that in the}} unit cell there is one {{structural}} unit at each vertex, {{and one in the}} centre of each B face. The palygorskite-sepiolite minerals are clay minerals with a layered structure. In tuperssuatsiaite ribbons of SiO4 tetrahedra, similar to those in the amphibole structure, are aligned parallel to the c crystal axis, and they link to form layers parallel to the plane containing the a and b axes. [...] The spacing between the layers, in the c direction, is about 5 Å, which is typical for minerals with an amphibole-type structure, due to the repeat distance along the chains of tetrahedra. [...] Channels occur that could be occupied by H2O as in <b>palygorskite.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Palygorskite</b> {{had large}} {{applications}} in chemical, environmental protection, medicine processes and so on. However, since the mineral limitations of natural <b>palygorskite,</b> both improving its quality and meeting {{the need of}} industry, <b>palygorskite</b> usually needs to be activated before using it. The influences of activation during the drying process were studied, {{as well as the}} drying kinetics of the non-activated of <b>palygorskite.</b> The results showed that the drying rate of <b>palygorskite</b> increased at first, and then came to a constant value, and kept that value for some time. After that, drying rate decreased with time going. Compared with drying curves of the non activated <b>palygorskite,</b> the samples made some changes after activation.
