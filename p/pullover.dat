25|$|The Camisolas Poveiras {{is part of}} the Branqueta, the {{traditional}} dress of the fishermen of Póvoa de Varzim. The Camisolas are local <b>pullovers</b> made for celebration and decorative purposes, initially used by the fishermen to protect them from the cold. These have fishery motifs and siglas poveiras, drawings related to the Nordic runes. The <b>pullovers</b> have just three colours: white, black and red, with the name embroidered in sigla and more recent examples also carry the name in the Latin alphabet. The <b>pullovers</b> were once a local dress until 1892, when a sea misfortune led the community to stop wearing it. It became popular once again {{at the end of the}} 1970s. Grace Kelly, princess of Monaco, had a Camisola Poveira and took a famous family picture using it.Today, there are some efforts to modernize it on one hand and on the other there are endeavours to preserve the long-established practices.|$|R

A similar scene occurs with the Seventh Doctor in Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E
