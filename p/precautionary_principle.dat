5|$|The {{sheer size}} and {{complexity}} of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other, more tangible closed systems. For example, he likens human existence on Earth— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the <b>precautionary</b> <b>principle</b> is a key factor in survival.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>principle,</b> which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the <b>precautionary</b> <b>principle,</b> nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E

25|$|Some {{ecological}} economists prioritise adding {{natural capital}} {{to the typical}} capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the <b>precautionary</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Transhumanists do not {{necessarily}} rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk. Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the <b>precautionary</b> <b>principle</b> are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter-productive {{as opposed to the}} technogaian current of transhumanism, which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series Connections, science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change, including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the status quo of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet's resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, clean, alternative technology, rather than fostering what it considers to be anti-scientific views and technophobia.|$|E

Their fundamental characteristics, including toxicity, persistence, ability to migrate long distances, and bioaccumulation within the food chain, are presented. The reactions of international community, especially the U. N. Stockholm Convention on POPs recently signed by 122 countries, are discussed. The future needs of substitutes to harmful chemicals and mitigation of health problems already caused are discussed as well.

40|$|Groundwater can augment total {{agricultural}} water supply {{in areas where}} rainfall is persistently low, but can also function as a buffer source of water in areas where rainfall is high but variable. In arid countries {{it is important to}} examine which of these functions dominates, as this has implications for water policy. As aquifers become depleted, the buffer function can be replaced by other local water supply schemes. However, if groundwater is mainly used to augment total water supply, the only replacement is long-distance supply schemes that may not be economically desirable. This study used Namibian farm price data to estimate implicit water values. The results are consistent with a buffer function for groundwater, but do not show conclusively that this function is more important than other functions. On <b>precautionary</b> <b>principles,</b> one should therefore assume that it will become necessary to decrease {{agricultural water}} use as aquifers become depleted. ...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{developments}} in marine biotechnology {{and the prospect}} of sea-bed mining have exposed the inadequacy of legal frameworks to regulation the exploration exploitation, and sharing of the benefits that arise from such marine endeavors. The {{fact of the matter is}} that despite the giant strides made in and the huge financial stakes involved in bioprospecting of hydro-thermal vent ecosystems, legal issues raised by profitable biotechnology development through marine scientific research (MSR) are still at an infant and underdeveloped stage. This article evaluates the extent to which the present legal order for the mining of seabed polymetallic nodules with its tangential reference to hydrothermal vent ecosystems succeeds in incorporating <b>precautionary</b> <b>principles.</b> In addition, the article queries the continued wisdom in severing the regulation of seabed mining of plymetallic nodules from the nonreguation omission of the latter from the regulatory framework of the ISA is perhaps a reflection of the limited jurisdiction conferred on the ISA by the relevant legal instruments governing the oceans. The unfortunate situation today is that there is no existing legal order, sketchy or otherwise, regulating bioprospecting of hydrothermal vent ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} phone microwave radiation can induce reversible unspecific adaptive responses {{if it is}} short and the organism is very radiosensitive. A long-term exposure (over one year) combined with the organism weakened immune system may produce a cumulative effect {{in the form of}} stress responses, various damages and, in some cases, even cancer. The ultimate result of the microwave exposure depends on the balance between induced damage and the organism reparative ability. Nevertheless, even a year of operation of a powerful base transmitting station for mobile communication reportedly resulted in a dramatic increase of cancer incidence among population living nearby. In addition, model studies in rodents unveiled a significant increase in carcinogenesis after 17 - 24 months of MW exposure both in tumor-prone and intact animals. We conclude that recent data strongly point to the need for re-elaboration of the current safety limits for non-ionizing radiation using recently obtained knowledge. We also emphasize that the everyday exposure of both occupational and general public to MW radiation should be regulated based on a <b>precautionary</b> <b>principles</b> which imply maximum restriction of excessive exposure...|$|R
40|$|Australia {{provides}} one of {{the last}} refuges globally for the sea mammal Dugong dugon, an inhabitant of the Queensland coast and other northern Australian waters. In response to declining dugong numbers, some ecologists have strongly advocated extensions of dugong protected areas in Queensland. In these areas, gill net fishing is banned. This raises the question of what is the optimal population of dugong (and similar species) and whether economic factors should play a role in its determination. Ecologists recommending extended dugong protected areas pay no attention to economic factors so their analysis is far from holistic. As discussed, economics is relevant to assessing the cost-effectiveness of alternative conservation strategies and social cost-benefit analysis can throw further light on the social dimensions of the problem, even though A. C. Pigou 2 ̆ 7 s view that welfare economics only yields partial answers should be heeded. Furthermore, even application of <b>precautionary</b> <b>principles</b> and safe minimum standards requires account to be taken of economic considerations, as recognised by amendments to the Endangered Species Act of the US. The ecologists in this dugong protection case ignore all such considerations...|$|R
