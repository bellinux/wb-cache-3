We analyse the problems arising in this process and review related work. We outline the key components of a programme of research in this area. Motivation It is increasingly being recognised that software construction de novo is {{the exception rather than the}} rule. The norm for most organisations (including defence procurement agencies, formerly the bastion of purposebuilt software) is purchase of commercial off-the-shelf "package" software. In some cases this software is modified or extended, but in most cases the user organisations accept the software "as is". There is an observable trend in business and commerce [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of quality}} models in <b>software</b> <b>package</b> <b>procurement</b> {{provides}} a jamework for {{the description of}} the domain which the package belongs to. Package descriptions and user quality requirements may be translated into the quality concepts defined in the model making package procurement more efficient and reliable. In this paper we address the construction of quality models for complex software domains, defined as domains that imply a mixture of functionalities. Procurement processes taking place in complex domains require not a single package to be selected but a set of them. As a consequence, instead of a standard, single quality model, we need a more elaborated quality model for driving the simultaneous <b>procurement</b> of multiple <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> We describe the parts that compose these kind of models, the methodology for building them and their usage in <b>software</b> <b>procurement.</b> We apply the approach to the complex domain of mail server systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the decision-making processes surrounding the adoption of <b>packaged</b> <b>software</b> in organizations. We begin by looking at its increasing utilization and consider some of the strengths and limitations of employing a standardized approach, particularly in relation to its consideration of end-user requirements. We note the highly problematic nature of installing a global standardized product in the local environment. Using a field study concerning the adoption of a customer relationship management package in a small organization, we go on to illustrate the limited amount of end-user involvement in the selection and procurement of the product. We argue that the art of salesmanship by the third party vendor and project team, which focuses on the interests of senior management, ultimately secures the selection and <b>procurement</b> of the <b>software</b> <b>package...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} analyse {{the process of}} <b>packaged</b> <b>software</b> {{selection}} in a small organization, focussing particularly {{on the role of}} IT consultants as intermediaries in the process. Design/methodology/approach – This is based upon a longitudinal, qualitative field study concerning the adoption of a customer relationship management package in an SME management consultancy. Findings – The authors illustrate how the process of “salesmanship”, an activity directed by the vendor/consultant and focussed on the interests of senior management, marginalises user needs and ultimately secures the <b>procurement</b> of the <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> Research limitations/implications – Despite the best intentions the authors lose something of the rich detail of the lived experience of technology in presenting the case study as a linear narrative. Specifically, the authors have been unable to do justice to the complexity of the multifarious ways in which individual perceptions of the project were influenced and shaped by the opinions of others. Practical implications – Practitioners, particularly those from within SMEs, should be made aware {{of the ways in which}} external parties may have a vested interest in steering projects in a particular direction, which may not necessarily align with their own interests. Originality/value – This study highlights in detail the role of consultants and vendors in software selection processes, an area which has received minimal attention to date. Prior work in this area emphasises the necessary conditions for, and positive outcomes of, appointing external parties in an SME context, with only limited attention being paid to the potential problems such engagements may bring...|$|R

The most significant contributor to application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> project failure lies in the misalignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> While various IT control frameworks that may assist in the implementation of application <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> are available, the question arises why industry still reports that the success rate of application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implementation projects remains low. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the extent to which the Projects in Controlled Environment (PRINCE 2) framework assists in the alignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality provided by the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implemented. This study investigated whether PRINCE 2 addresses all the reasons for project failure. It identifies the shortcomings and weaknesses in PRINCE 2 which may contribute to the misalignment between the business processes of the organisation and the functionality of the application <b>software</b> <b>package</b> implemented. The study recommends how these weaknesses identified in PRINCE 2 can be addressed.
