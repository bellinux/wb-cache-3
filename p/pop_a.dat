25|$|Pop-influenced {{punk rock}} {{emerged in the}} mid-1970s with a music style that was stylistically similar to power pop. By the mid-1980s, several bands merged {{hardcore}} punk with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as Dag Nasty, the Nip Drivers, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, and the Descendents. Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid-to-late 1980s. Pop punk particularly thrived in California, where independent record labels adopted a do it yourself (DIY) approach to releasing music. By the mid-1990s, a few pop punk bands had started to sell millions of records and receive extensive radio and television airplay. By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of Blink-182's Enema of the State, represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s. In the mid-2000s, emo <b>pop,</b> <b>a</b> fusion genre combining emo and pop punk, became popular. By {{the end of the}} 2000s, the pop punk sound of the 1990s had largely waned in mainstream popularity.|$|E

25|$|Romania's elite {{had been}} {{intensely}} Francophile ever since Romania had won its {{independence in the}} 19th century, indeed so Francophile that the defeat of France in June 1940 {{had the effect of}} discrediting the entire elite. Antonescu's internment ended in August, during which interval, under Axis pressure, Romania had ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (see Treaty of Craiova) and Northern Transylvania to Hungary (see Second Vienna Award). The latter grant caused consternation among large sections of Romania's population, causing Carol's popularity to fall to a record low and provoking large-scale protests in Bucharest, the capital. These movements were organized competitively by the pro-Allied PNȚ, headed by Iuliu Maniu, and the pro-Nazi Iron Guard. The latter group had been revived under the leadership of Horia Sima, and was organizing a coup d'état. In this troubled context, Antonescu simply left his assigned residence. He may have been secretly helped in this by German intercession, but was more directly aided to escape by socialite Alice Sturdza, who was acting on Maniu's request. Antonescu subsequently met with Maniu in Ploiești, where they discussed how best to manage the political situation. While these negotiations were carried out, the monarch himself was being advised by his entourage to recover legitimacy by governing in tandem with the increasingly popular Antonescu, while creating a new political majority from the existing forces. On 2 September 1940, Valer <b>Pop,</b> <b>a</b> courtier and an important member of the camarilla first advised Carol to appoint Antonescu as Prime Minister as the solution to the crisis. Pop's reasons for advising Carol to have Antonescu as Prime Minister who was partly because Antonescu-who was known to be friendly with the Iron Guard and had been imprisoned under Carol-was believed to have enough of an oppositional background to Carol's regime to appease the public and partly because Pop knew that Antonescu for all his Legionary sympathies {{was a member of the}} elite and would never turn against it. When Carol proved reluctant to have Antonescu as Prime Minister, Pop visited the German legation to meet with Fabricius on the night 4 September 1940 to ask that the German minister phone Carol to tell him that Reich wanted Antonescu as Prime Minister; Fabricius's promptly did just that. Carol and Antonescu accepted the proposal, Antonescu being mandated to approach political party leaders Maniu of the PNȚ and Dinu Brătianu of the PNL. They all called for Carol's abdication as a preliminary measure, while Sima, another leader sought after for negotiations, could not be found in time to express his opinion. Antonescu partly complied with the request but also asked Carol to bestow upon him the reserve powers for Romanian heads of state. Carol yielded and, on September 5, 1940, the general became Prime Minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him. The latter's first measure was to curtail potential resistance within the Army by relieving Bucharest Garrison chief Gheorghe Argeșanu of his position and replacing him with Dumitru Coroamă. Shortly afterward, Antonescu heard rumors that two of Carol's loyalist generals, Gheorghe Mihail and Paul Teodorescu, were planning to have him killed. In reaction, he forced Carol to abdicate, while General Coroamă was refusing to carry out the royal order of shooting down Iron Guardist protesters.|$|E

500|$|Before late 1958, {{rather than}} unified pop and country singles charts, Billboard {{had as many}} as four charts for each, {{separately}} ranking records according to sales, jukebox play, jockey spins (i.e., airplay), and, in the case of <b>pop,</b> <b>a</b> general [...] "Top 100". Billboard now regards the sales charts as definitive for the period. Widely cited chart statistician Joel Whitburn accords historical releases the highest ranking they achieved among the separate charts. Presley discographer Ernst Jorgensen refers only to the Top 100 chart for pop hits. All of the 1956–58 songs listed here as number one US pop hits reached the top of both the sales and with three exceptions, the Top 100 charts: [...] "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You" [...] (three), [...] "Hound Dog" [...] (two, behind its flip side, [...] "Don't Be Cruel"), and [...] "Hard Headed Woman" [...] (two).|$|E
500|$|Goldenheart has an eccentric, dreamy musical {{style that}} {{incorporates}} spare, reverberating beats, icy synthesizers, and dream pop textures. Allmusic's Andy Kellman characterizes its music as [...] "largely pop-oriented contemporary R", while Jesse Cataldo from Slant Magazine finds {{it to be}} [...] "aligned with an intensifying style of alternative R ... in which albums are intricately structured and thematic." [...] Marcus Holmlund of Interview observes an [...] "atmospheric aesthetic" [...] that blends [...] "alternative listens like Björk and Imogen Heap with 80s <b>pop</b> (<b>à</b> la Phil Collins and Prince)". Richard, who {{grew up listening to}} Collins, Prince, Genesis, Cyndi Lauper, and Peter Gabriel, cites the song [...] "'86" [...] as most exemplary of those influences on the album. Goldenheart also draws heavily on dance music. Its melodic urban contemporary sound incorporates elements of electro, house, and European dance-pop. The ambient, 2-step [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "Riot" [...] both have euphoric house climaxes. [...] "Pretty Wicked Things" [...] features an industrialized, dubstep production, with jerky basslines and pitch-shifted vocals.|$|E

500|$|The {{music was}} {{developed}} immediately following {{a brief period}} in the mid 1960s where creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable {{to decide on the}} artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word [...] "progressive", being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from [...] "commercial" [...] pop. Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between [...] "progressive" [...] pop and [...] "mass/chart" [...] <b>pop,</b> <b>a</b> separation which was [...] "also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class." [...] Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of {{what it meant to be}} an artist in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of [...] "progressive" [...] rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers [...] "above" [...] normal pop practice.|$|E
500|$|Although Jackson {{has reached}} superstar {{status in the}} United States, she has yet {{to achieve the same}} level of {{response}} internationally. According to Nacy Berry, vice chairman of Virgin Records, Janet marked the first time the label [...] "had centrally coordinated and strategized a campaign on a worldwide basis" [...] which ultimately brought her to a plateau of global recognition. Her historic multimillion-dollar contract made her the highest-paid artist in history, until brother Michael renegotiated his contract with Sony Music Entertainment only days later. Sonia Murry noted that she remained [...] "the highest-paid female in <b>pop...</b> <b>a</b> whirlwind of fashion, personality and slick musical packaging rivaled only by Madonna and Whitney Houston in today's pop pantheon." [...] James Robert Parish, author of Today's Black Hollywood (1995) wrote: [...] "She confirmed her status as today's Queen of Pop when, not long ago, she signed a $35-$40 million recording contract with Virgin Records." [...] Music critic Nelson George noted that while surpassing Michael would be next to impossible, Janet had assuredly reached iconic status. He explained: [...] "What worked for Michael 10 years ago is working for her now... Michael was clearly the voice of the '80s, those that grew up with him since Motown. And with the themes (independence, social consciousness and up-front yet responsible sexuality) that she's addressing in her albums and the popularity she's enjoying, she could very well be the voice of the '90s." ...|$|E
500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ...

500|$|A cover {{version of}} [...] "September Gurls" [...] {{appeared}} on the Bangles' 1986 triple platinum album Different Light. [...] "September Gurls", Borack wrote, [...] "was and is {{the sine qua non}} of power <b>pop,</b> <b>a</b> glorious, glittering jewel with every facet cut and shined to absolute perfection.... a peerless, aching distillation of love and longing. 'September Gurls' may not actually be the greatest song ever recorded, but for the duration of its 2:47 running time, you can be forgiven for believing it is." [...] The 1987 tribute song [...] "Alex Chilton", co-written by three members of the Replacements, was released as a single from the album Pleased to Meet Me and contains the lyric [...] "I never travel far without a little Big Star." [...] "I'm In Love With A Girl" [...] from Radio City features in the soundtrack of the 2009 film Adventureland. In 1998, an ad hoc, shortened version of #1 Records [...] "In the Street" [...] (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom That '70s Show, and in 1999, a new version titled [...] "That '70s Song (In the Street)" [...] was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show. [...] "That '70s Song" [...] and Big Star's own [...] "September Gurls" [...] are included on the 1999 album That '70s Album (Rockin') released by the television program's producers. The 2006 tribute album Big Star, Small World includes Big Star covers by the Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Gin Blossoms, Wilco, the Afghan Whigs, and Whiskeytown, among others. Lucero, a Memphis, Tennessee-based alternative country band, covered [...] "I'm In Love With a Girl" [...] on their 2015 release All a Man Should Do, an album which takes its title from a lyric in the song. Founding member Jody Stephens, and later additions to Big Star, provide backup on the track.|$|E
500|$|Along with Gentlemen, Congregation is {{generally}} considered by music journalists {{to be part of}} the Afghan Whigs' peak recording period. Dulli cites it as [...] "the record where we came into our own". Melody Maker dubbed it [...] "the finest rock LP of the decade" [...] and commented that it is [...] "nothing less than rock raping <b>pop,</b> <b>a</b> ferocious deflowering of Motown's romantic ideal". With Congregation, Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody found the band to be [...] "crucial to the birth of '90s alternative rock." [...] AllMusic's Jason Ankeny said that it was the band's artistic breakthrough and [...] "ticket to the big leagues", [...] "an incendiary and insidious set which bridges the gap between the noisy aggression of the band's early releases and the soulful swagger of their later work." [...] Ankeny also cited it as [...] "the grunge era's most overlooked masterpiece" [...] and an indication of the band's musical growth, writing that [...] "while still unmistakably a member of the Sub Pop stable, there's a greater maturity and depth to their sinewy sound, with a newfound grasp of mood and nuance". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it a [...] "quantum leap" [...] over the band's previous work, commenting that it [...] "shows that they ditched grunge for soul because they were no damn good at the former and ladies dig the latter." [...] In 2002, Italian music magazine [...] included the album in its list of 100 Best Albums by Decade. Polish webzine [...] ranked it number 79 on its 2004 list of the Top 100 Albums of the '90s. Italian music journalists [...] and [...] included Congregation in their 2010 book on essential rock albums. The Spin Alternative Record Guide (1995) was somewhat less enthusiastic, writing that [...] "the results feel like dress rehearsals for Gentlemen, with one partial exception, 'Conjure Me,' and one absolute triumph: a surging final track ... that might be the Afghan Whigs' strongest recorded performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la Raíz {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice {{stated that the}} album [...] "casts a spell with deep feeling, and melodies and lyrics that linger in the mind. Elegantly adorned with subtle strings and velvety production, it {{has the kind of}} warmth people are always saying they can hear on old vinyl records". Bryan also predicted that this release would be recognized in the future as the singer's [...] "most profound and enduring statement". In another positive review, Natalia Cano of the magazine Rolling Stone Mexico, referred to the album as [...] "fresh and honest <b>pop,</b> <b>a</b> reflection of her musical maturity", reiterating that the album [...] "continues to place her {{as one of the most}} important composer and performer of Latin America." [...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it is too early in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel García, Torreblanca and María Daniela". An editor from Televisa Espectáculos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows all the things she learned after working with Agustín Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a sense of adventure and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "Vámonos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry". Corsa also noted that the singer [...] "drew from Joni Mitchell, Charles Bradley, and Amy Winehouse".|$|E
