This Issue Brief makes a case against ex <b>post</b> <b>restructuring</b> measures, specifically bankruptcy modeled on Chapter 9 of the U. S.

In particular, it introduces tax-credit borrowing (TCB) as a potential commitment device for states that would allow for the creation of super-priority, risk-free debt. TCB ensures that states internalize the risk of default and avoids the moral hazard problem of states assuming that the federal government will, in a fiscal crisis, use taxpayer money to offer a bailout. It also incentivizes better monitoring of the borrowing decisions made by state officials, as the fiscal ramifications of excessive debt would move from state creditors to taxpayers and voters. Small changes to federal tax policy and likely a subsidy (relative to traditional debt) would be necessary to encourage tax-credit borrowing, but this new approach can solve the sticky problem of debt prioritization that continues to mystify states and municipalities.

Leaders in this dawning age will have to demonstrate more flexibility and take more risks than managers of the old order. Do to the rapid changes in technology and the encroachment of global influence on day-to-day decisions, managers must change their roles considerably – from the exercising of “absolute power ” to the promotion of empowerment of others.

The participants were divided in two groups, those who knew someone who had been made redundant in the previous 12 months (affected by organisational restructuring) {{and those who did not}} know anyone in the organisation who had been made redundant (employees not affected by organisational restructuring).

(Business Management) Abstract: Banking {{institutions}} {{operate in}} a sector driven by knowledge as an essential commodity for attaining and retaining a competitive advantage in a highly competitive knowledge economy. This economy is characterised by constant disruptions. Knowledge creation and sharing are essential activities that share a dichotomous relationship needed in shaping the competitive edge of modern banking institutions. Modern business is often characterised by organisational restructurings that bring about a plethora {{of positive and negative}} consequences to operations, people and knowledge flow in an organisation. Managing the sharing of knowledge through employing relevant, useful knowledge sharing tools during periods of major restructuring and <b>post</b> <b>restructuring</b> poses a challenge to management. Management may not always have high levels of awareness of the importance of ensuring that knowledge sharing survives major organisational restructuring. Management has to ensure that knowledge sharing continues to play its pivotal role in accelerating the company’s journey of recovery from chaos and moving towards normality and high business performance. The journey of one company, a banking institution, was the focus of this study. A case study was done on the use of knowledge sharing tools in helping a banking institution thrive under different business conditions viz. a period of major restructure and a period that follows a major restructure. The {{purpose of the study was}} to make a contribution to modern literature on business management by elevating the essentiality of applying knowledge management by promoting knowledge sharing in a normal business operating climate as well as under turbulent conditions. The empirical study involved interviewing employees at a major banking institution with the aim of gaining insights in the essential variables that must be taken into account when managing knowledge sharing within a banking institution. A questionnaire was used to gather data for an analysis of multiple knowledge sharing tools for their perceived usefulness in fostering knowledge under different business conditions. Though this study was not based on generational theory, it became necessary to understand a generational view on how the various knowledge sharing tools are used in the workplace.

It was observed that the companies with high efficiency levels were those with the highest volume of sales. Thus, efficiency was not determined only by the nationality of the firms, since the possibility of the accomplishment of profitable businesses, mainly in association with great retail networks, could be indicated as a determinant for greater efficiency.

Two strategies are discussed. The first is defensive pessimism, an anticipatory strategy that involves etting defensively ow ex-pectations prior to entering a situation, so as to defend against loss of self-esteem in the event o f failure. The second is an optimistic strategy, where expectations are high at the outset, and <b>post</b> hoc <b>restructuring</b> of the situa-tion is done when the outcome is known. Expectations about performance on an anagram task were collected from prescreened optimistics and defen-sive pessimists.

A posttest measuring self-reported satisfaction, feel-ings of control, and performance evaluations was administered. As predicted, subjects selected for defensive pessimist attitudes expected to perform significantly worse than did those selected for optimistic attitudes, even though there was no difference in actual performance. Moreover, optimists demonstrated attributional egotism in claiming significantly more control over their performance in the success condition than in the failure condition. Pessimists did not show this pattern.

We sought to determine whether hospitalized patients with a history of heart failure (HF) benefitted from inpatient GEM or not. MethodsWe studied 309 inpatients previously diagnosed with HF who were participants in a randomized trial of geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) versus usual care (UC). The intervention involved multidisciplinary teams that provided comprehensive geriatric assessment. We evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQOL), basic activities of daily living (ADLs), health service utilization, and survival at discharge, 6 months, and 1 year post randomization. ResultsGEM patients had higher mean change scores for physical function (unadjusted means: 0. 17  vs.  – 4. 67, p =  0. 046) and basic ADLs (1. 25 vs. 0. 67, p =  0. 003) at hospital discharge, which remained significant after adjusting for baseline HRQOL scores and in-hospital days. Outcomes were not significantly different at 1 year. Length of stay for GEM was greater than UC (24 days vs. 17 days, p =  0. 03), but total costs at 1 year were not different (p =  0. 9). Mortality rates at 1 year were high and similar (GEM 29. 0 %, UC 27. 3 %, p =  0. 73) in both the groups. ConclusionInpatient GEM was associated with better maintenance of physical function and basic ADLs at hospital discharge; however, no differences in HRQOL or survival were observed between GEM and UC at 1 year <b>post</b> randomization. <b>Restructuring</b> inpatient care models to incorporate inpatient GEM principles may be one method to optimize health-care delivery...|$|R

This debate has largely been dominated by approaches that emphasize either the depoliticization of institutional designs or the determining impact of pre-existing social structures. These views, however, have serious problems explaining {{one of the key}} comparative developments in East-Central Europe – the strong economic growth in Poland and the demise of the Czech Republic in the 1990 s. This paper explains these differences by offering an alternative, embedded politics approach that views firm and institutional creation as intertwined experiments.

As a case study, Indonesia provides two important insights {{on the study}} of staterestructuring on regional convergence. First, Indonesia {{is a member of the}} ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) that its institutional arrangements emphasis on member countries freedom to determine their own trade liberalisation sectors and schedules. Second, Indonesia decentralisation is a rapid and significant shift of politico-economy and social. Second, there is a rapid and significant shift of politico-economy and social institutional arrangements from centralised to decentralisation regime. These external and internal state-restructuring are expected influence the variety of regional economic development and convergence. This study aims to analyse the impact of state restructuring on disparities at the district level for the period from 1993 to 2005. The study divides the period under observation into three sub periods, the pre-decentralisation, the decentralisation and the whole period. This research aims to achieve this objective with three empirical studies as follows, first, using economic indices, the thesis examine inequality level of district economic growth and industry concentration. Second, econometrics analysis explores the impact of trade openness and decentralisation on regional economic growth. Finally, this thesis adopts comparative political analysis by using the historical institutionalism approach to understand the variation of state restructuring impact. The main findings show that despite evidence of regional convergence, disparities are persistent and severe in the <b>post</b> state <b>restructuring</b> period. The quantitative analysis shows that AFTA has insignificant impact and decentralisation significantly contract regional economic growth. While qualitative case studies in the Batam and Bandung cities found that institutional history and path development strongly influence development progress and discourses. Politico-economy shocks only act as critical juncture that provides opportunity for the state and regions to create new development path. However, path dependence of institutional changes and economic development is bounded by the regions’ past institutional arrangements and knowledge.

The key enquiry is to scrutinise the ex <b>post</b> effects of <b>restructuring</b> on performance and value measures of firms with contrast to a matched criteria non-restructured sample. A cross sectional study employing logit estimate is undertaken to examine firm characteristics of restructuring samples. Further, additional parameters, i. e. Conditional Volatility and Asymmetry are generated under the GJR-GARCH estimate and reiterated in logit models to capture time-varying heteroscedasticity of the samples. This research incorporates most forms of restructurings, while prior studies have examined certain forms of restructuring. Particularly, these studies have made limited attempts to examine different restructuring events simultaneously. In addition to logit analysis, an event study is adopted to evaluate the announcement effect of restructuring under both the OLS and GJR-GARCH estimate supplementing our prior results. By engaging a composite empirical framework, our estimation method validates a full appreciation of restructuring effect. The study provides evidence that restructurings indicate non-trivial significant positive effect. There are some evidences that the response differs because of the types of restructuring, particularly while event study is applied. The results establish that performance measures, i. e. Operating Profit Margin, Return on Equity, Return on Assets, Growth, Size, Profit Margin and Shareholders' Ownership indicate consistent and significant increase. However, Leverage and Asset Turn Over suggest reasonable influence on restructuring across the sample period. Similarly, value measures, i. e. Abnormal Returns, Return on Equity and Cash Flow Margin suggest sizeable improvement. A notable characteristic seen coherently throughout the analysis is the decreasing proportion of Systematic Risk. Consistent with these findings, Conditional Volatility and Asymmetry exhibit similar trend. The event study analysis suggests that on an average market perceives restructuring favourably and shareholders experience significant and systematic positive gain.
