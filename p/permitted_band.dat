50|$|Humans {{who deal}} with the species caught in mist nets are called banders in the United States. Banders are {{responsible}} for banding the species caught in the net {{so they can be}} tracked. In the United States, in order to band a bird or bat, one must have a <b>banding</b> <b>permit.</b> <b>Banding</b> <b>permits</b> are given to people who have gone through training and whose projects contribute to the conservation and management of the bird population. Banders are responsible for the animals caught and thus apply their training by paying attention to stress cues (for birds these include panting, tiredness, closing of eyes, and raising of feathers). If not, the animal can severely injure itself. There are different types of <b>banding</b> <b>permits</b> for birds, the Master Permit and the Sub permit. Master Permits are given to individuals who band on their own or who supervise <b>banding</b> operations. Sub <b>permits</b> are given to individuals who will be supervised while banding by a person with a Master Permit. In order to receive a permit, one must fill out an application and return it to the nearest banding office. Banders must ask for special authorization in their application in order to use mist nets, cannon nets, chemicals, or auxiliary markers (North American Bander’s Study Guide 6).|$|R
40|$|We study shear banding in soft glassy {{materials}} {{subject to}} a large amplitude oscillatory shear flow (LAOS). By numerical simulations of the widely used soft glassy rheology model, supplemented by more general physical arguments, we demonstrate strong banding over an extensive range of amplitudes and frequencies of the imposed shear rate γ̇(t) =γ̇_ 0 cos(ω t), even in materials that do not <b>permit</b> <b>banding</b> as their steady state response to a steady imposed shear flow γ̇=γ̇_ 0 =const. Highly counterintuitively, banding persists in LAOS even {{in the limit of}} zero frequency ω→ 0, where one might a priori have expected a homogeneous flow response (consistent with the requirement of homogeneous flow for a strictly zero frequency steady imposed shear flow). We explain this finding in terms of an alternating competition within each cycle between glassy aging and flow rejuvenation. Our predictions have far-reaching implications for the flow behavior of aging yield stress fluids, suggesting a generic expectation of shear banding in flows of even arbitrarily slow time variation.

50|$|The 20th century saw {{dramatic}} {{innovations in}} musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, {{such as the}} use of altered chords and extended chords in 1940s-era Bebop jazz. The development of powerful, loud guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement systems in the 1960s and 1970s <b>permitted</b> <b>bands</b> to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of jazz and rock music to create jazz fusion). As well, composers and musicians used new electric, electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as electronic dance music genres such as house music were created largely with synthesizers and drum machines. Faster modes of transportation such as jet flight allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.|$|R

In the context of materials selection, these systems successfully avoid the existing ubiquitous reliance on gallates as hosts in Cr 3 +-doped phosphorescent phosphors. Zn 2 SnO 4 is employed as a host {{to take advantage of}} its characteristic inverse spinel crystal structure, easy substitution into Zn 2 + and Sn 4 + sites by Cr 3 + in distorted octahedral coordination and non-equivalent substitution. In this work, Al dopant was introduced both to precisely tailor the local crystal field around the activator center, Cr 3 +, and to redeploy trap distribution in the system. Indeed, such redeployment <b>permits</b> <b>band</b> gap adjustment and the dynamic variation of the annihilation and the formation of defects. The results demonstrate that the method employed here can be an effective way to fabricate multi-wavelength, low-cost, NIR phosphorescent phosphors with many potential multifunctional bio-imaging applications...|$|R

Large {{regions of the world}} are too sparsely populated to be economically served by terrestrial cellular communications. Since satellites are well suited to this application, TRW filed with the FCC on May 31, 1993 for the Odyssey construction permit. Odyssey will provide high quality wireless communication services worldwide from satellites. These services will include: voice, data, paging, and messaging. Odyssey will be an economical approach to providing communications. A constellation of 12 satellites will be orbited in three, 55 deg. inclined planes at an altitude of 10, 354 km to provide continuous coverage of designated regions. Two satellites will be visible anywhere in the world at all times. This dual visibility leads to high line-of-sight elevation angles, minimizing obstructions by terrain, trees and buildings. Each satellite generates a multibeam antenna pattern that divides its coverage area into a set of contiguous cells. The communications system employs spread spectrum CDMA on both the uplinks and downlinks. This signaling method <b>permits</b> <b>band</b> sharing with other systems and applications. Signal processing is accomplished on the ground at the satellite's 'Gateway' stations. The 'bent pipe' transponders accommodates different regional standards, as well as signaling changes over time.

40|$|India, a {{powerful}} developing nation, requires an adequate power infrastructure for its sustained economic growth. The existent power sector in India is diversified in nature having its power generation ranging from {{wide range of}} commercial sources such as hydro, coal, diesel, gas, nuclear along with nonconventional sources like solar, wind, biogas & etc. Despite being the third largest electricity producer {{in the world by}} 2013, significant part of the country still faces severe power shortages due to the considerable rise in commercial and industrial consumers. With the load never being constant, the imbalance in load- generation causes frequency variation. With the unscheduled generation and drawl of electricity posing threat to entire grid by creating large frequency fluctuations, the Government of India has put forward the concept of unscheduled interchange (UI) as a part of three part tariff in the name of availability based tariff (ABT).

40|$|When intense light {{interacts with}} an atomic gas, recollision between an {{ionizing}} electron and its parent ion creates high-order harmonics {{of the fundamental}} laser frequency. This sub-cycle effect generates coherent soft X-rays and attosecond pulses, and provides a means to image molecular orbitals. Recently, high harmonics have been generated from bulk crystals, but what mechanism dominates the emission remains uncertain. To resolve this issue, we adapt measurement methods from gas-phase research to solid zinc oxide driven by mid-infrared laser fields of 0. 25 volts per 5 ngstr 6 m. We find that when we alter the generation process with a second-harmonic beam, the modified harmonic spectrum bears the signature of a generalized recollision between an electron and its associated hole. In addition, we find that solid-state high harmonics are perturbed by fields so weak that they are present in conventional electronic circuits, thus opening a route to integrate electronics with attosecond and high-harmonic technology.
