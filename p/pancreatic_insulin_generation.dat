In rats on the control diet, values for serum and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> did not differ 2 and 14 days after 40 mg/kg of STZ.

40|$|The low-dose {{streptozocin}} (STZ) {{model of}} diabetes {{has been reported}} to involve direct STZ beta-cytotoxicity and/or immunologically mediated beta-cell destruction. Because the T-lymphocyte dependency of such a model is controversial, we further assessed the role of T-lymphocytes by determining the occurrence and magnitude of hyperglycemia as well as the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> contents in both STZ-injected nude C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice and STZ-injected euthymic C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice selectively depleted in helper and/or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The effectiveness of MoAb treatment was assessed in lymph node cells by flow-microfluorometry analysis and in spleen cells by concanavalin A stimulation, allospecific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, and T-lymphocyte lymphokine production. Sixteen days after the first STZ injection, hyperglycemia (plasma glucose greater than 200 mg/dl) occurred in significantly fewer helper T-lymphocyte-depleted mice (P less than. 005) or helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-depleted mice (P less than. 001) than in non-MoAb-treated mice.

Here, we quantified the beta-cell mass in pancreas obtained at autopsy of 57 type 2 diabetic (T 2 D) and 52 non-diabetic subjects of European origin. Sections from the body and tail were immunostained for insulin. The beta-cell mass was calculated from the volume density of beta-cells (measured by point-counting methods) {{and the weight of}} the pancreas. The <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> concentration was measured in some of the subjects. beta-cell mass increased only slightly with body mass index (BMI).

In conclusion, the average beta-cell mass is about 39 % lower in T 2 D subjects compared with matched controls. Its decrease with duration of the disease could be a consequence of diabetes that, with further impairment of insulin secretion, contributes to the progressive deterioration of glucose homeostasis.

40|$|The use of {{arteriovenous}} (AV) concentration {{differences to}} measure {{the production of a}} substance at organ/tissue level by Fick principle is limited to steady state. Out of steady state, there is the need, as originally proposed by Zierler, to account for the nonnegligible transit time of the substance through the system. Based on this theory, we propose a modeling approach that adopts a parametric description for production and transit time. Once the unknown parameters are estimated on AV data, the transition time of the substance can be assessed and production can be reconstructed. As a case study, we discuss the estimation of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> secretion during a meal from C-peptide concentrations measured in femoral artery and hepatic vein in 12 subjects. Results support the importance of accounting for nonnegligible transit times, even if C-peptide mean transit time across the splanchnic bed is rather limited (3. 3 ± 1. 3 min), it affects the estimation of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> secretion which shows a significantly different profile in the early portion of the postprandial period when estimated either with the novel modeling approach or with the simplified steady state equation...|$|R

Methods: Fifty-two healthy C 57 BL/ 6 male mice were randomized into 4 groups to {{study the effects of}} clozapine (group C, D) and a high-fat diet (group B, D). Three mice from each group were randomly selected to determine the amount of food intake on days 8 - 10, and their pancreases were removed for histological examination on day 11.

Conclusion: Pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis, suppression of cell proliferation, and trends of reduction in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> content were observed in mice taking clozapine.

Sodium orthovanadate (0. 3 mg/ml) was administered for 7 wk in H 2 O. Vanadate treatment induced a fall in fed and fasted plasma glucose and insulin levels and improved tolerance to oral glucose; the stimulated glucose area was decreased by 65 %, and an early peak of insulin secretion was restored. During an intravenous glucose tolerance test, the glucose disappearance rate was twofold higher in vanadate-treated mice, and the reappearance of a significant insulin response was also observed. Moreover, vanadate produced a twofold increase in hepatic glycogen content and prevented the exhaustion of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> stores. The hypoglycemic response to exogenous insulin was similar in control and treated mice.
