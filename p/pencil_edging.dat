40|$|StratiGraph, a Java-based {{tool for}} {{computation}} and presentation of closure hierarchies of Jordan and Kronecker structures is presented. The too lis based on recent theoretical results on strati cations of orbits and bundles of matrices and matrix pencils. A stratification reveals the complete hierarchy of nearby structures, information critical for explaining the qualitative behaviour of linear systems under perturbations. StratiGraph facilitates {{the application of}} these theories and visualizes the resulting hierarchy as a graph. Nodes in the graph represent orbits or bundles of matrices or matrix <b>pencils.</b> <b>Edges</b> represent covering relations in the closure hierarchy. Given a Jordan or Kronecker structure, a user can obtain the complete information of nearby structures simply by mouse clicks on nodes of interest. This contribution gives {{an overview of the}} StratiGraph tool, presents its main functionalities and other features, and illustrates its use by sample applications...|$|R

30|$|In this exercise, {{students}} begin by focusing their eye on some point, {{anywhere on the}} form and without taking their eyes off of the form, convince themselves that the pencil is actually touching that point on which the eye is fastened. Movement is coordinated so that the eye and <b>pencil</b> trace the <b>edge</b> of the form slowly along the outer contour lines and follow along lines that wind into {{the interior of the}} form. Students complete the exercise with an intensity of focus that also demands they inhibit their habit of looking at the paper and judging what they see. There is a great temptation to look down at the paper! Using the contemplative method of ‘Blind Line’ allows my students to see whatever happens to be in front of them — a leaf, a tea cup, a shell — in new ways and produces interesting results when they capture that object using only line. In time it is clear to them that concentrating only on the quality and intensity of the line they are seeing and drawing allows them to become engaged with what artist and author Frederick Franck calls the ‘pure’ act of seeing without judging or labeling the object they observe. Franck prompts his students to look beyond naming the object, saying, “quickly we stick labels on all that is, labels that stick once and for all. By these labels we recognize everything but no longer see anything. We know the labels on all the bottles, but never taste the wine” (Franck 1973, 3 - 4).|$|R
