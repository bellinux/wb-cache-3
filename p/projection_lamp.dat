50|$|A filmstrip is a spooled roll of 35 mm {{positive}} film with approximately thirty to fifty images arranged in sequential order. Like 16 mm film, a filmstrip was inserted vertically {{down in front}} of the projector aperture, rather than horizontally as in a slide projector. Therefore, the frame size is smaller than normal 35 mm film. Two image frames of a filmstrip take up the same amount of space as a single 35mm frame, including its guard band, so that a 25 exposure 35mm film can contain 50 filmstrip images. Early celluloid filmstrips had a habit of melting or combusting from the intense and sustained heat of the <b>projection</b> <b>lamp.</b> These were called pictural filmstrips, the first filmstrips that were produced in a complete set.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic soundtracks can {{be joined}} with the moving image but it creates an abrupt {{discontinuity}} because of the offset of the audio track relative to the picture. Whether optical or magnetic, the audio pickup must be located several inches ahead of the <b>projection</b> <b>lamp,</b> shutter and drive sprockets. There is usually a flywheel as well to smooth out the film motion to eliminate the flutter that would otherwise result from the negative pulldown mechanism. If you have films with a magnetic track, you should keep them away from strong magnetic sources, such as televisions. These can weaken or wipe the magnetic sound signal. Magnetic sound on a cellulose acetate film base is also more prone to vinegar syndrome than a film with just the image.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, James D. Hardy, Harold G. Wolff and Helen Goodell of Cornell University {{introduced}} the first dolorimeter {{as a method}} for evaluating the effectiveness of analgesic medications. They did their work at New York Hospital. They focused {{the light of a}} 100 watt <b>projection</b> <b>lamp</b> with a lens on an area of skin that had been blackened. They found that most people expressed a pain sensation when the skin temperature reached 113 °F (45 °C). They also found that after the skin temperature reached 152 °F (67 °C), the pain sensations did not intensify even if the heat was increased. They developed a pain scale, called the [...] "Hardy-Wolff-Goodell" [...] scale, with 10 gradations, or 10 levels. They assigned the name of [...] "dols" [...] to these levels. Unfortunately, other researchers were not able to reproduce the results of Hardy, Wolff and Goodell and the device and the approach was abandoned. Harvard Medical School Professor and Massachusetts General Hospital Anaesthetist Henry K. Beecher (1957) expressed skepticism about this method of measuring pain.|$|E

50|$|Before Kodachrome {{film was}} marketed in 1935, most color {{photography}} had been achieved using additive methods and {{materials such as}} Autochrome and Dufaycolor, which were the first practical color processes.

The finished transparencies absorbed between 70% and 80% of light upon projection, requiring very bright <b>projection</b> <b>lamps,</b> especially for large projections. Using the subtractive method, these disadvantages could be avoided.|$|R
25|$|During {{ordinary}} operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster.

Secondly, Eastman Kodak's introduction of panchromatic film stock in 1928 allowed for the camera to expose the projected background more than orthochromatic stocks, making it look less faint than it did before. Finally, the larger film gauges beginning {{to emerge in the}} late 1920s demanded more powerful <b>projection</b> <b>lamps,</b> which were subsequently available for making the rear projection screen brighter and thus more properly exposed.|$|R

40|$|S INCE the {{beginning}} of 1953 experiments at the Laboratories of the Hydro- Electric Power Commission of Ontario with the method of van Heel (see references) for precision alignment have shown it to be very suitable for measuring small deflections, such as movements of rocks and glaciers. The basic idea is that three marks are placed on a line with, say, 400 feet between the outer two. They are: a single slit, about 1 / 32 inch wide, illu-minated by a 100 -watt <b>projection</b> <b>lamp</b> with condenser lens (Fig. 1); a double slit (Fig. 2), and a 3 x eyepiece with a scale (Fig. 3).

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{fluorescence}} of tubercle bacilli {{stained with}} auramine and rhoda-mine {{does not require}} ultra-violet light. It {{can be caused by}} blue light up to 406 mp. A’copper sdphate ammonia liquid filter, suitably diluted, will transmit this wave-band. A gelatin screen filter, absorbing all light below 510 mp. is used in the eyepiece. Normal, high intensity <b>projection</b> Alament <b>lamps,</b> combined with lamp condensers of large aperture, provide suitable light sources. The numerical aperture of the microsoope condenser must be fully used by immersion in glycerol. The fluorescence is vellry bright with the usual biological, and certain binocular, microscopes. The simplicity of the equipment enables fluorescence microscopy of tubercle bacilli to be used at low cost in any laboratory. The phenomenon of fluorescence as applied to stained bacilli may be described as follows. Certain fluorochroms (e. g. auramine) absorb light of a certain wave-length, and convert it into light energy of another wave-length. This effect is observed by illuminating the specimen with suitable light passed through a filter which transmits a wave-band capable of causing fluorescence, and b...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sedative and antinociceptive effects of three dopaminergic blockers often used in veterinary medicine. The study was conducted on 10 Thoroughbred mares. Sedation was evaluated by determining the spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) in automated individual behavior stalls and by measuring head ptosis (HP). The intravenous injection of acepromazine (0. 05; 0. 08 and 0. 11 mg/kg) and azaperone (0. 25; 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/kg) did not induce significant changes on SLA. In contrast, intramuscular injection of levomepromazine caused an increase in SLA at the dosages of 0. 75 and 1. 0 mg/kg, but not at 0. 5 mg/kg. Significant head ptosis occurred with all dosages and drugs. Antinociception was determined utilizing a heat <b>projection</b> <b>lamp</b> to record the hoof withdrawal reflex latency (HWRL) and skin twitch reflex latency (STRL). Acepromazine (0. 08 mg/kg) and levomepromazine (0. 75 mg/kg) did not induce significant changes on both HWRL and STRL, but azaperone (0. 5 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in both HWRL and STRL. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test (P< 0. 05). The results indicate the antinociceptive effect of azaperone, and the tranquilizer effect of acepromazine and levomepromazine, in horses. KEY-WORDS: Head height. Locomotor activity.

40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{demonstration of}} the tubercle baciilus by the Ziehl-Neelsen technique has always entailed heavy demands on the time and concen-tration of the observer, {{but in recent years}} fluorescence microscopy has offered a means of greatly facilitating this task. The spontaneous fluorescence of M. tuberculosis under ultra-violet microscopy was first observed by Kaiserling (1917), but the use of fluorochrome staining is much more recent (Hagemann, 1937), and it is with this latter technique that this paper is concerned. The essential requirements are a high intensity light source and an appropriate system of filters. A blue filter eliminates the long wavelengths. The short wavelength rays elicit fluorescence from the stained preparation, and an orange eyepiece filter then allows only the fluorescence to reach the observer. The bacilli are seen as bright rods against a dark background, and are easily seen with low magnifications, permitting a much more rapid survey than with oil immersion objectives. For staining, Hagemann first employed berberine sul-phate, but later he reported superior results with auramine 0 (Hagemann, 1938), and this has be-come the standard fluorochrome for M. tubercu-losis. In reviewing the literature it is proposed to con-sider (a) the apparatus used, (b) the staining methods, and (c) the practical applications and results, and to comment on these before detailing the author's investigations.

40|$|The {{number of}} patent {{applications}} {{has been growing}} rapidly: in 2010 the patent application requests increased with 11 % at the European Patent Office. It is important that patent examiners can efficiently compare new applications with published patents. Patent examiners review the list of relevant patents, returned by a search query, {{one at a time}} using the current tools. There is no overview of the patents and time is wasted when the best document is the last in the list. An overview of the patent collection can provide insights into which patents can be skipped and which should be read in detail. This work proposes an Organization Viewer for reviewing a collection of patents. It is based on the research prototype TouchPat which uses multi-touch interaction and displays the patents in a static 2 D grid. In the Organizational Viewer, the patents can be organized manually in a spatial layout using a new multi-touch gesture set and Stacks. In addition, this work examines how automatic organization using the Local Affine Multidimensional <b>Projection</b> (<b>LAMP)</b> technique can also support the user. These new organization techniques are evaluated with twelve patent examiners at the European Patent Office using the think-aloud protocol. The results of these evaluation show that an overview is a valuable addition to the work of patent examiners and that the value of an overview for patent examiners depends on personal preferences as well as their domain of expertise. The TouchPat prototype and the evaluation transcripts give insight into the features that can improve the process of reviewing relevant patents.

40|$|Laser {{light source}} becomes more popular {{today in the}} {{projection}} technology. The use of lasers in projection applications provides considerable advantages compared to conventional <b>projection</b> <b>lamps.</b> These are, for example, long lifetime, large color gamut, small étendue for small projection system. However, one of a major obstacles that prevents lasers projection from the market is speckle. Speckle appears as unwanted granular noise on projected images and it degrades the image quality. A number of speckle reduction solutions have been developed in recent years. However, speckle removal methods that can be integrated in laser projection technology are still challenging. The objective of this PhD work is the investigation, application and characterization of methods for speckle suppression in a real laser projection system. Different approaches for speckle suppression are examined in this work. The first approach is {{the application of a}} Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) diffuser. The benefits of using MEMS diffuser are: less power consumption, small size, simple drive electronics, and simplified integration within a projector. The MEMS diffuser has random patterns that have a role as wavefront phase modulator for speckle suppression. The device is designed based on Silicon on Insulator (SOI) MEMS fabrication process. The design of MEMS diffuser is then theoretical calculated and simulated. The experimental dynamic measurement of MEMS diffuser shows a well fit with the calculation and simulation results. Speckle contrast suppression of the diffuser is characterized. The device provides up to 43 : 8 % of speckle suppression. Based on the same principle, a second generation of MEMS diffuser is designed to have larger height fluctuations with a continuous profile. The calculation, simulation and characterization of the second generation MEMS diffuser are done. However, due to the properties of fabrication processes, a continuous profile of random patterns can not be attained and therefore the second generation of MEMS diffuser does not offer better speckle suppression. The second approach for speckle suppression is a commercial phase-randomizing deformable mirror for anti-speckle technology. The mirror can tolerate high optical power thus it is suitable for laser projection system where high power lasers are required. The mirror comprises a continuous surface of micro mirror array that can be individually deformed and actuated up to hundreds of kHz. Due to the deformation of the micro mirrors, speckle contrast is reduced by the introduction of angle diversity. Speckle suppression by combination of wavelength diversity and angle diversity is measured and analyzed. The study is done both for single broadband laser and laser array. It is shown experimentally that speckle contrast can be reduced down to 0. 04 for single broadband laser and to 0. 033 for four broadband lasers array. Finally, different speckle suppression methods such as wavelength diversity, angle diversity, moving diffuser are applied in a real laser projection system which is built by Projectiondesign AS. Speckle contrast of the projected images is characterized by setting the camera to match speckle perception of human eyes. Speckle contrast of 0. 050 and of 0. 038 are attained respectively for red lasers and blue lasers in the projection system...|$|R

His interest in both these themes continued to play a major part in his subsequent career resulting in several large scale paintings.|$|R
40|$|The initial {{exploration}} of environmental art involved {{a study of}} light and color, which led to an examination of environmental performance and scenic projection techniques. Eventually, the thesis research resulted {{in the development of}} an environmental performance that integrates projected light, projection screens and live performance. A variety of materials for screens were examined in order to determine their transparent and light reflecting qualities and to devise a transparent luminous surface. Among those examined were pelon, nylon, silk, fiberglass, plexiglas, vinyl, and aluminum netting. Included in the investigation was a review of <b>projection</b> equipment, <b>lamp</b> housings, projector bulb specifications, filament design and performance data. In an attempt to control sequence and to create movement of colored images, 16 mm film projection, optical printing and cameraless animation techniques were utilized. Manipulation of stained glass and glass dyes resulted in a series of colored glass slides for still projection. Work with black film leader resulted in abandoning the traditional rectangular film frame, making it possible for light images to take on the shapes of various projection surfaces. The development of a multi-layered screen configuration followed, allowing the projected light images to be duplicated in space, by penetrating one transparent screen after another. Further exploration led to the design of a projection device that would become integral with the performance environment. Earlier research included experimentation with prisms and lenses. The final lighting design, consists of cylindrical tubes and small tungsten-halogen filament bulbs in conjunction with lantern slide projection. Finally, the problems of interaction between live performer and stage environment and how to harmonize the three-dimensionality of the human performer with the projectors and inanimate objects in the performance environment became major concerns. A general survey of technical, historical and stylistic developments regarding this issue was helpful in solving these problems. The thesis project is an original design which addresses this issue and demonstrates an original concept for spatial projection and human performance. The human performer interacts with the staged environment by becoming, at times, a prop, and at other times, a projection screen. by Sharon Haggins-Dunn. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)
