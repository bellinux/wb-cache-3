40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{requirements}} {{is to ensure that}} hazardous office waste is properly managed. They cover handling and disposal of such waste. They apply to workers, supervisors, and Waste Management. 2 Requirements Most people assume that waste accumulated in office areas may be disposed in the trash or recycled in the blue containers available for paper and plastic recycling. This is not true. Please see below for some common office wastes that need to be handled and disposed as hazardous waste. 2. 1 Toner and Inkjet Cartridges Almost all toner cartridges in laser and inkjet printers, fax machines, and copiers can be recycled and are generally picked up by the office supply vendor on the next scheduled delivery. Certain manufacturers supply prepaid packaging for used cartridges, but vendor pickup is preferred. Check with the administrative assistant in your work area for pickup procedures or contact the Waste Management Group. 2. 2 <b>Aerosol</b> <b>Cans</b> – Office Pressurized <b>aerosol</b> <b>cans</b> containing such products as room freshener and pressurized air (for dust removal) are considered hazardous waste. To dispose of properly, submit a completed Hazardous Waste Pick-Up and Empty Container Request Form to Waste Management.

40|$|A {{device was}} {{constructed}} to simulate an exploding <b>aerosol</b> <b>can.</b> The device {{consisted of a}} cylindrical pressure vessel for storage of flammable propellants and base product and a high-rate discharge (HRD) valve for quick release of the constituents. Simulator tests were conducted using representative constituents and propellant quantities for comparison with actual cans heated {{to the point of}} rupture and ignition. This report describes the tests conducted with the simulator in unconfined spaces, a B- 727 cargo compartment, and an LD- 3 Unit Loading Device (ULD). Subsequent work is planned with the aim of matching the pressure pulse produced by the exploding <b>aerosol</b> <b>can</b> simulator with that measured during an overheated <b>aerosol</b> <b>can</b> explosion. 17.

50|$|A new {{development}} is the 2K (two component) aerosol. A 2K aerosol device has main component stored in main chamber and a second component stored in an accessory container. When applicator activates the 2K aerosol by breaking the accessory container, the two components mix. The 2K <b>aerosol</b> <b>can</b> has the advantage for delivery of reactive mixtures. For example, 2K reactive mixture can use low molecular weight monomer, oligomer, and functionalized low molecular polymer to make final cross-linked high molecular weight polymer. 2K <b>aerosol</b> <b>can</b> increase solid contents and deliver high performance polymer products, such as curable paints, foams, and adhesives.|$|R

The <b>packing</b> <b>pressure</b> to fill the thin part in the sintered mold with porous surface is lower than that in the steel mold with porous block.
