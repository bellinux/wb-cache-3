The minimum and maximum wage <b>payment</b> <b>period</b> {{with the exception of}} casual employees should not be less than one week or more than a month, and where not expressly stipulated a month is the default wage period per section 75 of the Act payable before the third working day after the wage period. The wages are to be paid during working hours at the place of employment, or in any other way, such as through a bank account with the consent of the employee. Salaries should be made in legal tender, however, part payment in kind is not prohibited provided it is appropriate for the personal use and benefit of employee and his family, and the value attributable to such payment in kind is fair and reasonable. The payment in kind should not exceed forty per cent of the total amount paid out to the employee.|$|E

50|$|Treating a {{month as}} 30 days {{and a year}} as 360 days was devised for its ease of {{calculation}} by hand compared with manually calculating the actual days between two dates. Also, because 360 is highly factorable, payment frequencies of semi-annual and quarterly and monthly will be 180, 90, and 30 days of a 360-day year, meaning the payment amount will not change between <b>payment</b> <b>periods.</b>|$|R

50|$|With federal {{student loans}} the student may have {{multiple}} options for extending the repayment period, but though {{an extension of}} the loan term will reduce the monthly payment, it will also increase the amount of total interest paid on the principle balance during the life of the loan (the unpaid interest and any penalties become capitalized, i.e. added to the loan balance). Extension options include extended <b>payment</b> <b>periods</b> offered by the original lender and federal loan consolidation.

40|$|<b>Payment</b> <b>periods</b> are an {{important}} part of the legal and financial environment of business. Long and/or delayed <b>payment</b> <b>periods</b> increase business’ cash requirements, financial disequilibrium, can cause heavy administrative costs and undermine profitability and competetivness of firms, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, that are more vulnerable to variations in cash flow and often rely on contracts with large firms who are known to delay payments to a far greater extent than smaller customers. According to some studies only 23 % of the late payment is due to the debtor having financial difficulties. The most frequent cause of it is intentional late payment. The Commission’s Recommendation of 12 May 1995 on <b>payment</b> <b>periods</b> in commercial transactions invited Member States to tackle the problem but Commission’s Communication of July 1997 showed that some action had been taken in only a limited number of countries to improve the payments situation between firms. The Commission decided to transform its Recommendation into proposal for a Directive combating late payment in commercial transactions. The final version of that proposal the European Council adopted on 29 July 1999. The European firms will benefit from a statutory right to interest that should be sufficiently high to compensate the creditor for the loss incurred through late payment and will be payable 30 calendar days after the receipt of the invoice unless otherwise specified in the contract. For certain categories of contracts, Member States are able to fix a period of 60 instead of 30 calendar days after which interest will become due. The Directive obliges Member States to ensure that the creditor, pursueing his claims through the court proceedings, will be able to obtain an enforceable title within a period not exceeding 90 calendar days. The Directive constitues considerable progress on the issue of combating late payments but more decisive action on a number of issues could have been undertaken. For instance, the debtor should be obliged to pay full compensation for damages caused by late payments; there should be also a mutual recognition of retention of title in the EU.
