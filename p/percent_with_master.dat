40|$|Support {{for public}} {{education}} wavers {{in a number of}} states due to a lack of evidence indicating that increased funding is associated with increases in output. Maintaining and increasing this support, however, is critical for rural communities as they seek to strengthen their human capital base as a strategy for economic growth and development. The results of an education production model, estimated with an expenditure variable specified as a polynomial lag, suggest allocating resources to education increases output as teacher quality and quantity and increased funding have positive influence on educational outcomes. Standardized achievement test scores are used as school output measures. Teacher input measures include <b>percent</b> <b>with</b> <b>masters</b> degrees and pupil/teacher ratio. Per pupil expenditure is used as a measure for supplies/facilities. Nonschool inputs are average daily school system attendance rate and parent-teache...|$|R

Seven "organizational health " characteristics were used, including leadership, cohesiveness, resource utilization, adaptiveness, optimum power equalization, morale, and planning. Financial variables included mean class size, <b>percent</b> of teachers <b>with</b> <b>master's</b> degree, minimum teacher salary, maximum teacher salary, enrollment, per pupil expenditure, instructional supply per pupil, pupil services per pupil, special instructional programs per pupil, special state aid per pupil, and federal aid per pupil.

40|$|With the U. S. {{economy in}} the midst of a {{prolonged}} slump, it's hard to believe that any industry would actually benefit from having more workers. But that is precisely the case when it comes to those industries which depend upon highly skilled scientists and engineers. The United States has long faced a dilemma in this respect: the U. S. economy is capable of absorbing more high-tech professionals than the U. S. educational system produces. That is one reason so many U. S. scientists and engineers are immigrants. In "STEM" occupations (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), the foreign-born account for 26. 1 <b>percent</b> of workers <b>with</b> PhDs and 17. 7 <b>percent</b> of those <b>with</b> <b>master's</b> degrees. Even more U. S. scientists and engineers would be immigrants if not for the arbitrary limits imposed by the U. S. immigration system, particularly the inadequate supply of green cards and H- 1 B visas. Given that STEM professionals tend to create jobs through their innovative work, such limits are economically self-defeating...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} pig {{producers}} and employees {{was conducted to}} document trends in the industry. These surveys have been conducted four times: 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Trends show that {{the average age of}} pig producers is increasing, quite notably the last five years; 2000 to 2005. It increased by 4. 1 years over the past five years. Producers are staying in the industry longer and fewer are entering; especially younger producers. Employee trends show the same thing—that the average age is increasing; it increased by 6. 6 years from 2000 to 2005. Employees too are staying in the industry longer reflecting less turnover. Education levels of producers and employees are increasing. This is most notable with employees. About one in ten employees (9 %) indicated they have a DVM or Ph. D. The <b>percent</b> <b>with</b> a <b>masters</b> degree or equivalent also increased from 2000 to 2005. An interesting phenomenon with employees is that the percent without a high school diploma is also increasing. This group went from 3. 7 percent to 9. 3 percent of employees between 2000 and 2005. Hog farms are becoming increasingly specialized and larger. While the farrow-to-finish system remains the dominant system, its relative importance has decreased dramatically. It has declined from about 8 in 10 producers in 1990 to 4 in 10 producers in 2005. Contract finishers as well as wean-to-finish producers have shown notable growth. The percent of producers producing 25, 000 or more pigs annually increased from 3. 4 percent in 1995 to 15. 7 percent in 2005. About one in twenty producers indicated they produced 100, 000 or more pigs annually...|$|R
