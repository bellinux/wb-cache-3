500|$|The {{mainstream}} school of Bitchū Province was the Aoe school {{named after a}} place presently located in Kurashiki. It appeared {{at the end of}} the Heian period and thrived in the ensuing Kamakura period. The quality of Aoe swords was swiftly recognized, as 3 of the 12 smiths at Emperor Go-Toba's court were of this school. Five tachi blades of the early aoe school (ko-aoe, before the Ryakunin era, 1238/39) have been designated national treasures. The ko-aoe school consists of two families employing a similar style of swordsmanship that did not deviate with time. The first family was represented by the founder Yasutsugu and, among others, Sadatsugu, Tametsugu, Yasutsugu (the one in this list) and Moritoshi. The second family, named [...] "Senoo", was founded by Noritake who was followed by Masatsune, and others. Ko-Aoe produced slender tachi with small kissaki and deep koshi-zori. A distinctive feature of this school is the jihada which is chirimen-hada and sumigane (dark and <b>plain</b> <b>steel).</b> The hamon is midare based on suguha with ashi and yō. The boshi is midare komi or suguha with a short kaeri, yakitsume.|$|E

Skarpedin's, on the other hand, was quite plain, but partly gilded; his armour was of pieces of steel like fish scales sewed on a leathern shirt, and over his shoulders he wore as a mantle the skin of a wolf. His chief weapon was a bill--a sort of hook or short scythe fixed to a pole, and it was very deadly in his hands. Most of the carles and thralls were content to wear thick shirts of wolf and other skins, which were found to offer good resistance to a sword-cut, and some of them had portions of armour of various kinds. Their arms were spears, bows, arrows with stone heads, javelins, swords, bills, and battle-axes and shields.|$|E

On his head there was a <b>plain</b> <b>steel</b> helmet, but he wore no [...] "serk", or shirt of mail (hence the name of berserk, or bare of serk), and he was, like the rest of his comrades, noted for being capable of working himself up into such a fury of madness while in action, that few people of ordinary powers could stand before his terrible onset. He was called Hake, the berserk of Hadeland, and was comparatively short in stature, but looked shorter than he really was, in consequence of the unnatural breadth and bulk of his chest and shoulders.

In advance were Master Moritz and the two barons, the former in a stout <b>plain</b> <b>steel</b> helmet, cuirass, and gauntlets, a sword, and those new-fashioned weapons, pistols; the latter in full knightly armour, exactly alike, from the gilt-spurred heel to the eagle- crested helm, and often moving restlessly forward to watch for the enemy, though {{taking care not to}} be betrayed by the glitter of their mail. So long did they wait that there was even a doubt whether it might not have been a false alarm; the boy was vituperated, and it was proposed to despatch a spy to see whether anything were doing at Schlangenwald.|$|E

Add to this that he was in years just twenty, in his looks much older, and in conceit at least two hundred; that he had no objection to be jested with, touching his admiration of his master's daughter; and had even, when called upon at a certain obscure tavern to pledge the lady whom he honoured with his love, toasted, with many winks and leers, a fair creature whose Christian name, he said, began with a D--;--and as much is known of Sim Tappertit, who has by this time followed the locksmith in to breakfast, as is necessary to be known in making his acquaintance.|$|E

60|$|Felton's {{reply was}} to bound upon his charger, and to urge {{it down the}} slope, while Sir Nigel {{followed}} not three spears'-lengths behind him. It was a rugged course, rocky and uneven, yet the two knights, choosing their men, dashed onwards {{at the top of}} their speed, while the gallant Spaniards flew as swiftly to meet them. The one to whom Felton found himself opposed was a tall stripling with a stag's head upon his shield, while Sir Nigel's man was broad and squat with <b>plain</b> <b>steel</b> harness, and a pink and white torse bound round his helmet. The first struck Felton on the target with such force as to split it from side to side, but Sir William's lance crashed through the camail which shielded the Spaniard's throat, and he fell, screaming hoarsely, to the ground. Carried away by the heat and madness of fight, the English knight never drew rein, but charged straight on into the array of the knights of Calatrava. Long time the silent ranks upon the hill could see a swirl and eddy deep down in the heart of the Spanish column, with a circle of rearing chargers and flashing blades. Here and there tossed the white plume of the English helmet, rising and falling like the foam upon a wave, with the fierce gleam and sparkle ever circling round it until at last it had sunk from view, and another brave man had turned from war to peace.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the hot deformation processing, useful and efficient mathematical models able to evaluate the {{different aspects of the}} response of <b>plain</b> carbon <b>steel</b> to hot plastic deformation are among the most important prerequisites.

50|$|A {{reinforced}} {{beam bar}} in the early 1900s consisted of a <b>plain</b> straight <b>steel</b> {{in the center of}} a molded concrete form. The beam would fail along the lines of principal stresses in the concrete through shearing. The <b>plain</b> straight <b>steel</b> was placed into an encased mold and concrete was poured in. This formulated mixture of steel and concrete then hardened and became the reinforced beam bar. However, in some cases there was a tiny air gap between the steel and the hardened concrete which allowed the steel to move and slip. This weakened the reinforced beam from its original full strength capability. This meant then this weakened fractured beam could fail and break under the heavy load of the building it was supporting.|$|R

In the case of V microalloyed steels, the reheating temperature has an effect on the amount of vanadium in solution prior to deformation. This factor influences the austenite evolution during warm deformation and the transformation during cooling. As a consequence, in the microalloyed steels complex multiphase microstructures are obtained that lead {{to a wide range of}} strength-toughness combinations. In contrast, in the case of the <b>plain</b> C-Mn <b>steel</b> minor effects are observed in the deformation range from 800 to 870 °C. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Maximilian armour is {{a modern}} term applied to the style of early 16th-century German plate armour {{associated}} with, and possibly first made for the Emperor Maximilian I. The armour is still white armour, made in <b>plain</b> <b>steel,</b> but it is decorated with many flutings that may also {{have played a role}} in deflecting the points and blades of assailants and increasing the structural strength of the plates. It is a transitional stage in the decoration of armour, after the <b>plain</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces of 15th-century armour and before the elaborate decoration and colouring with etching and other techniques of Renaissance armour. The armour is characterized by armets and close helmets with bellows visors; small fan-shaped narrow and parallel fluting—often covering most of the harness (but never the greaves); etching; work taken from woodcuts; sharply waisted cuirasses, and squared sabatons.|$|E

Although it appears that wrought iron and <b>plain</b> carbon <b>steel</b> have similar chemical compositions, that is deceiving.
