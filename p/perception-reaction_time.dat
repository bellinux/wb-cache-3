It has been apparent {{for some time that}} the key to perceiving a slower vehicle ahead of us as an imminent hazard, i. e., one re-quiring immediate action, is a sufficient rate of change of the visual angle of the lead vehicle. This is known as the “looming threshold”, among other things. A number of laboratory researchers have reported values of the looming threshold to be in the range of 0. 003 radian/sec. Forensic practitioners routinely use elevated values of the looming threshold, e. g., 0. 005 - 0. 008, to account for the complexity of real-world driving tasks. However, only one source has used data from actual vehicle accidents to arrive at a looming threshold – and that value, 0. 0275 rad/sec, is an order of magnitude larger than that derived from laborato-ry studies. In this study, we examine a much broader range of real-world accident data to obtain an estimate of the reasonable upper end of the looming threshold.

This research aimed to identify driving performance factors that might underlie newly-licensed male teens’ risk. Surveys were conducted with 21 16 -year-olds {{at the time of}} intermediate licensure. During the second month of licensure they completed drives in a high-fidelity simulator. Simulator scenarios allowed assessment of responses to yellow traffic lights changing to red and to a visual search task, for which previous data on older age groups of drivers were available. All teens had an A or B grade point average, previously found to be associated with lower crash and citation risk. Nonetheless, 71 % reported risky driving in terms of prior unlicensed, unsupervised driving. In the simulator, 46 % went through an intersection as the light turned red, compared to 33 % of adults. In the visual search task, teens had shorter mean <b>perception-reaction</b> <b>times</b> and identified more targets than adults and older drivers, but similar to young drivers. Therefore, even teens with good grades, perceived to be less risky, were willing to take driving risks. Their driving performance suggests there may be subtle differences in the way recently-licensed teens drive that might predispose them to crashes. Further research of this nature can increase understanding of such differences and inform the development of more targeted intervention...|$|R
40|$|Merging from on-ramps to {{mainline}} traffic {{is one of}} the most challenging driving maneuvers on freeways. The challenges are further heightened for older drivers, as they are known to have longer <b>perception-reaction</b> <b>times,</b> larger acceptance gaps, and slower acceleration rates. In this research, VISSIM, a microscopic traffic simulation software, was used to evaluate the influence of the aging drivers on the operations of a typical diamond interchange. First, drivers were recorded on video cameras as they negotiated joining the mainline traffic from an on-ramp acceleration lane at two sites along I- 75 in Southwest Florida. Several measures of effectiveness were collected including speeds, gaps, and location of entry to the mainline lanes. This information was used as either model input or for verification purposes. Two VISSIM models were developed for each site – one for the existing conditions and verification, and another for a sensitivity analysis, varying the percentage of older drivers and Level of Service (from A to E), to determine their influence on ramp operational characteristics. According to the results, there was a significant difference in driving behavior between older, middle-aged, and younger drivers, based on the measures of effectiveness analyzed in this study. Additionally, as the level of service and percentage of older adult motorists increased, longer queues were observed with slower speeds on the acceleration lanes and the right-most travel lane of the mainline traffic...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper quantifies and models the impact of wet pavement surface and rainy weather conditions on driver <b>perception-reaction</b> <b>times</b> (PRTs), deceleration levels, and traffic signal change interval durations. A total of 648 stop-run records were collected as part of the research effort for a 72 km/h (45 mi/h) approach speed where participant drivers encountered a yellow indication initiation at different distances from the intersection. The participant drivers were randomly selected in different age groups (under 40 years old, 40 to 59 years old, and 60 years of age or older) and genders (female and male). Using the gathered data, statistical models for driver PRT and deceleration levels were developed, considering roadway surface and environmental parameters, driver attributes (age and gender), roadway grade, approaching speed, and time and distance to the intersection at the onset of yellow. Inclement weather yellow timings were then developed and summarized in lookup tables as a function of different factors (driver age/gender, roadway grade, speed limit, precipitation level, and roadway surface condition) to provide practical guidelines for the design of yellow signal timings in wet and rainy weather conditions. The results indicate that wet roadway surface conditions require a 5 percent increase in the change interval and that rainy conditions require a 10 percent or more increase in the duration of the change interval. These recommended change durations can also be integrated within the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative to provide customizable driver warnings prior to a transition to a red indication...|$|R

The published statistical data showed that the number of casualties has gradually increased, and indicated that the main cause of {{traffic accident}} was the negligence by drivers, nearly twenty percent of the total amount of accidents every year in Taiwan. Many published researches about driving safety pointed out that the negligence is usually caused by driver’s distraction and low level of alertness. In recent year, the Collision Warning System (CWS) providing visual, tactile and various audio signals to stimulate the driver’s sense of hearing for warning purpose has been developed to assist drivers for a safe driving. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of various audio signals in the collision warning system on driving performance using a driving simulator.

This experiment evaluated {{the adequacy of the}} 2. 0 second PRT assumption, including specific consideration of older drivers, who are known to experience relatively greater difficulty at intersections. Subjects in three age groups (20 - 40; 65 - 69; and 70 + years old) drove their own vehicles (fitted with a computer-controlled video-based data collection system) over a route that included 14 stop-controlled intersections. At each stop sign, they were required to make ratings of "road quality; " this broke visual search, and provided an opportunity for the experimenter to precisely define the initiation of search and the initiation of forward movement (thus defining PRT). The 2. 0 second PRT assumption was found to work reasonably well for all age groups, and corresponded to roughly the 85 th percentile PRT for all subjects. PRTs for older subjects were slightly (but significantly) briefer than for younger drivers. Reasons for not observing a slowing of intersection PRT with advancing age are discussed.

40|$|Hazard {{perception}} {{has been}} found to correlate with crash involvement, and has thus been suggested as the most likely source of any skill gap between novice and experienced drivers. The most commonly used method for measuring hazard perception is to evaluate the <b>perception-reaction</b> <b>time</b> to filmed traffic events. It can be argued that this method lacks ecological validity and may be of limited value in predicting the actions drivers’ will take to hazards encountered. The first two studies of this thesis compare novice and experienced drivers’ performance on a hazard detection test, requiring discrete button press responses, with their behaviour in a more dynamic driving environment, requiring hazard handling ability. Results indicate that the hazard handling test is more successful at identifying experience-related differences in response time to hazards. Hazard detection test scores were strongly related to performance on a driver theory test, implying that traditional hazard perception tests may be focusing more on declarative knowledge of driving than on the procedural knowledge required to successfully avoid hazards while driving. One in five Irish drivers crash within a year of passing their driving test. This suggests that the current driver training system does not fully prepare drivers for the dangers they will encounter. Thus, the third and fourth studies in this thesis focus on the development of two simulator-based training regimes. In the third study participants receive intensive training on the molar elements of driving i. e. speed and distance evaluation. The fourth study focuses on training higher order situation awareness skills, including perception, comprehension and projection. Results indicate significant improvement in aspects of speed, distance and situation awareness across training days.

40|$|AbstractThe {{dynamics}} of the dilemma zone (DZ) have been realized since {{the concept of the}} dilemma zone was proposed in 1960. The dynamics are a reflection of the dynamical characteristics of the driver-vehicle complex, and can be characterized by the dynamical features of the dilemma zone contributing factors which include the minimum <b>perception-reaction</b> <b>time</b> (PRT) and the maximum deceleration and acceleration rates. To date, the {{dynamics of}} these contributing factors have not yet been well modeled and quantified despite being continuously explored by researchers over decades. In the absence of the quantitative knowledge about these contributing factors, the dilemma zone with assumed constant parameter values, and the Type II dilemma zone defined from a probabilistic perspective (i. e. a zone in which at the onset of yellow interval more than 10 % and less than 90 % drivers would choose to stop) were widely used in practice as alternatives in estimating the dilemma zone. However, both alternatives are compromised in ways, being still incapable of reflecting the dilemma zone dynamics. In fact, the incapacity of modeling and quantifying the dilemma zone dynamics was {{due to the lack of}} reliable and robust vehicular trajectory data during the yellow intervals. The availability of video-capture based software VEVID enabled the collection of high-frequency time-based trajectory data from high-definition digital video and hence offered technical preparedness for modeling the dilemma zone dynamics. The most significant innovation of this paper lies in the proposal of the dynamical dilemma zone model by incorporating the quantitative dynamics into the traditional dilemma zone model. The dynamical contributing factors were identified, quantified, and eventually formulated. Particularly, the models for the contributing factors were developed and validated using separate datasets. The validation results indicated that the models for the dynamical contributing factors are effective in predicting the minimum PRT and the maximum acceleration and deceleration rates under various speed conditions. Specifically, the minimum PRT is a function of individual vehicle's speed; and the maximum deceleration and acceleration rates are functions of both the individual vehicle's speed and the intersection approach's 85 th percentile speed. The final evaluation compared the dynamical dilemma zone with the traditional dilemma zone model, and the Type II dilemma zone model calibrated based on the same trajectory data used for developing the dynamical dilemma zone model. As expected, the evaluation results indicated that the dynamical dilemma zone model estimated the dilemma zone more accurately than the traditional dilemma zone model and the Type II dilemma zone model. This innovation brings advancement in empirical understanding and theoretical modeling of the dynamics of DZ and hence provides theoretical support for developing more efficient and effective dilemma zone protection strategies in the future...|$|E
40|$|Because many freeways in the U. S. {{and abroad}} are being reconstructed or rehabilitated, it becomes {{increasingly}} important {{to plan and}} design freeway work zones with the utmost in safety and efficiency. Central to the effective design of work zones {{is being able to}} understand how drivers behave as they approach and enter a work zone area. While simple and complex microscopic models have been used over the years to analyze driver behavior, most models were not designed for application in work zones and thus do not capture the interdependencies between lane-changing and car-following vehicle movements along with the drivers’ cognitive and physical characteristics. With the use of psychology’s field theory, this dissertation develops a framework for creating vector-based, explanatory, deterministic microscopic models, to enhance our understanding of driver behavior in work zones and better aid freeway planners and designers. In field theory, an agent (i. e. the driver) views a field (i. e. the area surrounding the vehicle) filled with stimuli and perceives forces associated with each stimuli once these stimuli are internalized. Based on this theory, the new modeling framework, Modified Field Theory (MFT), is designed to directly incorporate drivers’ perceptions to roadway stimuli along with vehicle movements for drivers of different cognitive and physical abilities. From this framework, specific microscopic models, such as a simple freeway work zone car following model, can be created. It is postulated that models derived from this framework would more accurately reflect the driver decision-making process, naturally modeling the effects of external stimuli such as innovative geometric configurations, lane closures, and technology applications such as variable message boards. A simple freeway work zone car following model was created using the MFT framework. Two MFT car-following agents were created and calibrated. The second agent (Agent 2) followed the first agent (Agent 1) through a one-lane segment of freeway. Car-following data for Agent 2 was plotted on a graph of relative speed vs. distance to the lead vehicle, showing car-following behavior. Car-following behavior for Agent 2 was validated against Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC) Living Laboratory data for simple freeway work zone car-following (Driver 15). The car-following behavior of Agent 2 replicated the “spiraling” trend observed in Driver 15. Unlike other models (such as Wiedemann), this model does not ‘force’ these trends to occur; these trends occur naturally, {{as a result of the}} <b>perception-reaction</b> <b>time</b> delay and the nature of the forces involved. Additionally, unusual car following trends reported for Driver 15 were replicated in Modified Field Theory when conditions surrounding each event were synthetically recreated. Results demonstrated that the Modified Field Theory framework can successfully replicate the process by which a driver scans the driving environment and reacts to their surroundings. Microscopic models can successfully be created using this framework. Results demonstrated that models created from this framework naturally recreate behavioral trends observed in empirical data, and that these models are capable of replicating driving behavior in unusual scenarios, such as the car following behavior of a subject vehicle when the lead vehicle has a strong sudden acceleration event. Before this model can be applied to work zones, other calibration and validation efforts are required...|$|E
