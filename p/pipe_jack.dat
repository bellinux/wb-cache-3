The current interest in the technology {{is the result of}} increased activities to create underground installations such as the wastewater and surface water collection network, which in addition to high water tables, face the problem of landslide and problematic soil conditions. The most important and expensive parts of Microtunneling technology is concerned with <b>pipe</b> <b>jack</b> excavation method, shaft construction and any ground support systems to be used. Shaft is a point that cutting machine starts to excavate and imposed force on the back of pipes.

40|$|While {{much money}} and effort has been spent by {{manufacturers}} and users of pipe jacking equipment to develop suitable techniques, this work {{appears to be the}} first to study the method at full scale, in a scientific research programme. It has involved monitoring a series of five pipe jacks during construction. In each case a heavily instrumented pipe was incorporated into the pipe string to measure pipe joint stresses, pipe and joint compressions and contact stresses between pipe and ground. Total jacking loads and movements of the pipe string were also measured and all results correlated with a detailed site log, full tunnel alignment surveys, and observed ground conditions. The success of the site monitoring has been highly dependent upon the development of a suitable instrumentation and data acquisition system in conjunction with appropriate site procedures for working in the restricted and physically demanding <b>pipe</b> <b>jack</b> environment without undue disruption to normal site operations. The build up of total jacking force is the result of highly complex soil-pipe interaction. The local interface stresses are essentially frictional in most ground conditions, and can be related to the shear strength of the ground. The problem is in determining the effective radial stresses which are affected by soil insitu stresses, stiffness and strength; groundwater conditions; rate of progress; pipeline misalignment and use of lubricants. Relations between pressure distributions at pipe joints and measured tunnel alignments are presented. That small angular deviations between successive pipes cause severe localisation of stresses on their ends is clearly demonstrated. Careful back analysis shows that the linear stress approach of the Concrete Pipe Association of Australia can adequately match the measured stresses and could be used by pipe manufacturers to provide design data on allowable jacking forces for pipes on the basis of pipe size, packer properties, concrete strength and angular alignment. It is also clear from the small pipe barrel stresses that improved packing materials would allow more of the potential strength of pipes to be achieved. Since relative angular than absolute deviations control transfer mechanisms between pipes, uncritical adherence to specifications based on absolute line and level is counter-productive...|$|E

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn this research work, {{a comprehensive review of}} investigations into <b>pipe</b> <b>jacking</b> operations, and in particular the forces generated during the process, is presented. The factors affecting these forces were examined and their influence was studied in order to give a clear indication on the their magnitude and behaviour. A model scale testing facility, based on a 1. 8 m X 1. 5 m X 1. 5 m high steel tank, has been developed together with hydraulic jacking facilities and scale model pipes of 200 mm diameter having both steel and concrete surfaces. In this facility the actual <b>pipe</b> <b>jacking</b> operation can be simulated, so that a study of the jacking forces could be made with the use of appropriate instrumentation techniques and computerised data recording. A series of tests was conducted to examine the influence of several parameters on the jacking forces, such as overcut ratio, type of soil, type of pipe surface, overburden pressure, and the rate of jacking. These parameters were in relation to the distance jacked. Two granular soils, uniformly graded Leighton Buzzard sand and well-graded River sand, were used as the material surrounding the pipeline, that is the material through which the <b>pipes</b> were <b>jacked.</b> Laboratory analysis on the soil materials was conducted and the relationship between results obtained from these tests and scale model testing were established. The interface friction between the surface of the pipeline and the surrounding soil was determined. The results show a peak in the jacking forces {{at the start of the}} jacking process, followed by a decrease and leveling off as the jacking continued. The graph is very similar to the stress/strain relationship of a typical granular soil. Both steel and concrete pipes were used in the tests to detennined the influence of pipe surface, and to a lesser degree pipe joint, characteristics. Higher forces were recorded for concrete <b>pipes.</b> The <b>jacking</b> rate was kept constant and consistent for all tests. It was found to have little effect on the magnitude of the jacking forces. The jacking forces were measured automatically using a computer. The results show a clear trend of increase in the jacking forces when the overburden pressure and jacking length were increased. Tests using different overcut ratios have indicated that a minimum jacking force might be achieved at a specific overcut ratio. The results of this research show that the jacking forces are influenced by a number of parameters. These include the overburden pressure, overcut ratio, <b>pipe</b> diameter, <b>jacking</b> length and the influence of the surrounding material.

As <b>pipe</b> <b>jacking</b> has becomes more commonplace, engineers are pushing {{the limits of the}} technology more and more by designing longer drives in more difficult ground conditions. Lubrication is essential to reduce the frictional resistance generated at the pipe-soil interface. Even though lubrication is widely utilized, there is not a clear understanding of the conditions required to obtain the full benefit of lubrication. This dissertation focuses on bentonite slurry characteristics and interface behavior under different lubricating conditions with the goal to further the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the large friction reductions observed in the field. An interface shear device capable of measuring interface behavior on pipe surfaces was used to perform tests under two lubricating conditions. Pipes were sheared against a mixture of sand and slurry and the effect of the slurry was quantified. In another series of tests, slurry was injected at the pipe-soil interface. An axisymmetric interface shear device was developed to further investigate the lubrication mechanism associated with injection of slurry into sand. The device was designed to inject slurry through injection ports built into a shaft displaced within a sealed sand-filled chamber. A series of tests were performed on dry sand as well as sand where water or slurry was injected during shearing. The effect of sand type and viscosity are also investigated. Findings from the experimental studies are related back to full-scale behavior with the objective of assessing the lubrication methods and their effectiveness. A rational procedure for predicting non-lubricated and lubricated jacking forces is proposed to optimize design and serve as a framework for evaluating jacking forces in the field. Ph. D.

40|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>jacking</b> is a trenchless {{construction}} {{technique for}} {{the installation of}} underground pipelines. Although <b>pipe</b> <b>jacking</b> is widely used, fundamental research is still needed to understand fully the factors affecting the process and to prevent unexpected failure. With the time and financial limitation, {{it is difficult to}} explore all aspects of these factors with experiments; and it is also difficult to study them by analytical methods because of the complexity of the problem. This thesis describes the use of the finite element technique to study the pipe performance under different environments and the laboratory tests of several different joint designs. The emphasis of the current research is on the performance of the concrete <b>pipes</b> during <b>jacking</b> under working conditions and to seek possible improvements in the design of pipes and pipe joints by numerical modelling. In the finite element modelling, a simplified two-dimensional model is used for a preliminary study, then the analyses are carried out with three-dimensional models A, B and C representing a complete pipe, a pipe with surrounding soil and a symmetric three-pipe system respectively. Several factors affecting the pipe performance have been examined, for example, the properties of the packing material, the stiffness of the surrounding soil, the misalignment angle at the pipe joint, and the interaction between the pipe and surrounding soil. The numerical results show that the misalignment of the pipe is the dominating factor inducing both tensile stresses and localized compressive stresses in the concrete pipe, especially with a high misalignment angle which results in separation between packing material and the pipe. The packing materials with high Poisson's ratio and high stiffness also induce higher tensile stresses in the pipe, and the influence of Poisson's ratio is significant. Under 'diagonal' loading, both the stiffness of the surrounding soil and the interaction between the pipe and the surrounding soil {{have a significant effect on}} the stresses within the concrete pipe. Under 'edge' loading, the greatest potential damage is at the pipe joint due to the tensile stresses in the hoop direction; while under 'diagonal' loading, the damage is most likely the cracking on the external surface of the pipe along a line connecting the two diagonal loaded corners. The results show that the Australian model gives somewhat good prediction about the maximum normal stress and the diametrical contact width at pipe joint. Based on the numerical results, several different joint designs for improving the pipe strength have been proposed and tested in the laboratory. Both the laboratory tests and the back analyses suggest that the local reinforcement and the local prestressed band at the pipe joint will improve the pipe strength...|$|R

This research represents the preliminary stage of a research project on Soil Conditioning Agents in <b>Pipe</b> <b>Jacking</b> and Mechanised Tunnelling, sponsored by the <b>Pipe</b> <b>Jacking</b> Association (PJA) and three water companies. The experimental work was carried out in order to evaluate the fundamental soil properties of foamed sand, in particular its compressibility, permeability and shear strength. The first chapter deals with the basic aspects of soil conditioning agents and their application to tunnelling, and provides an understanding of the fundamentals of foam behaviour. An introduction to the problems encountered in tunnelling is given. A brief study of foams and their properties is presented and the role of foams as soil conditioning agents is described. In the second chapter, a description of the foam generator used is provided. Two types of sand (fine and coarse), four types of foaming agents and a specific polymer mixture were employed for the testing. In some cases, sodium bentonite was used alone or in combination with foam and polymer. The sample preparation method, together with the results from measuring the reduction of the power input required to mix sand with foam, are presented. The third chapter presents the compression tests performed in a 75 mm Rowe cell. Results are presented as volume changed variation with the applied vertical stress. Quality control was carried out on the test results in order to evaluate the likely inconsistencies during the preparation and measurements. The most notable outcome was that for fine sand even at high pressure the final voids ratio of foam/sand mixtures after the compression remained higher than the maximum voids ratio of dry sand. Some measurements of the foam/sand mixtures permeability were also performed in the Rowe cell. Tests were carried out using the constant head principle with a "Marriotte bottle". Permeability values determined from testing are compared with indirect evaluation from the compression tests. In the fourth chapter direst shear tests in a standard shear-box are presented. Fine and coarse sand mixed with foam were test in shear under seven different vertical loads. Results are presented as plots of shear strength against horizontal deformation. Very low values of shear strength for foamed sand tests are recorded. The shear strength is plotted against the relative density index along with the experimental results from Bolton's correlation. Foamed sand shear strength values are scattered within a range below that of Bolton's Correlation. Finally, the conclusions form the test results are discussed...|$|R

The main objective was to collect information on jacking loads and stresses at the pipe-soil interface to provide a better basis for future designs. This was achieved by building twelve stress cells -capable of measuring total normal stresses, shear stresses and pore pressures - into the wall of a standard concrete <b>jacking</b> <b>pipe</b> that could be inserted anywhere in the <b>pipe</b> string. <b>Jacking</b> loads and forward movement of the pipe string were simultaneously recorded and the results were correlated against site activities, including lubrication operations, and tunnel alignment surveys. Another objective was to monitor the ground response by measuring displacements around the tunnel and ground pressures above the perpendicular to the intended line. Ground movements were measured using conventional surveying techniques for surface settlements, and inclinometer access tubes for sub-surface deformation. On one scheme, electro-levels were employed in a near-horizontal tube to measure centre line settlement as the tunnel bore advanced. Push-in spade cells and pneumatic piezometers were installed on two schemes to measure the change in horizontal pressures {{with the passage of the}} shield. Because of the myriad data collected, it has only been possible to present a summary of the results obtained. Jacking force records from all the monitored schemes - including the previous fieldwork stage - are presented. The pattern of jacking load build up and the magnitude of frictional resistance can differ significantly according to the type of ground and use of lubricants. Stress measurements at the pipe-soil interface show that the interaction between jacking loads, pipeline misalignment, stoppages, lubrication, excavation technique etc, is highly complex. Ground movement measurements compared to well established empirical predictive methods show that short-term displacements are related to ground losses caused by closure of the overbreak void between shield and pipe...|$|R
