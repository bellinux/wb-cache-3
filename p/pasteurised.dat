5|$|John Smith's Extra Smooth (3.6% ABV). The highest selling variant, {{available}} in kegs and cans. It is nitrogenated and <b>pasteurised.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1993, John Smith's Extra Smooth was {{launched}} in cans. It was introduced in kegs in February 1995, and distributed to 10,000 pubs and venues. It is a nitrogenated version of the <b>pasteurised</b> beer, which was renamed to John Smith's Original in order to differentiate the two products.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Guinness {{introduced}} the beer widget, a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system. The words draft and draught {{can be used}} as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a beer widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than <b>pasteurised.</b>|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a bottle}} {{conditioned}} beer, FES has been <b>pasteurised</b> to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, {{in an attempt}} to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high lactic acid content. Finally, the beer is allowed to mature in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.|$|E
5|$|Whitbread bought Boddingtons Brewery in 1989 and Boddingtons Bitter {{received}} an increased marketing budget and nationwide distribution. Boddingtons achieved its peak {{market share in}} 1997 {{and at the time}} was exported to over forty countries. Boddingtons beer brands are now owned by the global brewer Anheuser–Busch InBev which acquired the Whitbread Beer Company in 2000. Strangeways Brewery closed in 2004 and production of <b>pasteurised</b> (keg and can) Boddingtons was moved to Samlesbury in Lancashire. Production of the cask conditioned beer moved to Hydes Brewery in Moss Side, Manchester, until it was discontinued in 2012, ending the beer's association with the city.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s White Shield {{had become}} a cult drink brewed in small {{quantities}} for a dedicated following; production in 1965 was just 15,000 barrels as drinkers switched to filtered and <b>pasteurised</b> bottled and keg beers. It found renewed popularity in the early 1970s as the demand for real ale grew, but lost this position as cask ale became easier to find. Bass moved production from Burton to their Hope & Anchor brewery in Sheffield in 1981. The Hope & Anchor brewery closed in 1992, and production was moved to Cape Hill in Birmingham, before being contracted to King and Barnes of Sussex in 1998. By this time, production was down to just 1,000 barrels a year, and the beer's long-term survival was in doubt. The King and Barnes brewery closed in 2000, and production moved to the Bass owned White Shield microbrewery in Burton upon Trent.|$|E
25|$|The Methodist Church {{has long}} used non-alcoholic wine (grape juice) in {{the sacrament of}} Holy Communion. In 1869, an American Methodist dentist named Thomas Welch {{developed}} a method of <b>pasteurising</b> grape juice {{in order to produce}} an unfermented communion wine for his church. He later founded Welch's grape juice company. By the 1880s, this non-alcoholic wine had become commonplace in Methodist churches worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|Watney's Red Barrel was {{a bitter}} which sold highly in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s. It was {{introduced}} in 1931 as an export keg beer that could travel for long distances by being made stable through filtering and <b>pasteurising</b> - as such {{it was the first}} keg beer. It was renamed as [...] "Red" [...] in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Buckler {{is a low}} alcohol (0.5% abv) pale lager. It was {{launched}} {{in the summer of}} 1988, and is distributed worldwide. There was a recall in 2004 due to a fault in the <b>pasteurising</b> process. Buckler is no longer available in the Netherlands (Heineken's home market) after the brand's image declined following Dutch comedian Youp van 't Hek mocking the brand (and its consumers) in a show in 1989.|$|R
5|$|Worthington's Creamflow (3.6% ABV) is {{the twelfth}} highest selling {{beer in the}} United Kingdom, with an {{estimated}} 640,000 hectolitres sold in 2012. It is the third highest selling ale brand in the United Kingdom after John Smith's and Tetley's. It is the highest selling ale in Wales, where it has a 20 per cent volume share, and has held pole position since at least 1999. Most of the sales consist of the nitrogenated and <b>pasteurised</b> Creamflow, which was launched in 1995 and is available in kegs and cans. Cask conditioned Worthington's Cask is made from Northdown and Challenger hops, brewing sugar and pale malt. Modest amounts of a 4% keg bitter known as Worthington's Ale continue to be brewed for the Teesside market.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011, Heineken {{sold the}} McEwan's beer brands to Wells & Young's for around £20 million, and {{production}} of McEwan's Best Scotch and canned and bottled brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed to reintroduce McEwan's as a cask ale brand and launch an expanded premium bottled range. Together with the Younger's brands McEwan's generates £80 million of sales annually in the UK, and McEwan's is now the largest Wells & Young's brand. It is the highest-selling ale brand in Scotland where it has a 20 per cent market share. Like most largely <b>pasteurised</b> ale brands in the UK {{it has been in}} a state of managed decline. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small amount is exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of McEwan's Export in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden ale called McEwan's Gold. In 2013, export sales to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013 McEwan's Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan's beers began to be sold in France in April 2013. The bottled beers McEwan's Amber and Signature were launched in July 2013.|$|E

50|$|As {{a direct}} result of the {{contamination}} of the blood supply in the late 1970s and early/mid-1980s with viruses such as hepatitis and HIV, new methods were developed in the production of clotting factor products. The initial response was to heat-treat (<b>pasteurise)</b> plasma-derived factor concentrate, followed by the development of monoclonal factor concentrates, which use a combination of heat treatment and affinity chromatography to inactivate any viral agents in the pooled plasma from which the factor concentrate is derived. The Lindsay Tribunal in Ireland investigated, among other things, the slow adoption of the new methods.|$|R

5000|$|The {{business}} {{was founded in}} 1957 by William Davies (1929-2014) of Llanybydder. Davies was from a dairy farming family and saw an opportunity to sell milk locally. Using the family farm, Llygadenwyn, as a base, he started delivering milk to local homes and eventually to other milkmen in the wider locality. The business grew {{over the years and}} in the 1960s moved to a building in the centre of Llanybydder to <b>pasteurise</b> the milk. In 1965 the business re-located and was expanded as turnover grew. William Davies's son, Timothy Davies subsequently took over management of the business.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned seed pretreatments, seed germination is also assisted when disease-free soil is used. Especially when trying to germinate difficult seed (e.g. certain tropical fruit), prior treatment of the soil (along with the usage of the most suitable soil; e.g. potting soil, prepared soil or other substrates) is vital. The two most used soil treatments are pasteurisation and sterilisation. Depending on the necessity, pasteurisation is to be preferred as this does not kill all organisms. Sterilisation can be done when trying to grow truly difficult crops. To <b>pasteurise</b> the soil, the soil is heated for 15 minutes in an oven of 120 °C.|$|R
5000|$|The place {{retains a}} number of {{elements}} integral to {{the function of the}} place as a butter (and later milk <b>pasteurising</b> and bottling) factory, including the 1929-30 factory building, an early factory office building, several cold stores, a [...] single-storeyed company administration building with two-storeyed extensions erected 1948-1950, a 1938 re-tinning shed, an ice shed and a store erected during the Second World War, and sections of the 1914/1923 railway siding. These elements are important in illustrating the principal characteristics of an early to mid 20th century dairy factory with company headquarters and important links to a principal railway network and to overseas port facilities.|$|R

25|$|Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT), {{is a type}} of milk {{processing}} where all bacteria are destroyed with high heat to extend its shelf life for up to 6 months, as long as the package is not opened. Milk is firstly homogenized and then is heated to 138 degrees Celsius for 1–3 seconds. The milk is immediately cooled down and packed into a sterile container. As a result of this treatment, all the pathogenic bacteria within the milk are destroyed, unlike when the milk is just <b>pasteurised.</b> The milk will now keep for up for 6 months if unopened. UHT milk {{does not need to be}} refrigerated until the package is opened, which makes it easier to ship and store. But in this process there is a loss of vitamin B1 and vitamin C and there is also a slight change in the taste of the milk.|$|E
25|$|Broadly speaking, cask ale brewing {{starts the}} same as that of keg beer. The same brew run could be used to make cask, keg, and bottled beer. The {{difference}} is what happens after the primary fermentation is finished and the beer has been left to condition. Typically keg and bottled beers are either sterile-filtered or <b>pasteurised</b> or both, but beer destined for cask is simply 'racked' (poured) into the cask in its natural state. Finings are usually placed in the cask to assist 'dropping' the yeast giving a clear beer. Extra hops and priming sugar may also be added. The cask is sealed and sent off to the pub. In this state it is like a bottle-conditioned beer and, like bottle-conditioned beers, the beer will continue to develop for a certain period of time. Also like bottle-conditioned beers, the length of time the beer can last in the cask will depend on the nature of the beer itself: unopened, stronger beers can last for months; light, delicate beers need to be tapped and sold quickly. Stronger beers may also need longer to settle and mature. Some pubs have been known to keep very strong beers in a sealed cask for a year or more to allow them to fully develop.|$|E
40|$|Here's {{yet another}} way to get more {{by-products}} out of cocoa. Did you know that from the pulp of the fruit you could make delicious refreshing drinks, jam, jellies, wine, and vinegar? This can {{be a way to}} make some more money during the cocoa harvest without any large investment. This method for making fresh cocoa juice was developed by women's groups in the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. After harvesting, they open the pods and put the bean and pulp in jute sacks, which they twist to extract the juice. They then filter and bottle the juice, adding water (one measure of water for each measure of juice), a small cupful of sugar, and the juice of a lemon. But the fresh juice with its sugar content cannot be kept long in the tropical climate. To <b>pasteurise</b> the juice, the women first pour it into clean, washed bottles (still warm) and close them immediately. They then place the bottles in a bain-marie, which is a container of water that is kept hot by placing it in another container of almost boiling water (70 - 80 °C, measured with a thermometer). It takes about 20 minutes to <b>pasteurise</b> a bottle of 750 - 1000 ml.

40|$|We {{report on}} two {{children}} with Escherichia coli O 157 infection, {{one of whom}} developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). Both had drunk raw cows or goats milk in the week before their illness. Molecular subtyping identified a sorbitol fermenting Escherichia coli O 157 :H isolate from a dairy cow. This isolate differed from Shiga toxin producing O 157 :H strains isolated from the 6 year old boy with HUS. This result underlines the need to search for other causes of infection, despite documented consumption of unpasteurised milk. In the second patient, human sorbitol non-fermenting O 157 :H isolates and animal isolates from goats were indistinguishable. The isolation of indistinguishable sorbitol non-fermenting Escherichia coli O 157 :H from contact animals supports the association between HUS and consumption of raw goats milk, and re-emphasises the importance of <b>pasteurising</b> milk...|$|R

The canned variant, launched in 1991, contains a widget to give the beer a creamy white head. The beer's ABV was reduced from 3.8% to 3.5% in late 2008. On draught in the United Kingdom it is typically served at 5 to 7 degrees Celsius, although an Extra Cold variant served at 3 to 5 degrees Celsius has been available since 2006. Its taste, or perceived lack of it, has been criticised by some, with Andrew Jefford describing it as a [...] "blandly foamy nitrokeg travesty of the original [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Today, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} modern methods for making clotted cream. The [...] "float cream method" [...] includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for {{up to an hour}} it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The [...] "scald cream method" [...] is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to <b>pasteurised</b> for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.|$|E

50|$|Ryazhenka {{is made by}} <b>pasteurising</b> {{milk and}} then {{simmering}} it on low heat for eight hours or longer. Historically, this was done by placing a clay pot (glechik or krinka) with milk in the traditional Russian oven for a day until it is coated with a brown crust. Prolonged exposure to heat causes the Maillard reaction between the milk's amino acids and sugars, resulting {{in the formation of}} melanoidin compounds that give it a creamy color and caramel flavor. A great deal of moisture evaporates, resulting in a change of consistency. In household production, sour cream (smetana) is subsequently added to trigger fermentation. In modern industrial production, pure thermophile bacterial cultures (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) are used instead. The mixture is then kept in a warm place. The fermentation occurs at temperatures above ca. 40 °C / 100 °F and usually takes from three to six hours.|$|R
