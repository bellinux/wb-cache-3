40|$|There exists {{an inverse}} {{relationship}} between the rate of molecular evolution {{and the level of}} gene expression. Among the many explanations, the “toxic-error” hypothesis is a most general one, which posits that <b>processing</b> <b>errors</b> may often be toxic to the cells. However, toxic errors that constrain the evolution of highly expressed genes are often difficult to measure. In this study, we test the toxic-error hypothesis by using microRNA (miRNA) genes because their <b>processing</b> <b>errors</b> can be directly measured by deep sequencing. A miRNA gene consists of a small mature product (≈ 22 nt long) and a “backbone. ” Our analysis shows that (i) like the mature miRNA, the backbone is highly conserved; (ii) the rate of sequence evolution in the backbone is negatively correlated with expression; and (iii) although conserved between distantly related species, the error rate in miRNA processing is also negatively correlated with the expression level. The observations suggest that, as a miRNA gene becomes more highly (or more ubiquitously) expressed, its sequence evolves toward a structure that minimizes <b>processing</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} {{information}} {{and the possibility of}} speculation are examined in an environment with unawareness. Although agents have “correct ” prior beliefs about events they are aware of and have a clear understanding of their available actions and payoffs, their unawareness may lead them to commit information <b>processing</b> <b>errors</b> and to behave suboptimally. As a result, more information is not always valuable and agents can speculate with each other. We identify two specific information <b>processing</b> <b>errors</b> that are responsible for both problems. Moreover, we construct a dynamic model where agents announce their posteriors and update their awareness as soon as they hear a counterfactual announcement. We study how awareness is updated and whether agreement about posteriors is reached. ...|$|R

50|$|In 2007 WUWT readers alerted Stephen McIntyre to a {{discrepancy}} in temperature records {{published by the}} Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) {{based on data from}} United States Historical Climate Network. In August 2007, McIntyre notified GISS about the problematic numbers, which GISS acknowledged and promptly corrected. The change did not affect global temperature trends, but did have the marginal effect of changing the hottest year on record for the contiguous United States to 1934, rather than 1998 as had previously been shown. In a formal acknowledgement, GISS stated that the minor data <b>processing</b> <b>error</b> had only affected the years after 2000, and noted that the contiguous United States represents only 1.6% of the Earth's surface. The result was a statistical tie between the years 1934, 1998 and 2005 as the warmest years to date for these U.S. states, with 1934 warmest by only around 0.01 °C which was well within the margin of uncertainty.|$|E

50|$|During {{the very}} early 1970s, the LSI-1 was developed, a single board {{low-cost}} 16-bit computer. To achieve the ambitious goals, the company ventured into development of full-custom LSI chips: a 4-bit slice arithmetic logic unit and 3-chip control unit. The control unit was based on programmable logic arrays (PLA). The control unit PLA transformed the machine instructions and events into series of microinstructions to operate the ALU and related functions. The concept was conceived by Ken Gorman and was designed by Gorman and Roy Blacksher. Although the design was proven in the lab using first iteration chips, a disastrous <b>processing</b> <b>error</b> by chip foundry National Semiconductor during a bug-fix iteration caused a six-month schedule slip from which the project could not recover. Therefore, the LSI-1 never entered the marketplace. Gorman subsequently became manager of the Processor Development department and oversaw computer processor engineering through 1975. For one project, Gorman worked with AMD in the conceptualization of the Am2900 4-bit slice chip that was employed in Computer Automation's high-end processors and gained widespread acceptance in the marketplace.|$|E

If there was a <b>processing</b> <b>error,</b> the notification SHOULD be sent immediately upon detection of the error to the Push Initiator and the message should not be sent to the client. Otherwise, the notification MUST be sent after the message delivery process has been completed. The delivery process is considered completed when the message is no longer a candidate for delivery, e.g. the message has expired. If the push submission is indicated as rejected in step two in figure 3, then no result notification will be sent.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Shipboard Uniform Automated Data Processing System (SUADPS) was {{designed in the}} late 1960 's to improve afloat supply management by utilizing automated data processing equipment. This system is still currently operational on the U. S. Navy's thirteen submarine tenders performing most of the basic clerical functions of supply. SUADPS {{in its present form}} is obsolete and requires substantial manual interfacing from initial document preparation to final processing and filing. Some of the adverse aspects of SUADPS manual interfacing are document <b>processing</b> <b>errors,</b> omissions and procedural deviations. If not adequately curbed, these aspects can degrade submarine tender supply effectiveness. Within a few years, system improvements will be made available to the fleet to alleviate some of the deficiencies incorporated in the present system.
