40|$|A new {{technique}} is described which couples median filtering and image deblurring techniques to filter noisy images without introducing defocusing side effects. To deal with colour images a vector median filtering procedure is proposed. Using this procedure a better edge preserving filter is obtained {{which does not}} introduce new colours. The deblurring operation is performed componentwise by fitting an ARMA model to the image. The AR part of the model estimates the image and the <b>MA</b> <b>part</b> estimates the blurring function. Finally, the <b>MA</b> <b>part</b> is inverted and applied to remove the blur introduced by the median filter...|$|R
