40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to place the {{writings}} of Charles Lamb in the context of his age. His work is assessed in relation to that of his friends and contemporaries, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Keats and Hazlitt, in order to ascertain how far he shared their characteristic preoccu- <b>pations.</b> Because of its central significance in the writings of the early English Romantics, and its problem- atic role in Lamb's own works, the concept of the imagination is employed as an unifying theme for this investigation. The introduction summarizes the history of Lamb r s reputation, and details in particular the fluctuations in critical opinion on the question of whether or not he can be considered a Romantic. In chapter one, Lamb's early relationship with Coleridge is described and its effects upon his imaginative development analyzed. The second chapter concerns itself with the damnation imagery rife throughout Lamb's work; what he makes of the theme is compared with its use in other contemporary writings. In chapter three, another characteristic subject of Lamb's, the glorification of childhood, is similarly analyzed and considered in the context of his age. The next three chapters deal primarily with Lamb's criticism. Chapter four illustrates his critical grasp and appreciation of the central Romantic concept of the imagination as an enhancer of consciousness. His strictures against the extreme 'egotistical sublime' aspects of Romanticism are detailed in the following chapter, mainly in relation to his criticisms of Wordsworth. His close involvement with another category of imaginative activity, the sympathetic imagination, is described in chapter six, and claims are made for his innovative function in its development. The final chapter relates the earlier findings to the Essays of Elia and concludes that a study of Lamb's writings may help to correct imbalances in the conventional idea of the spirit of the age. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims at {{influences of}} spiritual needs satisfaction at convalescence of clients. These needs are frequently omitted {{and this is}} still a tabooed topic in our society. That are why we wonder about the opinions of the ill and the attending staff referring such needs. The aim of the thesis was to find out the relation between satisfaction of spiritual needs and the attitude of the ill towards his/her disease and to find out the differences in motivation to heal by and between the believers and unbelievers. In the first part of my thesis you are at what needs are. Which are our needs and how they can be satisfied. A. H. Maslow was engaged in these problems. We also mention his pyramid. We deal in detail with the term of spiritual need. Each man is unique and that is why even the spiritual needs may be highly individual. At the moment when we fall ill and we must be hospitalised, a change of our life style occurs. As a consequence, we pay our attention to something supernatural [...] the God. Roman [...] Catholic is the most spread one in our country. That is why we aimed at clients of this religion. A nurse should have a basic knowledge of the most spread religion in our country. We mention the factors affecting spiritual needs in our thesis. In the course of his/her stay in the hospital, the ill may fully detach from his/her religious group and he/she may close up even in relation to health-care employees. But the most important feature is to identify the fact that the patient has some spiritual needs. Only after establishing it, we can help him/her to satisfy such needs. Not only priests, but even others may need to profess their religion. According to my opinion, the need is insufficiently discussed and even less is done for such needs satisfaction. The spiritual needs of the ill include keeping, improving or correction of ones religion. It is also the need of fulfilment of ones religious obligations, like for example Sunday divine service. A nurse should be able to assist the client with such obligations fulfilment, to offer him/her the possibility of the needs satisfaction and to inform him/her that she is able to assist her ill client even in this field. The results completed spiritual needs satisfaction are believing of clients markedly improvement their complete therapy. The personnel struggle for this need satisfying too.

Data includes pre- and post-interviews, audio recordings and visit fieldnotes. We characterised families’ experiences as falling into three discourses, as ‘disorientating’, ‘fun’ or ‘meaningful’ visits. Analysis identifies how the families’ experiences, and the likelihood of deriving science learning from the visit, were shaped through interactions of habitus and capital.

40|$|We propose {{and test}} a general {{equilibrium}} model in which longer working time and higher labor force participation lead to a fall in unemployment. Longer working hours and higher labor force participation have two direct effects: People have higher incomes and less (leisure) time. This has implications for the composition of consumer demand, since people spend less time on home production. Instead, they outsource more domestic tasks to the market. Consumer demand shifts toward unskill-intensive goods. The relative demand for unskilled labor rises and unemployment falls. We test our model in two ways: First, we study the link between labor market partici- <b>pation,</b> home production {{and the demand for}} household and similar services using the German time use survey conducted in 1991 / 92. Second, we use cross-country time- series data on OECD countries between 1980 and 2003 to directly examine the link between labor force participation and the unemployment rate. The empirical results corroborate the predictions from the theoretical model. ...|$|E

According to two different models of Europa’s internal structure, {{the thickness of}} the icy shell is a few km or a few ten km.

This acceleration differs according to the ratio of the Love number k 2 out of the dissi- <b>pation</b> rate Q, this latter depending on the icy shell’s thickness. Hence, a measurement of this acceleration should, in principle, allow us to decide between the two models. We studied Europa’s orbital motion by mean of numerical integration. Using least- squares method we quantified the influence of Europa’s tidal acceleration among the Galilean system, and compared it to the accuracy of the astrometric observations. The correlation, between Io’s and Europa’s tidal acceleration was found to be a crucial point...|$|E

40|$|Lakeside {{settlements}} can {{be regarded}} as a special type of archaeological site, as, thanks to their location near the shoreline, or even in the lake, various kinds of organic remains have been preserved under waterlogged conditions. This paper presents the results of six-studied Neolithic lake dwellings from Switzerland. A series of natural and anthropogenic site formation processes were identiﬁed through micromorphological analysis and have been compared with natural processes in peatlands. The main processes can be summarized as follows: in the littoral zone a carbonate lake marl stratum accumulated prior to construction of the settlement. During lake regressions, the shore platform be- came dry and the settlements were established. Throughout the period of occu- <b>pation,</b> anthropogenic processes led to the accumulation of organic layers. The depositional regime can be characterized as paludal, dominated by constant humidity, and rapid covering of the remains. Some parts of the anthropogenic accumulations have been affected by erosion and reworking processes as a re- sult of lake ﬂooding, and runoff from the hinterland. Finally, the degradation of organic matter occurred only during dry phases when the groundwater level dropped. Seasonality was of great importance in this kind of milieu throughout the various processes described above. Mikroarchäologie - Mikromorphologie - Sedimen...|$|E

The main focus is on testing the Refined Similarity predictions for the dependence on the local dissipation rate. In the dissipation sub-range there is clear evidence for RSH scaling at large values of the dissipation rate, but strong departures from RSH scaling at very small values. However, a detailed analysis of the dependence on Reynolds number of the results at small values of the local dissipation rate suggests a trend towards RSH scaling with increasing Reynolds number, but this can only be realized, if at all, for Taylor scale Reynolds numbers greater than 105. Within the inertial sub-range, there is limited evidence for RSH scaling, but again there is a trend towards more substantial scaling over a wider range of dis- sipation rates with increasing Reynolds number. The main conclusion is that RSH scaling may apply as an important theoretical constraint on the Lagrangian structure of turbulence in the large Reynolds number limit, but significant corrections to the theory exist at practical values of the Reynolds number...|$|E

One species of the subgenus Netelia {{and two of the}} sub- genus Paropheltes employed a venom causing weak (often incomplete) temporary paralysis, ad- ministered as a separate action prior to oviposition. The venoms had no long-term adverse effect on hosts and it appears that these taxa, and perhaps all other groups of ectoparasitic koinobiont Ichneumonidae, lack the host-regulating venom systems that have been regarded as instrumental in the evolution of endoparasitism in some koinobiont cyclostome Braconidae.

Subjects: Ten patients (5 males, mean age 12. 47 years, stand- ard deviation 1. 84 years) with different neurological gait disorders and 14 healthy children (7 males, mean age 11. 76 years, standard deviation 2. 75 years). Methods: All participants walked in the driven gait ortho- sis Lokomat® in 4 different randomly-assigned conditions. Biofeedback values calculated during swing phases were the primary outcome measure and secondary outcomes were derived from a questionnaire assessing the participant’s mo- tivation. Results: Findings revealed {{a significant main effect for}} train- ing condition in all participants (p< 0. 001), for patients (p< 0. 05) and for healthy controls (p< 0. 01). Overall, both virtual reality-assisted therapy approaches were equally the most effective in initiating the desired active participation in all children, compared with conventional training condi- tions. Motivation was very high and differed between the groups only in the virtual navigation condition. Conclusion: Novel virtual reality-based training conditions represent a valuable approach to enhance active partici- <b>pation</b> during robot-assisted gait training in patients and healthy controls...|$|E
