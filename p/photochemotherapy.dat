50|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT), {{sometimes}} called <b>photochemotherapy,</b> {{is a form}} of phototherapy involving light and a photosensitizing chemical substance, used in conjunction with molecular oxygen to elicit cell death (phototoxicity).

It is used clinically to treat a wide range of medical conditions, including wet age-related macular degeneration, psoriasis, atherosclerosis and has shown some efficacy in anti-viral treatments, including herpes. It also treats malignant cancers including head and neck, lung, bladder and particular skin.

40|$|Background  Patients with {{psoriasis}} undergoing {{or about}} to undergo ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy and <b>photochemotherapy</b> often have thick scale on their plaques which can prevent the penetration of UV radiation. Emollients {{are used to}} moisturize the skin and to prevent or reduce some of the milder side-effects (‘dryness’, itching) sometimes experienced during UV therapy. However, emollients can alter the UV transmission of skin and thus may alter the clinical effects of phototherapy and <b>photochemotherapy.</b> Objectives  We tested 30 of the topical emollients in the British National Formulary (BNF) using a standard in vitro technique used to test sunscreens. We also surveyed U. K. phototherapy units to establish routine practice for emollient use in phototherapy and <b>photochemotherapy.</b> Methods  We used a standard in vitro technique to measure the monochromatic protection factors (MPFs) of 30 non-bath emollients from the BNF. An application rate of 2 mg cm− 2 was used. For the assessment of effects during narrowband UVB (TL- 01) phototherapy, {{the mean of the}} protection factors at 310 and 315 nm was calculated; for psoralen plus UVA <b>photochemotherapy</b> the mean UVA protection factor was used. A questionnaire survey was used to assess routine practice concerning emollient use prior to phototherapies in phototherapy units throughout the U. K. Results  In the UVA range, 17 of the 30 emollients gave protection factors of 1 · 2 or above. In the UVB range, 23 of 30 had an MPF of 1 · 2 or above. Yellow soft paraffin had the highest protection factor in the UVB range. Of 78 centres surveyed, 57 returned completed questionnaires (73...|$|E

40|$|Extracorporeal <b>photochemotherapy</b> is a {{new form}} of {{immunotherapy}} which involves the extracorporeal photoinactivation of peripheral blood cells by 8 -methoxypsoralen in the presence of ultraviolet A irradiation, followed by readministration of the cells. To explore the efficacy of this therapy in the treatment of autoimmune disease, four patients with a lengthy history of corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drug-resistant pemphigus vulgaris were initiated on extracorporeal <b>photochemotherapy.</b> Three patients experienced a complete remission in cutaneous disease expression, permitting discontinuation of medications in two and a substantial decrease in the third.

Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease that involves the mucosal [I and cutaneous surfaces.

The Sn(IV)porphyrin was tested against a keratitis isolate of Acanthamoeba castellanii belonging to the T 4 genotype using growth and viability assays. The effects of Sn(IV)porphyrin on A. castellanii binding to and cytopathogenicity of human corneal epithelial cells in vitro were tested. The metalloporphyrin showed potent amoebistatic effects. The tin porphyrin inhibited amoebae binding to and cytopathogenicity of corneal epithelial cells.

40|$|Extracorporeal <b>photochemotherapy</b> is an {{effective}} treatment for cutaneous T cell lymphoma but {{its mode of action}} is uncertain. The reduction in viability of patients' photoirradiated buffy coat lymphocytes was correlated with a 35 % increase in DNA single-strand breaks and marked decreases in cellular ATP and NAD levels (to 58 and 34 % of control, respectively) immediately after photoirradiation. Complementary in vitro studies were conducted with normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes using a Therakos ultraviolet A (UVA) light box. UVA light was cytotoxic on its own but was potentiated by 8 -methoxysporalen. 3 -aminobenzamide, a poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitor, mitigated the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet A light in the presence of 8 -methoxypsoralen in lymphocytes and reduced the amount of nucleotide depletion they caused. 10 J/cm 2 of UVA light in the presence of 300 ng/ml 8 -methoxypsoralen increased the poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Exposing lymphocytes to deoxycoformycin and deoxyadenosine was found to induce biochemical and physical effects similar to those of <b>photochemotherapy.</b> In summary, we have shown that the lymphocytotoxic effect of extracorporeal <b>photochemotherapy</b> for cutaneous T cell lymphoma is apparently mediated by DNA damage, subsequent poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation and adenine nucleotide depletion.
