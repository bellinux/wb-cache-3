5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker <b>purple</b> colour.

Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
