40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} study the {{behavior}} of gate leakage current in a simple inverter. We make some important observations about the gate leakage in both PMOS and NMOS devices. We then study the trade off between power and delay in a standard inverter within a particular buffer chain when reducing {{the size of the}} <b>pull-down</b> <b>device.</b> In the last part of this paper, we present an alternate leakage suppressed inverter for driving large loads. We finally compare the performance of our proposed circuit with those of standard and scaled-down inverters and show that we can significantly reduce the standby power in certain situations with a modest reduction in speed.

40|$|The {{subthreshold}} {{leakage current}} characteristics of domino logic circuits is evaluated in this paper. The strong {{dependence of the}} subthreshold leakage current on the node voltages is discussed. In a standard low threshold voltage domino logic circuit with stacked <b>pull-down</b> <b>devices,</b> a charged state rather than a discharge state of the dynamic node is preferred for lower leakage current. Alternatively, the subthreshold leakage current of a dual threshold voltage domino logic circuit is significantly reduced provided that the dynamic node is discharged. A dual threshold voltage circuit has degraded noise immunity characteristics as compared to a standard low threshold voltage circuit. Both keeper and output inverter sizing are necessary to compensate for this degradation in noise immunity. An alternative dual threshold voltage domino circuit technique employing a low threshold voltage keeper for enhanced noise immunity is also considered in this paper. Under similar noise immunity conditions as compared to a standard low threshold voltage domino logic circuit, the savings in subthreshold leakage current offered by a dual threshold voltage circuit technique with a high threshold voltage keeper is {{significantly higher than the}} savings offered by a dual threshold voltage circuit technique with a low threshold voltage keeper...|$|R
40|$|Leakage {{currents}} in CMOS transistors have risen dramatically with technology scaling leading to {{significant increase in}} standby power consumption. Among the various transistor candidates, the excellent short channel immunity of Silicon double gate FinFETs have made them the best contender for successful scaling to sub- 10 nm nodes. For sub- 10 nm FinFETs, new quantum mechanical leakage mechanisms such as direct source to drain tunneling (DSDT) of charge carriers through channel potential energy barrier arising due to proximity of source/drain regions coupled with the high transport direction electric field is expected to dominate overall leakage. To counter the effects of DSDT and worsening short channel effects and to maintain Ion/ Ioff, performance and power consumption at reasonable values, device optimization techniques are necessary for deeply scaled transistors. In this work, source/drain underlapping of FinFETs has been explored using quantum mechanical device simulations as a potentially promising method to lower DSDT while maintaining the Ion/ Ioff ratio at acceptable levels. By adopting a device/circuit/system level co-design approach, it is shown that asymmetric underlapping, where the drain side underlap is longer than the source side underlap, results in optimal energy efficiency for logic circuits in near-threshold as well as standard, super-threshold operating regimes. In addition, read/write conflict in 6 T SRAMs and the degradation in cell noise margins due to the low supply voltage can be mitigated by using optimized asymmetric underlapped n-FinFETs for the access transistor, thereby leading to robust cache memories. When gate-workfunction tuning is possible, using asymmetric underlapped n-FinFETs for both access and <b>pull-down</b> <b>devices</b> in an SRAM bit cell can lead to high-speed and low-leakage caches. Further, it is shown that threshold voltage degradation {{in the presence of}} Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) is less severe in asymmetric underlap n-FinFETs. A lifetime projection is carried out assuming that HCI is the major degradation mechanism and it is shown that a 3. 4 x improvement in device lifetime is possible over symmetric underlapped n-FinFET. ...|$|R

So on a single channel, data bursts of four words per packet can deliver an effective throughput of 133 Mbit/s. With 16 words per packet, the throughput goes up to 178 Mbit/s.

40|$|X-ray {{astronomy}} {{is gaining}} importance for studying X-ray space {{sources such as}} single and binary stars, neutron stars, supernovae and black holes. Due to atmospheric absorption, X-ray telescopes must operate in space on satellites. Among the causes limiting the resolution of modern telescopes are distortions in mirrors shape. An innovative approach for X-ray mirrors aims at correcting the shape errors by means of piezo-ceramic actuators glued {{to the back of}} the mirrors, thus creating an “active mirror”. In order to test the viability of shape correction, we fabricated [1] a prototype of a thin glass active mirror, sized 20 cm x 20 cm with a 400 um thickness (Fig. 1). The mirror can allocate up to 25 piezo actuators connected to the external driving electronics by means of conductive paths, created on the back of the mirror by metal evaporation followed by a microlithographic process for selectively etching the metal. We also designed and built [2] a modular multichannel voltage amplifier (Fig. 2), driving up to 16 piezo actuators. At beginning we considered several high voltage monolithic operational amplifiers (OP AMP), capable of managing the specified output voltages (± 70 V). However all of them had to be ruled out due to their high quiescent currents, giving around 0. 35 W power dissipation per channel. So we used a different approach. Each channel consists of two stages (Fig. 3). The first stage is a conventional OP AMP, powered by a ± 12 V dual supply. It drives in push-pull the control LED’s of two high voltage optocouplers (TLP 627 by Toshiba), whose output transistors are connected in series between the ± 70 V dual supply. It recalls a “totem pole” configuration, where the two optocouplers act as pull-up and <b>pull-down</b> <b>devices.</b> As the OP AMP driving stage operates at low voltages, its power consumption is quite low. Moreover, the output stage, based on optocouplers, has a very low bias current (around 0. 1 mA), giving a power consumption of about 15 mW per channel. The voltage feedback, derived from the output voltage, guarantees the desired signal amplification and linearity. The amplifier has an overall voltage amplification of 11 and a bandwidth limited to 100 Hz, adequate to the typical control signals used to drive the piezo actuators, which are generated by an external 16 channels, 16 bit resolution, USB digital to analog converter. The amplifier also includes a “high voltage“ power supply, based on a micropower isolated flyback converter (LT 8300 by Linear Technology). Using a dual output transformer with a 1 : 5 : 5 winding ratio, it produces a ± 70 V dual voltage output starting from a single 12 V supply, with a nominal maximum output current of 4 mA. The whole 16 channels piezo driver thus only needs a ± 12 V supply. Thanks to the adopted strategies, the total power consumption for the 16 channel voltage amplifier has been measured to be within 0. 5 W...|$|R
