40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} four formats of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on the listening comprehension of EFL learners. To achieve this goal, 6 o homogeneous intermediate EFL learners were selected as the sample of the study. They were divided into four groups of fifteen. Each group received one format of the same listening test. The findings indicated that the full question <b>preview</b> <b>format</b> (FQP), answer option preview (AOP), and question stem preview (QSP) can have a facilitative effect on the listening comprehension of the EFL learners {{in comparison with the}} not-previewing format (NP); however, no significant difference was found between the three question previewing formats themselves (FQP, AOP, and QSP). These finding can be helpful for test developers, EFL teachers, and material designers...|$|E
30|$|Previous {{research}} shows that {{it is easier for}} EFL students to take a multiple-choice listening comprehension test if questions and options are both written on paper. Yanagawa and Green (2008) investigated three formats: (1) previewing both the question and options, (2) previewing the question, and (3) previewing the options. They used Part 3 of the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) listening section. The spoken texts were short conversations of 25 to 59 words. Japanese test takers of the TOEIC test sites in and around Tokyo were asked to participate in their study, and a total of 279 people volunteered. They found that question preview helps test takers produce more correct answers, while option preview does not lead to high scores. They suggested {{that in the case of}} an option <b>preview</b> <b>format</b> test, teachers should advise their students “not to give too much attention to answer options prior to listening, given the lack of any significant benefit from option preview” (Yanagawa and Green 2008, p. 120). Iimura (2010 a) compared four formats: (1) previewing both the question and options, (2) previewing the question, (3) previewing the options, and (4) previewing neither the question nor the options. A total of 40 Japanese university students participated in his study. He used materials taken from the Grade 2 EIKEN Test. 1 The experiment was conducted using a computer. In Format 1, for example, students saw both the question and options on the screen, and 10  seconds later they listened to a dialogue via headphones. Then they chose the answer by clicking on the button. The results showed that only the full preview and non-preview formats produced a statistically significant difference. He therefore mentioned that “format difference did not considerably affect listening performance” (p. 31). Further study was conducted by Chang and Read (2013), who compared two formats: (1) the written mode, which allowed the participants to preview both questions and options, and (2) the oral mode, which presented both items orally. The participants were 87 university students in Taiwan, who were divided into two groups. The materials were three types of spoken texts: dialogues with 6 – 9 utterances, conversations with 2 – 3 utterances, and short talks for about 20 – 30 seconds. One group took a test of which the first half was presented in oral mode and the rest in written mode. The other group took a test in which the order of the modes was reversed. The results showed that “students performed slightly better with the written mode” (Chang and Read 2013, p. 580), corresponding to grades of 66  % in the oral mode as opposed to 68  % in the written mode. They also mentioned that “the majority of participants considered test items in the written mode easier than in the oral mode” (Chang and Read 2013, p. 582) since 78  % of them answered that they preferred the written mode.|$|E

40|$|According to § 5 (2) of the Studien- und Prüfungsordnung DHBW Technik I hereby {{declare that}} this Bachelor thesis {{is the result}} of my own work, and that all {{information}} sources, literature references and citations used are indicated properly. Walldorf, 2. September 2010 Domain-specific languages can profit from automated refactorings just like general-purpose programming languages do. However, implementing a refactoring tool is challenging and therefore out of scope for most of the former. This thesis presents a refactoring infrastructure for a language workbench based on textual modeling concepts that mitigates this challenge. The infrastructure works for any kind of language defined within the workbench. It au-tomatically provides refactoring authors with undo/redo support, <b>preview</b> generation and <b>format</b> preserving updates of textual views. In addition, in the context of behavior preservation, it relives them from having to account for name bindings manually. The infrastructure is evaluated by the implementation of two refactorings: a mov...|$|R
