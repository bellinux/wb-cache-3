40|$|The N 170 is an event-related {{potential}} component {{reported to}} be very sensitive to human face stimuli. This study investigated the specificity of the N 170, {{as well as its}} sensitivity to inversion and task status when subjects had to categorize either human or animal faces in the context of upright and inverted natural scenes. A conspicuous N 170 was recorded for both face categories. Pictures of animal faces were associated with a N 170 of similar amplitude compared to pictures of human faces, but with delayed peak latency. <b>Picture</b> <b>inversion</b> enhanced N 170 amplitude for human faces and delayed its peak for both human and animal faces. Finally, whether processed as targets or non-targets, depending on the task, both human and animal face N 170 were identical. Thus, human faces in natural scenes elicit a clear but non-specific N 170 that is not modulated by task status. What appears to be specific to human faces is the strength of the inversion effect. article can be downloaded here:[URL]...|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} SO(10) {{symmetric}} instanton solutions in Type IIB supergravity is developed. The instanton of least {{action is a}} candidate for the low-energy, semiclassical approximation to the D= [...] 1 brane. Unlike a previously published solution,[GGP] this admits an interpretation as a tunneling amplitude between perturbatively degenerate asymptotic states, but with action twice that found previously. A number of associated issues are discussed such as the relation between the magnetic and electric <b>pictures,</b> an <b>inversion</b> symmetry of the dilaton and the metric, the R× S^ 9 topology of the background, and some properties of the solution in an "instanton frame" corresponding to a Lagrangian in which the dilaton's kinetic energy vanishes.

40|$|Abstract Background Polytene {{chromosome}} banding patterns {{have long been}} used by Drosophila evolutionists to infer degree of relatedness among taxa. Recently, nucleotide sequences have preempted this traditional method. We place the classical Drosophila evolutionary biology tools of polytene chromosome inversion analysis in a phylogenetic context and assess their utility in comparison to nucleotide sequences. Results A simultaneous analysis framework {{was used to examine}} the congruence of the chromosomal inversion data with more recent DNA sequence data in four Drosophila species groups – the melanogaster, virilis, repleta, and <b>picture</b> wing. <b>Inversions</b> and nucleotides were highly congruent with one another based on incongruence length difference and partitioned Bremer support values. Inversion phylogenies were less resolved because of fewer numbers of characters. Partitioned Bremer supports, corrected for the number of characters in each matrix, were higher for inversion matrices. Conclusions Polytene chromosome data are highly congruent with DNA sequence data and, when placed in a simultaneous analysis framework, are shown to be more information rich than nucleotide data. </p...|$|R
40|$|When {{pictures}} {{are placed in}} a stereoscope so that an impression of depth is given, such depth is inverted when the two <b>pictures</b> are Such <b>inversion,</b> reversed from left to right. however, does not occur in all cases, especially when photographs of faces are displayed. "Cognitive " factors are then assumed to override the binocular disparity cues of stereopsis. A. van den Enden and H. Spekreijse (1) offer a different explanation {{for the lack of}} inversion of faces. They note that a stereoscopic picture of a face offers two different sets of cues to depth, namely, binocular disparity and texture perspective-gradient...|$|R
40|$|The {{conductor}} operator acts on {{a function}} through multiplying {{it with the}} logarithm of the norm of the variable both in position and in momentum space and adding the outcomes. It makes sense at each completion of an arbitrary number field and arose in previous papers by the author where it was shown to be intimately connected with the Explicit Formula of Analytic Number Theory. I complete here its spectral analysis: the conclusion is that the local contribution to the Explicit Formula expressed as an integral over the critical line is completely equivalent to, indeed precisely realizes this spectral analysis. In this <b>picture</b> the <b>inversion</b> is related to complex conjugation, the additive Fourier transform {{is closely related to}} the Tate-Gel’fand-Graev Gamma function on the critical line, and the conductor operator itself is just the logarithmic derivative of the Gamma function, again on the critical line, acting as a multiplier. From this one gets that the conductor operator is not only dilation and Fourier invariant, which was obvious, but also inversion invariant. In this manner, an operator theoretic and spectral interpretation of each local contribution to the Explicit Formula on the critical line has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|Large-amplitude {{collective}} {{dynamics of}} shape phase transition in the low-lying states of 30 - 36 Mg is investigated by solving the five-dimensional (5 D) quadrupole collective Schroedinger equation. The collective masses and potentials of the 5 D collective Hamiltonian are microscopically derived {{with use of}} the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus local quasiparticle RPA method. Good agreement with the recent experimental data is obtained for the excited 0 + {{states as well as}} the ground bands. For 30 Mg, the shape coexistence picture that the deformed excited 0 + state coexists with the spherical ground state approximately holds. On the other hand, large-amplitude quadrupole-shape fluctuations dominate in both the ground and the excited 0 + states in 32 Mg, so that the interpretation of 'coexisting spherical excited 0 + state' based on the naive <b>inversion</b> <b>picture</b> of the spherical and deformed configurations does not hold.

40|$|Topological {{insulators}} are new quantum {{states with}} helical gapless edge or surface states inside the bulk band gap. These topological surface states are robust against the weak time-reversal invariant perturbations, such as lattice distortions and non-magnetic impurities. Recently {{a variety of}} topological insulators have been predicted by theories, and observed by experiments. First-principles calculations {{have been widely used}} to predict topological insulators with great success. In this review, we summarize the current progress in this field from the perspective of first-principles calculations. First of all, the basic concepts of topological insulators and the frequently-used techniques within first-principles calculations are briefly introduced. Secondly, we summarize general methodologies to search for new topological insulators. In the last part, based on the band <b>inversion</b> <b>picture</b> first introduced in the context of HgTe, we classify topological insulators into three types with s-p, p-p and d-f, and discuss some representative examples for each type.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} 2 mirror images as the same <b>picture</b> across left–right <b>inversions</b> exists early on in humans and other primates. In order to learn to read, however, one must discriminate the left–right orientation of letters and distinguish, for instance, b from d. We therefore reasoned that literacy may entail a loss of mirror invariance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we asked adult literates, illiterates, and ex-illiterates to perform a speeded same–different task with letter strings, false fonts, and pictures regardless of their orientation (i. e., they had to respond “same ” to mirror pairs such as “iblo oldi”). Literates presented clear difficulties with mirror invariance. This “mirror cost ” effect was strongest with letter strings, but crucially, it was also observed with false fonts and even with pictures. In contrast, illiterates did not present any cost for mirror pairs. Interestingly, subjects who learned to read as adults also exhibited a mirror cost, suggesting that modest reading practice, late in life, can suffice to brea...|$|R
