5|$|Susianna Kentikian {{was born}} in Yerevan, Armenian SSR, the {{daughter}} of veterinary doctor Levon Kentikian and his wife Makruhi. At the age of five, she left Armenia {{with her parents and}} her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at asylum seekers' homes. However, due to the violence at these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian went to school {{for a short period of}} time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in Hamburg, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's residence status remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.|$|E

40|$|The former Aliens Control Act 96 of 1991 {{has been}} {{repealed}} by the Immigration Act 13 of 2002 (s 54), which commenced on 12 March 2003. On 26 May 2014, {{amendments to the}} Immigration Act 13 of 2002 effected by the Immigration Amendment Act 3 of 2007 (GN 656 in GG 30095 dated 18 July 2007) and the Immigration Amendment Act 13 of 2011 (GN 690 in GG 34561 dated 26 Aug 2011) {{as well as the}} Regulations were implemented (GN R 413 in GG 37679 dated 22 May 2014). With regard to the issuing of <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> to a foreign spouse of a South African citizen or permanent resident under the former and now repealed Aliens Control Act, two aspects earlier came under scrutiny in the case of Dawood, Shalabi and Thomas v Minister of Home Affairs (2000 1 SA 997 (C), 2000 3 SA 936 (CC)). The first aspect related to a nonrefundable fee payable by foreign spouse applicants for immigration <b>permits</b> (now <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits).</b> The second issue concerned section 25 (9) (b) of the Aliens Control Act and, in particular, the question whether it was constitutional to require that an immigration permit could be granted to the spouse of a South African citizen who is in South Africa at the time only if that spouse is in possession of a valid temporary <b>residence</b> <b>permit.</b> Both aspects were declared to be inconsistent with the Constitution and thus invalid (see the discussion in par 4 3 below). The applicants, whose temporary <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> had expired, were therefore entitled to remain in South Africa pending the finalisation of their application for an immigration permit. Important to note for purposes of the discussion below, however, is the fact that when they got married, all three applicants were in the Republic legally.

40|$|Do {{we have a}} {{moral duty}} to offer {{severely}} ill asylum- seeking children <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits?</b> This thesis analyses our moral duty to offer 410 severely ill asylum-seeking children <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits.</b> During 2004 an emotionally charged debate started in Sweden. The debate concerned the deportation of 410 severely ill asylum- seeking children and their families. For this and other reasons Sweden was criticized by the United Nations commission along with human rights organizations for being too restrictive in its migration and asylum politics. My thesis outlines the migration and asylum debate and the refugee situation {{in the world at}} present together with facts about how the asylum procedure takes place in Sweden. Further I draw upon medical research connected to the asylum procedure along with how the Swedish Government and Save the Children respond to the migration and asylum debate. I also explore which rights, in terms of legal implications and ethical principles, these children have. Additional I outline theories in political philosophy from the utilitarian and communitarian tradition. The two philosophers I refer to are Michael Walzer and Peter Singer to apply their views to my primary question. Finally, I reach a critical analysis where I summarize and discuss my research. In the end I offer my final reflections in order to further debate on migration and asylum issues...|$|R
30|$|To our {{knowledge}} {{this is the}} first paper to study employers’ hiring choices between equally-qualified workers with and without <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> in the region of employment. Our main finding is that despite other evidence of taste-based discrimination against persons without permanent status (NLH) in China’s cities, {{and despite the fact that}} NLH workers likely have lower levels of destination-specific skills than natives, employers in our data are more likely to call back identically-matched NLH than LH applicants to the same job. Further, this preference for migrant workers is confined to situations where firms are seeking to fill less-skilled and lower-paid positions.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the severe}} {{restrictions}} {{on the number of}} Jews allowed to live in Hamburg (with the exception of the period of 1811-15,) until 1864, a major Jewish community developed in Altona starting in 1611, when Count Ernest of Schaumburg and Holstein-Pinneberg granted the first <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> to Ashkenazic Jews. Members did business both in Hamburg and in Altona itself. All that remains after the Nazi Holocaust during World War II are the Jewish cemeteries, but in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the community was a major center of Jewish life and scholarship. The Holstein-Pinneberg and later Danish Holstein had lower taxes and placed fewer civil impositions on their Jewish community than did the government of Hamburg.|$|R

A new visa law implemented that year, La Ley de Extranjeria, was quite restrictive, and did not provide for <b>permanent</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits.</b> In 1989, the Asociación de Trabajadores Inmigrantes Marroquíes en España was formed {{by a group of}} Moroccan workers to defend their working rights. As late as 1992, official statistics showed only 16,665 Moroccans residing in Spain (of whom 14,998 lived in peninsular Spain). In the following years, many Moroccans came to occupy jobs in the agricultural, hospitality, construction, and service sectors. By 2000, their population had increased to 201,182 individuals. Along with the growing numbers of migrants, their composition also shifted, with a higher proportion of women among them.|$|R
