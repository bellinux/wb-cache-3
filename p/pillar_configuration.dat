40|$|I {{believe that}} the {{permanent}} water courses, swamps, reservoirs and groundwater resources of NSW require far better protection from longwall mining than is currently occurring. I {{will go on to}} discuss this topic, but at this early stage it is worthwhile reflecting on exactly why it has become such an important issue at this particular point in time. The answer is in fact relatively simple, the recent efficiencies gained using longwall mining extraction techniques have actually come at a cost, one that is currently being borne by the environment (and taxpayers of NSW). As longwall mining panels have become wider and longer and in some cases the height of the seam worked has become higher, subsidence levels have increased dramatically- from much less than 1 m in many older longwall (and earlier bord and <b>pillar)</b> <b>configurations</b> to almost 3 m over the most recent Dendrobium workings. In turn the impacts associated with subsidence have also increased dramatically (eg Cataract River, Upper Georges River, Waratah Rivulet). If longwall top coal caving methodologies are introduced into NSW, these subsidence impacts are likely to increase even further. While longwall top coal caving may not be identified for use in the southern coalfields because of the generally narrower coal seams...|$|R

A Quantum Dot (QD) weakly coupled to the contacts and tuned in a valley between two conduction peaks (Coulomb Blockade (CB)), is insulating if its charging energy is larger than the thermal energy [1]. However, when the number of electrons at the dot, N, is odd, below a characteristic temperature scale TK, a strongly correlated state between the dot and the contacts sets in, and the typical Kondo resonance in the conduction electron spectral density builds up at the chemical potential of the contacts µ.

40|$|We propose an {{architecture}} for dramatically enhancing the stress bearing and energy absorption capacities of a polymer based composite. Different weight fractions of iron oxide nano-particles (NPs) are mixed in a poly(dimethylesiloxane) (PDMS) matrix either uniformly or into several vertically aligned cylindrical pillars. These composites are compressed up to {{a strain of}} 60 % at a strain rate of 0. 01 s(- 1) following which they are fully unloaded at the same rate. Load bearing and energy absorption capacities of the composite with uniform distribution of NPs increase by similar to 50 % upon addition of 5 wt% of NPs; however, these properties monotonically decrease with further addition of NPs {{so much so that}} the load bearing capacity of the composite becomes 1 / 6 th of PDMS upon addition of 20 wt% of NPs. On the contrary, stress at a strain of 60 % and energy absorption capacity of the composites with <b>pillar</b> <b>configuration</b> monotonically increase with the weight fraction of NPs in the pillars wherein the load bearing capacity becomes 1. 5 times of PDMS when the pillars consisted of 20 wt% of NPs.

40|$|Mining is the {{extraction}} of profitable minerals or other land materials from the earth, generally from a mineral body, vein or (coal) crease. Mining includes distinctive techniques like prospecting for metal bodies, dissecting the possibility of extraction, gainfulness of the operation, extraction of the sought materials. One of such systems is the Bord and Pillar system for mining {{which is one of}} the most established strategies for mining. The accomplishment of Bord and Pillar mining is selecting the ideal pillar size. In the event that the pillars are too expensive, then {{the extraction}} proportion abatements prompting less productivity and if the pillars are too little it jeopardizes the general mine wellbeing.

Variety of security element with width to stature proportion of pillar, extraction rate and profundity of spread has been dead set and conclusion has been made.

40|$|Occupant Restraint Systems (ORS) {{have been}} widely used in Public Service Vehicles (PSVs). A Wheelchair Tiedown and Occupant Restraint System (WTORS) has been {{developed}} to provide effective occupant protection for disabled people who are seated in wheelchairs. An international laboratory study had been conducted to produce a compliance test protocol that included specification of the sled deceleration versus time history and the crash pulse corridor. Currently effort at the international level is being focused through the International Standards Organisation (ISO) to produce standards for WTORS and transportable wheelchairs. Dynamic sled testing of WTORS was conducted in Middlesex University Road Safety Engineering Laboratory (MURSEL) to develop a test protocol in a WTORS System. This research has been concerned with the effects to which the occupant of a wheelchair secured by a WTORS is subjected in a frontal impact. Both occupant Forward Facing Frontal (FFF) and Rearward Facing Frontal (RFF) impact configurations have been considered. A Surrogate wheelchair with a tiedown restraint System, a Surrogate occupant restraint System, and an Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) were used to facilitate highly controlled tests. Production wheelchairs were also crash tested to validate the response of the Surrogate System. A 48 km/h- 20 g crash pulse falling within the ISO standard crash pulse corridor was specified. The Crash Victim Simulation (CVS), one of the computer modelling methods, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models were designed to study the dynamic response of a restrained wheelchair and its occupant in a crash environment. Two CVS computer packages: MADYMO®, DYNAMAN® and one of FEA programs: PAFEC were used in WTORS models to predict the occupant response during impacts and hence provide data to optimise future system design. A modelling protocol for WTORS was developed {{based on the results of}} ninety (90) sled tests of WTORS Surrogate system and forty (40) dynamic tests of production wheelchairs. To illustrate the potential of these models the results of simulations were validated by sled tests. A random effects Statistical method was used to quantify the results. The load-time histories were also traced to qualify the test and model results. A literature review highlighted twenty years of wheelchair crash research. The correlation between computer model and experimental results was made more accurately. The modelling technique of interconnection of FEA models into CVS program was also introduced. The velocity profile and the natural frequency of WTORS analysis were used to explain why the wheelchair and dummy experienced acceleration amplifications relative to the sled. The shoulder belt load at floor-mounted configuration was found to be higher than that at B <b>pillar</b> <b>configuration.</b> Energy principles were also applied to show why more compliant wheelchair tiedown Systems subjected restraints to a less severe crash environment. A decomposition of forces using the computer model showed why quasi-static analysis is insufficient in WTORS design.

40|$|Field {{emission}} is {{a phenomenon}} where electrons are extracted from a conducting material by an external electric field. This effect {{has been used for}} electron sources for many applications, from electron microscopes to flat-panel displays. One undesirable feature of field emitters is that they often require high turn-on voltages. One way to improve the field emission is to decrease the tip size. In previous works, single carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with nanometer tip sizes have been used as field emitters, and have achieved currents comparable or higher than commercial field emitters at relatively low operating voltages. However, the single CNT field emitters are not as mechanically robust as their commercial counterparts. In this presentation we will demonstrate different tip shapes formed by elastocapillary self-assembly on patterned CNT <b>pillars.</b> This novel <b>configuration</b> could increase the strength and stability of the field emitter while lowering the turn-on voltage...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) exhibit extraordinary {{mechanical properties}} and unique electronic properties and therefore, have received much attention {{for more than}} a decade now for a variety of applications ranging from nanoelectronics, composites to meeting needs in energy, environmental and other sectors. In this talk, we focus on some near term potential of CNT applications for both NASA and other Agency/societal needs. The most promising and successful application to date is a nano chem sensor at TRL 6 that uses a 16 - 256 sensor array in the construction of an electronic nose. Pristine, doped, functionalized and metal-loaded SWCNTs are used as conducting materials to provide chemical variation across the individual elements of the sensor array. This miniaturized sensor has been incorporated in an iPhone for homeland security applications. Gases and vapors relevant to leak detection in crew vehicles, biomedical, mining, chemical threats, industrial spills and others have been demonstrated. SWCNTs also respond to radiation exposure via a change in conductivity and therefore, a similar strategy is being pursued to construct a radiation nose to identify radiation sources (gamma, protons, neutrons, X-ray, etc.) with their energy levels. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) grown using plasma enhanced CVD typically are vertical, individual, freestanding structures and therefore, are ideal for construction of nanoelectrodes. A nanoelectrode array (NEA) can be the basis for an affinity-based biosensor to meet the needs in applications such as lab-on-a-chip, environmental monitoring, cancer diagnostics, biothreat monitoring, water and food safety and others. A couple of demonstrations including detection of e-coli and ricin will be discussed. The NEA is also useful for implantation in the brain for deep brain stimulation and neuroengineering applications. Miniaturization of payload such as science instrumentation and power sources is critical to reduce launch costs. High current density (greater than 100 mA/per square centimeters) field emission capabilities of CNTs can be exploited for construction of electron gun for electron microscopy and X-ray tubes for spectrometers and baggage screening. A CNT <b>pillar</b> array <b>configuration</b> has been demonstrated, not only meeting the high current density needs but more importantly providing long term emitter stability. Finally, supercapacitors hold the promise to combine the high energy density of a battery with the high power density of capacitors. Traditional graphite electrodes have not delivered this promise yet. A novel design and processing approach using MWCNTs has shown a record 550 F/g capacitance along with significant device endurance. This supercapacitor is suitable for railgun launch application for NASA, powering rovers and robots, consumer electronics and future hybrid vehicles...|$|R
