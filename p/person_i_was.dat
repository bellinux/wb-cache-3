Harrison himself attributed this dualism to his Pisces astrological sign, an issue he addresses in the posthumously released [...] "Pisces Fish".

500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{created the}} shapeshifter device and later regretted its design. He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode {{we had to make}} the shape-shifter device, the thing that you put into your mouth and it transforms one person into another <b>person.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have that time over again to redo this one." [...] He added, [...] "A lot of the time, I [...] actually see [...] on set, so I watched the episode to see how everything comes together." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Ebert noted his own [...] "tendency {{to place}} what I now {{consider}} the year's best film in second place, perhaps because I {{was trying to}} make some kind of point with my top pick," [...] adding, [...] "In 1968, I should have ranked [...] above The Battle of Algiers. [...] In 1971, McCabe and Mrs. Miller was better than The Last Picture Show. [...] In 1974, Chinatown was probably better, in a different way, than Scenes from a Marriage. [...] In 1976, how could I rank Small Change above Taxi Driver? [...] In 1978, I would put Days of Heaven above An Unmarried Woman. And in 1980, of course, Raging Bull was a better film than The Black Stallion... although I later chose Raging Bull as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, it was only the second-best film of 1980... am I the same <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in 1968, 1971, or 1980?

2500|$|According to Loveless, [...] "...I {{learned so}} much about what to feel in a song from those years of playing those clubs. I was saddened {{sometimes}} because I thought 'I left Nashville, I left all that for this? What happened to me? What is wrong with me?' But I think what was happening was that I was beginning to find... me. Find who I really was. And what kind of <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> inside and out.

2500|$|In 2012, Diamond {{married his}} manager, Katie McNeil, {{in front of}} family and close friends in Los Angeles. [...] Seven months earlier, on September 7, 2011, in a message on Twitter, the 70-year-old Diamond {{announced}} his engagement to the 41-year-old McNeil. Diamond said that his 2014 album Melody Road was fueled by his relationship with McNeil, explaining: [...] "There's no better inspiration or motivation for work than being in love. It's what you dream of as a creative <b>person.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to complete this album – start it, write it and complete it – {{under the spell of}} love, and I think it shows somehow." [...] In addition to serving as Diamond's manager, McNeil produced the documentary Neil Diamond: Hot August Nights NYC.|$|E

The eldest, Elizabeth, died in 1927 of septicaemia {{at the age of}} four. When talking of his childhood he said he [...] "adored it in all its aspects. If anyone should be grateful for their upbringing, for their mam and dad, I'm that <b>person.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the kid who came from a little part of paradise." [...] On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was not the most well-appointed place in the world, [...] "But to me it was heaven". [...] "Everything I have done, everything I've achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood. Maybe it was the constant sight of Mam, with eight children to look after, working from morning until night, working harder than you or I have ever worked." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 1953 to 1955 {{he went to}} sea as Commander Cruisers-Destroyers, Pacific, {{where his}} career was stalled {{temporarily}} by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas. Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when I brought the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, I was looking for a replacement in the Second Fleet, and I brought in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do better if I put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E
