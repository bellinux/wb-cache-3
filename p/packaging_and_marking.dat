40|$|Avocado {{quality control}} is dealt with {{as a total}} process, commencing with an {{understanding}} of the physiological attributes of the fruit itself, including respiration, ethylene production, transpiration and the effects of step-down temperatures and time on quality. Orchard factors that may affect fruit quality are discussed briefly. These include factors such as irrigation, nutrition, mulching, fruit-maturity, diseases, picking and transport to the packhouse. This is followed by an analysis of packhouse factors, including grading, temperature control, waxing, vapour pressure, <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>marking</b> of cartons. Control of the cold chain during road transport, at the docks and during sea transport is emphasised and the interrelationship between time and temperature and their effect on quality is again emphasised. The potential for using CA and MAP is discussed. Systems for the quality evaluation of fruit on overseas markets are described, together with definitions of some common types of external cold injury. Ethylene 'triggering ' or ripening is mentioned as an important factor in marketing. Emphasis is placed on the role of grower organisations in ensuring that controls are implemented at each point of the production and marketing chain so as to guarantee satisfied customers and therefore the grower's own economic success...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the quality of modelling waxes in Yogyakarta based on international standard. Seven brand of modelling waxes (Rusco tropical, Cavec Tropical, Ruby, SMIC, Anchor Brand medium, Anchor Brand Hard, and Anchor Brand Medium) were exained by ISO 12163 (ANSI/ADA no. 24) specification. The specification which were examined were general requirements (uniform shapes, free from foreign materials, smooth sheets, uniform texture, cohere if softened, and uniform dimension), special requirements (color, odor & flavour, softening, trimming and flaming), and preparation for delivery requirements (<b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>marking).</b> The modelling waxes were stated fulfill the requirements if all 5 samples of each brands were suitable with the specification. The results showed that one brand (Cavec Tropical) fulfilled general and specific requirements, 1 brand (SMIC) only fulfilled general requirements and 3 brands (Rusco tropical, Ruby and Anchor Brand Hard) only fulfilled special requirements.

40|$|The {{goal is to}} {{calculate}} the efficiency criteria of the technological process of percolation of Turkestan valerian roots and rhizomes, to work out an optimal technology for obtaining a thick extract of Turkestan valerian. Materials and methods. In the experiment used roots and rhizomes of Turkestan valerian, purified water and ethanol of 96 % pharmacopoeial quality. When determining the optimum extraction conditions 70 % ethyl alcohol {{was used as the}} extractant. The extraction method is percolation. Each extract fraction was taken at a DER 1 : 1 step, the amount of dry residue in each fraction was estimated and the main indices of the process dynamics were calculated. Results. The total yield of extractives from 100 g of the raw materials was 10. 79 g, which is more than 12. 44 %. The maximum number of stages of extraction for obtaining a thick extract is 7, a further increase in portions of the extractant does not lead to {{a significant increase in the}} yield of the finished product, which indicates the depletion of the raw material. Тhe optimal technology for getting a thick extract consists of the following classical steps: grinding raw materials, preparing the extractant, preparing herbal raw materials, infusion, percolation, settling, filtration, evaporation, <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>marking.</b> Conclusion. Based on the conducted research, a technology for obtaining a thick extract from the roots and rhizomes of Turkestan valerian has been tested and experimentally substantiated, a laboratory regulation and methods for its standardization have been developed...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate how handwriting as an individualisation technique in fraud investigation can be used by police detectives, SARS investigators and forensic investigation specialists, who are responsible for the investigation and linking the perpetrator, with a view to criminal prosecution. A further intent was to share and introduce a number of important concepts, namely: criminal investigation, identification, individualisation, fraud, evidence and handwriting. The research will explain the sophisticated investigation techniques used to obtain sufficient information to prove the true facts in a court of law. Identification is the collective aspect of the set of characteristics by which an object is definitively recognisable or known, while the individual characteristics establish the individuality of a specific object. Many types of evidence may be used to link an individual with a crime scene, and associate that individual with the performed illegal handling. It also explained that during a cheque/document fraud investigation, it is in most cases the only link to information to trace, identify and individualise the perpetrator, and to obtain a handwriting specimen. It is also discussed how to eliminate a person being a writer of a document, and how to collect, <b>package</b> <b>and</b> <b>mark</b> a disputed document during the investigation. If the investigators use their knowledge of these concepts, it should enhance their investigative skills, and empower them to be become better equipped for the challenges they face in identifying, individualising and linking the perpetrators, in order to ensure successful prosecution and conviction.
