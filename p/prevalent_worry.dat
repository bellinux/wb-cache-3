It takes into account the effects of the domestic recession and also the fact that Ireland has an ageing population. The complexities involved in identifying and addressing key motivating factors of personal soft drinks consumption are considered through the lens of brand loyalty, brand repertoire and the underlying influence of personal health on soft drink purchasing decisions. Quantitative data was gathered through a structured survey using online questionnaires. The sample was made up of Irish people, aged 18 to 74 years old, with 210 respondents completing the survey in full. The report demonstrates that there are differences in consumption patterns by age, which remain an important variable in overall consumption trends. In the light of the evidence gathered, results support existing studies which show out of home consumption of soft drinks declines with age, however older consumers still represent an important group of consumers for in-home consumption. This concurrent approach to investigating consumption location was an advancement of reviewed research data and literature. The study also supports existing theory which suggests older consumers are as likely as younger consumers to be promiscuous in their brand choices and that they have a repertoire of brands as wide as the younger cohort. An important finding is that health concerns around soft drinks are a <b>prevalent</b> <b>worry</b> across all age groups. As these are shown to be having a negative impact on stated consumption habits, strategies for addressing this issue are suggested. The report concludes that there is scope for soft drinks brands to create an upturn in current market trends by strategically targeting older consumers and suggests ways in which this may be done...|$|E
5000|$|Helen Singer Kaplan (February 6, 1929 - August 17, 1995) was an Austrian-American sex {{therapist}} {{and the founder}} of the first clinic in the United States for sexual disorders established at a medical school. The New York Times described Kaplan as someone who was [...] "considered a leader among scientific-oriented {{sex therapist}}s. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods." [...] She was also dubbed the [...] "Sex Queen" [...] because of her role as a pioneer in sex therapy during the sexual revolution in 1960s America, and because of her advocacy of the idea that people should enjoy sexual activity as much as possible, as opposed to seeing it as something dirty or harmful. The main purpose of her dissertation is to evaluate the psychosexual dysfunctions because these syndromes are among the most <b>prevalent,</b> <b>worrying</b> and distressing medical complaints of modern times.|$|R
40|$|The {{perceptions}} {{and experiences of}} hard-to-manage behaviours were explored among 32 staff working {{in a variety of}} local authority and private nurseries and playgroups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to ascertain what behaviours in children staff find most challenging, how they were managed and concerns communicated to parents. Results showed that aggression, inability to share and refusal were perceived as the most <b>prevalent</b> and <b>worrying.</b> Exclusion, explanation and distraction were the most frequently used strategies for handling such behaviours. Staff who were prepared to raise with parents their concerns about problematic behaviours that endangered the child's safety were out-of-character or persistent. A systems approach, based upon the ecological congruence model, was adopted to explain the links between staff {{perceptions and}} their tolerance for discrepancies from social norms. Staff-parent communication effectiveness was interpreted in terms of the home-pre-school relationship...|$|R
40|$|While it is {{important}} to remember that 2 ̆ 2 law 2 ̆ 2 consists of a large number of mutually contradictory symbols and ideals, it is equally important to realize that it requires for its acceptance a unified philosophy, which we will refer to as the 2 ̆ 2 science of the law 2 ̆ 2 or jurisprudence. An official admission by a judicial institution that it was moving in all directions at once in order to satisfy the conflicting emotional values of the people which it served would be unthinkable. It would have the same effect as if an actor interrupted the most moving scene of a play in order to explain to the audience that his real name was John Jones. The success of the play requires that an idea be made real to the audience. The success of the law as a unifying force depends on making emotionally significant the ideal of a government of law which is rational and scientific. Of course if we look at the moving, tumbling stream of events, evaluating the effects of the complex of habits, fears, hopes, social and economic pressures, we discover that 2 ̆ 2 law 2 ̆ 2 is not what it pretends to be. Yet if law did not pretend to be what it is not, it would lose its magic and effectiveness. This is a paradox only to those who refuse to think of the essentially dramatic character which every great public institution must develop. Functionally the primary purpose of the science of the law is to be a sounding board of both the prevalent hopes and the <b>prevalent</b> <b>worries</b> of those who believe in a government of law and not of men, to reconcile these hopes and worries somewhere in the mists of scholarship and learning, and never to admit that this is what it is doing...|$|R

Within the chaotic mass of newcomers, violence and disorder became <b>prevalent</b> enough to <b>worry</b> colonial Portuguese authorities. At least as concerned about collecting taxes on the newfound mineral wealth as stopping the lawlessness, Governor Pedro Miguel de Almeida requested two companies of Portuguese dragoons from the King [...] of Portugal.|$|R
40|$|There {{are very}} few symptom {{assessment}} instruments in Chinese. We present the validity and reliability of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF) and the Condensed Form MSAS (CMSAS) in Chinese cancer patients. The Chinese version of the 32 -item MSAS-SF, a self-report measure for assessing symptom distress and frequency in cancer patients, was administered to 256 Chinese patients with colorectal cancer at a clinical oncology outpatient unit. Highly <b>prevalent</b> symptoms included <b>worrying</b> (59 %), dry mouth (54 %), lack of energy (54 %), feeling sad (48 %), feeling irritable (48 %), and pain (41 %). Both the MSAS-SF and CMSAS demonstrated good validity and reliability. For the MSAS-SF subscales, Cronbach alphas ranged from 0. 84 to 0. 91, and for CMSAS subscales, from 0. 79 to 0. 87. Moderate-to-high correlations of MSAS-SF and CMSAS subscales with appropriate European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C 30 subscales (0. 42 - 0. 71, Ps 4 [P < 0. 001]). The Number of Symptoms subscale correlated appropriately with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 function (- 0. 46 to - 0. 60, P < 0. 001) and symptom scales (0. 31 - 0. 64, P < 0. 001). The average time to complete the MSAS-SF was six minutes. The Chinese versions of the MSAS-SF and CMSAS are valid and practical measures. Further validation is needed for Chinese patients with other cancer types and with other symptom instruments. © 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Content {{analysis}} was conducted to determine {{the frequency of the}} presence of positive Biblical virtues and paired opposite traits across 18 Newbery Medal books from the 1920 s through the 2000 s because the Newbery Award is a prestigious honor bestowed upon children 2 ̆ 7 s literature, and the criteria for selection among books specifically precludes the necessity of good character. The fruit of the spirit listed in Galatians 5 : 22 served as the rubric by which the characters 2 ̆ 7 thoughts, dialogue, and actions were measured. Consensus data was recorded, and chi-square tests of independence were conducted after three readers examined the presence and frequency of each positive Biblical virtue and paired opposite trait. The researcher found that, with few exceptions, Newbery Medal books depict a greater frequency of opposite traits as opposed to positive Biblical virtues. The opposite traits most <b>prevalent</b> include: sorrow, <b>worry,</b> impatience, cruelty, immorality, and violence. The positive Biblical virtues frequently portrayed include: love, faithfulness, and self-control. Among the 18 Newbery Medal books examined, the readers determined that six books are entirely appropriate for young readers, seven of the books are more appropriate for an adolescent audience, and five of the books were found to be inappropriate for children and/or adolescents based on the graphic nature of the content. The moral development and reasoning of children and adolescents must be acknowledged as educators select literature for students. It is counterproductive to marginalize the paramount nature of didactic content given the necessity of promoting good character among this nation 2 ̆ 7 s youth. The researcher suggests that the American Library Association carefully examine their definition of the term 2 ̆ 2 child 2 ̆ 2 as it relates to moral growth. A new system of classification of Newbery Medal books has been proposed {{as a result of the}} study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Growth-enhancing hormone {{treatment}} {{is considered a}} possible intervention in short but otherwise healthy adolescents. Although height gain is an obvious measure for evaluating hormone treatment, {{this may not be}} the ultimate goal for the person, but rather a means to reach other goals such as the amelioration of current height-related psychosocial problems or the enhancement of future prospects in life and society. The aim of our study was to clarify the motives of adolescents and their parents when choosing to participate in a growth-enhancing trial combining growth hormone and puberty-delaying hormone treatment. Methods Participants were early pubertal adolescents (25 girls, 13 boys) aged from 11 to 13 years (mean age 11. 5 years) with a height standard deviation score (SDS) ranging from - 1. 03 to - 3. 43. All had been classified as idiopathic short stature or persistent short stature born small for the gestational age (intrauterine growth retardation) on the basis of a height SDS below - 2, or had a height SDS between - 1 and - 2 and a predicted adult height SDS below - 2. The adolescents and their parents completed questionnaires and a structured interview on the presence of height-related stressors, parental worries about their child's behavior and future prospects, problems in psychosocial functioning, and treatment expectations. Questionnaire scores were compared to norms of the general Dutch population. Results The adolescents reported normal psychosocial functioning and highly positive expectations of the treatment in terms of height gain, whereas the parents reported that their children encountered some behavioral problems (being anxious/depressed, and social and attention problems) and height-related stressors (being teased and juvenilized). About 40 % of the parents were worried about their children's future prospects for finding a spouse or job. The motives of the adolescents and their parents exhibited rather different profiles. The most <b>prevalent</b> parental <b>worries</b> related to the current or future functioning of their children, while a few cases were characterized by no observed motives or by psychosocial problems only reported by the adolescents themselves. Conclusion The motives for participating in a growth-enhancing hormone trial are more obvious in the parents than in the adolescents themselves. Two out of three parents report worries about the future opportunities or observe modest current psychosocial problems in their children. The adolescents want to gain height, but the motivation underlying this remains unclear. Few of the adolescents experience psychosocial problems. Our analyses revealed differences among individuals in terms of motives, which implies that in an evaluation of hormone treatment, the importance of divergent outcome variables will also differ among individuals. Effectiveness evaluations of hormone treatment to increase height and the consequential fulfillment of other goals must be awaited. </p...|$|R
