40|$|A notable {{aspect of}} {{high-temperature}} superconductivity in the copper oxides is the unconventional {{nature of the}} underlying paired-electron state.

Of particular interest are the polarization wavefunction, defined by the configuration interaction including the Hartree-Fock function and all configurations which are orbitally singly-excited therefrom, and the first-order wavefunction, which in addition includes effects due {{to the presence of}} unoccupied valence orbitals. These wavefunctions are defined in terms of orbital (rather than spinorbital) excitation, and involve configurations each of which is an appropriate many-electron angular momentum eigenfunction. The polarization wavefunction is particularly useful in estimating hyperfine structure parameters. First order wavefunctions describe the correlation energy associated with orbital-occupancy patterns; we call this the orbital correlation energy. The remaining, or nonorbital correlation energy may be estimated empirically to give close estimates of electron affinities. Direct evaluation of most of the nonorbital correlation energy may be obtained from a second-order wavefunction or from <b>pair</b> correlation <b>energies</b> calculated, following Nesbet, from Bethe-Goldstone equations.
