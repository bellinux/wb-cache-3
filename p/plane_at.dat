5|$|Principal {{gameplay}} involves one-on-one 2.5D style fighting. Mortal Kombat uses {{a single}} two-dimensional fighting <b>plane</b> (<b>at</b> 60 frames per second), although characters are rendered in three-dimensional fashion, {{intended to give}} depth and range to portrayals of various projectiles. Unlike previous Mortal Kombat games, four buttons on the game controller represent attacks and are each linked to a corresponding limb.|$|E
5|$|A man on an {{international}} flight injects himself with an insulin pen, which releases a biological agent that quickly kills everyone aboard by causing their flesh to crystallize. The airplane's autopilot system lands the <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> Boston's Logan Airport, where various federal agencies create {{a task force to}} investigate what occurred during the flight. F.B.I. Special Agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) and her partner, Agent Scott (Mark Valley), are together in bed at a motel, where Scott says that he loves her. Dunham receives a call from her boss Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), who tells her to head to the airport. Dunham is added to the interagency task force headed by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick).|$|E

5|$|In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 {{operating}} as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused {{a fire in}} engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew {{lost control of the}} aircraft. The unmanageable <b>plane,</b> <b>at</b> a speed of 275 knots, hit the ground at a dairy farm and burned. All passengers and crew, as well as a dairyman on the ground, died.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of {{the data from the}} 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{inclined}} planes was an innovation that Green had pioneered elsewhere. He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal, which included six planes, five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism. He {{was at the time}} the engineer for the Grand Western Canal, which included seven vertical boat lifts and an inclined <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> Wellisford, again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism. The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital <b>plane.</b> <b>At</b> the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has to take off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s {{a number}} of {{proposals}} for a railway between Manchester and Bolton were made, some well advanced enough to be submitted to Parliament. One, in 1825, was for a line from New Bailey in Salford, to Park Field in Bolton, and included a branch line to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The plan included {{the use of an}} inclined <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> Clifton to allow the railway to access the higher ground from thereon. Another scheme was to connect with the planned Liverpool and Manchester Railway near Eccles, and would reach Bolton via Moorside and Farnworth. Neither of these schemes progressed beyond the early stages of planning. In 1830 two more proposals to connect the towns were made. The Manchester to Preston Railway was unsuccessful, leaving open the way for the second scheme, which would become known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway.|$|E
5|$|The Hearst {{basketball}} coach, Tom Barry, berates his team, including Wallace (Percy Daggs III), after a game, and the coach's son quits as a result. One of Logan's teachers tells Dick that Logan {{must start}} attending classes. Dick sneaks into Logan's apartment for the hotel staff and finds it a mess. Veronica works at Mars Investigations {{for the day}} and walks in to find the Coach's family in the office, as the Coach has died. The son who quit, Josh, is the prime suspect, but the family suspects Mel Stolz (Jeremy Roberts) or one of the PCH bikers. Dick tries to set up Logan on a double date before realizing that one of the “twins” is actually eleven years old. Dick and the older sister leave, leading Logan to babysit the other sister, Heather (Juliette Goglia) although Logan just goes to bed. Keith talks to Mel Stolz, who says that he was on a <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> the time. Dick calls Logan and says he is in Las Vegas, leaving Logan to babysit Heather for another day.|$|E

5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each <b>plane</b> <b>at</b> multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E
