Based on RED between the generator and load nodes and the predefined bilateral <b>power</b> <b>contracts,</b> charge evaluation is carried out.

40|$|The <b>Power</b> <b>Contract</b> {{signed in}} 1969 between Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited and Hydro-Québec {{was the result}} of {{protracted}} negotiations between the parties which lasted six years. It became the cornerstone of a complex financial arrangement to secure a loan which was at the time the largest private placement effected in the United States of America to provide the funds required for the construction of the Churchill Falls Plant terminated in 1976 at a cost of approximately a billion dollars. This long term contract which had led Premier Smallwood to exclaim : « Glory Hallelujah » when he had heard that the deal had been agreed upon started to be looked at in much a different light by Newfoundland following the rise in the cost of energy resulting from the increases in the price of oil demanded by OPEC. It became the nub of several Court cases instituted in the Newfoundland and Québec Courts. This article is in substance the text of a conference given by the author to the lawyers and notaries of the Ministry of Justice of Québec during the Fall of 1981. It outlines the historical events which led to the negotiations and the signing of a Letter of Intent in 1966 followed by the <b>Power</b> <b>Contract</b> in 1969 and details the events leading to the institution in September 1976 of an action before the Supreme Court of Newfoundland by the Attorney General of that province against CFLCo and Hydro-Québec for a declaration that 800 megawatts of power from Churchill Falls may be recalled, to the institution by Hydro-Québec of a declaratory action in the Québec Courts against CFLCo and the other interested parties, including the Attorney General of Newfoundland, to have certain clauses of the <b>Power</b> <b>Contract</b> interpreted and finally to the adoption in 1980 by the Newfoundland Legislature of The Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act and its reference to the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland to rule on its constitutional validity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Several {{studies have}} {{proposed}} job migration over the {{wide area network}} (WAN) to reduce the energy of networks of datacenters {{by taking advantage of}} different electricity prices and load demands. Each study focuses on only a small subset of network parameters and thus their results may have large errors. For example, datacenters usually have long-term <b>power</b> <b>contracts</b> instead of paying market prices. However, previous work neglects these contracts, thus overestimating the energy savings by 2. 3 x. We present a comprehensive approach to minimize the energy cost of networks of datacenters by modeling performance of the workloads, <b>power</b> <b>contracts,</b> local renewable energy sources, different routing options for WAN and future router technologies. Our method can reduce the energy cost of datacenters by up to 28 %, while reducing the error in the energy cost estimation by 2. 6 x.

40|$|The gradual {{relocation}} {{of part of}} the energy-intensive industries (EIIs) outside of Europe {{is one of the}} possible consequences of the combination of emission charges and higher electricity prices entailed by the EU-Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). The geographical distribution of cement plants is a relevant factor in relocation decisions because cement sector is characterized by high transportation costs. In order to mitigate this effect, EIIs have asked for CO 2 allowance grandfathering and long-term <b>power</b> <b>contracts</b> whereby they would be supplied from dedicated power capacities at a lower price. We model this situation on a prototype cement international market calibrated on ETS regulated and unregulated countries, with a particular focus on the Italian market. The analysis is based on an oligopolistic partial equilibrium model with a detailed technological representation of the whole production process. The model is a Generalized Nash game that accounts for the interactions of cement companies. In particular, we investigate the role played by the transportation costs in the clinker/cement production relocation and evaluates the effectiveness of CO 2 allowance grandfathering and of the application of long-term <b>power</b> <b>contracts</b> in mitigating this phenomenon. To this aim, we conduct empirical experiments taking into account different transportation costs and progressively higher CO 2 allowance prices with and without long-term contracts. Our results show that the European and Italian cement markets are affected by the EU-ETS and react by importing clinker from unregulated regions. Both allowance grandfathering and long-term <b>power</b> <b>contracts</b> only partially mitigate this relocation phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by new {{evidence}} that managerial incentives {{play an important role}} in determining firm productivity, this paper incorporates the principal-agent mechanism into the new heterogeneous firm trade framework to examine the link between openness and endogenous firm productivity. We show that firm heterogeneity plays a crucial role in the effects of openness on firms’ optimal incentive contracts via the trade-induced “carrot and stick” effect. This mechanism increases the marginal value of managerial effort, which motivates the firm owners (principals) to offer a higher <b>power</b> <b>contract</b> to the managers (agents) to reduce managerial slacks. The intra-firm managerial incentive mechanism stressed in this paper could be viewed as complementary to the inter-firm reallocation effect in the Melitz (2003) model in explaining the observed link between openness and aggregate productivity. openness, managerial incentives, heterogeneous firms, productivity. ...|$|E

The primary focus is {{an evaluation of the}} way retail electricity rates for Western`s preference customers vary with alternative pricing and power quantity commitment terms under Western`s long-term contracts to sell power (marketing programs). Retail rate impacts are emphasized because changes in the price of electricity are the most direct economic effect on businesses and residences arising from different Western contractual and operational policies. Retail rates are the mechanism by which changes in cost associated with Western`s contract terms are imposed on ultimate consumers, and rate changes determine the dollar level of payments for electric power incurred by the affected consumers. 41 figs., 9 tabs...|$|E
