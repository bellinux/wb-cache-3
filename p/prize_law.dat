5000|$|One {{considerable}} {{difference between}} <b>prize</b> <b>law</b> and ordinary Anglo-American criminal {{law is the}} reversal of the normal onus probandi or burden of proof.

50|$|Prize {{money has}} a {{distinct}} meaning in warfare, especially naval warfare, where it was a monetary reward paid out under <b>prize</b> <b>law</b> to the crew of a ship for capturing or sinking an enemy vessel. The claims for the bounty are usually heard in a Prize Court. This article covers the arrangements of the British Royal Navy, but similar arrangements {{were used in the}} navies of other nations, and existed in the British Army and other armies, especially when a city had been taken by storm.|$|E

A fabricated story was circulated that in some regions of Germany, schoolchildren were given a holiday to celebrate the sinking of Lusitania. This claim was so effective that James W. Gerard, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, recounted it in his memoir {{of his time in}} Germany, Face to Face with Kaiserism (1918), though without substantiating its validity.|$|E
50|$|The common {{element of}} those cases are that they require the court to {{exercise}} jurisdiction over maritime property. For example, in a Petitory and Possession Action, a vessel whose title is in dispute, usually between co-owners, will {{be put in the}} possession of the court until the title dispute can be resolved. In a Limitation Action the shipowner will post a bond reflecting the value of the vessel and her pending freight. A sixth category, that of <b>prize</b> (<b>law),</b> relating to claims over vessels captured during wartime, has been rendered obsolete due to changes in the laws and practices of warfare.|$|E

50|$|The {{right to}} be rewarded for salvage at sea under common law is based both on {{equitable}} principles and public policy and is not contractual in origin. Historically, salvage is a right in law, when a person, acting as a volunteer (that is, without any pre-existing contractual or other legal duty so to act) preserves or contributes so to preserving at sea any vessel, cargo, freight, or other recognized subject of salvage from danger. This is the typical case of salvage and is distinct from <b>Prize</b> <b>law,</b> which is the rescuing of property from the enemy {{at a time of}} war, for which a reward is made by the Court of Admiralty sitting as a Prize Court.|$|E
50|$|A {{privateer}} was {{a private}} person or ship that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war. The commission, {{also known as a}} letter of marque, empowered the person to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war, including attacking foreign vessels during wartime and taking them as prizes. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under <b>prize</b> <b>law,</b> with the proceeds divided between the privateer sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission. Since robbery under arms was common to seaborne trade, all merchant ships were already armed. During war, naval resources were auxiliary to operations on land so privateering was a way of subsidizing state power by mobilizing armed ships and sailors.|$|E
5000|$|The commissioners took {{testimony}} from witnesses on standard form written interrogatories. [...] Admiralty Courts rarely heard live testimony. The commissioners' interrogatories sought {{to establish the}} relative size, speed, and force of the vessels, what signals were exchanged and what fighting ensued, {{the location of the}} capture, the state of the weather and [...] "the degree of light or darkness," [...] and what other vessels were in sight. That was because naval <b>prize</b> <b>law</b> gave assisting vessels, defined as those that were [...] "in signal distance" [...] at the time, a share of the proceeds. The written interrogatories and ship's papers established the nationality of the prize and her crew, and the origin and destination of the cargo: the vessel was said to be [...] "confiscated out of her own mouth." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{letter of}} marque by its terms {{required}} privateers to bring captured vessels and their cargoes before admiralty courts of their own or allied countries for condemnation. Applying the rules and customs of <b>prize</b> <b>law,</b> the courts decided whether the {{letter of marque}} was valid and current, and whether the captured vessel or its cargo in fact belonged to the enemy (not always easy, when flying false flags was common practice), and if so the prize and its cargo were [...] "condemned," [...] to be sold at auction with the proceeds divided among the privateer's owner and crew. A prize court's formal condemnation was required to transfer title; otherwise the vessel's previous owners might well reclaim her on her next voyage, and seek damages for the confiscated cargo.|$|E

A privateer (sometimes called corsair or buccaneer) was a private person or ship authorized by a government by letters of marque to attack foreign vessels during wartime, and take them as prizes. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under <b>prize</b> <b>law,</b> with the proceeds divided between the privateer shipowners and crew.

40|$|This book investigates how {{the rulers}} of the Habsburg world empire {{developed}} and implemented a central maritime policy for the Netherlands and appointed an admiral of the sea or admiral-general for that purpose. It also explains why the Habsburgs were eventually unable {{to gain control of}} the maritime affairs of the Netherlands, in spite of the support of the powerful Burgundian Lords of Veere, who occupied the central position of admiral from 1491 to 1558. From their power base on the island of Walcheren in Zeeland, known as the key to the Netherlands at the time because of its central location between Holland, Flanders, Antwerp and the sea, they held an ideal vantage point for exercising the admiralship. The result not only offers an illuminating insight into the organisation of the war fleet, maritime trade and fishery, privateering and <b>prize</b> <b>law</b> in the Habsburg Netherlands, but also puts the maritime success of the later Dutch Republic in a new perspective...|$|E
