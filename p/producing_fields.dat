2500|$|With [...] {{of natural}} gas and [...] of {{petroleum}} estimated by the field operators as initially recoverable hydrocarbon reserves from eight <b>producing</b> <b>fields</b> (DTI, 2001), the East Irish Sea Basin is at a mature exploration phase. Early Namurian basinal mudstones are the source rocks for these hydrocarbons. Production from all fields is from fault-bounded traps of the Lower Triassic formation, principally the aeolian Sherwood Sandstone reservoir, top-sealed by younger Triassic continental mudstones and evaporites. Future mineral exploration will initially concentrate on extending this play, but there remains largely untested potential also for gas and oil within widespread Carboniferous fluvial sandstone reservoirs. This play requires intraformational mudstone seal units to be present, {{as there is no}} top-seal for reservoirs subcropping the regional base Permian unconformity in the east of the basin, and Carboniferous strata crop out at the sea bed in the west.|$|E

2500|$|Linda Nochlin's essay [...] "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?" [...] {{helped to}} ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and {{remains one of}} the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then {{followed}} by a 1972 College Art Association Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled [...] "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the Second-wave feminist movement, of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects. [...] In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art <b>producing</b> <b>fields.</b> The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. Griselda Pollock is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an operating-mode analysis of an MIS solar cell and discusses the advantages which can arise {{as a result}} of the use of transport control, field shaping (increased n factor), and zero bias barrier height modification. It is noted that for an n-type semiconductor, it is relatively easy to obtain an enhanced n factor using acceptor-like states without an increase in diode saturation current, the converse being true for p-type semiconductors. Several MIS configurations are examined: an acceptor-like, localized state configuration <b>producing</b> <b>field</b> shaping and no change in diode saturation current, and acceptor-like localized configurations <b>producing</b> <b>field</b> shaping, with a decrease of diode saturation current, in one case, and an increase in the other...|$|R
40|$|We reanalyze the {{production}} of seed magnetic fields during inflation in (R/m 2) nFμνFμν and IFμνFμν models, where n is a positive integer, R the Ricci scalar, m a mass parameter, and Iηα a power-law function of the conformal time η, with α a positive real number. If m is the electron mass, the <b>produced</b> <b>fields</b> are uninterestingly small for all n. Taking m as a free parameter, we find that, for n≥ 2, the <b>produced</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> can be sufficiently strong in order to seed the dynamo mechanism and then to explain galactic magnetism. For α 2, {{there is always a}} window in the parameters defining inflation such that the generated magnetic fields are astrophysically interesting. Moreover, if inflation is (almost) de Sitter and the <b>produced</b> <b>fields</b> almost scale invariant (α 4), their intensity can be strong enough to directly explain the presence of microgauss galactic magnetic fields. © 2008 The American Physical Society...|$|R
