Enlistment records and muster rolls, from 1866 to 1912 were in many instances filed by state, some records were broken down by company or military post providing information such as when, where, and by whom the scout was enlisted; period of enlistment; place of birth; age at time of enlistment; physical description; and possibly additional remarks such as discharge information, including date and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> rank at the time, and if the scout died in service.

To illustrate this important point I arranged two <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> as represented, fig 130.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether a change in practice to introduce a multidisciplinary fall-prevention program can reduce falls and injury in nonacute patients in a rehabilitation hospital. Design: A quasi-experimental study. Setting: Three geriatric wards with a similar design, equipment, staffing levels, and skill mix. Participants: Eight hundred twenty-five consecutive patients. Intervention: The patients' fall-risk status was assessed using the Downton Score. Current practice was maintained on the two control wards (n= 550). On the experimental ward (n= 275), a fall-prevention program was introduced. A multidisciplinary team met weekly specifically to discuss patients' fall risk and formulate a targeted plan. Patients at risk were identified using wristbands; risk factors were corrected or environmental changes made to enhance safety. Measurements: Primary outcomes were number of fallers, recurrent fallers, total falls, patients sustaining injury, and falls per occupied bed days. Secondary outcomes were <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> and mortality. Results: Patients were matched for age and risk status. Control wards had proportionally more fallers (20. 2 % vs 14. 2 %: P=. 033), patients sustaining injury (8. 2 % vs 4 %: P=. 025), and total number of falls (170 vs 72 : P=. 045). These results did not remain significant after controlling for differing length of stay. There was no reduction in recurrent fallers (6. 4 % vs 4. 7 %: P=. 43) and no effect on <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> (home discharges; 57. 5 % vs 60. 7 %: P=. 41) or mortality (15. 3 % vs 13. 8 %: P=. 60). Conclusion: This study shows that falls might be reduced in a multidisciplinary fall-prevention program, but the results are not definitive because of the borderline significance achieved and the variable length of stay. More research on fall prevention in hospital is required, particularly as to what interventions, if any, are effective at reducing falls in this group of patients...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Random sample of 36 NHS hospitals, stratified by size of hospital (number of beds), area (north, midlands, south east, south west), and type of hospital (teaching or non-teaching, trust or directly managed). From each hospital a random sample of, on average, 143 patients was interviewed at home or the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> two to four weeks after discharge by means of a structured questionnaire about their treatment in hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 5150 randomly chosen NHS patients recently discharged from acute hospitals in England. Subjects had been patients on medical and surgical wards apart from paediatric, maternity, psychiatric, and geriatric wards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Patients' responses to direct questions about preadmission procedures, admission, communication with staff, physical care, tests and operations, help from staff, pain management, and discharge planning. Patients' responses to general questions about their degree of satisfaction in hospitals. RESULTS [...] Problems were reported by patients, particularly with regard to communication with staff (56 % (2824 / 5020) had not been given written or printed information); pain management (33 % (1042 / 3162) of those suffering pain were in pain all or most of the time); and discharge planning (70 % (3599 / 5124) had not been told about warning signs and 62 % (3177 / 5119) had not been told when to resume normal activities). Hospitals failed to reach the standards of the Patient's Charter [...] for example, in explaining the treatment proposed and giving patients the option of not taking part in student training. Answers to questions about patient satisfaction were, however, highly positive but of little use to managers.

40|$|The primary {{thrust of}} the NTS Terminal Waste Storage Project during FY 1978 was to {{continue}} {{an evaluation of the}} suitability of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) for siting a commercial spent fuel or high-level waste repository. At the beginning of the year, three primary issues were identified. They are: (1) is waste isolation at the NTS compatible with weapons testing; (2) are there suitable geohydrologic settings available on the NTS; and (3) are there suitable disposal media available at NTS. The NTS Terminal Waste Storage Project has been organized primarily to address these three issues. The southwestern area of the NTS has been identified as compatible with both current and future weapons testing. The NTS and adjacent areas of southern Nevada contain media which are probably suitable for waste isolation and which occur in a region characterized by long groundwater flow paths through sorptive media. However, utilization of the southwestern part of NTS requires that several geotechnical issues be addressed intensively. These are: (1) the potential for earthquakes at and near NTS; (2) the potential for future volcanism at possible repository sites; (3) the location and nature of faults; and (4) the characterization of the groundwater flow system from possible repository sites to <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge.</b> Four potential disposal media available on the NTS were studied during FY 1978. Studies of one of these media, alluvium, were suspended due to the low near-field thermal conductivity.

40|$|Objectives: Because most {{research}} on long-term acute care hospitals {{has focused on}} Medicare, {{the objective of this}} research is to describe the Georgia Medicaid population who received care at a long-term acute care hospital, the type and volume of services provided by these long-term acute care hospitals, and the costs and outcomes of these services. For those with select respiratory conditions, we descriptively compare costs and outcomes to those of patients who received care for the same services in acute care hospitals. Methods: We describe Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to a long-term acute care hospital between 2011 and 2012. We compare them to a population of Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to an acute care hospital for one of five respiratory diagnosis-related groups. Measurements used include patient descriptive information, admissions, diagnosis-related groups, length of stay, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> 90 -day episode costs, readmissions, and patient risk scores. Results: We found that long-term acute care hospital admissions for Medicaid patients were fairly low (470 90 -day episodes) and restricted to complex cases. We also found that the majority of long-term acute care hospital patients were blind or disabled (71. 2 %). Compared to patients who stayed at an acute care hospital, long-term acute care hospital patients had higher average risk scores (13. 1 versus 9. 0), lengths of stay (61 versus 38 [*]days), costs (US$ 143, 898 versus US$ 115, 056), but fewer discharges to the community (28. 4 % versus 51. 8 %). Conclusion: We found that the Medicaid population seeking care at long-term acute care hospitals is markedly different than the Medicare populations described in other long-term acute care hospital studies. In addition, our study revealed that Medicaid patients receiving select respiratory care at a long-term acute care hospital were distinct from Medicaid patients receiving similar care at an acute care hospital. Our findings suggest that state Medicaid programs should carefully consider reimbursement policies for long-term acute care hospitals, including bundled payments that cover both the original hospitalization and long-term acute care hospital admission...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Discharge {{planning}} is a routine feature of health systems in many countries. The {{aim is to}} reduce hospital length of stay and unplanned readmission to hospital, and improve the co ordination of services following discharge from hospital thereby bridging the gap between hospital and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge.</b> Sometimes discharge {{planning is}} offered {{as part of an}} integrated package of care, which may cover both the hospital and community. The focus of this review is discharge planning that occurs while a patient is in hospital; we exclude studies that evaluate discharge planning with follow up care. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of planning the discharge of patients moving from hospital. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant studies were identified using Medline, Embase, SIGLE database for grey literature, Bioethics database, Health Plan, Psych. Lit, Sociofile, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Econ Lit, Social Science Citation Index, EPOC register. The review was updated using the EPOC trials register in August 2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: STUDY DESIGN: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare discharge planning (the development of an individualised discharge plan) with routine discharge care. PARTICIPANTS: all patients in hospital. INTERVENTION: the development of an individualised discharge plan. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data analysis and quality assessment was undertaken independently by two reviewers using a data checklist. Studies are grouped according to patient group (elderly medical patients, surgical patients, and those with a mix of conditions), and by outcome. MAIN RESULTS: Three new studies were included in this update. In total we included eleven RCTS: 6 trials recruited patients with a medical condition (2, 368 patients), and four recruited patients with a mix of medical and surgical conditions (2, 983 patients), one of these four recruited medical and surgical patients as separate groups, and the final trial recruited 97 patients in a psychiatric hospital and from a general hospital. We failed to detect a difference between groups in mortality for elderly patients with a medical condition (OR 1. 44 95 % CI 0. 82 to 2. 51), hospital length of stay (weighted mean difference - 0. 86, 95 % CI - 1. 9 to 0. 18), readmission rates (OR 0. 91 95 % CI 0. 67 to 1. 23) and being discharged from hospital to home (OR 1. 15 95 % CI 0. 72 to 1. 82). This was also the case for trials recruiting patients recovering from surgery and those recruiting patients with a mix of medical and surgical conditions. One trial comparing a structured care pathway for patients recovering from a stroke with multidisciplinary care reported a significant rate of improvement in functional ability and quality of life for the control group (median change in Barthel score between 4 to 12 weeks of 2 points for the treatment group, versus 6 for the control group, p< 0. 01); (Euroqol scores at 6 months 63 for the treatment group, vs. 72 for the control group, p< 0. 005). Two trials reported that patients with medical conditions allocated to discharge planning reported increased satisfaction compared with those who received routine discharge. No statistically significant differences were reported for overall health care costs. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The impact of discharge planning on readmission rates, hospital length of stay, health outcomes and cost is uncertain. This reflects a lack of power as the degree to which we could pool data was restricted by the different reported measures of outcome. It is possible that even a small reduction in length of stay, or readmission rate, could {{have an impact on the}} timeliness of subsequent admissions in a system where there is an shortage of acute hospital beds...|$|E

The spark is {{consequent}} upon a <b>discharge</b> or lowering <b>of</b> the polarized inductive {{state of}} many dielectric particles, {{by a particular}} action of {{a few of the}} particles occupying a very small and limited space; all the previously polarized particles returning to their first or normal condition in the inverse order in which they left it, and uniting their powers meanwhile to produce, or rather to continue, (1417.--1436.) the discharge effect in the place where the subversion of force first occurred. My impression is, that the few particles situated where discharge occurs are not merely pushed apart, but assume a peculiar state, a highly exulted condition for the time, i.e. have thrown upon them all the surrounding forces in succession, and rising up to a proportionate intensity of condition, perhaps equal to that of chemically combining atoms, discharge the powers, possibly {{in the same manner as}} they do theirs, by some operation at present unknown to us; and so the end of the whole. The ultimate effect is exactly as if a metallic wire had been put into the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>discharging</b> particles; and it does not seem impossible that the principles of action in both cases, may, hereafter, prove to be the same.|$|R
40|$|Flue gas {{desulfurization}} (FGD) by-products from coal-fired {{electric power}} generation are increasing due to Clean Air Act legislation in the U. S. requiring removal of sulfur from coal. The FGD by-products are one of many waste products or residuals of economic production and consumption activities that may impose social costs when entering a natural environment with limits to its assimilative or "sink " capacity. The options for dealing with this problem include reducing levels of throughput, converting the residuals to new products or recycling them as inputs, changing the wastes to a more benign form, altering the time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> residuals <b>discharge</b> and changing the assimilative capacity of the environment. This paper {{is part of a}} larger multidisciplinary research effort on FGD Recycling at The Ohio State Univer-sity (see Dick et iJ [...] , 1991) and focuses on developing a correct method for assessing the social or complete costs and benefits. It is oriented primarily to non-economists. The three options for converting FGD by-products to new products or recycling them as inputs include FGD by-products as an agronomic lime substitute, as an amendment on active and abandoned stripmine spoil, and as an embankment stabilizer for highway construction. Social cost benefit analysis is concerned with estimating full willing-ness to pay and willingness to accept measures of economic value regardless of whether or not those values are currently reflected in market prices.

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{explore and}} {{critically}} examine stakeholders' views and perceptions concerning the nurse-led Palliative Care Discharge Service in an acute hospital setting and to inform sustainability, service development and future service configuration. Background: The drive in {{policy and practice}} is to enable individuals to achieve their preferred <b>place</b> <b>of</b> care during their last days of life. However, most people in UK die in acute hospital settings against their wishes. To facilitate individuals' preferred <b>place</b> <b>of</b> care, a large acute hospital in northeast England implemented a pilot project to establish a nurse-led Macmillan Palliative Care Discharge Facilitator Service. Design: A pluralistic evaluation design using qualitative methods was used to seek stakeholders' views and perceptions of this service. Methods: In total, 12 participants (five bereaved carers and seven health professionals) participated in the evaluation. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} bereaved carers who used this service for their relatives. A focus group and an individual interview were undertaken with health professionals who had used the service since its inception. Individual interviews were also conducted with the Discharge Facilitator and service manager. Analysis of all data was guided by Framework Analysis. Results: Four key themes emerged relating to the role <b>of</b> the <b>Discharge</b> Facilitator Service: achieving preferred <b>place</b> <b>of</b> care; the <b>Discharge</b> Facilitator as the ‘conduit’ between hospital and community settings; delays in hospital discharge and stakeholders' perceptions of the way forward for the service. Conclusion: The Discharge Facilitator Service acted as a reliable resource and support for facilitating the fast-tracking of end-of-life patients to their preferred <b>place</b> <b>of</b> care. Relevance to clinical practice: Future planning for hospital-based palliative care discharge facilitating services need to consider incorporating strategies that include: increased profile of the service, expansion of service provision and the Discharge Facilitator's earlier involvement in the discharge process...|$|R
