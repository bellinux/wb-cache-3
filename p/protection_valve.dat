50|$|The {{brake system}} for FE {{is similar to}} the rest of the FM/FH family of trucks with EBS however a new {{integrated}} air dryer system called APM or Air Production Management was introduced. APM combines the functions of air dryer, regulator, four-way <b>protection</b> <b>valve,</b> pressure limiting and safety valves, pressure sensors and blocking valve into one unit and is electronically controlled. The main advantages of the system are in reduced numbers of separate components which also reduces risk of air leakage and electrical connectors failures.|$|E
50|$|The air {{compressor}} {{is driven by}} the engine either by crankshaft pulley via a belt or directly from the engine timing gears. It is lubricated and cooled by the engine lubrication and cooling systems. Compressed air is first routed through a cooling coil and into an air dryer which removes moisture and oil impurities and also may include a pressure regulator, safety valve and smaller purge reservoir. As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way <b>protection</b> <b>valve</b> into the front and rear brake circuit air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, pressure limiting, drain and safety valves.|$|E

The proposed valve system has out-wards opening poppet-type valves on both the high- and low pressure side. This solution allows for a symmetric valve arrangement, enabling the units to operate as traditional motors/pumps with traditional distributor valves as well as to be used in simplified system layouts where full advantage is taken of the technology. This is opposed to current solutions having poppet type valves opening inwards on the low-pressure side and outwards on the high-pressure side, requiring dedicated high-and low pressure ports, also on motors.

We reported here a case of AVR with the functioning LITA to the occluded LAD and the GEA to the occluded RCA, where an aortic valve surgery under aortic cross clamp with the conventional combination of the antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia might fail to protect RV muscle due to an anatomical characteristic of the cardiac vein drainage system.|$|R

OBJECTIVES: This study compared clinical and transmission electron microscopic aspects of myocardial <b>protection</b> during mitral <b>valve</b> replacement using warm retrograde perfusion in empty beating versus arrested heart with cold blood anterograde cardioplegia. METHODS: Randomized study to evaluate myocardial cellular ischemia-reperfusion of both techniques {{to replace the}} mitral valve. Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned into group A (beating heart) and group B (arrested heart). The following parameters were assessed: echocardiography, blood chemistry, hemoglobin, lactate. During the surgical procedure a total of 102 myocardial biopsies were performed for ultrastructural analysis from anterior left ventricular wall: before cardiopulmonary bypass, before aortic desclamping and 10 minutes after reperfusion. RESULTS: Elevation of lactate at 3 hours during the procedure was higher in group A, but similar {{at the end of}} surgery (P= 0. 06). Cardioversion was necessary in 5 / 17 (A) vs. 13 / 17 (B) P= 0. 07. Median intraoperative systemic temperature was significantly lower in the group B compared to A (32 ° C vs. 36 ° C), P< 0. 001. There was no significant difference of the ultramicroscopic aspects of the heart biopsies before, during and after surgery in both groups. Cellular and mitochondrial transient abnormalities such as mitochondrial swelling, glycogen loss and cytosol swelling were detected independently of the moment of the biopsies.

40|$|Ostracoda or mussel-shrimps are small, bivalved Crustacea. Because {{of their}} {{excellent}} fossil record and their broad variety of reproductive modes, ostracods are {{of great interest}} as a model group in ecological and evolutionary research. Here, we investigated damage and repair {{of one of the}} most important biological mutagens, namely UVB radiation in the putative ancient asexual ostracod Darwinula stevensoni from Belgium. We applied three different methods: the Polymerase Inhibition (PI) assay, Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) and dot blot. All three techniques were unsuccessful in quantifying UVB damage in D. stevensoni. Previous experiments have revealed that the valves of D. stevensoni provide an average UVB protection of approximate 60 %. Thus, UVB damage could be too little to make quantitative experiments work. Additional variation between individual ostracods due to season and age most likely contributed further to the failure of the three used experimental approaches. In a second experiment, we investigated the influence of temperature on survival of D. stevensoni during UVB exposure. The estimated lethal UVB dose at 4 °C was with 50 kJ/m 2 significantly lower than at room temperature with 130 kJ/m 2. This could either indicate adaptation to low temperatures and/or the presence of metabolic processes against UVB damage in D. stevensoni. These results could also explain why the estimated lethal UVB dose of D. stevensoni is similar to that of other non-marine ostracods where valves provide around 80 % <b>protection,</b> although the <b>valves</b> of D. stevensoni provide less protection. If such metabolic processes can repair UVB damage fast, they might be an alternative explanation why we could not quantify UVB damage in D. stevensoni...|$|R
40|$|Magnetorheological fluids {{belong to}} the class of field-responsive fluids that undergo large, {{reversible}} and fast changes in their rheological properties when acted upon by an external magnetic field. 'Smart' or controllable composite materials have been obtained by doping polymers, foams, fabrics etc. with these field-responsive fluids. The resulting composite materials have potential applications in numerous fields ranging from adaptive energy absorption, automotive crash <b>protection</b> to microfluidic <b>valves,</b> mixers and separation devices. A series of stable magnetorheological (MR) fluids have been systematically characterized under steady shearing, creep and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) flow conditions. A rheometer fixture for applying nearly uniform magnetic fields up to 0. 4 T has been fabricated to measure both steady-state and transient changes in the fluid properties under applied fields. Stable MR fluids with a markedly improved dynamic response (yield stress {{as a function of}} magnetic field) compared to commercial fluids have been formulated by increasing the constituent particle size and by stabilizing the system against sedimentation. A new "soft-glassy rheology" model has been used to model the fluid response time and visco-elasto-plastic response under creep conditions and oscillatory loadings. (cont.) The experiments and model show that the evolution of chain structure and plastic collapse in these suspensions exhibits a universal scaling with the dimensionless stress s = [sigma]/[sigma]y. Structure evolution, pattern formation and dynamics of MR fluid flow in microchannel geometries has been analyzed using high-speed digital video microscopy. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that control MR structure formation, experiments have been performed while varying the magnetic field, particle size, channel geometry, concentration and fluid composition. Excellent qualitative agreement has been obtained with Brownian Dynamics simulations and useful scalings based on interplay of magnetostatic & viscous forces have been extracted to understand the field-dependent fluid response on the macro & micro scale. Novel MR elastomeric materials and microparticles have been synthesized by doping photo-curable or thermo-curable polymers with field-responsive fluids. A high-throughput micromolding technique for synthesis of controllable particles of anisotropic shapes and sizes has been developed. Flexible and permanent chain-like structures have also been synthesized using amidation chemistry. Potential microfluidic applications such as field-responsive valves, mixers and separation devices using these 'smart' materials have also been investigated. by Suraj Sharadchandra Deshmukh.

40|$|Summary and Conclusion Emergency Shutdown (ESD) {{valves and}} High Integrity Pressure <b>Protection</b> System (HIPPS) <b>valves</b> are final {{elements}} in Safety Instrumented Systems. Proof or functional testing are performed at specific intervals {{in order to}} ensure the valves’ function. For these type of valves, such tests may require costly shutdowns. For a final element, like a valve, the interval between proof tests are by performance based standards like IEC 61505 / 61511, related to the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) for the element’s complete function. Partial Stroke Testing (PST) can reduce the time between such tests. PST is performed by allowing the valve to start closing, and to start reopening before the process is interrupted. By performing a partial test at a shorter interval, a fraction of the dangerous undetected failures, the PST coverage, are tested more often. This will reduce the PFD and imply that the proof test interval can be extended, still achieving the same Safety Integrity Level (SIL). Three systems for PST have been evaluated: The Emerson FieldVue DVC 6000 SIS, the Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring and the Crane ValveWatch II. ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring provides leak testing in open and closed position, respectively. Leak testing on an open valve is treated as a partial test and is included in the PST coverage. FieldVue can not be used on hydraulic operated valves. Three ESD valves and one HIPPS valve on the Kollsnes gas processing plant have been analyzed. Two systems have been evaluated for each valve. A Failure Mode, E. ects and Diagnostic Analysis has been performed on the tested parts of each valve’s complete function. Based on this analysis, the PST coverage and increased test intervals are calculated. The PST coverage found for the hydraulic operated ESD gate valves are 66 % and 74 % for ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring, respectively. For the pneumatic operated ESD ball valve, a PST coverage of 21 % has been found for FieldVue and 56 % for Smart Valve Monitoring. The calculated intervals between functional tests to achive a SIL 2 rating, are between 0, 54 and 0, 89 years for these ESD valves. SIL 2 corresponds to a PFD < 10 - 2. For the ESD valves, new control circuits with lower failure rates should be designed in order to improve the results. Today’s one year proof test interval on ESD valves seems not to be in accordance with the standard used in this project, i. e to achieve SIL 2 the proof test interval should be reduced. A PST coverage of 100 % and 0 % has been found on the HIPPS solenoid valve for Smart Valve Monitoring and FieldVue, respectively. The PST coverage for the valve and actuator is 53 % for both systems. Based on an inital annual test interval for the overall pressure protection system, is PST, by the system with best coverage, roughly estimated to increase the test interval by 76 %. The results are highly dependent on the choices and assumptions made in this project. A closer study of experience data could have increased the quality of the analysis. Such data is not found easily available. The results are assumed to be relatively conservative. Deeper involvement of professionals with operational experience from relevant areas would probably also have improved the quality. The Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring has achieved the best results in this analysis. ValveWatch and FieldVue would improve their PST coverage if ESD solenoids were tested. They are also able to monitor actual shutdowns and may contribute to document a shutdown as proof test. These systems also make more measurements and may be better suited for predictive maintenance purposes. ValveWatch has achieved the highest PST coverage for a valve separately, because of its leak test. All the evaluated systems will give increased knowledge about the valve’s condition, and thereby improve safety. The PFD will be substantially reduced. Future needs at Kollsnes should be analyzed further, and an eventual installation of such systems should be done according to these needs. </p...|$|R
