25|$|We {{have seen}} that forcing can be done using Boolean-valued models, by {{constructing}} a Boolean algebra with ultrafilter from a <b>poset</b> with a generic subset. It is also possible to go back the other way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a <b>poset</b> P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a generic ultrafilter on B restricts to a generic set on P.

If F is a family of chain antimatroids whose basic words all belong to A, then F generates A if and only if the feasible sets of F include all paths of A. The paths of A belonging to a single chain antimatroid must form a chain in the path <b>poset</b> of A, so the convex dimension of an antimatroid equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the path <b>poset,</b> which by Dilworth's theorem equals the width of the path <b>poset.</b>|$|E
