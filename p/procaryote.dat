40|$|More than 50 years ago, Monod (1949) {{proposed}} {{the application of}} the Michaelis-Menten relation describing enzyme kinetics to a culture of microorganisms. For the purpose of simplification, the mathematical relation proposed by Monod (1949) reduced the entire cell to a single enzyme genetically expressed in a single intensity. However, cell metabolism is based on a large number of biochemical reactions. This paper reviews the literature to identify the controlling factors of cell metabolism and the regulation of specific activity of the cell. The literature review was designed to highlight which regulation mechanisms induce a growth-rate variation {{so that they can be}} expressed mathematically. The study of these processes will focus on modeling the specific activity variation. The review is limited to heterotrophic <b>procaryote</b> organisms under aerobic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} minimal {{model for the}} global carbon cycle of the Earth {{containing}} the reservoirs mantle, ocean floor, continental crust, biosphere, and the kerogen, {{as well as the}} combined ocean and atmosphere reservoir. The model is specified by introducing three different types of biosphere: <b>procaryotes,</b> eucaryotes, and complex multicellular life. During the entire existence of the biosphere <b>procaryotes</b> are always present. 2 Gyr ago eucaryotic life first appears. The emergence of complex multicellular life is connected with an explosive increase in biomass and a strong decrease in Cambrian global surface temperature at about 0. 54 Gyr ago. In the long-term future the three types of biosphere will die out in reverse sequence of their appearance. We show that there is no evidence for an implosion-like extinction in contrast to the Cambrian explosion. In dependence of their temperature tolerance complex multicellular life and eucaryotes become extinct in about 0. 8 – 1. 2 Gyr and 1. 3 – 1. 5 Gyr, respectively. The ultimate life span of the biosphere is defined by the extinction of <b>procaryotes</b> in about 1. 6 Gyr. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} various inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen to the nitrogen requirements of picoplankton was examined with 15 N tracers. Size fractionation {{was used to}} measure uptake by < l-pm size microorganisms, and inhibitors of protein synthesis were used to separate procaryotic from eucaryotic nitrogen uptake, Picoplankton utilized mainly ammonium and amino acids and only negligible amounts of nitrate and urea. Nearly all amino acid uptake was by <b>procaryotes,</b> while both <b>procaryotes</b> and eucaryotes utilized ammonium. About 78 % of total ammonium uptake was by <b>procaryotes,</b> and a significant portion of this was due specifically to heterotrophic bacteria. Regeneration of ammonium was correlated with eucaryotic rather than procaryotic activity. Ammonium accounted for at least 20 - 60 % of the summed ammonium plus amino acid utilization by bacteria. The results suggest that a significant portion of ammonium uptake in the euphotic zone was by heterotrophic bacteria rather than solely by phytoplankton. This may invalidate the use of the Rcdfield C: N ratio for estimating rates of nitrogen assimilation in the euphotic zone from carbon assimilation rates. Historically, it has been assumed tha...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the distribution of amino terminal end groups in the cellular proteins of a number of microbes. Among the <b>procaryotes,</b> methionine is a highly variable but virtually ubiquitous major protein end group. This is consistent with its possible role as a general amino acid initiator of protein biosynthesis in the <b>procaryotes.</b> Generally, however, alanine is the most abundant of the major end groups, followed in decreasing order by serine, threonine, the acidic amino acids, and occasionally lysine. No other new major end-groups were found. Among 15 representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae, retention of the initiating methionine terminus of the cellular protein varies considerably at a tribal level and is randomized at a familial level. The profiles of the five remaining end groups, however, are strikingly uniform, and are, for example, close to but significantly {{different from those of the}} Erwineae. Among the taxonomically more heterogeneous Bacillaceae, end-group profiles vary more and are sometimes unrelated. End-group analysis is thus particularly useful as a molecular criterion of taxonomy in assessing familial homogeneity. Free NH 2 termini in eucaryote cell proteins are fewer, and they have increased acidic amino acid components and no methionine; they are otherwise similar to those of the <b>procaryotes...</b>|$|R

40|$|DNA repair by O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (O 6 -MT) is {{accomplished}} by removal by the enzyme of the methyl group from premutagenic O 6 -methylguanine-DNA, thereby restoring native guanine in DNA. The methyl group is transferred to an acceptor site cysteine thiol group in the enzyme, which causes the irreversible inactivation of O 6 -MT. We detected {{a variety of different}} forms of the methylated, inactivated enzyme in crude extracts of human spleen of molecular weights higher and lower than the usually observed 21 - 24 kDa for the human O 6 -MT. Several apparent fragments of the methylated form of the protein were purified to homogeneity following reaction of partially-purified extract enzyme with O 6 -[3 H-CH 3]methylguanine-DNA substrate. One of these fragments yielded amino acid sequence information spanning fifteen residues, which was identified as probably belonging to human methyltransferase by virtue of both its significant sequence homology to three <b>procaryote</b> forms of O 6 -MT encoded by the ada, ogt (both from E. coli) and dat (B. subtilis) genes, and sequence position of the radiolabelled methyl group which matched the position of the conserved <b>procaryote</b> methyl acceptor site cysteine residue. Statistical prediction of secondary structure indicated good homologies between the human fragment and corresponding regions of the constitutive form of O 6 -MT in procaryotes (ogt and dat gene products), but not with the inducible ada protein, indicating the possibility that we had obtained partial amino acid sequence for a non-inducible form of the human enzyme. The identity of the fragment sequence as belonging to human methyltransferase was more recently confirmed by comparison with cDNA-derived amino acid sequence from the cloned human O 6 -MT gene from HeLa cells (1). The two sequences compared well, with only three out of fifteen amino acids being different (and two of them by only one nucleotide in each codon) ...|$|E
40|$|Two new {{instances}} {{of the rare}} bacteriocuprein form of superoxide dismutase have been discovered in Pseudomonas diminuta and P. maltophilia. Each species contains a manganese superoxide dismutase as well. Eight other strains of Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas spp. lacked bacteriocupreins and contained either a manganese or an iron superoxide dismutase. Native molecular weights and isoelectric points were determined for all these bacterial dismutases. A monospecific polyclonal antibody was prepared against the bacteriocuprein from Photobacterium leiognathi; it was not cross-reactive with the bacteriocuprein from either Pseudomonas strain. Bacteriocupreins have previously been identified in only two <b>procaryotes,</b> P. leiognathi and Caulobacter crescentus.

When grown in mycoplasma media supplemented with PPLO serum fraction (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), A. laidlawii was rapidly killed by low concentrations of toxicant (less than 1. 0 mM). At higher concentrations (greater than 10 mM), NDFDA treatment appeared to lyse cells. A. laidlawii cells grown in horse serum-supplemented mycoplasma media were both killed and lysed at the same NDFDA concentration (greater than 10 mM). These data suggest that this perfluorinated fatty acid can be cytotoxic and cytolytic to mycoplasmas. Changes in active concentrations occurred in parallel with changes in growth medium serum supplementation, which is known to alter mycoplasma membrane composition.

40|$|No {{other group}} of <b>procaryotes</b> {{has been so}} embroiled in {{controversy}} and in establishing a clear pathogenic niche as the mycoplasmas. Their virulence determinants are undeniably complex, and their unique biological properties likely chal-lenge the host differently from typical bacterial pathogens (1, 2). Also, numerous Mycoplasma species appear to comprise the commensal micro-bial flora of healthy persons (3), and the association of these mycoplasmas with disease complicates the diagnosis and necessitates extensive and highly specific serologic, nucleic acid, and epide-miologic data. Nonetheless, mycoplasmas by themselves can cause acute and chronic diseases at multiple sites with wide-ranging complications and have been implicated as cofactors in disease. Recently, mycoplasmas have been linked as a cofactor to AIDS pathogenesis and to malignant transformation, chromosomal aberrations, the Gulf War Syndrome, and other unexplained and complex illnesses, including chronic fatigue syn-drome, Crohn’s disease, and various arthritides (4 - 8). Even with mounting evidence of their pervasive and pathogenic potential, mycoplasmas still evoke {{the image of a}} group of obscure or impotent microorganisms. Yet they are evolu-tionarily advanced <b>procaryotes</b> (9 - 11), and their elite status as “next generation ” bacterial patho-gens necessitates new paradigms in fully under-standing their disease potential.

40|$|Superoxide dismutase, {{ascorbate}} peroxidase, and catalase {{activities were}} {{studied in the}} symbiotic photosynthetic <b>procaryote</b> Prochloron sp. and its ascidian host Lissoclinum patella. The protein-specific activities of these antioxidant enzymes in the Prochloron sp. and L. patella collected at different depths from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, were directly proportional to irradiance, whereas the pigment concentrations in the Prochloron sp. were inversely proportional to irradiance. The presence of a cyanide-sensitive superoxide dismutase, presumably a Cu-Zn metalloprotein, in the Prochloron sp. extends the possible phylogenetic distribution of this protein. The concentration of UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids is inversely proportional to irradiance in both the host and symbiont, suggesting that these compounds may not provide sufficient protection against UV radiation in high-irradiance environments. The {{significant differences in the}} specific activities of these antioxidant enzymes, cellular photosynthetic pigment concentrations, and UV-absorbing compounds from high- and low-irradiance habitats constitute an adaptive response to different photic environments.

To explain this and other peculiar properties of the oPDUGs, we construct an evolving-graph model for the long-timescale evolutionary dynamics of oPDUGs, containing only divergent mechanisms of domain discovery. The model generates degree distributions (resembling Pareto laws) and clustering-coefficient distributions that are characteristic of the oPDUGs.
