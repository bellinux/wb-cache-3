40|$|Abstract: <b>Pipe</b> <b>joints</b> {{have been}} widely {{utilized}} in industrial plants, where dynamic load of vibration is considerably harmful for sealing performance. However, there is a lock of design codes and experimental procedures developed for vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper proposes an experimental setup for testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints,</b> which use metal gaskets, in vibratory conditions. Also, a flexible piezoelectric film sensor is introduced into this test rig for monitoring of stress in pipes. With the proposed test rig, vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> can be conducted, therefore further investigations such as fatigue analysis of the contact surfaces, and computational analysis of metal gaskets and seal devices are readily available. Finally, some experimental results of a gasketed flange joint, which uses a 1. 5 -inch diameter stainless steel gasket, were reported...|$|R

Several <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> test sections consisting of variations in sawing methods, joint cleaning techniques, sealant installation, and sealant types have been established {{over the past few}} years.

An innovative, nondestructive, broad coverage <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> tester that yields quick results has been designed and developed for evaluation of pavement <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> performance. The Iowa vacuum <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> tester (IA-VAC) applies a low vacuum above a <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> that has been spray-covered with a foaming water solution. Any unsealed area or leak that exists along the joint will become quickly and clearly visible by the development of bubbles at the leak point.

In {{the present}} work, cohesive zone model (CZM) based analytical solutions are derived for the bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> under torsion. The {{concept of the}} minimum relative interface rotation ϕm is introduced and used as the fundamental variable to express all other parameters, such as external torsion load, distribution of interfacial shear stress, length of elastic zone and softening zone, etc. It is found that when the bond length of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> is longer than a certain value, further increase in bond length cannot bring any significant increase in torsion load capacity. Given that the bond length of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> is long enough, the torsion load capacity is indeed independent of the shape of cohesive laws and the bond length. Consequently, simplified expressions of the torsion load capacity are derived {{as a function of}} the interface fracture energy, torsion stiffness of the pipe, and the geometric properties of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joints.</b> Depending on the torsion stiffness ratio of the pipe and the coupler, the macroscopic-debonding can initiate at the right end, left end or both ends simultaneously. It is interesting to note that the maximum torsion load capacity is achieved when the torsion stiffness of the pipe and the coupler are identical. Good agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) result validates the accuracy of the current model. Fracture energy based formulas of the torsion load capacity derived in the present work can be directly used in the design of adhesively bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that bolt tension is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition.
