40|$|A {{major goal}} of ecology and {{evolutionary}} biology is to explain patterns of species richness among clades. Differences in rates of net diversification (speciation minus extinction over time) may often explain these patterns, but {{the factors that}} drive variation in diversification rates remain uncertain. Three important candidates are climatic niche position (e. g., whether clades are primarily temperate or tropical), rates of climatic niche change among species within clades, and microhabitat (e. g., aquatic, terrestrial, arboreal). The first two factors have been tested separately in several studies, but {{the relative importance of}} all three is largely unknown. Here we explore the correlates of diversification among families of frogs, which collectively represent approximate to 88 % of amphibian species. We assemble and analyze data on phylogeny, climate, and microhabitat for thousands of species. We find that the best-fitting phylogenetic multiple regression model includes all three types of variables: microhabitat, rates of climatic niche change, and climatic niche position. This model explains 67 % of the variation in diversification rates among frog families, with arboreal microhabitat explaining approximate to 31 %, niche rates approximate to 25 %, and climatic niche <b>position</b> <b>approximate</b> to 11 %. Surprisingly, we show that microhabitat can have a much stronger influence on diversification than climatic niche position or rates of climatic niche change...|$|E

The left ventricular disk was <b>positioned</b> <b>approximating</b> the interventricular septum; however, the right ventricular (RV) disk was deployed on the free wall of the RV due to an absent apical muscular septum and a small cavity at the apex.

40|$|An {{unresolved}} {{question in}} vision research is whether perceptual {{decision making and}} action {{are based on the}} same or on different neural representations. Here, we address this question for a straightforward task, the judgment of location. In our experiment, observers decided on the closer of two peripheral objectssituated on the horizontal meridian in opposite hemifieldsand made a saccade to indicate their choice. Correct saccades landed close to the actual (physical) location of the target. However, in case of errors, saccades went {{in the direction of the}} more distant object, yet landed on a <b>position</b> <b>approximating</b> that of the closer one. Our finding supports the notion that perception and action-related decisions on object location rely on the same neural representation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the sequential road feature delineation from digital images. It {{is based on a}} feedback loop between extrapolation and refinement steps of a given road centerline point, using in both steps correlation techniques. Firstly, a previously extracted road centerline point is linearly extrapolated, resulting in an <b>approximate</b> <b>position.</b> Secondly, this <b>approximate</b> <b>position</b> is corrected by comparing gray level profiles extracted perpendicularly to the extrapolation direction. This strategy is then repeated to allow the entire road centerline to be extracted or a stop point to be found. In order to initialize the extraction process, the operator needs to supply a starting point plus direction and width. Experimental results obtained from the application of the method to real image data are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R
