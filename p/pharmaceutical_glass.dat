30|$|Arsenic (As) is a toxic and non-degradable {{metalloid}} {{present in}} the environment in both the organic (i.e., monomethyl arsenate—MMA, dimethyl arsenate—DMA) and inorganic (i.e., arsenite, arsenious acid, arsenate, and arsenic acid) forms (Kumaresan and Riyazuddin 2001). For inorganic As, four main oxidation states commonly exist: As− 3 (arsine), As 0 (elemental arsenic), As+ 3 (arsenite), and As+ 5 (Arsenate). As {{contamination of the environment}} is a matter of concern since As accumulates in environment and enters the food chain through drinking water and crops (Chakraborty et al. 2014; Alam et al. 2016). The main sources of As groundwater contamination can be both natural and anthropogenic (ref). Naturally As enters groundwater via leaching, rock weathering, volcanic eruption, geochemical reaction, and biological activity (Kanel et al. 2005 a, b). Common anthropogenic As sources include timber treatment with copper chrome arsenate, fertilizers from agriculture sources, and a variety of <b>pharmaceutical,</b> <b>glass,</b> and other chemical activities. As contamination of groundwater has caused havoc in over 70 countries of the world affecting around 150 million people (Ravenscroft et al. 2009). In Bangladesh and India alone, 70 million people are at risk, due to exposure to high concentrations of As in drinking water (Niu et al. 2007). Several diseases like dysfunction of the respiratory system, injury to the nervous system, hepatomegaly, hypertension, and diseases of the peripheral vascular and cardiovascular system with lungs, kidney, liver, skin, large intestine, buccal cavity, urinary track, bone rectum cancer has been reported from this region (Guan et al. 2012). Due to such increasing effect of As, WHO has set permissible limit of As in drinking water as 10  µg/L (WHO 1993).|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{ways are}} {{employed}} in the pharmaceutical industry to prepare active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) such as proteins, vaccines and antibiotics in the glassy state. Of these methods, solvent removal is the most widely applied technique e. g. lyophilization, spray drying, spray freeze drying, vacuum drying, film drying, drying from a foam, etc. The stability of API in different glasses after their preparation is of prime importance to the pharmaceutical industry. In our studies, we will investigate the influence of different processing conditions and drying methods on the storage stability of API in amorphous matrices. We will mainly address two important points: the impact of heating glasses on storage stability and on some of physicochemical properties, {{and the impact of}} drying method on the storage stability and physicochemical properties of amorphous formulations containing proteins and vaccines as active ingredients. ^ First, we will address structural relaxation and its relationship to the solid state stability of amorphous pharmaceuticals. Because thermal history of an amorphous material affects its properties, one can theoretically alter the stability profile of a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>glass</b> even by a modification in processing conditions during drying e. g. performing secondary drying at a higher temperature during freeze drying cycle (i. e. annealing). There is growing evidence for a correlation between chemical degradation rate in amorphous pharmaceuticals and the glassy state dynamics of the glass formed by the excipient and the active ingredient. This has been attributed to the fact that degradation must require some degree of molecular motion for molecules to move into and through the transition state. Movement of neighboring molecules in the glassy state to generate the volume required for motion may be very slow, and therefore rate-limiting. The circumstances under which the mobility required for the degradation process is similar to the mobility required for structural relaxation are unknown, and therefore how well coupled the degradation dynamics and glassy state structural dynamics are is not well understood. It is also known that a glassy system experiences an increase in global relaxation time during aging, but the stability consequences of such an increase are unknown. ^ Second, we address the impact of drying method on the solid state properties of amorphous pharmaceuticals (e. g. specific surface area, particle morphology, particle size, thermal properties, and storage stability). One important effect we investigate in our studies is composition heterogeneity. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E

40|$|At {{temperatures}} {{below the}} nominal {{glass transition temperature}} Tgα, the structural α-relaxation and the Johari-Goldstein (JG) β-relaxation are too slow to contribute to susceptibility measured at frequencies higher than 1 GHz. This is particularly clear {{in the neighborhood of}} the secondary glass transition temperature Tgβ, which can be obtained directly by positronium annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and adiabatic calorimetry, or deduced from the temperature at which the JG β-relaxation time τβ reaches 1000 s. The fast process at such high frequencies comes from the vibrations and caged molecules dynamics manifested as the nearly constant loss (NCL) in susceptibility measurements, elastic scattering intensity, I(Q, T), or the mean-square-displacement, «u 2 (T) », in quasielastic neutron scattering experiment. Remarkably, we find for many different glass-formers that the NCL, I, or «u 2 » measured in the glassy state changes its temperature dependence at temperature THF near Tgβ. In paper I (Capaccioli, S.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2015, 119 (28), 8800 - 8808) we have made known this property {{in the case of the}} polyalcohols and a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>glass</b> former, flufenamic acid studied by THz dielectric spectroscopy, and explained it by the coupling of the NCL to the JG β-relaxation, and the density dependence of these processes. In this paper II, we extend the consideration of the high frequency response to broader range from 100 MHz to THz in the glassy state of many polymers observed by quasielastic light scattering, Brillouin scattering, quasielastic neutron scattering, and GHz-THz dielectric relaxation. In all cases, the NCL changes its T-dependence at some temperature, THF, below Tgα, which is approximately the same as Tgβ. The latter is independently determined by PALS, or adiabatic calorimetry, or low frequency dielectric and mechanical spectroscopy. The property, THF Tgβ, had not been pointed out before by others or in any of the quasielastic neutron and light scattering studies of various amorphous polymers and van der Waals small molecular glass-formers over the past three decades. The generality and fundamental importance of this novel property revitalize the data from these previous publications, making it necessary to be reckoned with in any attempt to solve the glass transition problem. In our rationalization, the property arises first from the fact that the JG β-relaxation and the caged dynamics both depends on density and entropy. Second, the JG β-relaxation is the terminator of the caged dynamics, and hence the two processes are inseparable or effectively coupled. Consequently, the occurrence of the secondary glass transition at Tgβ necessarily is accompanied by corresponding change in the temperature dependence of the NCL, I, or «u 2 » of the fast caged dynamics at THF =Tg...|$|E

40|$|The Rock Resources of the Northern Emirates The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has vast {{resources}} of limestone and hard {{rock in the}} northern Emirates. These are currently exploited by quarrying companies to produce construction aggregate and raw material for the manufacture of cement, {{with a small amount}} being used to produce rock wool, dimension stone and mineral filler. The demand by industry for higher value mineral products that could be produced from these resources is mostly met by imports. As part of the work funded by the UAE Ministry of Energy, the British Geological Survey (BGS) carried out studies (during 2008 to 2011) of the hard rock, dimension stone, and limestone and dolomite {{resources of}} the UAE. Hard rock resources There is a well established quarrying industry in the Hajar Mountains of the northern and eastern UAE that produces a range of rock products (mostly construction aggregate) from the UAE-Oman ophiolite rocks (mainly gabbro with ultramafic rocks including harzburgite and dunite). Many quarries are located in areas where the rock resources are of poor quality and/ or the reserves are limited. A study was carried out by the BGS to make the geological information, available in the maps and reports published by the BGS in 2006, more accessible to the quarrying industry. Over 100 quarries were surveyed in the Fujairah, Ras al Khaimah, Ajman, Dubai and Sharjah emirates and rocks samples were collected and tested. A new map was produced that classifies the hard rock resources of the ophiolite according to their suitability for use as construction aggregate. Five categories were used in the classification scheme including: Highest grade gabbro aggregate; Good gabbro aggregate; Good gabbro aggregate mixed with unsuitable rocks; Unsuitable rocks; and Peridotite serpentinite good aggregate. Unsuitable rocks include basalt, wehrlite and rocks generally near the major fault zones that are intensely altered. The map also includes buffer zones to indicate areas where quarrying may have a detrimental impact on local communities or the road network. The aggregate suitability map could be used for planning purposes such as the expansion of existing quarries and the location of new quarries. It will greatly reduce the quarrying of poor quality rock and improve the standard of construction material produced in the future. Dimension stone resources Dimension stone is natural stone that has been extracted and cut for use in wall cladding, floor tiles and structural components in modern tower blocks, hotels, offices, airports, shopping malls and private homes. A wide variety of rock types are used including igneous (granite, gabbro, porphyry, basalt and serpentine), metamorphic (marble, gneiss and slate) and sedimentary (sandstone, limestone and travertine). The UAE has a thriving dimension stone industry that uses stone imported from India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, China, Oman, Italy, Iran, Turkey, Greece and Pakistan. In 2008, the UAE imported over 200, 000 tonnes of dimension stone valued at over US 42 million. There is currently no significant production of dimension stone from quarries in the UAE. A study was carried out by the BGS to identify limestone and hard rock resources in the UAE {{that could be used for}} the production of dimension stone. In total 31 sites were assessed and samples collected for test work to assess their suitability. Each site was assessed to determine the presence of planes of weakness (bedding, faults, fractures and joints) that could affect the production of large blocks, as well as the accessibility and likelihood of quarrying being permitted. The samples were tested to determine their strength, water absorption, porosity and density, as well as their appearance when cut and polished. The twelve sites identified that met the assessment criteria occur in the Musandam 2 Formation, Dhera Limestone Formation, Jebel Qamar South Limestone Formation, Jebel Qamar North Limestone Formation, Fujairah Gabbro, Kalba Gabbro, Layered Gabbro and Harzburgite. High purity limestone and dolomite resources Limestone and dolomite have many high value industrial applications including the manufacture of paint, paper, plastic, <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>glass,</b> ceramics, food supplements, and chemicals. Currently, the limestone and dolomite resources of the UAE are mainly worked to produce low value construction aggregate, with little production of high-purity products. In 2008 the UAE imported over 200, 000 tonnes of high purity limestone and dolomite valued at over US 20 million to meet industrial demand. A study was carried out by the BGS to assess the potential of the resources in the UAE to produce high-purity limestone and dolomite. Nearly 250 samples of limestone and dolomite were collected from the northern emirates and tested to determine their chemical composition. A new map was produced that classifies the limestone resources of the UAE according to their purity as industrial-grade limestone (calcium carbonate). Five categories were used in the classification scheme including Very high purity; High purity; Medium purity; Low purity; and Impure. The purity is based on the calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), silica (SiO 2) and iron (Fe 2 O 3) content of the limestone. Localities of high purity dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) are also shown on the resource map. Sixty five localities of high purity limestone and 6 localities of high purity dolomite were identified. This study has shown that the UAE has resources of high purity limestone and dolomite that could be used to produce valuable industrial products. The development of these resources has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the economic diversification of the UAE economy...|$|R
40|$|The Italian {{industrial}} sector {{is characterized by}} a number of peculiarities compared to other advanced countries. One of these is the small average size of its firms. This particular model of organization of production, based on the small dimension and often on informal relationships within and outside the firm, guarantees flexibility and a high degree of specialization, two key factors of the Italian economic performance. But this model presents some limits too, one being related to the ownership structure and governance of firms. Another characteristic of the Italian {{industrial sector}} is its weakness in high-tech industries: innovative activity is still far from the level reached in the major industrialized countries, and Italian trade deficit in the technologically-advanced sectors is persisting. In this paper, we try to assess whether the weak performance of the Italian economy in the high-tech sectors may depend upon ownership structure in Italy. Ownership structure can influence innovative activity because it implies particular forms of risk and profit sharing, and particular financial sources. The first part of the paper presents the main characteristics of Italian corporate governance and ownership structure, as well as the innovation system in Italy, comparing them with the situation in other industrialized countries.

40|$|Gas-solid {{fluidized}} beds {{have found}} wide industrial applications compared to fixed beds due to low pressure drop and good solid fluid mixing. Some {{of the important}} applications of gas–solid fluidized beds are in dairy, cement, food, and pharmaceutical industries for varied operations which include drying, cooling, coating and agglomeration. This permits a continuous automatically controlled operation with ease of handling and rapid mixing of solids leading to near isothermal conditions throughout the bed, thereby minimizing overheating in case of heat sensitive products. Mixing of solids is a common processing step widely used in industry. It is extensively employed {{in the manufacture of}} ceramics plastics, fertilizers, detergents, <b>glass</b> <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> processed food and cattle feed and in the powder metallurgy industry. Mixing index concept is a very much important factor in fluidization. Mixing index is the ratio of fraction of jetsam in the top portion of bed to the fraction in a well- mixed bed. Mixing index’s value from 0 to 1 corresponds to complete segregation and complete mixing respectively. A mathematical model of a real chemical process is a mathematical description which describes experimental facts and establishes relationship among the process variables. Mathematical modeling is an activity in which qualitative and quantitative representation or abstractions of the real process are carried out using mathematical symbols. In building a mathematical model, a real process is reduced to its bare essentials, and the resultant scheme is described by a mathematical formalism selected according to the complexity of the process. The resulting model could be either analytical or numerical in nature depending upon the method used for obtaining the solution. It is important that the model should also represent with sufficient accuracy qualitative and quantitative properties of the prototype process and should adequately fit the real process. For a check on this requirement, the observation made on the process should be compared with predictions derived from the model under identical ivconditions. Thus, a mathematical model of a real process is a mathematical description combining experimental facts and establishing relationships between the process and variables. Mixtures of solid particles of different sizes and/or densities tend to separate during fluidization. Particles that sink to the gas distributor are referred to as jetsam, while those that float on the fluidized bed surface are referred to as flotsam. Mixing and Segregation behavior of mixture particles is of practical importance because particle distributions in the fluidized bed influences the chemical reaction, bed expansion, and various mass and heat transfer properties in the fluidized beds. Many studies {{have been made in the}} past in order to understand the underlying mechanisms and predict the behaviour of mixing and segregation, including the investigation of factors affecting the mixing/segregation, the development of predictive empirical and theoretical correlations, as well as mathematical and numerical models. A theoretical model has been developed on the basis of “counter flow solid circulation model”. Considering both vertical and horizontal movement of the jetsam particles as some particles displace horizontally due to the bursting of bubbles, the dispersion model in the form of the differential equation is written and this is solved by finite difference method. For calculating concentration of jetsam particles and mixing index at any height of the bed, a c-language program is written. The numerical results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. It is observed that both the concentration of the jetsam particles and mixing index decreases with the height of particles layers in the bed (measured from the distributor). It is also observed that the unpromoted bed gives better mixing index values than promoted bed due to its greater flow area. Optimum fraction of bed materials with respect to its distribution ion the upward and downward streams during the fluidization process can be taken up to 20 %. When static bed height, operating fluidization velocity and jetsam particles composition values increases, for all the cases corresponding mixing index values decreases. It is seen that mixing index values of disc promoted bed and rod promoted fluidized bed are nearly same although flow area of rod promoted fluidized bed is greater than disc promoted fluidized bed...|$|R
40|$|Micro-CT is a {{very useful}} {{non-destructive}} technique for the 3 D study of bone, biomaterials and their interactions because {{it is able to}} supply structural and densitometric information by obtaining images of the internal structure of a small object with a high spatial resolution. Besides, Micro-CT is an important tool to study the interactions between biomaterials and bone tissue from a 3 D point of view. Typical uses in biomedical fields include the study of in vitro bone samples and biomaterials such as hydroxyapatite (HA), bioactive <b>glasses,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> granules, metals and composites (polymers + HA or calcium phosphate). Usually, the most evaluated material parameter is porosity because it plays a dominant role in the biomechanical characteristics, the initial cell attachment and thus the subsequent tissue regeneration. Due to the linear attenuation coefficient specific for every material, is important to set X-ray source voltage and image reconstruction corrections depending on involved materials. More specifically, bone is a connective tissue composed by an average of about 2 / 3 of inorganic substances and 1 / 3 of organic substances. The main constituents of the inorganic matrix of bone is a mixture of HA and TCP while biomaterials in orthopedics can be enclosed within two categories:- biomaterials used as replacement of bone to stimulate tissue regeneration and that can be completely absorbed and degraded (mainly ceramic and polymers); - biomaterials for prosthetic implants that have mechanical properties that ensure stabilization of fractures or damaged joints (mainly metals, ceramics or high density polymers). Moreover, micro-CT, deriving from clinical CT, allow studying the interactions between biomaterials and bone tissue also in a longitudinal way. The statistical power of longitudinal studies compared to cross-sectional studies has a great meaning principally because the effect of an implanted biomaterial can be evaluated over time in the same sample. In fact, an in vivo micro-CT analysis allows an assessment and quantification of the development over time in healing processes due to the application of engineered medical devices. The ability to study the time evolution of anatomical changes occurring {{in the course of the}} experiment could exclude the use of different experimental groups and, thus, has a significant ethical meaning that should not be underestimated. Limitations of the in vivo micro-CT image acquisition are: the complexity of displaying small structures that are moving dynamically due principally to breathing and heart beating; the limitation in administered X-ray dose distribution per animal due to the destructive effects on living organisms and cells; and the linear attenuation coefficient specific for every material including animal soft and hard tissues. The evaluation of the mineral content is another important and peculiar task of micro-CT. The variations in mineral content are determinable due to the principle that the gray levels of every micro-CT section give a map of the distribution of the absorption coefficients of the X-rays related to the analyzed sample. Such coefficients depend on the material density, from the atomic number of the elements that constitute it and from the incidental energy used. In orthopedic preclinical studies, usually two different densitometric parameters are evaluated: Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Tissue Mineral Density (TMD). Mineralization is an important aspect in several bone disease evolution such as, for example, osteoporosis or osteoarthritis. The first year of the research was dedicated to the micro-CT analysis of different kinds of biomaterials in the pre-implantation phase studying new procedures to widen the acquisition possibilities and the kinds of quantitative analytical methods. In particular the project followed 3 different research lines: a) the study of thixotropic carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) hydrogels added with iron magnetic-nanoparticles (CMC-NPs) examining the differences in magnetic particles distribution and using a micro-CT freezing chamber to overcome the limitation of movements during the acquisition; b) the study of the 3 D cell (MG 63) distribution seeded onto a polymeric scaffold using osmium tetroxide as contrast agent and developing a new micro-CT segmentation protocol; c) the study of dimensional metrology establishing an approach for the quantification of wear in ZrO 2 head prosthesis components using micro-CT and to validate the method comparing it with the gold standard, i. e. the gravimetric analysis. The second year was dedicated to the study of the interactions between different types of biomaterials implanted in bone tissue. The micro-CT analyses were performed as a result of in vivo preclinical studies and clinical retrieved studies. During this year, the project was divided in the following research lines: a) the evaluation of the in vivo behaviour of ceramic custom made prosthesis in a suitable animal model (adult sheep) at 6 and 12 months from surgical cranioplasty; b) the evaluation of the characteristics of bone quality and its microarchitecture in retrieved metal-on-metal Metal-on-metal HR; c) the analysis of granules characteristics using a new injectable multiphasic bone substitutes based on gel-coated OsproLife® HA/TTCP. During the third year, the non “functional”, i. e. non quantitative, information obtainable from a micro-CT analysis was deepened, testing the most important computer algorithms for 3 D visualization and modelling: maximum intensity projection (MIP), shaded surface display (SSD) and volume rendering (VR). Moreover, the Micro-CT analyses performed were divided in the following research lines: a) the evaluation of the in vivo osteoinductive behaviour of three-dimensional interconnected porous scaffolds of gelatin with or without contents of nanocrystalline HA over time; b) the evaluation of bone quality in terms of mineral content in a study of osteoarthritis treatment in a large animal model with engineered hyaluronic acid scaffolds. The main objective of this PhD research was to develop innovative techniques and procedures of 3 D image analysis for the characterization of polymeric, ceramic and metal biomaterials used in various fields of bone tissue preclinical research. In detail the aims can be summarized in: – assessing micro-CT procedures applicable to pre-implanted biomaterials through both metrological studies and in vitro studies of 3 D cell scaffold colonization, with the definition of effective segmentation techniques; – developing micro-CT techniques to evaluate different kinds of implanted biomaterials both ex vivo and in vivo establishing standard test protocols and identifying the mechanisms of material resorption and degradation in physiological environment and the mechanisms of bone remodeling; – exploring the densitometric analysis in relation to the contribution of mineralization in healing process at peri-implant site. These program objectives have been achieved through the development of reliable experimental procedures for the morphological and mechanical evaluation of implantation biomaterials (scaffold and prostheses); the investigation of a large number of possible applications of biomaterials in orthopedic preclinical studies through in vitro, ex-vivo and in vivo micro-CT analysis; the elaboration of new interpretative models of the bone regeneration mechanisms through 3 D morphometric parameters; and the extension of the knowledge and the expertise in 3 D biomaterial evaluations used in orthopedic research...|$|R
