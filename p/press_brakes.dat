On contact with the sheet, the roll contacts on two points and it rotates as the forming process bends the sheet.

50|$|After some {{contention}} by OSHA, {{an electronic}} safety device can {{fall under the}} PSD umbrella. One such device is the Laser Sentry press brake safety device, designed by Glen Koedding, CEO of Metal Tech Controls Corp, in 2003. The concept was challenged with OSHA by a competitor almost immediately. OSHA responded by issuing a letter of disapproval stating that the Laser Sentry {{did not meet the}} “safe distance” rule. The rule states that a presence sensing protective device must be a minimum of 6 inches away from the nearest pinch point. However, after further observation, Laser Sentry was deemed a Presence Sensing Device (PSD) in 2004, when used in conjunction with hydraulic <b>press</b> <b>brakes.</b> Laser Sentry features laser guides that ensure the safety of a press brake operator while employing the precision of lasers directly surrounding the die. OSHA's caveat to its approval of the device was that they be properly installed and inspected. Among other presence sensing devices available, this device {{can be used as a}} retrofit to aging machines.|$|E
