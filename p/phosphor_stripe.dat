5000|$|The {{electrons}} {{from the}} cathodes are all aimed toward {{a single point}} {{at the back of}} the screen where they hit the aperture grille, a steel sheet with vertical slots cut in it. Due to the slight separation of the cathodes {{at the back of the}} tube, the three beams approach the grille at slightly different angles. When they pass through the grille they retain this angle, hitting their individual colored phosphors that are deposited in vertical stripes on the inside of the faceplate. The main purpose of the grille is to ensure that each beam strikes only the phosphor stripes for its color, much as does a shadow mask. However, unlike a shadow mask, there are essentially no obstructions along each entire <b>phosphor</b> <b>stripe.</b> (Larger CRTs have a few horizontal stabilizing wires part way between top and bottom, but in practice, they are not noticed.) ...|$|E
50|$|Later, Sony {{changed the}} whole game, {{replacing}} the shadow mask with an aperture grille and the phosphor dots with vertical <b>phosphor</b> <b>stripes.</b> They cleverly implemented a single electron gun with three independent cathodes, {{all of which}} greatly simplified convergence.|$|R
50|$|LPD uses {{a set of}} movable mirrors {{to direct}} light from several ultra-violet lasers onto a screen made of a plastic-glass hybrid {{material}} coated with color <b>phosphor</b> <b>stripes.</b> The lasers scan the screen line by line from top to bottom. The energy from the lasers' light activates the phosphors, which emit photons, producing an image.|$|R
50|$|The beam-index tube is a color {{television}} {{cathode ray tube}} design, using <b>phosphor</b> <b>stripes</b> and active-feedback timing, rather than phosphor dots and a beam-shadowing mask as developed by RCA. Beam indexing offered much brighter pictures than shadow-mask CRTs, and used a single electron gun rather than three, {{making it easier to}} build and reducing power consumption.|$|R
25|$|Dot pitch {{defines the}} maximum {{resolution}} of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, moiré appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render. Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré; however, because their <b>phosphor</b> <b>stripes</b> have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.|$|R
40|$|Vertical Colour Selection (VCS) is {{an option}} for slim CRTs with {{increased}} sharpness and brightness. The direction of self-convergence of the DY is changed to vertical {{in order to obtain}} better spot uniformity, but the line scan direction remains horizontal. Hence, no video conversion is needed, contrary to transposed scan. In this paper we address two issues: First, there is a high risk of moiré, since the scan lines and the <b>phosphor</b> <b>stripes</b> are parallel. We propose a feedback mechanism guiding the electron beams towards the middle of the mask slots. As positive side effects, the brightness is improved and the shadow mask can be made of a cheap type of steel. Secondly, VCS deflection coils have to satisfy different requirements than coils in ordinary CRTs. We discuss the design rules for self-convergent VCS coils and present simulation results...|$|R
