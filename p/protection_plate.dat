50|$|Renault's initial {{proposal}} {{was based on}} the Renault ZM, or Renault R35. It had a similar smooth curved cast hull to that of the light infantry tank but was much wider and had six road wheels and double tracks per side — to avoid having to design a new broad track.

5000|$|As {{a part of}} {{an overall}} export push by Volkswagen do Brasil (VWB), 170,000 [...] "Passat LSE" [...] were also built between 1983 and 1988 {{specifically}} for export to Iraq. These cars received various upgrades to suit Iraqi conditions, such as a <b>protection</b> <b>plate</b> for the engine, a stronger radiator, and standard air conditioning, and were bartered for oil which was transferred to Petrobras. As Petrobras' oil reserves grew larger than necessary, VWB found themselves with a large stock of Iraqi-spec cars that they were unable to export. In July 1986 local sales of these leftovers began. Despite being fitted with the old 72 PS 1.6-liter MD270 engine and a four-speed transmission rather than the more powerful AP600 and five-speed unit used in current Brazilian cars, the LSE was an unexpected success in the Brazilian market.|$|E
50|$|However, it was {{not long}} before the police came under attack with firearms; against which the cages and {{hardboard}} of the early Land Rovers provided no <b>protection.</b> <b>Plates</b> of ballistic steel were added to each side of the rear cargo bed and an armoured steel door was fitted to the rear. Whilst this provided a greater degree of protection from low velocity weapons, there were many areas of the vehicle which were still unprotected. The RUC realised that a fresh design was required to protect their officers.|$|R

50|$|The armour of the TR-85M1 tank has {{a maximum}} {{thickness}} of 200 mm (multilayered) for the hull and 320 + 20 mm add-on armour on the turret. The 20 mm add-on armour {{on the front}} of the turret has a modular appearance with a triangular profile. Although it might look like bricks of explosive reactive armour, the add-on composite armour is designed this way for easy replacement after combat damage. The tank also has side skirts as a protection against shaped charges. The metal side skirts have three holes each that form steps for the crew to reach the roof hatches. On the sides of the turret there are ammunition boxes for the heavy antiaircraft DShK machine gun. The upper glacis plate has two track segments, while the lower glacis plate can be fitted with steel screens or a mine roller. The TR-85M1 tank also has NBC protection and an improved, rapid fire suppression system using non-toxic agents. The system, designed by L'Hotellier, protects both the crew and the engine compartment using halon. The modernized version adds an additional mine <b>protection</b> <b>plate</b> and a bar for the driver, which increases protection against mines and improvised explosive devices. Also, the older TR-85 tanks have a conventional driver's seat bolted on the floor of the tank, wherereas the M1 version has a parachute-harness like arrangement. In this way, the driver does not have any contact with the hull except on the pedals and is out of the shockwave area of exploding land mines or IEDs.|$|E
5000|$|The Char D1's Renault FT ancestry {{can still}} {{be seen from the}} sloping engine deck and the profile of the side armour plates; it is also still a rather narrow vehicle, only 2.16 metre wide. Its length is 5.76 metre with tail. The riveted hull armour is thirty mm thick on all {{vertical}} surfaces, ten mm on top and bottom. The NC31 introduced a 10 mm <b>protection</b> <b>plate</b> for the suspension units; the lower hull side armour beneath it was probably 16 or 25 mm thick — the exact data have been lost. For its time the Char D1 was relatively well armoured; as a result the hull alone weighs 11 metric tons, rather heavier than a typical light tank of the period. A 74 hp V-4 engine of 6.08 litre renders a top speed of 18.6 km/h; the range is ninety kilometres; it can climb a 110 cm obstacle and a 50% slope, cross a 220 cm trench and wade through 90 cm of water. The type thus had a relatively good mobility for the early thirties. In the hull are two crew members. The first is the driver who, as with the Renault FT, is seated below large double hatches that form the nose plates. He can operate, via a steel cable, a fixed 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun low in the nose, that is almost completely hidden behind the armour. The second crew member operates the radio set {{on the right side of}} the fighting compartment, the set being an ER (Émetteur-Récepteur or [...] "emitter-receiver") 51 for the NC31s and an ER52 or 53 for the series vehicles. At the right of the engine deck a very distinctive and robust radio antenna frame is fitted, its point the highest of the vehicle at 2.4 metres. It impedes a full rotation of the turret to the right, limiting the total movement to about 345°. The radio operator also assists in the loading of the gun, by handing over rounds taken from the munition load of 76 to the third crew member, the commander, located in the turret.|$|E

50|$|From the Middle East, mail {{was quickly}} adopted in Central Asia by the Sogdians and by India in the South. Mail armour was {{commonly}} used by Mongol armies where it eventually became the armour {{of choice in}} India. Indian mail was constructed with alternating rows of solid links and round riveted links and it was often integrated with <b>plate</b> <b>protection</b> (mail and <b>plate</b> armour). Mail and plate armour was commonly used in India until the Battle of Plassey and the subsequent British conquest of the sub-continent.|$|R
50|$|At {{this moment}} however it was {{recognized}} by the commission that the weight estimate earlier made by the bribed Infantry officer had been a deliberate falsehood and that the best that could be expected was 28 tonnes. Also the claimed first production date, that had already led to a limiting of Char B1 bis orders, later was proven to be wildly optimistic. In April 1938 Renault claimed that weight could yet be saved by perpetuating the feature of the torsion-bar suspension, limiting the crew to four and keeping the ammunition load to its bare minimum. The commission decided however to bring the weight limit of the project to thirty tonnes, as this was {{in line with the}} other projects and the planned inner hull side armour (located below fifty millimetres external suspension <b>protection</b> <b>plates)</b> of ten millimetres was deemed too thin. The weight advantage in relation to the rival designs thus largely disappeared.|$|R
5000|$|The Z.1007 had a {{defensive}} armament of four machine guns: two 12.7 mm (.5 in) and two 7.7 mm (.303 in). The main defensive weapon was a Caproni-Lanciani Delta manually powered Isotta Fraschini dorsal turret {{armed with a}} 12.7 mm (.5 in) Scotti or Breda-SAFAT machine gun. The turret had a good field of fire, although it had blind spot behind the tail (as did all turreted aircraft without rear gunners or twin vertical stabilizers). The 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda was a standard weapon for Italian bombers and the field of fire was improved by the twin-tail configuration on later models. An electrically powered Breda V turret carrying a similar armament was substituted in late production aircraft. [...] Another 12.7 mm (.5 in) was in the ventral position behind the bomb bay, with a field of fire restricted to the lower rear quadrant of the aircraft. There were also two waist position 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda machine guns, with 500 rpg. Only one of the waist guns could be used at a time since the gunner for this position manned both guns (a practice common with other aircraft, such as the He 111, B-25 Mitchell and G4M Betty). Simultaneous attacks from both sides were generally rare, and waist guns are generally the least effective armament on an aircraft, mostly intended to improve morale and provide a deterrent effect. Allied reports stated that armour was better than usual for an Italian bomber, with the dorsal gunner receiving a large [...]76 m × 1.1 m (2 ft 6in x 3 ft 6 in) armor plate, plus a small head <b>protection</b> <b>plate</b> of [...]36 m × [...]20 m (14 x 8 in), {{as well as a}} 8 mm (.31 in) thick curved plate which rotated with his turret. There was rear armor plate 5 mm (.20 in) thick for side gunners, with other 6 mm (.24 in) all around the machine guns, and 6 mm (.24 in) armor for ventral machine gun position, which meant that all defensive positions were reasonably protected against light enemy fire and fragments. The pilots were protected with 5 mm (.20 in) roof and lateral armor, 6 mm (.24 in) around the seats, 5 mm (.20 in) overhead, and a 6 mm (.24 in) armored bulkhead behind them.|$|E

The time evolution of the temperature field closely around the thermistor after resistive heating for different time intervals was empirically approximated, physically modeled, and numerically simulated in finite element method with software ASNSYS, to prove its feasibility.

The tracks were protected by easily replaceable steel side <b>protection</b> <b>plates,</b> which were fixed with screws. As extra protection, steel aprons were attached on the side. The surface was provided with a welded-steel thickening, the drivers hatch was strengthened and provided with 360 ° slotted sights. The whole tactical equipment was removed, under the tower a platform made from aluminum was installed. The tower had a hatch of the same type as the driver's hatch. The tank was usually only used with one crew member, the driver, although there was enough space for an observer or a commander. Tower and driver positions were connected, so {{in case of a}} jammed driver's hatch, the driver could exit the tank through the hatch in the tower.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of CFD modeling of the coal pulverizing mill at the Loy Yang B Power Station in Victoria, Australia. The focus of this work is to consider issues relevant to coal power generation whereby the quality of the fuel supply varies in sand content. The Eulerian/Lagrangian approach was used for the numerical modelling due to the low solid-to-gas loading of the industrial power station flows. The sand modelling investigation highlighted that the larger sand particles recirculates through the grinding mill via the classifier return duct. Erosion of the mill-wall system is influenced by the sand loading. Results showed the reduction of wear was significantly reduced as the gas mass-flow was reduced. The CFD modelling produced consistent results for the particle mass flow splits between the three mill-duct legs when compared with the measured data conducted in the earlier trials.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the physical isolation of inner and outer divertor volumes by a septum plate of the Mk-II gas box divertor, thus increasing divertor closure and neutral compression, on the plasma and divertor performance has been studied at the Joint European Torus (JET). The septum plate was installed in 1999, together with the original Mk-II gas box divertor, and was then replaced by a simple <b>protection</b> <b>plate</b> in 2001. This removal reduced {{the closure of the}} divertor by opening a line of sight path for neutrals to travel between the inner to the outer divertor volumes. Comparison of identical discharges with and without the septum thus provides direct evidence of the effect of divertor closure on plasma behaviour. With this aim, following septum removal, several dedicated L-mode and H-mode discharges have been performed, in each case repeating earlier discharges when the septum was still in place. In each case, the fuelling location was varied between the inner/outer divertor and the main chamber, and differences in detachment in the inner and outer divertors were studied. Under L-mode conditions, differences in detachment dynamics were indeed observed between closed (with septum) and open (without septum) divertor configurations, although the differences were only significant in the medium density range. In contrast, the ultimate density limit was not affected, being determined in each case by the formation of a wall multifacedted asymmetric radiation from the edge (MARFE), rather than an X-point MARFE. Under H-mode conditions, the differences were more subtle. Although the ion fluxes to the targets were unaffected, the target electron temperatures were found to be lower in the closed divertor configuration. In this case, the fuelling efficiency was the largest when the gas injected from the inner divertor, with implications on global energy confinement and ELM frequency. Otherwise, no difference in the confinement of the discharges with and without septum was observed...|$|E
50|$|Several {{elements}} of body armour (body cuirass, shoulder guards, breast <b>plates</b> and lower <b>protection</b> <b>plates)</b> {{from the late}} Mycenaean period have been found at Thebes, some bronze bands have been also found at Mycenae and Phaistos. Bronze scales were found at Mycenae and Troy; scale armour, the oldest form of metal body armour, was used widely throughout the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. In May 1960 Swedish archaeologists discovered the earliest example of a beaten bronze cuirass at Dendra, dated {{to the end of}} the fifteenth century BC. It forms part of the Late Helladic (LHIIIa) Dendra Panoply, which consists of fifteen separate pieces of bronze sheet, held together with leather thongs, that encased the wearer from neck to knees. The panoply includes both greaves and lower arm-guards. The arm-guard is unique but greaves, probably made of linen, are often depicted in late Mycenaean art. The few bronze examples that have been found only covered the shins and may have been worn over linen ones, as much for show of status Diane Fortenberry has suggested, as for protection. Although we have only this one complete panoply to date, armor of similar type appears as an ideogram on Linear B tablets from Knossos (Sc series), Pylos (Sh series) and Tiryns (Si series).|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{protection}} {{system is a}} key element in atmospheric re-entry missions of aerospace vehicles. Usually, in the thermal load calculations, the analysis assumes that the vehicle has a smooth surface. However, discontinuities or imperfections are often present on the aerospace vehicle surfaces due to fabrication tolerances, sensor installations, spaces between the thermal <b>protection</b> <b>plates,</b> and differential expansion or ablation rates between non-similar materials. In the present work, rarefied hypersonic flows over two- and three-dimensional cavities at an altitude of 80 km in the Earth’s atmosphere are studied numerically. To model flows in the transitional regime, where the validity of the Navier Stokes equations is questionable, the direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been used. The primary goal is to assess the sensitivity of heat transfer, pressure, and skin-friction coefficients for a family of two- and three-dimensional cavities defined by different length-to-depth ratios. The analysis shows that an assumption of two-dimensionality {{plays a key role in}} the over prediction of the aerodynamic properties. Previous work using a continuum approach shows that two recirculation regions and flow attachment occurs when the length-to-depth ratio is equal to 14; however, the same phenomena are observed in the transitional regime when the cavity length-to-depth ratio is equal to 4. A study of the influence of the cavity width has also been conducted. It is shown that increasing the cavity width results in an augmentation of the surface aerothermodynamic quantitie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Well-designed {{clinical}} {{studies on the}} palatal development in preterm and low birthweight infants are desirable because the literature is characterized by contradictory results. It could be shown that knowledge about 'normal' palatal development is still weak as well (Part 1). The objective of this review is therefore to contribute a fundamental analysis of methodologies, confounding factors, and outcomes of studies on palatal development in preterm and low birthweight infants. Methods An electronic literature search as well as hand searches were performed based on Cochrane search strategies including sources {{of more than a}} century in English, German, and French. Original data were recalculated from studies which primarily dealt with both preterm and term infants. The extracted data, especially those from non-English paper sources, were provided unfiltered for comparison. Results Seventy-eight out of 155 included articles were analyzed for palatal morphology of preterm infants. Intubation, feeding tubes, feeding mode, tube characteristics, restriction of oral functions, kind of diet, cranial form and birthweight were seen as causes contributing to altered palatal morphology. Changes associated with intubation concern length, depth, width, asymmetry, crossbite, and contour of the palate. The phenomenon 'grooving' has also been described as a complication associated with oral intubation. However, this phenomenon suffers from lack of a clear-cut definition. Head flattening, pressure from the oral tube, pathologic or impaired tongue function, and broadening of the alveolar ridges adjacent to the tube have been raised as causes of 'grooving'. Metrically, the palates of intubated preterm infants remain narrower, which has been examined up to the age of the late mixed dentition. Conclusion There is no evidence that would justify the exclusion of any of the raised causes contributing to palatal alteration. Thus, early orthodontic and logopedic control of formerly orally intubated preterm infants is recommended, as opposed to non-intubated infants. From the orthodontic point of view, nasal intubation should be favored. The role that palatal <b>protection</b> <b>plates</b> and pressure-dispersing pads for the head have in palatal development remains unclear. </p...|$|R
