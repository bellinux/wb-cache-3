40|$|Crime {{rates have}} surged {{in nearly all}} new democracies. To explain this empir-ical regularity, we model the effects of {{political}} regimes on law enforcement and parametrize political regimes by their vulnerability to violent overthrow. It is assumed that democracies are less vulnerable than dictatorships. We first show that dictatorships generate more investment in “political protection ” or secret police activities. When law enforcement does not depend directly on secret <b>police</b> <b>monitoring,</b> regime types {{have no effect on}} crime rate. This is true even when se-cret <b>police</b> <b>monitoring</b> generates an external effect on regular <b>police</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The results indicate that the crime rate tends to be higher under a democratic than an authoritarian government if law enforcement does depend directly on po-litical monitoring. Thus, to effectively combat crime, young democracies should fill the void created by the old regime’s political police by setting up an elite police force, such as the “Scorpions ” in South Africa. ∗Preliminary draft...|$|R

Although the ICITAP mandate prevents it from doing actual policing in postintervention scenarios, its capacity to build local police forces is increasingly viewed as the ticket to quick military withdrawal following interventions or peacekeeping missions. As the scope of ICITAP activities has widened, so has its geographic reach.

When Hank is killed after arresting Walt, Skyler, believing Walt to be the killer, demands that he leave their house and threatens him with a knife. A physical altercation ensues which is ended by Walter Jr., who proceeds to call 911. Walt responds by kidnapping Holly, ignoring Skyler's desperate pleas for him to stop.

5000|$|Social media often {{features}} in political struggles to control public perception and online activity. In some countries, Internet police or secret <b>police</b> <b>monitor</b> or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in Turkey after the Taksim Gezi Park protests. Both Twitter and YouTube were temporarily {{suspended in the}} country by a court's decision.

The TİB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites {{without the need for}} a court order. Yet TİB's 2014 blocking of Twitter was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech. More recently, in the 2014 Thai coup d'état, the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison.

5000|$|In 2007, {{the gang}} was {{believed}} to be composed of approximately 50 men. An estimate in 2009 by Michael Chettleburgh, an expert on street gangs who works as a consultant on issues of criminal justice, put NPF's membership between 60 and 80. He also asserts that the age of NPF members mostly ranges between 18 and 28. NPF members have criminal tattoos to signal their membership in the gang, with the neck being the standard location for these tattoos. According to Chettleburgh, NPF first formed in the mid-to-late 1980s. In 1993, Morris Glasgow was sentenced to jail for seven years once he was identified as the crime boss of a nationwide pimping ring, possibly NPF. Peel Regional Police (PRP) vice detective Randy Cowan stated in 2007 that NPF is a family-based gang, with members of the 2000s being the relatives of 1990s members. A warning has been issued to police officers to be extremely careful when encountering NPF members because of the gang's [...] "armed and dangerous" [...] status. Both the Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Halifax Regional <b>Police</b> <b>monitor</b> the gang. Like Independent Soldiers, Indian Posse, United Nations, Bo-Gars, Native Syndicate, and Crazy Dragons, NPF has an interprovincial presence. Chettleburgh, the author of Young Thugs: Inside the Dangerous World of Canadian Street Gangs, stated in 2009 that NPF's activities west of Nova Scotia only began approximately ten years earlier, but that the gang's presence had subsequently become well-established in the area of Ontario stretching between Niagara Falls and the Regional Municipality of Peel. The commencement of NPF's activities in southwestern Ontario coincided with their expansion into Quebec. In 2008, Chettleburgh stated that there were approximately 12 confirmed NPF members in Peel. According to Chettleburgh, outlaw motorcycle gangs in the Regional Municipality of Niagara frequently collaborate with NPF. NPF used to have a presence in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) as well, although Chettleburgh has stated that NPF is no longer very active there. In 2010, PRP Constable Mike Viozzi claimed that NPF had an even stronger presence in Montreal than in Ontario. In Invisible Chains, Perrin argues that NPF has also become active in Western Canada.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} factors relating to burglary incidence in England and Wales, the United States, and the Netherlands.

Data {{are drawn from}} national victimization surveys of about the same time: the 1994 British Crime Survey, the 1994 National Crime Victimisation Survey, and the 1993 <b>Police</b> <b>Monitor,</b> respectively. Relative to the two European countries, US households have more idiosyncratic patterns of burglary victimization. Despite differences across the three data sets, several similar effects emerge of variables tapping lifestyle characteristics on burglary victimization. Four variables had significant effects {{in the same direction}} in two or more countries where the third country showed a non-significant effect in the same direction. These were age, lone parent household status, urbanization, and the presence of security measures in the home. Some variables had significant effects in opposite directions according to country: rented accommodation was associated with higher burglary rates in the UK but lower rates in the Netherlands; household affluence was linked with higher rates of burglary in the UK and lower rates in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring in the Dutch {{public sector}} An {{increasing}} stream of monitoring activities {{has entered the}} public sector. A lot of different monitors have been implemented in the Netherlands, like the <b>police</b> <b>monitor,</b> drugs monitor, integration monitor and the emancipation monitor. Although monitoring of policy processes is quite prevalent in the public sector, monitoring still remains an unexplored scientific theme, {{while most of the}} scientific attention is restricted to performance systems. In the current mode of monitoring is often approached in a rational way. Within the rational approach monitoring is seen as an objective search for facts in order to improve policy. The aim of this study however, is to widen this narrow focus and include two other perspectives as well, namely a political and cultural approach of monitoring. These three perspectives are not mutually exclusive. One of the assumptions {{of this study is that}} monitoring activities have impacts on intergovernmental relationships, this because monitors are used on different governmental levels. The impacts of monitors on intergovernmental relationships have not been studied as of yet. This is surprising, because in policy documents monitoring is connected with intergovernmental relationships.

This main question is divided into seven research questions...|$|E
