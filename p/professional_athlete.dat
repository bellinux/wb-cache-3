40|$|Taxation {{of income}} {{for the average person}} can be a {{daunting}} task.

This means that athletes have to pay taxes in every state in which they play a game, practice, and perform a service that is part of their contract. <b>Professional</b> <b>athletes,</b> like every United States (U. S.) citizen, are required to pay both federal and state income taxes. Since <b>professional</b> <b>athletes</b> are constantly traveling, their state of residence becomes even more important when allocating their income to the respective state.

He helped the university team to another NCAA outdoor victory, setting a new personal best of 19.93s in the 200m qualifiers and placing third in the finals.

5|$|Turley {{played his}} first game {{in the major leagues}} on September 29, 1951. He lost to the Chicago White Sox. He did not pitch again in 1951, and after the season ended, he enlisted with the United States Army for two years. Turley {{returned}} to the Browns in August 1953, and caught attention for his high strikeout rate. Turley remained with the team after they moved to Baltimore, Maryland, to become the Baltimore Orioles in 1954. He earned $9,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for the 1954 season. He pitched the first game at Memorial Stadium, striking out nine in a complete game. A power pitcher, Turley recorded many strikeouts, but did not have great control. For the 1954 season, he led the American League in strikeouts with 185, but also led the league with 181 walks. That year, he earned comparisons to fellow fireballer Bob Feller, and finished in third place in balloting for the Hickok Belt, given to the <b>professional</b> <b>athlete</b> of the year.|$|E

5|$|A lasting {{legacy of}} Vézina was the trophy named after him. At {{the start of}} the 1926–27 season, Leo Dandurand, Leo Letourneau and Joseph Cattarinich, owners of the Montreal Canadiens, donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL in honour of Vézina. It was to be awarded to the goaltender of the team who allowed the fewest goals during the regular season. The inaugural winner of the trophy was Vézina's {{successor}} in goal for the Canadiens, George Hainsworth. He {{went on to win the}} trophy the next two seasons as well. In 1981, the NHL changed the format of awarding the trophy, instead giving it to the goaltender deemed best in the league based on a poll of NHL general managers. The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945 and among the first nine inductees was Vézina. In 1998 Vézina was ranked number 75 on The Hockey News list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. In honour of the first <b>professional</b> <b>athlete</b> to come from Chicoutimi, the city renamed their hockey arena the Centre Georges-Vézina in 1965. When the NHL announced its 100 greatest players in conjunction with the league's centennial 2017, Vézina was included on the list.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during his}} senior year, James was the {{centerpiece}} of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a <b>professional</b> <b>athlete.</b> This prompted {{an investigation by the}} Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the question, whether <b>professional</b> <b>athletes</b> have special reasons to act morally outside of the {{sporting}} arena? <b>Professional</b> <b>athletes</b> receive a tremendous amount of media attention, {{both on and off the}} field. Hence, they are in the limelight not only for their sporting excellence and athletic achievement but also for their behaviour in aspects of life beyond their particular field. The objective of this thesis is to show that <b>professional</b> <b>athletes</b> have more reasons to act morally than ordinary people. The first chapter {{is focused on}} the role model argument. <b>Professional</b> <b>athletes</b> hold positions of great influence, fame and authority in our society and, hence, they are role models for the rest of us. Because of their highly unusual influence, they have a moral obligation to be good role models which stem from social responsibility. The second chapter {{is focused on the}} special relationship between sport and morality. Namely, I argue that athletes have a special reason to act morally because of the intrinsic and instrumental value of integrity. Therefore, this thesis claims that <b>professional</b> <b>athletes</b> have special reasons to act morally stemming from the social responsibility and the value of personal integrit...|$|R
