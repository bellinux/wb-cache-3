5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing <b>protein</b> <b>intake</b> in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate <b>protein</b> <b>intake</b> from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude <b>protein</b> <b>intake</b> in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce.

40|$|Background: Variation in {{absorption}} efficiency explains more of {{the variability}} in calcium balance than does actual calcium intake. Several investigators {{have suggested that the}} relatively high phosphorus and <b>protein</b> <b>intakes</b> of the diets of industrialized nations reduce calcium absorption and thereby aggravate the problem of calcium deficiency. Objective: My objective was to test whether variation in phos-phorus and <b>protein</b> <b>intakes</b> is associated with variation in cal-cium absorption. Design: One hundred ninety-one Roman Catholic nuns aged 48. 7 ± 7. 0 y were studied 3 times each over a> 20 -y period with a full metabolic balance regimen; controlled, chemically analyzed diets; and double-tracer measurement of calcium absorption.

Similarly, upper-arm muscle mass was not less in those elderly people {{at the lower end}} of the range of <b>protein</b> <b>intakes.</b> Thus in this population of overtly healthy elderly men and women, there was no evidence of protein deficiency in contrast to other surveys where elderly people with chronic diseases were included.

DESIGN: Dietary <b>protein</b> and energy <b>intakes</b> were assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire in 266 patients, and factors other than dialysis adequacy that are potentially associated with reductions in energy and <b>protein</b> <b>intakes</b> were examined. RESULTS: Only 39 % of the patients had <b>protein</b> <b>intakes</b> > or = 1. 2 g x kg(- 1) x d(- 1), and 26 % had energy intakes > or = 126 kJ x kg(- 1) x d(- 1).

Multiple regression analysis showed that other than increasing age, diabetes, and total urea clearance, having a history of volume overload was independently associated with a 0. 22 -g x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) decrease in protein (P = 0. 001) and a 13. 07 -kJ x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) decrease in energy intake (P = 0. 006).

25|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} has an {{emotional}} and physiological {{impact on the}} individual. Many who have undergone the surgery suffer from depression in the following months {{as a result of}} a change in the role food plays in their emotional well-being. Strict limitations on the diet can place great emotional strain on the patient. Energy levels in the period following the surgery can be low, both due to the restriction of food intake and negative changes in emotional state. It may take as long as three months for emotional levels to rebound. Muscular weakness in the months following surgery is also common. This is caused by a number of factors, including a restriction on <b>protein</b> <b>intake,</b> a resulting loss in muscle mass and decline in energy levels. Muscle weakness may result in balance problems, difficulty climbing stairs or lifting heavy objects, and increased fatigue following simple physical tasks. Many of these issues pass over time as food intake gradually increases. However, the first months following the surgery can be very difficult, an issue not often mentioned by physicians suggesting the surgery. The benefits and risks of this surgery are well established; however, the psychological effects are not well understood.|$|E

Advisor: JB. Suparyatmo, Co-advisor: Diffah Hanim. Thesis: The Graduate Program in Nutrition Science, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta ABSTRACT Background: Protein energy {{malnutrition}} (PEM) is {{a condition}} frequently found in pregnant woman. The mothers with PEM can affect the fetal growth, which makes it susceptible to low birth weight risks. The prevalence of low birth weight in newborns of the mothers with PEM who did receive intensive nutrition counseling was 20, 1 % in Jember regency. Objective: The objective {{of this research is}} to analyze the effect of the nutrition counseling of third trimester pregnancy woman with PEM on the birth weight in newborns. Method: This research used the quasi experimental method with the pretest-posttest control group design. The samples of research consist of 37 respondents, 18 for control group and 19 for counseling group and taken using the purposive sampling technique. The data of research were collected through questionnaire, checklist, and body scale and analyzed using the Independent Sample t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-Square, and Fisher’s Exact Test. ¬ Result: The nutrition counseling did not had any direct effect on the birth weight as indicated by the p-value = 0. 380. Yet, had an effect on the increase of energy and <b>protein</b> <b>intakes</b> as indicated by the p-value = 0. 000 and p = 0. 014. The fundal height had a contribution of 4. 681 times to the birth weight. The mothers’ body weight had a contribution of 1. 375 times on the birth weight. The energy and <b>protein</b> <b>intakes</b> had contributions of 1. 003 times and 0. 961 times on the birth weight.

A chart audit gathered other demographics, clinical, anthropometric and dietary information. T-tests or one-way analysis of variance tests were used to identify differences in total energy and <b>protein</b> <b>intakes.</b> Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to determine predictors of eating inadequately (i. e. intake of < 75 % of estimated energy and protein requirements). Results Mean energy and <b>protein</b> <b>intakes</b> of the 184 patients were 5917 ± 2956 kJ and 54 ± 28 g, respectively. Estimated energy and protein requirements were calculated for 93 patients.

In multivariate analysis, patients on the renal ward were 4. 1 and 4. 6 times more likely to be eating inadequately for energy and protein, respectively (p< 0. 05).
