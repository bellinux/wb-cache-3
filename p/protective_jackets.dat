5000|$|Despite the {{problems}} {{mentioned in the}} previous section on electronic scoring, the vast majority of fencing considers it a great improvement over non-electric system described here. As described {{in an article in the}} London newspaper, The Daily Courier, on June 25, 1896: [...] "Every one who has watched a bout with the foils knows that the task of judging the hits is with a pair of amateurs difficult enough, and with a well-matched pair of maîtres d’escrime well-nigh impossible." [...] In addition there were frequent problems with bias and collusion, leading to the wry expression that a dry jury consisted of [...] "4 blind men and a thief". Some fencers, particularly in sabre, would hit hard to ensure their touches could not be missed, and dry sabre could be an extremely painful undertaking despite the <b>protective</b> <b>jackets.</b> Even in the best of circumstances, it was very difficult to accurately score hits, and it systematically under-reported valid touches to hard-to-see areas, such as the back or flank under the arm. Consequently, even though there are limitations and controversy over electronic scoring, and despite its rejection by the classical fencers, electronic scoring is by far the dominant method used to determine if touches land.|$|E

However, nonhuman primates with central venous catheters must wear <b>protective</b> <b>jackets.</b> Jackets routinely are removed for aerosol exposure to agents and respiratory measurements by whole-body plethysmography (WBP) because of the potentially confounding effects of jackets on these procedures. However, removing the jacket may dislodge the catheter, making it unusable. Using each animal as its own control, we tested 12 African green monkeys to determine whether minute volume, tidal volume, respiratory rate, or accumulated volume measurements by WBP differed {{depending on whether the}} animal wore a protective jacket or not. We found no statistical differences in any measured respiratory parameter and concluded that the jackets could be left in place on the animal while undergoing plethysmography without compromising the calculations for determining the inhaled dose of aerosolized agent. In addition, this study revealed no obvious contraindications to leaving the jacket in place in other nonhuman primate species, provided that the jacket fits appropriately and that plethysmography is performed correctly...|$|E

40|$|Fire-fighters&rsquo; {{protective}} garments {{consist of}} a layered material assembly which typically include a flame-resistant outer shell and functional inner layers. The inner layers are generally composed of a moisture barrier and a thermal barrier or liner. When a firefighter is performing a task in a fire, the heat and perspiration generated from the body becomes trapped inside the protective clothing and may cause heat stress to the wearer. At the moment, in Australia there are no particular designs of firefighters&rsquo; protective ensembles specifically developed for female fire-fighters. The female firefighters utilize exactly the same protective jacket as male fire-fighters. In the present research, different commercial textile materials that are most commonly used for skin layer garments and for firefighters&rsquo; protective clothing were evaluated for their thermal and sensorial comfort attributes. The best performing materials combination offering enhanced thermal comfort attributes for skin layer garments and for the firefighters&rsquo; protective jacket were selected {{for use in the}} firefighters&rsquo; protective jacket in existing design and fit and in new and improved design and fit suitable for female firefighters. 3 D body scanning technology was used to analyse the existing design, construction and fit of the existing firefighters&rsquo; protective jacket as relevant to female body form. Thermal manikin Newton was used to determine the influence of jacket design, size and fit on thermal attributes as relevant to male and female form of the manikin. Findings of the research demonstrate that, size, construction and fit of protective clothing have a considerable impact on the thermal comfort attributes of the clothing regardless of the materials used. In addition, the existing design, construction and fit of the protective jacket need to be modified to better suit female firefighters. Their body geometry should be taken into consideration when designing the <b>protective</b> <b>jackets</b> for them. The results of the present research are encouraging for the future development of new firefighters&rsquo; <b>protective</b> <b>jackets</b> for Australian female firefighters. The results also reveal {{that there is a need}} for anthropometric studies of female Australian firefighters.

5000|$|A series {{heating cable}} {{is made of}} a run of {{high-resistance}} wire, insulated and often enclosed in a <b>protective</b> <b>jacket.</b> It is powered at a specific voltage and the resistance heat of the wire creates heat. The downside {{of these types of}} heaters is that if they are crossed over themselves they can overheat and burn out, they are provided in specific lengths and cannot be shortened in the field, also, a break anywhere along the line will result in a failure of the entire cable. The upside is that they are typically inexpensive (if plastic style heaters) or, as is true with mineral insulated heating cables, they can be exposed to very high temperatures. Mineral insulated heating cables are good for maintaining high temperatures on process lines or maintaining lower temperatures on lines which can get extremely hot such as high temperature steam lines.|$|R

40|$|Inductance loops play a {{major role}} in vehicle {{detection}} systems that provide data for use in traffic-actuated signal control and other surveillance systems. Considering the wide variety of vehicles on the road today, it has become increasingly important to find a loop configuration that can accurately detect oddsized vehicles. Odd-sized vehicles include motorcycles, mopeds, bicycles, and high-profile trucks. This loop type should also be easy to install and maintenance-free. Surface loops are typically used, and many loop configurations have been developed for detecting different vehicle types. More recently, deep-buried loops have been developed. Deep-buried loops are located below the pavement surface. They remain undamaged by pavement movements, traffic flow, and construction equipment. The detection ability of these loops, however, is questionable for many vehicle types. Modern practice for wire in a slot, wire in a <b>protective</b> <b>jacket,</b> and wire in a PVC conduit requires complete encapsulation of the loop wire.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{radiative}} properties of personal protective clothings worn during firefighting operations by firemen. Several intervention jackets are tested coming from different Fire and Rescue Services in France. The present study focuses on the spectral absorptivity of these equipments over visible–IR domains. The spectral absorptivity in the IR range is mainly responsible for the conversion of radiative transfer coming from the flame into heat flux through the <b>protective</b> <b>jacket.</b> This work shows that the mean absorptivities of different equipments are high, close to 90 %, which penalizes the thermal protection. This study demonstrates that the colored textile has a weak effect on the radiative properties {{and then on the}} thermal protection. On the contrary, the dyeing mode can decrease the absorptivity, hence improving the thermal protection of jackets, a dyed jacket being more efficient in the present test than a jacket made of fibers dyed before weaving.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the high performance of the concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes (CFFTs) as a stay-in-place formwork and confining material for concrete structures. However, there are several concerns related to the behavior of CFFT as a <b>protective</b> <b>jacket</b> against harsh environmental effects. The environmental effects such as freeze-thaw cycles and deicing salt solutions may affect materials properties, which may affect the structural response of CFFT members as well. This paper presents the test results of experimental investigation on the durability of short- and long-term behaviors of CFFT members. Test variables included the effect of confining using GFRP tubes, freeze-thaw cycles exposure in salt water, {{and the number of}} freeze-thaw cycles. CFFT cylinders (150 × 300 [*]mm) were prepared and exposed to 100 and 300 freeze-thaw cycles in salt water condition. Then, pure axial compression tests were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of specimens due to freeze-thaw exposure, by comparing the stress-strain behavior and their ultimate load capacities. Test results indicated that the confinement using CFFT technique significantly protected the concrete when subjected to freeze-thaw exposure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis project aims at {{improving}} peripherally-inserted {{central venous catheter}} (PICC) care in chemotherapy outpatients. From February to March 2011, 16. 8 % of PICCs were not cared for properly. The main problems encountered were dermatitis, catheter obstruction and catheter slippage.

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular methods of {{determining}} potential locations of spoilage in stored grains is through constant monitoring of the internal temperatures of the grain mass. Distinctive increases of the local temperatures in the grain are a good indication of potential spoilage problems. Daily inspection of the internal temperature of the stored grain can detect the presence of a 2 ̆ 2 hot spot 2 ̆ 2 before any grain is seriously deteriorated. The operator can then choose to aerate the grain to cool the 2 ̆ 2 hot spot 2 ̆ 2 or remove the grain from the bin. Daily monitoring of temperatures requires that sensing elements be placed within the grain mass. A common method of monitoring temperatures in a mass of stored grain utilizes thermocouples attached at regular intervals to high-strength steel cables. The entire assembly including the thermocouples and the cables is coated with a <b>protective</b> <b>jacket.</b> Temperature-sensing cables are available in many types, differing in surface material, size and cross-sectional shape.
