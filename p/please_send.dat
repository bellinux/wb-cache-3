500|$|On September 26, 2016, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that the latest album {{that had previously been}} promised to fans would not be released in 2016. The band felt that the songs on the album were incomplete and needed more time to be deemed finalized. The band also announced that it would be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me by playing it in its entirety the remainder of the tour. There also were more statements alluding to the band's end: [...] "What’s left should be a strange demise, but hopefully one as loud and as fun as the rest of our time together has been. All are invited. <b>Please</b> <b>send</b> flowers." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20January, a {{force of}} over 100Japanese aircraft, {{comprising}} bombers, dive bombers and fighter escort, converged on Rabaul. It was led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had controlled the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941. Two patrolling Wirraways of No.24 Squadron attacked {{the first wave of}} Japanese raiders. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then scrambled, one crashing on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the sea by Mitsubishi Zero fighters, two others crash landed with severe damage, one escaped with minor damage, and one remained unscathed. The ten-minute action killed six RAAF aircrew and wounded five. An Australian soldier on the ground later recalled, [...] "We sat at our guns, shocked by the massacre we had just observed". The Japanese fighters compounded the humiliation by executing aerobatics over the bombed airfield. Lerew signalled headquarters, [...] "Two Wirraways useless defence. Will you now <b>please</b> <b>send</b> some fighters?", receiving the reply, [...] "Regret inability to supply fighters. If we had them you would get them." [...] The next day he was ordered to attack the approaching Japanese fleet with [...] "all available aircraft". As his two serviceable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left only the one remaining Hudson with which to execute the order; it duly took off to search for the enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall, and returned to base.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{posted in}} 1869 to Puri as a deputy magistrate, Kedarnatha Datta felt he needed {{assistance}} in {{his attempts to}} promote the cause Gaudiya Vaisnavism in India and abroad. A hagiographic account has it that one night the Deity of Jagannath personally spoke to Kedarnath in a dream: [...] "I didn't bring you to Puri to execute legal matters, but to establish Vaishnava siddhanta." [...] Kedarnath replied, [...] "Your teachings have been significantly [...] depreciated, and I lack the power to restore them. Much of my life has passed and I am otherwise engaged, so <b>please</b> <b>send</b> somebody from Your personal staff so that I can start this movement". Jagannath then requested Kedarnath to pray for an assistant {{to the image of}} the Goddess Bimala Devi worshiped in the Jagannath temple. When his wife gave birth to a new child, Kedarnath linked the event to the divinatory dream and named his son Bimala Prasad ('"the mercy of Bimala Devi"). The same account mentions that at his birth, the child's umbilical cord was looped around his body like a sacred brahmana thread (upavita) that left a permanent mark on the skin, as if foretelling his future role as religious leader.|$|E
