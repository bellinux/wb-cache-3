40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} nurses and nursing {{practitioners}} in Australia mean {{an influx of}} nursing students could put strain on classroom activities and learning effectiveness. Nursing is a very practical occupation and distance learning limits the students’ exposure to practical activities and procedures. Research showed that nursing education was also {{in need of a}} technology boost, embracing new technologies for learning and training. This project describes a developmental process of designing an enhanced software training tool using industrial automation apparatus for the purposes of external nursing students. The enhanced training tool in question is an intravenous (IV) infusion <b>pump</b> <b>driver</b> emulator. The features of the real <b>pump</b> <b>driver</b> were mimicked in software but enhanced with audio and visual cues {{to create a sense of}} realism. To achieve an accurate and realistic mimic of an IV infusion <b>pump</b> <b>driver</b> various learning methods and software aesthetics were researched and put into practice. Iterative design and testing techniques were adopted to ensure bugs and errors were minimized and realistic flowing software was produced. As a result of completing the enhanced software training tool it became apparent that the views and opinions of the end-user were very important during the design process to ensure it meets the users’ needs. Because user centered design was implemented a user friendly training tool was created allowing students to self-assess their performance in pump operations, meeting the pedagogical requirements of the activity. Surveys were conducted and positive feedback was received including ideas for improvements and further work. ...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} for rotating machinery diagnostics; however measuring vibration of operational oil well pumps is not possible. The <b>pump’s</b> <b>driver’s</b> current signatures may provide condition-related information {{without the need for}} an access to the pump itself. This paper investigates the degree of relationship between the <b>pump’s</b> <b>driver’s</b> current signatures and its induced vibration. This relationship between the driver’s current signatures (DCS) and its vibration signatures (DVS) is studied by calculating magnitude-squared coherence and phase coherence parameters at a certain frequency band using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The CWT coherence-based technique allows better analysis of temporal evolution of the frequency content of dynamic signals and areas in the time-frequency plane where the two signals exhibit common power or consistent phase behaviour indicating a relationship between the signals. This novel approach is validated by experimental data acquired from 3 [*]kW petroleum <b>pump’s</b> <b>driver.</b> Both vibration and current signatures were acquired under different speed and load conditions. The outcomes of this research suggest the use of DCS analysis as reliable and inexpensive condition monitoring tool, which could be implemented for oil pumps, real-time monitoring associated with condition-based maintenance (CBM) program...|$|R

40|$|Historically, nursing {{students}} have shown great difficulty in mastering equipment during clinical practice sessions. A typical {{example is the}} Intravenous (IV) pump infusion driver.

Recent {{work in this area}} has demonstrated that Remote Access Laboratories (RAL) can be employed to enhance nursing education by providing access to an IV <b>pump</b> <b>driver</b> learning activity. The prototype closely mimicked the interface and audible feedback of a commonly used IV pump driver; and controlled a peristaltic pump to deliver the prescribed rates and volumes. This project takes this approach a step further and investigates a completely emulated interface in the same RAL environment. The aim is to target five problem areas that were previously identified. These include the screen navigation and data entry of the IV pump driver; and the correct calculation and entry of medication volumes and rates from a standard fluid chart. To address these issues the learning environment was modified to include a guided learning mode, integrated scaffolding resources and facility of self-assessment.

40|$|Abstract: An {{approach}} to developing variable-rate sprayer technologies is to install electronic control systems on conventional sprayers. This study introduces a direct injection type electronic solution concentration control system.

The control system consisted of a chemical tank, a chemical metering pump, the metering <b>pump’s</b> <b>driver,</b> the metering <b>pump’s</b> speed sensor, the implement’s travelling speed sensor, an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), a GPS receiver and a mixing unit. The metering pump discharge was measured at different carrier liquid (water) working pressures (3, 4 and 5 bar) and different chemical metering pump shaft speed (100, 200, 300 and 400 r/min, i. e. pump’s working range). Data analysis showed {{that the effect of}} metering pump speed, sprayer working pressure and their interaction was significant (P< 0. 001) on the metering pump’s discharge. Metering pump’s discharge function and the independent variables of pump speed and working pressure were calculated.

This report evaluates the criteria mandated by required pump testing at U.

Since the working condition of the <b>pump</b> <b>driver</b> is crucial to pump operability, {{a brief review of}} new applications of motor diagnostics is provided that highlights recent developments in this technology. The routine collection and analysis of spectral data is superior to all other technologies in its ability to accurately detect numerous types and causes of pump degradation. Existing ASME Code testing criteria do not require the evaluation of pump vibration spectra but instead overall vibration amplitude. The mechanical information discernible from vibration amplitude analysis is limited, and several cases of pump failure were not detected in their early stages by vibration monitoring. Since spectral analysis can provide a wealth of pertinent information concerning the mechanical condition of rotating machinery, its incorporation into ASME testing criteria could merit a relaxation in the monthly-to-quarterly testing schedules that seek to verify and assure pump operability.
