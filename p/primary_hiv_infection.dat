40|$|Abstract Background Symptomatic <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> is {{associated}} with an adverse prognosis, and immediate initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is recommended. However, {{little is known about}} immunological predictors of immune recovery. Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that promotes CD 4 + T cells homeostatic polyclonal proliferation and regulates Th 17 /regulatory T-cell balance, immunological functions known to be affected during <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} describe immune recovery in primary and chronic HIV infection and possible impact of TSLP. Methods Prospective study including 100 HIV-infected individuals (<b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> (N[*]=[*] 14), early presenters (> 350 CD 4 + T cells/μL, N[*]=[*] 42), late presenters without advanced disease (200 – 350 CD 4 + T cells/μL, N[*]=[*] 24) and with advanced disease (< 200 CD 4 + T cells/μL, N[*]=[*] 20) and). Immune recovery was defined as increase in CD 4 + T cells count from baseline to a given time of follow-up. Plasma TSLP was determined using ELISA and CD 4 + T cell subpopulations (recent thymic emigrants, naïve and memory cells) were measured using flow cytometry at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24  months of cART. Results Immune recovery was comparable in all groups, and no differences in immune homeostasis were found between <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> and early presenters, whereas differences in absolute counts and proportions of CD 4 + T cell subpopulations were found between <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> and late presenters. TSLP was elevated in <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> at baseline and after 24  months of cART. Interestingly, TSLP was negatively associated with proportion of recent thymic emigrants (correlation coefficient − 0. 60, p[*]=[*] 0. 030). TSLP was not associated with immune recovery in <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection.</b> Conclusions Immune recovery was comparable in primary and chronic HIV infection whereas differences in absolute counts and proportions of CD 4 + T cell subpopulations were found between <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> and late presenters supporting early initiation of cART. Higher plasma TSLP was found in <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection,</b> and TSLP was associated with lower thymic output, but not with immune recovery. These findings indicate a possible role of TSLP in immune homeostasis in HIV infection but do not support TSLP to affect immune recovery in <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: An {{important}} pending {{question is}} whether temporary {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} during <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> can influence viral rebound dynamics and the subsequently established viral setpoint, through preservation and enhancement of HIV- 1 -specific immune responses, or through other mechanisms. METHODS: We included all patients from two prospective studies who underwent a single treatment interruption while being well suppressed on highly active antiretroviral therapy. One group started highly active antiretroviral therapy during <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection,</b> and the other group started it during chronic HIV infection with CD 4 cell counts above 350 cells/microl. Data were collected up to 48 weeks from treatment interruption. The median time to viral rebound was analysed for three levels of viraemia: 50, 500 and 5000 copies HIV-RNA/ml plasma. RESULTS: The median time to viral rebound was significantly longer in <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> patients (n = 24) than in chronic HIV infection patients (n = 46) : 8 versus 4 weeks (P < 0. 001 for all three endpoints). In two <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> patients, no rebound of plasma HIV- 1 RNA over 50 copies/ml occurred. In the first 4 weeks after treatment interruption, CD 4 + T-cell counts declined with a median of - 5. 0 cells/microl blood per week in the <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> group and - 45 cells/microl blood per week in the chronic HIV infection group (P < 0. 05). From week 4 to 48, the decline in CD 4 + T-cell count was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Plasma viral load and CD 4 dynamics after a single interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy were different for <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> and chronic HIV infection patients. Viral rebound is delayed or absent and early CD 4 cell count decline after treatment interruption is less pronounced in <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> patient...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Timely {{diagnosis}} of <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> {{is important to}} prevent further transmission of HIV. <b>Primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> may take place without symptoms or {{may be associated with}} fever, pharyngitis or headache. Sometimes, the clinical presentation includes aseptic meningitis or cutaneous lesions. Intestinal ulceration due to opportunistic pathogens (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Toxoplasma gondii) has been described in patients with AIDS. However, although invasion of intestinal lymphoid tissue is a prominent feature of human and simian lentivirus infections, colonic ulceration has not been reported in acute HIV infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42 -year-old Caucasian man was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate for pharyngitis. He did not improve, and a rash developed. History taking revealed a negative HIV antibody test five months previously and unprotected sex with a male partner the month before admission. Repeated tests revealed <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> with an exceptionally high HIV- 1 RNA plasma concentration (3. 6 x 107 copies/mL) and a low CD 4 count (101 cells/mm 3, seven percent of total lymphocytes). While being investigated, the patient had a life-threatening hematochezia. After angiographic occlusion of a branch of the ileocaecal artery and initiation of antiretroviral therapy, the patient became rapidly asymptomatic and could be discharged. Colonoscopy revealed a bleeding colonic ulcer. We were unable to identify an etiology other than HIV for this ulcer. CONCLUSION: This case adds to the known protean manifestation of <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection.</b> The lack of an alternative etiology, despite extensive investigations, suggests that this ulcer was directly caused by <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection.</b> This conclusion is supported by the well-described extensive loss of intestinal mucosal CD 4 + T cells associated with <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection,</b> the extremely high HIV viral load observed in our patient, and the rapid improvement of the ulcer after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. This case also adds to the debate on treatment for <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection,</b> especially in the context of severe symptoms and an extremely high viral load...|$|E
40|$|Viruses, {{including}} the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), have evolved multiple strategies to overcome host immune defenses, {{allowing them to}} persist in the host.

The patient displayed clinical and radiological features similar to multiple sclerosis. Histology revealed inflammation with necrosis, demyelination and destruction of axons. Serum tests were negative for various infectious agents as well as specific cultures and PCR. Corticotherapy and many antibiotic treatments failed. Resorption of the lesions occurred after partial excision and highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). No recurrence was noted. This demyelinating cerebral disease was considered as the <b>primary</b> manifestation of <b>HIV</b> <b>infection.</b> <b>HIV</b> implication in the genesis of the process and its perpetuating this condition was suspected, but the mechanism is unclear. Dysimmune consequences related to the early course of <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> could be prevented by antiretroviral treatment. This study was the first description of tritherapy effectiveness on HIV related multiple sclerosis (MS) -like illness. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Symptomatic <b>primary</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> are {{over-represented}} in the mainly hospital-based {{studies on}} transmission of resistant HIV- 1. We examined {{a more general}} population for the prevalence of resistant HIV- 1 strains among primary infections. Design: From 1994 to 2002 primary infections were identified within the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS) among homosexual men and drug users, and at the Academic Medical Center (AMC). Whereas primary HIV- 1 -infected AMC patients, often presented with symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome, ACS participants largely seroconverted during follow-up and thus brought also asymptomatic primary infections to our study. Methods: Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences were obtained by population-based nucleotide sequence analysis of the first HIV RNA-positive sample available. Subtypes were identified by phylogenetic analysis. Mutations were identified based on the IAS-USA resistance table. Results: A total of 100 primary HIV- 1 infections were identified (32 AMC and 68 ACS). Transmission of drug-resistant strains decreased over calendar time, with 20 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), 10 - 34 %] of infections bearing drug-resistant mutations before 1998 versus only 6 % (95 % Cl, 1 - 17 %) after 1998. No multi-drug resistance pattern was observed. The median plasma HIV- 1 RNA level of the first RNA positive sample was significantly lower for the individuals infected with a resistant strain versus those infected with wild-type, suggesting a fitness-cost to resistance. Four of seven non-B subtypes corresponded with the prevalent subtype in the presumed country of infection, and none showed resistance mutations. Conclusions: The transmission of drug-resistant HIV- 1 strains in Amsterdam has decreased over time. Monitoring should be continued as this trend might change.

40|$|The loss of HIV-specific CD 8 + T cell cytolytic {{function}} {{is a primary}} factor underlying progressive <b>HIV</b> <b>infection,</b> but whether HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells initially possess cytolytic effector capacity, and when and why this may be lost during infection, is unclear. Here, we assessed CD 8 + T cell functional evolution from <b>primary</b> to chronic <b>HIV</b> <b>infection.</b> We observed a profound expansion of perforin+ CD 8 + T cells immediately following <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> that quickly waned after acute viremia resolution. Selective expression of the effector-associated transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin in cytokine-producing HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells differentiated HIV-specific from bulk memory CD 8 + T cell effector expansion. As infection progressed expression of perforin was maintained in HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells {{with high levels of}} T-bet, but not necessarily in the population of T-betLo HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells that expand as infection progresses. Together, these data demonstrate that while HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells in acute <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> initially possess cytolytic potential, progressive transcriptional dysregulation leads to the reduced CD 8 + T cell perforin expression characteristic of chronic <b>HIV</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|R
