5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>candidate</b> in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate.

40|$|Randomized natural {{experiments}} provide {{social scientists}} with rare opportunities to draw credible causal inferences {{in real world}} settings. We capitalize on such a unique experiment to examine how the name order of candidates on ballots affects election outcomes. Since 1975 California has randomized the ballot order for statewide offices with a complex alphabet lottery. Adapting statistical techniques to this lottery and addressing methodological problems of conventional approaches, our analysis of statewide elections from 1978 to 2002 reveals that in general elections ballot order significantly impacts only minor <b>party</b> <b>candidates,</b> with no detectable effects on major <b>party</b> <b>candidates.</b> These results contradict previous research finding large effects in general elections for major <b>party</b> <b>candidates.</b> In primaries, however, we show that being listed first benefits everyone. Major <b>party</b> <b>candidates</b> generally gain one to three percentage points, while minor <b>party</b> <b>candidates</b> may double their vote shares. In all elections, the largest effects are for nonpartisan races, where candidates i...|$|R
