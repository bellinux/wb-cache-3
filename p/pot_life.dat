They typically seem dry {{to the touch}} within seconds although complete drying (cure) might take a substantially longer period of time. There are many more options. Inks that cure via the use of Ultra Violet light are convenient for certain applications. UV inks will not fully cure until UV light hits the ink. UV curable ink can be wiped off many substrates when mistakes are made. They can be cured with UV light in as fast as 1 second of light exposure.

50|$|The basic {{reinforcement}} {{material for}} this process is glass-fibre rovings, which are chopped to a length of 10 to 40 mm and then applied on the mould. For improved mechanical properties, a combination of fabric and chopped fibre layers is used. The most common material type is E-glass, but carbon and Kevlar rovings can also be used. Continuous strand mat, fabric, and various types of core materials are embedded by hand whenever required. The weight fraction of reinforcement in this process is typically 20 to 40% of the total weight of the part. The most common resin system used for the spray-up process is general purpose or DCDP polyester; isophthalic polyesters and vinylesters are also sometimes used. Fast-reacting resins with a <b>pot</b> <b>life</b> of 30 to 40 minutes are typical. The resin often contains {{a significant amount of}} filler. The most common fillers are calcium carbonates and aluminium trihydrates. In filled resin systems, fillers replace some of the reinforcements; 5 to 25% filler is used by weight.|$|E
5000|$|Polyolefins (PO) (polyethylene (usually LDPE {{but also}} HDPE; HDPE has higher melting point and better {{temperature}} resistance), atactic polypropylene (PP or APP), polybutene-1, oxidized polyethylene, etc.), low-performance, for difficult-to-bond plastics. Very good adhesion to polypropylene, good moisture barrier, chemical resistance against polar solvents and solutions of acids, bases, and alcohols. Longer open time {{in comparison with}} EVA and polyamides. Polyolefins have low surface energy and provide good wetting of most metals and polymers. Polyolefins made by metallocene catalyzed synthesis have narrow distribution of molecular weight and correspondingly narrow melting temperature range. Due to the relatively high crystallinity, polyethylene-based glues tend to be opaque and, depending on additives, white or yellowish. Polyethylene hot melts have high <b>pot</b> <b>life</b> stability, are not prone to charring, and are suitable for moderate temperature ranges and on porous non-flexible substrates. Nitrogen or carbon dioxide can be introduced into the melt, forming a foam which increases spreading and open time and decreases transfer of heat to the substrate, allowing use of more heat-sensitive substrates; polyethylene-based HMAs are usually used. Foamable HMAs {{are available on the}} market since 1981. Amorphous polypropylene HMAs have good dielectric properties, making them suitable for use at high frequencies. PE and APP are usually used on their own or with just a small amount of tackifiers (usually hydrocarbons) and waxes (usually paraffins or microcrystalline waxes, for lower cost, improved anti-blocking, and altered open time and softening temperature). The molecular weight of the polymer is usually lower. Lower molecular weights provide better low-temperature performance and higher flexibility, higher molecular weights increase the seal strength, hot tack, and melt viscosity.|$|E

40|$|Crustbreak/feeding {{systems in}} prebake {{aluminium}} smelting pots {{are critical to}} efficient pot control as they contribute in a large way to the alumina balance in the pot. Inefficient feeder and pot operation may cause emission of global warming gases, severe cost penalties and may affect {{the health and safety}} of operating personnel This study investigated the causes of failure and the performance of existing designs. Most of the research was conducted at Portland Aluminium (Victoria) and contact was made with about 30 smelters world-wide. Methods have been developed to improve shot size accuracy, reduce costs, increase crustbreak/feeder life and improved the safety of operators and tradespersons. New designs were developed and two were subsequently patented in Australia, New Zealand South Africa and the U. S. A. Over 30, 000 measurements were taken of dose mass on 7 different feeder designs. Changing the shape of the dosing unit to accommodate better alumina flow rate reduced the standard deviation of the shot size to 0. 6 % of shot mass for one of the patented designs and 1. 9 % for the most commonly used pot feeder (compared to an original 7 - 14 %). These figures compare with 2. 5 % for the Aluminium Pechiney independent design. In the investigation into the mechanism of plunger wear and optimising materials, over 10, 000 measurements of plunger diameter were taken during feeder maintenance and over 2, 500 were taken in 3 monthly measurements in operating pots. Some 19 materials were tested. Plunger life at Portland increased from 1 year to 8 years (for plant scale operation) and trials in operating <b>pots</b> achieved <b>life</b> up to 15 years for one design.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} a study of two-step plywood adhesives made with varying amounts of phenol, 1, 3, 5 xylenol, resorcin, and formaldehyde. Each resin was evaluated by using it as the adhesive in making plywood. The plywood was then tested for shear strength and wood failure after a four hour boil. Procedures are given for making and testing various straight phenolic resins and resins modified with 1, 3, 5 xylenol or resorcin, or comibinations of both of these accelerating resins. The straight phenolic resins gave boil-proof bonds, but the curing cycle was too long.

40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcing}} steel in concrete is an insidious problem for structures at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). KSC {{is located on}} the coast of Florida in a highly corrosive atmosphere. Launch pads, highway bridge infrastructure, and buildings are strongly affected. To mitigate these problems, NASA initiated a development program for a Galvanic Liquid-Applied Coating System (GLACS). A breakthrough in this area would have great commercial value in transportation, marine and construction industry infrastructures. The patented NASA GLACS system has undergone considerable testing {{to meet the needs of}} commercialization. A moisture-cure coating gives excellent adhesion with ease of application compared to existing galvanic products on the market. The latest development, GalvaCori; can be sprayed or hand applied to almost any structure shape. A self-adhesive conductive tape system has been devised to simplify current collection within the coating areas. In testing programs, millivolt potential and milliamp output per square foot of anode have been closely studied at actual test sites. These two parameters are probably the most challenging items of a resin-based, room-temperature-applied, galvanic coating. Extensive re-formulation has resulted in a system that provides the needed polarization for catholic protection of {{reinforcing steel}} in concrete in a variety of structure environments. The rate of corrosion of rebar in concrete is greatly affected by the environment of the structure. In addition to this, for any given concrete structure; moisture level, carbonization, and chloride contamination influences the rate of rebar corrosion. Similarly, the cathodic protection level of galvanic systems is also dependent on the moisture level of the concrete. GalvaCorr is formulated to maintain galvanic activity as the moisture level of the structure declines. GalvaCorr is available as a three-part kit. The mixing step requires about ten minutes. The viscosity can be easily adjusted to meet the application needs. The <b>pot</b> or working <b>life</b> is four to six hours, depending on the temperature.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} Pol Pot was an unsophisticated {{political}} theorist {{and that he}} attempted to localize Maoism to serve his virulently ultra-nationalist agenda against Cambodia's ethnic Vietnamese. This {{is contrary to the}} existing assertions that Pol Pot was either a Maoist fundamentalist or adopted an ideology close to Maoism. The thesis postulates that Pol Pot used Maoism as a framework from which to launch his Khmer revivalist anti-Vietnamese program. The Cambodian leader's revolution was intended to "outdo" Mao, based solely on the use of antiquated Khmer agricultural developments, and surpass the grandeur of the great Angkor kings. This evidence can be found when one compares Pol Pot's writings, speeches, and slogans with Mao's own political works. Pol Pot was fascinated with Maoist rhetoric but never took action in building industry or improving social welfare. The Cambodian leader's overarching goal was to achieve a uniquely "pure" Khmer communism while also eradicating the entire Vietnamese race. The following thesis provides an analysis of Pol <b>Pot's</b> early political <b>life,</b> examines his infatuation with Mao Zedong and the Chinese revolution, and details the Cambodian leader's unique interpretation of the Chinese Chairman's political ideology. This thesis also aspires to she'd new insight into the study of Pol Pot's ultra- nationalist inspiration and disbar the convenient assumption by current scholars that he was merely a Maoist fundamentalist. In Pol Pot's attempts to create a uniquely Khmer communist ideology, he lost sight of the class struggle and espoused a racialist agenda based on Cambodian historical notions of revenge. These forms evolved from a mere grudge to notions of disproportionate and total revenge and dictated the Cambodian leader's treatment of the Vietnamese. Pol Pot was obsessed with Cambodia's long lost greatness and possessed an inherent need to reestablish the utopian Angkor kingdom in the present while punishing those responsible for its demise. In the end, his legacy was one of unbridled bloodshed that led to nearly three million deaths and the near-total destruction of his country...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{automobiles}} {{are painted}} with basecoat, technology which is either metallic, solid colour or pearlescent. This requires protection from chemicals, scratching, weathering and UV light by applying a protective top coat (clearcoat) over the basecoat. For the clearcoat to cure into a hard protective shell it undergoes an irreversible crosslinking process. This usually takes {{place over the}} first four to five hours, depending on the formulation and weather conditions. The speed of crosslinking can be enhanced by temperature. <b>Pot</b> <b>life</b> is important as it can affect {{the overall quality of}} the painted surface. If crosslinking occurs too quickly, before the clearcoat is applied onto the surface, the clearcoat cannot be used to produce a good quality finish. The “expired” mixture is thus discarded. If used, the quality of the finished product cannot be guaranteed to last, and the paintwork may have to be redone. This often means removing the underlying paint and primer as well with the clearcoat film. Besides the time lost, the discarded clearcoat mixture often lands in the landfill, polluting ground water and the environment. It is thus important {{from the point of view}} of both the environment preservation and waste management, that as much clearcoat as possible is used without being wasted. It was proven in an earlier study (BSc Hon Formulation Science Treatise, 2011) that adding eugenol to a clearcoat mixture after crosslinking had started could reduce its viscosity, which is an indicator of crosslinking progress. Crosslinking subsequently resumed at a lower rate than in traditional blends. If stored away from oxygen and high temperatures, this blend could maintain optimum viscosity indefinitely. In this follow up study an optimum formulation was developed using D - optimal experimental design. It sought to extend the <b>pot</b> <b>life</b> to avoid waste to spray painters while saving the environment from pollution. The formulation that gave the desired viscosity after five hours of <b>pot</b> <b>life</b> was adopted. It was hypothesised that the optimum formulated clearcoat mixture would have a longer <b>pot</b> <b>life</b> than its traditional counterparts, and that it would perform just as well as the traditional clearcoat mixtures. To study the rate of crosslinking (disappearance of functional groups and appearance of the urethane bond), FTIR spectrometry was performed on a mixture produced from the optimized formula in comparison to that of a traditional mixture (the control). The rate of disappearance of functional groups was found to be lower in the eugenol mixture than in the control mixture. After six hours, eugenol was added into the control mixture, and this seemed to reduce the viscosity with the re-emergence of functional groups in the mixture. After 24 hours of crosslinking, an FTIR scan was done on the solid sample and this revealed that the eugenol mixture had crosslinked fully, with no detectable functional groups in the sample...|$|E

40|$|In this project, {{a concept}} {{to improve the}} {{performance}} of aluminum production cells by introducing potlining additives was examined and tested. Boron oxide was added to cathode blocks, and titanium was dissolved in the metal pool; this resulted {{in the formation of}} titanium diboride and caused the molten aluminum to wet the carbonaceous cathode surface. Such wetting reportedly leads to operational improvements and extended cell life. In addition, boron oxide suppresses cyanide formation. This final report presents and discusses the results of this project. Substantial economic benefits for the practical implementation of the technology are projected, especially for modern cells with graphitized blocks. For example, with an energy savings of about 5 % and an increase in <b>pot</b> <b>life</b> from 1500 to 2500 days, a cost savings of $ 0. 023 per pound of aluminum produced is projected for a 200 kA pot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A new, {{easy and}} {{cost-effective}} synthetic procedure for {{the preparation of}} thermosetting melamine-based epoxy resins is reported. By this innovative synthetic method, different kinds of resins can be obtained just by mixing the reagents {{in the presence of}} a catalyst without solvent and with mild curing conditions. Two types of resins were synthesized using melamine and a glycidyl derivative (resins I) or by adding a silane derivative (resin II). The resins were characterized by means of chemical-physical and thermal techniques. Experimental results show that all the prepared resins have a good thermal stability, but differ for their mechanical properties: resin I exhibits remarkable stiffness with a storage modulus value up to 830 MPa at room temperature, while lower storage moduli were found for resin II, indicating that the presence of silane groups could enhance the flexibility of these materials. The resins show a <b>pot</b> <b>life</b> higher than 30 min, which makes these resins good candidates for practical applications. The functionalizatio...|$|E
