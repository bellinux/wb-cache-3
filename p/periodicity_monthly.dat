We aimed to fill this gap by presenting an assessment of data collected during 333 river surveys over 50 months along rivers in a newly protected area in the Peruvian Amazon. A total of 14, 138 basking Podocnemis unifilis Troschel, 1848 were recorded during 13, 510 km of river-based surveys. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to explore the influence of a series of abiotic and seasonal variables on the recorded abundances at two temporal scales: monthly and per trip. Our analysis revealed that there was a significant increase in turtle abundances during the study period and we also found a significant seasonal <b>periodicity</b> in <b>monthly</b> abundances. Abiotic factors strongly influenced trip level abundances, with more individuals per kilometer recorded during sunny days in the dry season, with temperatures between 25 and 30 °C.

40|$|Abstract Background Birth {{weight and}} length have {{seasonal}} fluctuations. Previous analyses of birth weight by latitude effects identified seemingly contradictory results, showing both 6 and 12 <b>monthly</b> <b>periodicities</b> in weight. The aims {{of this paper}} are twofold: (a) to explore seasonal patterns in a large, Danish Medical Birth Register, and (b) to explore models based on seasonal exposures and a non-linear exposure-risk relationship. Methods Birth weight and birth lengths on over 1. 5 million Danish singleton, live births were examined for seasonality. We modelled seasonal patterns based on linear, U- and J-shaped exposure-risk relationships. We then added an extra layer of complexity by modelling weighted population-based exposure patterns. Results The Danish data showed clear seasonal fluctuations for both birth weight and birth length. A bimodal model best fits the data, however the amplitude of the 6 and 12 month peaks changed over time. In the modelling exercises, U- and J-shaped exposure-risk relationships generate time series with both 6 and 12 month periodicities. Changing the weightings of the population exposure risks result in unexpected properties. A J-shaped exposure-risk relationship with a diminishing population exposure over time fitted the observed seasonal pattern in the Danish birth weight data. Conclusion In keeping with many other studies, Danish birth anthropometric data show complex and shifting seasonal patterns. We speculate that annual periodicities with non-linear exposure-risk models may underlie these findings. Understanding the nature of seasonal fluctuations can help generate candidate exposures. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Studying {{long-term}} trend {{changes of}} meteorological parameters {{is one of}} the routine methods in atmospheric studies, especially in the climate change subject. Among the meteorological parameters, temperature is always considered {{as one of the most}} atmospheric elements and studying it in order to gain a better understanding of the climate change phenomenon, has been effective. In addition to identifying trends, extraction of oscillatory patterns in the atmospheric phenomena and parameters occurrence can be an applicable and reliable method to explore the complex relations between atmospheric-oceanic cycles and short term or long term consequences of meteorological parameters. Materials and Methods: In this paper, monthly average temperature time series in Mashhad synoptic station in 55 years period (from 1956 to 2010) in monthly, seasonal, annual and seasons separately (winter, spring, summer and autumn) have been analyzed. Discrete wavelet transform and Mann-Kendall trend test were the main methods for performing this research. Wavelet transform is a powerful method in signal processing and it is an advanced version of short time Fourier transforms. Moreover, it has many improvements and more capabilities compared with Fourier transform. In the first step, temperature time series in various time scales (which was mentioned above) have been decomposed via discrete wavelet transforms into approximation (A) and detail (D) components. For the second step, Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to the various combinations of these decomposed components. For detecting the most dominant periodic component for each of the time scales datasets, results of Mann-Kendall test for the original time series and the decomposed components were compared to each other. The nearest value indicated the most dominant periodicity based on the D component’s level. To detect the similarity between results of the Mann-Kendall test, relative error method was employed. Additionally, it must be noted that before applying Mann-Kendall test, time series has to be assessed for its autocorrelation status. If there are seasonality patterns in the studied time series or lag- 1 autocorrelation coefficient of data is significant, then some modified versions of the Mann-Kendall test have to be employed. Results and Discussion: Results of this study showed that the temperature trend at every time scaled dataset (monthly, seasonal, annual and seasons separately) is positive and significant. Autocorrelation coefficients indicated that only seasonal time series and winter datasets did not have significant ACFs. On the other hand, monthly and seasonal datasets had seasonality pattern. Based on these results, Hirsch and Slack’s modified version of Mann-Kendall test was employed for monthly and seasonal time series and for the winter temperature data, the original version of the Mann-Kendall test was applied. For the remaining time series, the Hamed and Rao’s modified version of the Mann-Kendall trend test was employed. Dominant <b>periodicities</b> in <b>monthly,</b> seasonal and annual, confirmed the oscillatory behavior of each other. However, in the seasons, it seems that periodic patterns with the same temperature ranges are more similar. On the other hand, due to the greater similarity between the results of the Mann-Kendall test in the warmer seasons and the data with monthly, seasonal and annual time scale, it seems that yearly warm period has more noticeable impacts on the positive and significant trend of temperature in the study area. It must be noted that in any of the studied time series, results of the Mann-Kendall test for detail (D) component was not significant and after adding approximation (A) component, Mann-Kendall statistics turned to a significant value. This happens because the long term variations or trends appear in approximation components in most of the time series. Conclusion: In this study, a powerful signal processing method called wavelet transform was employed to detect the most dominant periodic components in temperature time series in various time scales, in Mashhad synoptic station. Results showed that using frequency-time analysis methods has more benefits compared with the use of only classic statistical methods, since one can explore any time series with more accuracy. Because most of the meteorological variables have periodic structures, it seems that using advanced signal processing methods like wavelet for analysis of these variables can have many advantages compared with linear-based methods. It can be suggested for future studies to use and employ signal processing methods for exploring the large scaled phenomena (e. g. ENSO, NAO, etc.) and discovering the relationship between these phenomena and climate change in recent decades.

40|$|UnrestrictedTypical {{air quality}} time series consist of {{consecutive}} hourly averages of concentrations of gaseous pollutants or composition of airborne particles. More often, time series of concentrations of particulate species are 24 -hour averages observed every third or sixth day. Time series may give us important information about sources of pollutants. For instance, 7 -day and monthly cycles are mostly associated with anthropogenic sources {{and can be}} analyzed to study the anthropogenic cycles and their variation over time. Moreover, species with the same periodicity {{might be related to}} the same sources and can be characterized based on their periodic behavior.; The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an efficient means to computationally calculate the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). However, the FFT requires equally spaced data, which means therecan be no missing observations. A few isolated missing points can be filled in by interpolation, but air quality data often has long runs of missing data that cannot be replaced by interpolatedvalues in any reasonable manner. Thus, the FFT cannot usually be applied to air quality data, and that perhaps explains why there have been very few reports in the literature of Fourier methods applied to air quality time series.; In statistics, an estimate of the power spectrum at a finite set of frequencies is known as a periodogram. The periodogram is commonly used to identify significant periodicities in the data. However, {{it is well known that}} air quality time series exhibit yearly, seasonal, weekly, and daily periodicities; therefore, identifying the periodicities is not the main goal of this study. The primary purpose of this research is to show how the Fourier transform and the periodogram can be used to quantitatively characterize and classify the periodicities in time series of air pollutants. Currently, plots of hourly and monthly averages are the only way to show daily and seasonal variations. This graphical means is semi-quantitative and subjective. In this case, to systematically characterize and quantify periodic behavior of air pollutants that have been measured in different sites, an objective and quantitative method is required.; In this research several methods of addressing the problem of missing or irregularly spaced data are developed and applied to analyze air quality data. Least square fitting of sines and cosines to the data is an alternative means to estimate the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) when missing data are presented. But, because of its computational inefficiency due to repeatedly calculating sines and cosines, it was not a popular means of harmonic analysis and it was replaced by the FFT, which is very fast. However, using current powerful computers, the least square approach can be applied to air quality time series. Schuster, in 1897, realized that the periodogram, which is calculated by the Fourier transform, allows one to "separate any true periodicity of a variable from among its irregular changes" [67]. Using the Schuster periodogram allows the exhibition of all the periodicities in one graph, and it avoids plotting hundreds of time-averaged concentration graphs. In 1975, Lomb developed a version of the least squares fitting equations to directly estimate the power spectrum in the presence of missing or irregularly spaced data. This research applied the Lomb periodogram to estimate the fraction of the variance explained by the yearly, seasonal, weekly, and daily periodicities. In many cases, the classic or Schuster periodogram can be used instead of the more esoteric Lomb periodogram and can be normalized to give the fraction of variance explained. Another major goal of this project is to characterize the periodic variation in air quality data. For this purpose, a method is developed to automatically classify and group species based on the configuration of the harmonics, and is demonstrated in this report.; Air quality time series are non-stationary and often have a trend; therefore, periodic behavior of long time series will vary over time. To specifically study time to time variation of power, sliding window Fourier transform is applied to air quality data. This method enables us to analyze the Fourier transform of a specific window of time, i. e. one year, which slides through the whole sampling time. Since weekly and <b>monthly</b> <b>periodicities</b> are mostly associated with anthropogenic sources, these frequencies are analyzed to study the changes in anthropogenic cycles.; A computer code is also implemented to estimate the inverse Fourier transform by the Lomb method. This method can be applied to reproduce the initial time series while its missing points are fully treated. Moreover, when frequency or period of the variabilities are known, the least square fitting can be used to evaluate the daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, or yearly patterns of concentration of different species.; In conclusion, the Lomb periodogram is an appropriate tool when there are many missing values and long gaps in the data, and when the sampling time is irregular or random; otherwise, the Schuster periodogram mean-gapping would be a reasonable method to apply, and would provide the same result as the Lomb method. It must be emphasized that detecting peaks in spectral analysis of unequally spaced data requires cautious concern, and for this reason several procedures are discussed and a modified computer code is developed, which could be applied for our specific needs in air quality analysis...|$|R
