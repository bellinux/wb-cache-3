5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. <b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E
25|$|In 1804, Joseph-Marie Jacquard {{developed}} a loom {{in which the}} pattern being woven was controlled by a paper tape constructed from <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> The paper tape could be changed without changing the mechanical design of the loom. This was a landmark achievement in programmability. His machine was an improvement over similar weaving looms. <b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> were preceded by punch bands, as in the machine proposed by Basile Bouchon. These bands would inspire information recording for automatic pianos and more recently numerical control machine tools.|$|E
25|$|A {{keypunch}} is {{a device}} for manually entering data into <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> by precisely punching holes at locations {{designated by the}} keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small desk, with a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> In 1901, Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features.|$|E

Canada still predominantly uses <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> ballots.|$|R
50|$|System {{profilers}} {{came into}} use after <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> {{were no longer}} needed to run programs. Mainframe computers had evolved into have modular architectures {{at the same time}} <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> were being abandoned as input devices. <b>Punch</b> <b>card</b> based mainframe computer systems typically had very rigidly fixed architectures with little variation in input or output devices.|$|R

25|$|Computers {{used paper}} tape and <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> for data and {{programming}} input until the 1980s {{when it was}} still common to receive monthly utility bills printed on a punched card that was returned with the customer’s payment.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{computer}} memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early core memory cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, {{such as the}} IBM 1401, shipped with as little as 2kilobytes of memory. Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as COBOL and RPG, processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> were converted to magnetic tape and then disc files, but {{the structure of the}} data usually changed very little. Data was still input using <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, well before the {{computer}} era, business data processing was done using unit record equipment and <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> most commonly the 80-column variety employed by IBM, which dominated the industry. Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.|$|E

25|$|Purely {{electronic}} circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> or punched paper tape for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium.|$|E
25|$|The {{tabulating machine}} is an {{electrical}} device designed {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born.

25|$|Computers {{manufactured}} {{until the}} 1970s had front-panel switches for programming. The computer program {{was written on}} paper for reference. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also were manually input via paper tape or <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed.|$|E

40|$|Background: Multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> are frame {{cards with}} 28 plastic {{cavities}} {{filled with a}} patient’s oral solid medication. They are used in primary care to facilitate medication management and to enhance adherence. Main criticism concerned handling difficulties and fading knowledge about medication of patients using them. This study aimed at exploring daily use, preferences and adherence of primary care patients using multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> Methods: Community pharmacies in Switzerland recruited primary care patients using multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> A mixed methods approach was applied with quantitative interviews performed by telephone and qualitative interviews face-to-face. Results: Of 149 eligible patients from 21 community pharmacies, 22 participated 2011 in the quantitative and 11 participated 2013 / 14 in the qualitative interview. Patients were very satisfied with the multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> and stated increased medication safety. All considered adherence as very important. Self-reported adherence was 10 (median) on a visual analogue scale (0 = no intake, 10 = perfect adherence). The absence of package inserts and predefined handling difficulties e. g., tablets spiking at removal were not perceived as problems. Conclusions: Patients are satisfied with the multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards,</b> feel safe, mostly have no handling problems and adhere to their treatment. Trust in health-care professionals and patients’ experiences emerged as key variables for initiating multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> use and for medication adherence. This mixed methods study invalidates previous concerns about disadvantages of multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> Health-care professionals should actively recommend them for primary care patients with polypharmacy and poor adherence...|$|R

Ruppelt wanted their experts to assist them in making the Air Force UFO study more scientific. It was the Battelle Institute that devised the {{standardized}} reporting form.

25|$|Leibniz was groping towards {{hardware}} and software concepts worked out much later by Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. In 1679, while mulling over his binary arithmetic, Leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles, governed by a rudimentary sort of <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Modern electronic digital computers replace Leibniz's marbles moving by gravity with shift registers, voltage gradients, and pulses of electrons, but otherwise they run roughly as Leibniz envisioned in 1679.|$|E
