25|$|Health care in Ireland is two-tier: {{public and}} private sectors exist. The public health care system is governed by the Health Act 2004, which {{established}} a new body to be responsible for providing health and <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> to everyone living in Ireland – the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; however the new structures are currently {{in the process of being}} established as the reform programme continues.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the cost effectiveness (from the UK NHS and <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> perspectives) of infliximab plus methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX alone, {{in the treatment}} of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were not adequately controlled on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and who were resistant to MTX. Method: Clinical data for the first year of therapy were taken from the ATTRACT (Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy) and a Markov model developed to assess costs and consequences in the longer term. Transition probabilities and health state valuations for the model were estimated based on the ARAMIS (Arthritis, Rheumatism, and _Aging _Medical _Information _System) _cohort, _and _resource use and costs (Lstg, 2000 values) obtained from various sources in the UK. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The primary analysis suggested that infliximab plus MTX had an ICER of Lstg 33 _ 618 per QALY gained. Alternative modelling assumptions and various other sensitivity analyses were applied, but the ICER always remained within the range for interventions typically funded by the NHS. Conclusion: This model suggests, with its underlying assumptions and data, that the combination of infliximab and MTX may be a cost-effective treatment (from the UK NHS and <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> perspectives) for patients experiencing RA that cannot be maintained on MTX alone.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} applicability of transformational and transactional leadership style to <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations. The Executive Directors and their subordinates from 92 Children’s Aid Societies and Children’s Mental Health Centres in Ontario participated in the study. The results indicate significant positive relationships between transformational leadership (TFL) and job satisfaction, commitment, leader effectiveness, and satisfaction with the leader. While not as robust, significant negative relationships were found between transactional leadership (TAL) and job satisfaction, commitment, leader effectiveness, and satisfaction with the leader. It is pointed out that TAL and TFL are derived by averaging eight discrete factors into two sources. This procedure allows for a comprehensive analysis of TFL and TAL leadership, but results {{in the loss of}} information regarding the relative importance of the individual factors making up the score. The dissertation concludes with suggesting that TFL and TAL are useful factors in examining leadership in <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations. However, while the TAL concept is relevant as an appropriate leadership style, the adequacy of Bass’ Multi-Factor Leadership Questionnaire used to measure TAL is questioned. This research reflects that TAL and TFL is perceived as a bipolar concept rather than an independent one as suggested by Bass (1985). Areas for future research as suggested including the role of personal values in TFL; the measurement of TAL; the relevance of TAL and TFL to more direct service positions; and management training programmes to promote the development of TFL...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{addresses the}} opportunities for social communication development for mental handicapped youths who use the <b>personal</b> assistance <b>social</b> <b>service.</b> The means used for communication development are practical experience courses. A questionnaire was sued for research purposes which proves that personal assistance is used by clients mainly in a school environment and for escorts. Despite this fact, demand for practical experience courses from assistants is considerable. Almost all of them consider them to be an opportunity for their client {{to get to know}} their client better, thereby improving the quality of the <b>social</b> <b>service</b> provided. Other research focused on comparison of individual plans for the users of the <b>personal</b> assistance <b>social</b> <b>service.</b> This research confirmed the importance of the work of personal assistants who have a demonstrable influence on the development of communication and socialisation of people with a mental handicap. Controlled interviews with clients demonstrated that the common intense experiences enjoyed during the practical experience course, converted into life experience, can have a positive influence on the relationship between the assistant and client. They then find it easier to achieve goals aimed at development of communication which make orientation in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} in the United States and New Zealand has suggested {{that over the last}} two decades the age profile of well-being has shifted against children and in favor of the elderly population. This shift has occurred because welfare systems have become increasingly generous towards older people and increasingly restrictive towards families with dependent children. This paper considers whether similar trends can be identified for Britain. We examine measures of the age profile of poverty and of changes in the incomes of older people, but find they produce ambiguous results which do not address directly the issue of the intergenerational impact of the British welfare state. Direct measures of government expenditure on cash benefits to the retired population and on health and <b>personal</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> expenditure by age-group show that the British welfare system has been neutral between age-groups in recent years.
