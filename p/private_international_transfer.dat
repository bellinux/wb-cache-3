40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>international</b> law {{presents}} a dilemma for {{legal and political}} philosophy. Legal and political philosophers have ignored <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law, {{with only a few}} scattered attempts to evaluate its claims. <b>Private</b> <b>international</b> law offers a powerful set of counterexamples that put into serious doubt attempts to link law’s authority only or primarily to relationships between states and citizens. No society, state, or other practice-mediated relationship can serve as grounds for the authority of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law to persons to whom it applies but who are outside of such relationships. <b>Private</b> <b>international</b> law affects the normative situations of persons entirely outside these relationships. This article examines these issues from the standpoint of contractualist moral and political philosophy. How can <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law be justified from a moral point of view? The aim {{of this article is to}} show that the moral justification of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law, in particular the law on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, requires an evaluation of the coercive qualities of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law. Suitably constructed moral principles, which permit reasonable restrictions on liberty, are developed...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} is to expand and refine the <b>international</b> {{technology}} <b>transfer</b> negotiating and analytic agendas and to reframe the issues. The paper presents concepts, indicators, illustrations and data that identify and measure <b>international</b> <b>transfers</b> of energy technologies {{that can be used}} to mitigate climate change. Among the questions on that agenda are how much technology transfer there has been to date, and how much will be needed in the future, especially to assist non-Annex I developing countries in their efforts to mitigate climate change. Before the how much questions can be answered, however, there are several prior questions, and hence the many other elements of the subtitle of the paper: what, who, how, why, when, where. These aspects of <b>international</b> technology <b>transfer</b> vary significantly among three existing institutional settings and among the associated analytic paradigms: North-South Official Development Assistance, Global <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> Investment and Trade, and International Public-Private Cooperation Agreements. The principal sections of the paper focus on features of <b>international</b> technology <b>transfers</b> in these institutional settings and on illustrations drawn from the biodiesel industry, especially the use of jatropha tree as the source of the feedstock. The conclusions are summarized as follows: (i) Technologies include intangible know-how and services, as well as tangible goods in the form of production process equipment and finished products. (ii) <b>International</b> <b>transfers</b> of some types of technology are much easier to measure than others. (iii) <b>International</b> technology <b>transfers</b> are highly industry-specific. (iv) Even for individual industries, it is necessary to use multiple indicators of technology transfers. (v) Patterns in the types of technology and methods of transfer vary across the three institutional settings examined in the paper. (vi) All three of the institutional arrangements are probably under-performing and inadequa...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} one of the most significant concepts of contemporary <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law - the concept of habitual residence. The concept of habitual residence was introduced into the field of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law within the context of the unification work of the Hague Conference of <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> Law in the interest of finding a compromise between the traditional connecting factors of domicile, dominant in the sphere of common law, and nationality, that is historically closely bound to continental legal systems. Thanks to the long and systematic unification work of the Hague Conference of <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> Law, the connecting factor of habitual residence has gained a permanent indisputable position in <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law. The concept of habitual residence has also forcefully made its way through into the rapidly developing sphere of European <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law. The European Union has followed in the footsteps of the Hague Conference of <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> Law: habitual residence is today the central, most frequently adopted connecting factor in the unified conflict-of-laws rules, that determine the applicable law, as well as in the rules that determine the jurisdiction of the forum.

Impact evaluation methods employed in the study include fixedeffects regression and difference-in-differences with propensity score matching. Poverty is measured by three Foster-Greer-Thorbecke poverty indexes, while inequality {{is measured by the}} Gini coefficient, Theil’s L and Theil’s T indexes. It is found that the impact of the governmental micro-credit, public <b>transfers</b> and <b>international</b> remittances on poverty reduction is very limited. On the contrary, informal credit, domestic (internal) private transfers and migration have positive and statistically significant impacts on poverty reduction. The domestic private transfers have the largest effect on the total poverty of the population due to a high impact on expenditure and a large coverage of the poor. Regarding inequality, both government-subsidized micro-credit and informal credit do not affect inequality significantly. Public <b>transfers</b> and <b>international</b> remittances increase inequality slightly, while domestic private transfers and migration lead to a decrease in inequality...|$|R

This reflected the recurrent attempt, typical of this area, to build self-sufficient systems of law, resting on autonomous principles.

40|$|Abstract__ The private {{ordering}} {{and public}} regulation of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law situations {{has never been}} an easy task, {{and it is one}} to which legislatures generally have not paid a lot of attention. However, our ‘open societies’ do no longer allow for this lack of interest. This is evident from ongoing debates on a range of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law matters that have attracted attention beyond the originally somewhat secluded <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law scholarship and which regularly receive media attention. The usual conflicts of interests underlying these types of legal relationships and disputes arising from them gain complexity {{as a result of the}} transnational dimension and raise pressing questions as to which (domestic) authority ought to address these in a fragmented world with different applicable laws. The articles included in this issue, dedicated to the role of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law in contemporary society, dig up the many open debates concerning the challenges of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law as a governance tool...|$|R

40|$|Many {{agree that}} <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law does {{a poor job}} of leading to good and {{predictable}} results. Can law and economics bring more scientific, objective foundations to the discipline? Economics, one may hope, can bring the conclusiveness to the field that doctrine could not. But even a fleeting review of existing studies reveals a discrepancy of views or economic approaches that mirrors the discrepancy in the traditional <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law doctrine. This article sets out to test whether different models lead to different outcomes. It makes arguments in three economic models - a private law model, an international law model, and a model combining the two. The subject area for this analysis is <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law of torts, more specifically the question of the law applicable to cross-border torts. The result is that the debate whether <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law is 2 ̆ 2 private law 2 ̆ 2 or (public) 2 ̆ 2 international law 2 ̆ 2 is replicated in the economic analysis of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law.

40|$|In this {{research}} {{the interaction between}} the rights guaranteed in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law has been analyzed by examining the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) in Strasbourg and selected national courts. In doing so the study has focused on the impact of the ECHR on the three main issues of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law: jurisdiction, applicable law, and the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. The conclusion of {{this research}} is that the rights guaranteed in the ECHR have a considerable impact on all three main questions of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law. Even though the Court’s case law on this topic remains somewhat limited, it is clear that <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law is not immune to the impact of the rights guaranteed in the ECHR.

40|$|In a {{legal system}} based on {{democracy}} {{and the rule of}} law, an important fundament for the different branches of law is found in constitutional law. Constitutional rules and principles provide democratic legitimacy of legislation and other forms of exercise of public power. Furthermore, such rules and principles limit the exercise of public power, notably through rules on fundamental rights and on transfer of authority to foreign states and international organisations. All these aspects may be relevant in relation to rules of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law. However, constitutional aspects of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law have gained little attention in Sweden. The article aims at identifying and discussing some important parts of the constitutional foundations for <b>private</b> <b>international</b> law in Sweden {{in the light of the}} rules and principles mentioned.
