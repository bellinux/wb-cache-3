40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{technical}} aspects of innovative hydrogen production concepts based on coal gasification with CO 2 capture. More specifically, it focuses on the technical evaluation and the assessment of performance of a number of plant configurations based on standard entrained flow gasification processes (dry feed and slurry feed types) producing hydrogen at pipeline pressure, which incorporate improvements for increasing hydrogen purity and pressure. Also, different CO 2 capture methods (physical vs. chemical solvents) are assessed. The dry feed type of entrained flow gasifier is currently considered to be the most efficient means of producing hydrogen from coal. The main shortcomings are relatively low hydrogen purity due to the need of using nitrogen as a transport gas for the coal and a <b>pressure</b> <b>limitation</b> of this type of design. The purity issue can be solved by using captured CO 2 or syngas to transport the coal in the gasifier.

40|$|Background: With {{adaptive}} support ventilation, respiratory {{rate and}} tidal volume (V(T)) are {{a function of}} the Otis least work of breathing formula. We hypothesized that adaptive support ventilation in an open lung ventilator strategy would deliver higher V(T) s to patients with acute lung injury. Methods: Patients with acute lung injury were ventilated according to a local guideline advising the use of lower V(T) (6 - 8 ml/kg predicted body weight), high concentrations of positive end-expiratory pressure, and recruitment maneuvers. Ventilation parameters were recorded when the ventilator was switched to adaptive support ventilation, and after recruitment maneuvers. If V(T) increased more than 8 ml/kg predicted body weight, airway pressure was limited to correct for the rise of V(T). Results: Ten patients with a mean (+/- SD) PaO(2) /FIO(2) of 171 +/- 86 mmHg were included. After a switch from pressure-controlled ventilation to adaptive support ventilation, respiratory rate declined (from 31 +/- 5 to 21 +/- 6 breaths/min; difference = 10 breaths/min, 95 % CI 3 - 17 breaths/min, P = 0. 008) and V(T) increased (from 6. 5 +/- 0. 8 to 9. 0 +/- 1. 6 ml/kg predicted body weight; difference = 2. 5 ml, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 4. 6 ml/kg predicted body weight, P = 0. 02). <b>Pressure</b> <b>limitation</b> corrected for the rise of V(T), but minute ventilation declined, forcing the user to switch back to pressure-controlled ventilation.

In particular, merging solutions are developed in which the axial guide field is the dominant driver of the reconnection.

40|$|A kick can {{be defined}} as an {{unintended}} influx of formation fluids into a borehole. If the kick can’t be controlled it will evolve into a blowout. In this case a relief well would have to be drilled to stop the influx. To be able to kill the blowing well one need to increase the bottom hole pressure. When the bottom hole pressure in the well becomes greater than the reservoir pressure the influx is stopped. The method used to increase the bottom hole pressure is called dynamic kill. When drilling a relief well from a floater kill fluid is pumped from the relief well rig. The kill fluid goes down the kill and choke line through the BOP [Blow Out Preventer], into the annulus of the relief well, it continues further down the annulus to the intersect point and in to the blowing well. To be able to increase the BHP [Bottom Hole Pressure] one needs to deliver enough volume of mud at high enough pump rate. The blowing well will be stopped by pumping so fast that the pressure in the blowing well exceeds the formation pressure. When fluid is flowing in pipes it looses pressure; friction pressure. These friction pressure losses occurs in the pipes on the rig, in the kill and choke line and in annulus in both relief well and the blowing well. Different simulation tools has been used to run simulations to find out how the friction pressure is affected by water depth (length of kill and choke line), ID; [Internal Diameter] size on kill and choke line and mud-type used.

Due to <b>pressure</b> <b>limitations</b> of the available boiler, only tests with steam pressures up to 50 bar and steam temperatures up to 320 °C could be performed.

The low pressure steam injection is also one of the possible STID application versions to the normal, not thermally upgraded (hot), engines which requires only minor modifications of the steam generating facilities used in current ship installations. It is shown that the ignition and combustion processes in the engine are practically unaffected by injection of the required mass of steam, which typically shall not be larger than 3. 5 times the mass of fuel, at which soot, unburned hydrocarbon and CO emissions start to grow. Within this range the NOx emissions can be described by a simple formula NOx =NOx,o(1 - 0. 2 m), where m is the steam to fuel mass ratio and NOx,o the emissions of the engine with out steam injection. The optimal way of using low pressure steam is to inject the steam into the inlet manifold of the engine which eliminates the complications of direct steam injection apparatus and eliminates the growth of maximum pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A high {{efficiency}} design was explored for meso-scale magnetorheological (MR) valves (< 25 mm OD with an annular gap < 1 mm). The {{objective of this}} paper is to miniaturize the MR valve while maintaining the maximum performance of the MR effect in the valve. The main design issues in the MR valve involve the magnetic circuit and nonlinear fluid mechanics. The performance of the MR valve is limited by saturation phenomenon in the magnetic circuit and by the finite yield stress of the MR fluid. When field is applied to the magnetic circuit in the MR valve, a semisolid plug (as a result of particle chain formation) forms perpendicular to the flow direction through the valve, and a finite yield stress is developed as a function of field. The resulting plug thickness is used to control flow rate through, and pressure drop across, the MR valve. The nondimensional plug thickness is evaluated as a basis for evaluating valve efficiency. Design parameters of the MR valve are studied and an optimal performance was designed using steel (Permalloy) material in the magnetic circuit. A maximum magnetic flux density at the gap was achieved in the optimized valve design based on a constraint on the outer diameter <b>limitation.</b> <b>Valve</b> performance was verified with simulation.
