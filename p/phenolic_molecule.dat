Significant progress has been made recently in understanding SA-mediated defense signaling networks. Functional analysis of a large number of genes involved in SA biosynthesis and regulation of SA accumulation and signal transduction has revealed distinct but interconnecting pathways that orchestrate the control of plant defense. Further studies utilizing combinatorial approaches in genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry and genomics will uncover finer details of SA-mediated defense networks as well as further insights into the crosstalk of SA with other defense signaling pathways.

SA exerts its functions by interacting with protein targets; however, the specific cellular components modulated by SA and critical for immune signal transduction are largely unknown. To uncover cellular activities targeted by SA, we probed Arabidopsis protein microarrays with a functional analog of SA. We demonstrate that thimet oligopeptidases (TOPs) constitute a class of SA-binding enzymes. Biochemical evidence demonstrated that SA interacts with TOPs and inhibits their peptidase activities to various degrees both in vitro and in plant extracts. Functional characterization of mutants with altered TOP expression indicated that TOP 1 and TOP 2 mediate SA-dependent signaling and are necessary for the immune response to avirulent pathogens. Our results support a model whereby TOP 1 and TOP 2 act in separate pathways to modulate SA-mediated cellular processes...|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} planned to {{investigate}} phytochemical content, antioxidants, and antibacterial activities of 12 extracts resulting from 12 treatments and {{to extract the}} free and bounded bioactive compounds from jojoba and jatropha hulls because in different studies, the extraction of phytochemical is done by using combined methods. This occurs when a single extraction method is low as we would expect, thus a mixture of extraction processes could be the optimum effective method for extraction of different polyphenols in extracts (Alfredo 2016). According to these reports and to our last study in this field, we used different treatments because {{as can be seen}} in the examined hull biomass (Figs  1 and 2), these are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and other minor components. Lignin is a polymer that contains mostly different functional groups involved in its depolymerization and degradation; phenolic compounds possess an aromatic ring bearing one or more hydroxyl groups, and their structures may range from a simple <b>phenolic</b> <b>molecule</b> to a complex high-molecular weight polymer (Balasundram et al. 2006). Since the solubility of bioactive compounds in general is depending on their chemical nature which vary from simple to very highly polymerized substances, the solubility of bioactive compounds is affected by the polarity of the solvent used (Wagdy and Taha 2017). We chose to use ethanol over other alcohols because of its safety, easily separated by evaporation, low boiling points, recycled to lower the costs of the treatments, and should be evaporated before the use of the extracts (Sun and Cheng 2002). Also, we used 70 [*]ml of ethanol (organosolvent) mixed with 30 [*]ml HCl or NaOH with ultrasound-assisted extraction then soaking overnight to reduce the temperature and to enhance the process by hydrolysis of lignin and extracts of the bound phenolic, flavonoid, and saponin compounds without degradations of phenolic compounds, leaving the residue to be used in other industrial products (Sun and Cheng 2002). Araque et al. (2007) studied the organosolvent acetone water for pretreatment. They found the highest ethanol yield after treatment with pH[*] 2.0 and 50 % aqueous acetone. For economic reasons, we used ethanol because ethanol has been favored over alcohols with higher boiling points. Ethanol is a common solvent although it hinders hydrolytic enzymes. It should be isolated from the solid fraction before enzymatic hydrolysis (Taherzadeh and Karimi 2007).|$|E
40|$|Gallic acid (GA), or 3, 4, 5 -trihydroxybenzoic acid, is the commonest and {{simplest}} phenolic acid, {{with just}} one aromatic ring. This <b>phenolic</b> <b>molecule</b> {{has been described as}} antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour, also, antimicrobial and anti-fungal activity has been attributed to it. Besides all the GA biological activities, this compound is cheap, due to the easy plant extraction, and non-toxic. Thus, this phenolic acid has been widely used in food, drugs and cosmetic industry. GA, as other phenolic compounds, is susceptible to environmental factors which may lead to the losing their structural integrity and bioactivity. This can be overcome by the encapsulation with cyclodextrins (CD). They are cyclic oligosaccharides arising from the degradation of starch; inexpensive and friendly to humans. CD are able to form an inclusion complex {{with a wide range of}} bioactive molecules, including hydrophobic ones, protect and modulate their release. In the present work, the formation of an inclusion complex (IC) between βCD, HPβCD (2 -Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) or MβCD (methyl-β-cyclodextrin) and GA was analysed by UV spectrophotometry. The antimicrobial activity of the complexes was also assessed, by qualitative and quantitative methods. The influence of the buffer and pH on the formation of the IC and on the GA antimicrobial activity was also tested. The IC formation was analysed in 2 buffer solutions (K 2 HPO 4 / KH 2 PO 4 and H 3 PO 4 /NaOH). The GA and IC absorbance spectrum showed different appearances depending on the buffer used. When K 2 HPO 4 / KH 2 PO 4 was used, the IC spectrum presented some alterations on the λmax comparatively to the GA spectrum. Since, the GA and ICs spectra obtained for the H 3 PO 4 /NaOH were similar, this buffer was selected. The IC formation between GA and βCD, HPβCD or MβCD was analysed at pH 5, 7 and 8. Based on the results it was clear that the pH used affected the IC formation in the conditions tested. The βCD formed IC 1 : 1 with GA for all pH values, being the pH 5 the most favourable. The same was observed for MβCD, but these CD had the lowest values for the association constant, meaning that the IC formation between MβCD and GA is not very efficient. Regarding the HPβCD, in neutral pH the IC formed was 1 : 2 and for the others pH was 1 : 1, pH 5 was the most favourable for the IC formation and pH 7 the least. The antimicrobial activity was assessed for the best combinations of GA/CD (βCD pH 5 and pH 7; HPβCD pH 5 and pH 8). For all the IC tested, the antimicrobial activity of GA was improved or alike to the GA without encapsulation. To the authors knowledge, the IC formation between HPβCD or MβCD and GA has not been reported until know, as well as the antimicrobial activity of the IC βCD/GA and HPβCD/GA...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop methodologies based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which provide novel insights into the interactions between xylanase (Tx-xyn 11) and phenolic compounds or lignin oligomers. In a first approach, Tx-xyn 11 was fixed onto sensor surfaces, and <b>phenolic</b> <b>molecules</b> were applied in the liquid phase.

An alternative approach was developed in which a lignin oligomer was fixed onto a sensor surface. Due to their hydrophobic properties, the preparation of stable lignin layers on the sensor surfaces represented a considerable challenge. Among the various chemical and physico-chemical approaches assayed, two approaches (physisorption via the Langmuir-Blodgett technique onto self-assembled monolayer (SAM) -modified gold and covalent coupling to a carboxylated dextran matrix) led to stable lignin layers, which allowed the study of its interactions with Tx-xyn 11 in the liquid phase.

The importance of VOO is mainly attributed both to its high content of oleic acid a balanced contribution quantity of polyunsaturated fatty acids and its richness in phenolic compounds, which act as natural antioxidants and {{may contribute to the}} prevention of several human diseases. The polar phenolic compounds of VOO belong to different classes: phenolic acids, phenyl ethyl alcohols, hydroxy-isochromans, flavonoids, lignans and secoiridoids. This latter family of compounds is characteristic of Oleaceae plants and secoiridoids are the main compounds of the phenolic fraction. Many agronomical and technological factors can affect the presence of phenols in VOO.

Haustorium development is initiated in aseptic roots of the facultative parasite Triphysaria versicolor when exposed to <b>phenolic</b> <b>molecules</b> associated with host root exudates and rhizosphere bioactivity. Morphological features of early haustorium ontogeny include rapid cessation of root elongation, expansion, and differentiation of epidermal cells into haustorial hairs, and cortical cell expansion. These developmental processes were stimulated in aseptic T. versicolor seedlings by the application of exogenous phytohormones and inhibited by the application of hormone antagonists. Surgically dissected root tips formed haustoria if the root was exposed to haustorial-inducing factors prior to dissection. In contrast, root tips that were dissected prior to inducing-factor treatment were unable to form haustoria unless supplemented with indole- 3 -acetic acid. A transient transformation assay demonstrated that auxin and ethylene-responsive promoters were up-regulated when T. versicolor was exposed to either exogenous hormones or purified haustoria-inducing factors. These experiments demonstrate that localized auxin and ethylene accumulation are early events in haustorium development and that parasitic plants recruit established plant developmental mechanisms to realize parasite-specific functions...|$|R
40|$|Plant polyphenols, such as flavonoids, {{comprise}} many compounds, {{ranging from}} simple <b>phenolic</b> <b>molecules</b> (i. e. flavonols, anthocyanins) to polymeric structures with {{high molecular weight}} (as proanthocyanidins, PAs). We investigated the effects of flavonoids by feeding Wistar rats Arabidopsis thaliana seeds carrying mutations in key enzymes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (15 % w/w seeds for 4 weeks). The seeds used were: Ws- 2 wild-type containing flavonols and PAs, tt 3 - 4 mutant containing flavonols only, ban- 5 accumulating flavonols and anthocyanins, tt 4 - 8 mutant, deprived of flavonoids. DNA oxidative damage was significantly reduced only in the liver of rats fed tt 3 - 4 mutant seeds. Microarray analysis of the liver revealed down-regulation of genes associated with oxidative stress, Krebs cycle, electron transport and proteasome degradation in all experimental groups compared to the tt 4 - 8 -fed reference rats; therefore, these effects were due to the flavonol content and not to high molecular weight compounds. We observed a down-regulation of inflammatory response genes in the colon mucosa in ban- 5 - fed rats, probably due to anthocyanin content. In conclusion, flavonols exhibited antioxidant effects at systemic level, whereas high molecular weight flavonoids affected only the colon, probably due to their limited absorption...|$|R
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is {{well known}} for its use in plastic {{manufacture}} and thermal paper production despite its risk of health toxicity as an endocrine disruptor in humans. Since the publication of new legislation regarding the use of BPA, manufacturers have begun to replace BPA with other <b>phenolic</b> <b>molecules</b> such as bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol B (BPB), but there are no guarantees regarding the health safety of these compounds at this time. In this context, a very simple, cheap and fast surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method was developed for the sensitive detection of these molecules in spiked tap water solutions. Silver nanoparticles were used as SERS substrates. An original strategy was employed to circumvent the issue of the affinity of bisphenols for metallic surfaces and the silver nanoparticles surface was functionalized using pyridine in order to improve again the sensitivity of the detection. Semi-quantitative detections were performed in tap water solutions at a concentrations range from 0. 25 to 20 µg L- 1 for BPA and BPB and from 5 to 100 µg L- 1 for BPF. Moreover, a feasibility study for performing a multiplex-SERS detection of these molecules was also performed before successfully implementing the developed SERS method on real samples.
