30|$|The {{predictive}} value of pupillary reactivity is underlined by recent systematic meta-analyses [155, 156]. In this setting, newly available automated infrared pupillometers hold great promise, because they allow quantitative {{measurement of the}} pupillary response. One single-center study recently showed quantitative pupillometry is superior to standard <b>pupillary</b> <b>examination</b> for post-CA coma prognostication and performs comparably to electro-physiological exams (including EEG and SSEP) [157].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Measurement {{of static}} pupillary {{size in the}} ICU is of {{importance}} in cases of acutely expanding intracranial mass lesions. The inaccuracies with subjective assessment of pupillary size by medical personnel preclude its use in emergent neurological situations. Objective: To determine if the ratio of pupil to limbus diameter (PLD ratio) measured by a two-box method is a reliable measure of pupil size for detecting early anisocoria and measuring pupillary changes. Materials and Methods: The PLD ratio {{was defined as the}} ratio of the pupillary diameter measured at a para-horizontal axial plane with the limbus diameter measured at the same or parallel axial plane. A two-box method was used to estimate the diameters of imaged pupils. Eyes were imaged using an iPhone 4 S cellphone camera. Background illumination was measured and kept constant. The pupils of a 78 -year-old woman, who presented with a large intra-axial parenchymal hemorrhage, were imaged. The patient had left pupillary miosis in dark but not in bright light. After presenting this case along with the images of the <b>pupillary</b> <b>examination,</b> a group of 21 medical staff were asked several questions on the <b>pupillary</b> <b>examination.</b> Reliability of PLD ratio were assessed via standard error of mean (S. E. M) of PLD ratios for 3 different subjects each imaged under constant illumination and fixation but from different angles to the optical axis. Results: Analysis of questionnaire data together with PLD ratios revealed that ~ 14 % and 10 % of participants could estimate the pupillary size in darkness and bright light respectively but none were simultaneously accurate indicating that subjective assessment of pupillary size was unreliable. The approach towards a systematic <b>pupillary</b> <b>examination</b> was inconsistent among the participants. The PLD ratio was found to be a reliable measure of pupillary size with standard error of mean below 0. 1 mm for the three subjects tested. Conclusion: Static pupillary sizes can be objectively and consistently evaluated using PLD ratios using a two-box method. PLD ratios are resistant, within limits, to changes in imaging angle or choice of para-horizontal axes for measurement...|$|E
40|$|A 25 -year-old male {{presented}} to the emergency department after being assaulted outside of a bar by a bare-fisted assailant resulting in significant head trauma and right periorbital swelling and pain. On physical examination, {{he was unable to}} open his eye and his ability to execute extraocular movements was uncertain. There was marked periorbital swelling and ecchymosis preventing adequate visualization of the pupil. Point-of-care ultrasonography was employed–given that a <b>pupillary</b> <b>examination,</b> assessment for entrapment, and evaluation for retinal integrity are fundamental in the evaluation of ocular trauma. A large amount of ultrasound gel was placed over the closed, affected eyelid, and the pupil was then visualized by having the patient look down while a high-resolution linear array ultrasound transducer (Sonosite M-Turb...|$|E

Since most of the work-related eye injuries are avoidable by protective glasses, education by ophthalmologists gains more importance. Knowing the main pathogenetic mechanisms and treatment options would contribute to successful long-term treatment and visual rehabilitation in traumatized eyes. Detailed history, visual acuity, examination of eye lids and adnexa, palpation of the orbital rim, assessment of eye movements, examination of cornea and conjunctiva (sterile fluorescein drops, Seidel test), assessment of anterior chamber, <b>pupillary</b> <b>examination</b> (size, shape, reaction), status of the lens, and fundus examination are performed in case of eye injury.

40|$|Background. Decompressive {{craniectomy}} can be {{proposed in}} the management of severe traumatic brain injury. Current studies report mixed results, preventing any clear conclusions on the place of decompressive craniectomy in traumatology. Methods. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of all decompressive craniectomies performed between 2005 and 2011 for refractory intracranial hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury. Sixty patients were included. Clinical parameters (Glasgow scale, <b>pupillary</b> <b>examination)</b> and radiological findings (Marshall CT scale) were analysed. Complications, clinical outcome, and early and long-term Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were evaluated after surgery. Finally, the predictive value of preoperative parameters to guide the clinician’s decision to perform craniectomy was studied. Results. Craniectomy was unilateral in 58 cases and the mean bone flap area was 100 [*]cm 2. Surgical complications were observed in 6. 7 % of cases. Mean followup was 30 months and a favourable outcome was obtained in 50 % of cases. The initial Glasgow Scale was the only statistically significant predictive factor for long-term outcome.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Pupillary</b> <b>examination</b> is an {{important}} objective method to diagnose lesions of the anterior visual pathways. However, errors and faults may easily alter the interpretation and value of the test as it is highly dependent on the examiner's skills. Therefore, we tried to develop a pupillography which is independent of the examiner. Methods: Hardware composed of a binocularly measuring instrument adapted for an infrared charge coupled device (CCD) was developed. Two arrays of infrared light emitting diodes (LED) were supplied {{in front of each}} of the subject's eyes. A microcontroller to modulate these LED was developed, as was software to save and analyze the pupil images. The hardware was able to deliver a light to either eye or to both eyes, and to change the time, frequency, and intensity of the stimulus. The software automatically analyzed the pupil size and location by image processing. Pupil size was calculated continuously. After artifact elimination, the response amplitudes of the pupils were determined for the right and left pupils. Results: Pupillary images of size 320 × 240, at 30 frames/second, were saved and processed to evaluate the change of the actual pupil size and the velocity of pupillary response. Conclusions: A pupillography to measure, save and analyze the pupillary response using image processing was developed. Further detailed clinical studies with a large number of patients will be required to validate this new method. Korean Journal of Ophthalmology 19 (2) : 149 - 152, 200...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To report patent foramen ovale (PFO) as {{the cause}} of retinal artery {{occlusion}} in a young and previously fit male and discuss the appropriate medical and surgical management options. Methods. Interventional case report with serial fundus photographs of an 18 -year-old male presenting to the eye casualty with sudden onset left visual loss. Results. Visual acuities were 6 / 24 left and 6 / 4 right with a left afferent <b>pupillary</b> defect. Slitlamp <b>examination</b> confirmed a left hemiretinal artery occlusion and subsequent cardiology review with transoesophageal echocardiography revealed patent foramen ovale which was closed surgically. Conclusions. PFO is not uncommon and is often covert but predisposes individuals to embolic events. These events may be ophthalmic with visual sequelae and so ophthalmologists, physicians, and other healthcare personnel should be aware of this important and emerging association.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a benign}} tumour {{of the bones}} and is a disease of unknown aetiology. This report discusses a case of proptosis and visual deterioration with associated bony mass involving the right orbit. Case presentation A 32 -year-old Nigerian man of Yoruba ethnic origin presented to the eye clinic of our hospital with right-eye proptosis and visual deterioration of 7 -year duration. Presentation was preceded by a history of trauma. Proptosis was preceded by trauma but was non-pulsatile with no thrill or bruit but was associated with bony orbital mass. The patient reported no weight loss. Examination of his right eye showed visual acuity of 6 / 60 with relative afferent <b>pupillary</b> defect. Fundal <b>examination</b> revealed optic atrophy. Computed tomography showed an expansile bony mass involving all {{the walls of the}} orbit. The bony orbital mass was diagnosed histologically as fibrous dysplasia. Treatment included orbital exploration and orbital shaping to create room for the globe and relieve pressure on the optic nerve. Conclusion Fibrous dysplasia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of slowly developing proptosis with associated visual loss in young adults. </p...|$|R

Case: A 69 -year-old man was referred to our hospital and initially presented with best-corrected visual acuities (BCVA) of 20 / 40 (right eye) and 20 / 1000 (left eye) and relative afferent <b>pupillary</b> defect. Slit-lamp <b>examination</b> revealed no signs of ocular inflammation in either eye. Fundus examination revealed left-eye swelling and a pale superior optic disc, and Goldmann perimetry revealed left-eye inferior hemianopia. The patient was diagnosed with nonarteritic AION in the left eye. One week later, the patient returned to the hospital because of vision loss. The BCVA of the left eye was so poor that the patient could only count fingers. Slit-lamp examination revealed 1 + cells in the anterior chamber and the anterior vitreous in both eyes. Funduscopic examination revealed vasculitis and exudates in both eyes. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral panuveitis, and treatment with topical betamethasone was started. No other physical findings resulting from other autoimmune or infectious diseases were found. No additional treatments were administered, and optic disc edema in the left eye improved, and the retinal exudates disappeared in 3 months. The patient&# 39;s BCVA improved after cataract surgery was performed. Conclusion: Panuveitis most likely manifests after the development of AION.

40|$|To the Editors: Primary extracranial meningiomas {{are rare}} tumors. 1 - 3 Orbital meningiomas account for 3 % of all orbital tumors 4 and {{are said to}} develop from ectopic {{arachnoid}} tissue. 5 Cases of orbital meningioma have been reported, but only few have been diagnosed on cytology. 6, 7 The most useful cytologic criteria for diagnosing meningioma are cell clusters, cell balls and cell whorls {{with the presence of}} psammoma bodies. 8 The tumor can be easily diagnosed cytologically on these criteria. A case of orbital meningioma presented with proptosis and a mass in the medial canthus of the eye and was diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. Subsequently the diagnosis was confirmed on histopathology. A 20 -year-old woman presented with proptosis of the left eye increasing gradually in size for 1 year. On physical examination there was proptosis and a firm mass in the medial canthal area and above it. Vision in that eye was 6 / 60, with a normal <b>pupillary</b> reaction. Fundus <b>examination</b> revealed blurred disc margins and macular atrophy with yellow atrophic bands running from disc to macula. Routine blood investigations were unremarkable. A clinical diagnosis of accessory lacrimal gland neoplasm was made. Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography (Figure 1) of the orbit was performed in the coronal and axial planes and revealed a soft tissue mass in the extraconal space in the superior and medial aspect of the orbit with irregular outlines and closely approximated to the medial bony wall of the orbit (ethmoid bone). Small, ossified nodules were seen in the medial margin of the mass. There was no intracranial connection, and the optic nerve was normal...|$|R
40|$|A 9 –year-old male European cat was {{referred}} for clinical examination {{with a history}} of anorexia, apathy and mild dehydration. Neurological exam revealed anisocoria and decreased <b>pupillary</b> reflex. Ultrasound <b>examination</b> of the abdomen suggested the presence of a mesenteric mass and several areas of renal and hepatic lesions. Renomegaly was also observed. Samples of organs were submitted to the pathology service of the Superior Agrarian School of Viseu. Macroscopic exam of the liver showed several prominent whitish areas that, on cut section, revealed multilocular cystic appearance with greenish colour in some of them. The mesenteric mass, of friable consistency, showed 5, 5 x 4, 4 x 3, 5 cm On cut section this mass revealed whitish areas of soft consistency that alternated with hemorrhagic areas. The kidneys showed an white, irregular surface, and also in one of them a corical prominent nodule was seen. Several sections were processed for routine histopathological diagnosis. Microscopic exam revealed that the mesenteric mass corresponded to a tumour of lymphoid cells. Cells were large, with scanty cytoplasm, euchromatic round nucleus with prominent central nucleoli, high mitotic count and moderate pleomorphism invading surrounding adipose tissue. The same type of cells was observed in the liver and kidneys. Based on these results, a lymphoma with renal and hepatic metastases was diagnosed in the mesenteric mass. Concomitantly, microscopic examination of the liver showed hepatocyte vacuolation and trabecular disorganization, with multiple cystic cavities lined by an epithelium of cubic or squamous type, showing fine fibrovascular tissue stroma. The cuboidal epithelial cells presented a moderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, round or oval nucleus, vesicular, oriented centrally and with small or inapparent nucleoli. Based on these results, the diagnosis of neoplasia derived from biliary epithelium, was established. The differential diagnosis to be considered on this case were colangioma and biliary cystadenoma. The definitive diagnosis of biliary cystadenoma was established, based on the presence of multiple cystic cavities, disseminated by the hepatic parenchyma. According to previous statements, it was concluded that in spite of its rare occurrence, this is a case of biliary cystadenoma...|$|R
