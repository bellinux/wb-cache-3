5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo <b>photodissociation</b> in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the <b>photodissociation</b> of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E
25|$|In the {{atmosphere}} of Venus carbon monoxide {{occurs as a result}} of the <b>photodissociation</b> of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 169 nm.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{observations}} of c-C3H2 in dense clouds {{have also found}} concentrations that are significantly higher than expected. This {{has led to the}} hypothesis that the <b>photodissociation</b> of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enhances the formation of c-C3H2.|$|E
25|$|The {{inner edge}} of the HZ is the {{distance}} where a runaway greenhouse effect vaporizes the whole water reservoir and, as a second effect, induces the <b>photodissociation</b> of water vapor {{and the loss of}} hydrogen to space. The outer {{edge of the}} HZ is the distance from the star where adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere fails to keep the surface of the planet above the freezing point.|$|E
25|$|Notice that c-C3H2 {{is mostly}} {{destroyed}} by converting {{it back to}} C3H3+. Since the major destruction pathways only regenerate the major parent molecule, C3H2 is essentially a dead end in terms of interstellar carbon chemistry. However, in diffuse clouds or in the <b>photodissociation</b> region (PDR) of dense clouds, the reaction with C+ becomes much more significant and C3H2 can begin {{to contribute to the}} formation of larger organic molecules.|$|E
500|$|The coma is {{generally}} made of [...] and dust, with water making up to 90% of the volatiles that outflow from the nucleus when the comet is within [...] of the Sun. The [...] parent molecule is destroyed primarily through <b>photodissociation</b> {{and to a}} much smaller extent photoionization, with the solar wind playing a minor role {{in the destruction of}} water compared to photochemistry. Larger dust particles are left along the comet's orbital path whereas smaller particles are pushed away from the Sun into the comet's tail by light pressure.|$|E
500|$|Liquid water cannot persist on {{the lunar}} surface. When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly {{decomposes}} {{through a process}} known as <b>photodissociation</b> and is lost to space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from solar wind, leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon. Computer simulations suggest that up to [...] of the surface may be in permanent shadow. The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon {{is an important factor in}} rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive.|$|E
500|$|One {{billion years}} from now, about 27% {{of the modern}} ocean will have been subducted into the mantle. If this process were allowed to {{continue}} uninterrupted, it would reach an equilibrium state where 65% of the current surface reservoir would remain at the surface. Once the solar luminosity is 10% higher than its current value, the average global surface temperature will rise to [...] The atmosphere will become a [...] "moist greenhouse" [...] leading to a runaway evaporation of the oceans. At this point, models of the Earth's future environment demonstrate that the stratosphere would contain increasing levels of water. These water molecules will be broken down through <b>photodissociation</b> by solar ultraviolet radiation, allowing hydrogen to escape the atmosphere. The net result would be a loss of the world's sea water by about 1.1 billion years from the present. This will be a simple dramatic step in annihilating all life on Earth.|$|E
500|$|Gas in Io's {{atmosphere}} is stripped by Jupiter's magnetosphere, escaping {{to either the}} neutral cloud that surrounds Io, or the Io plasma torus, a ring of ionized particles that shares Io's orbit but co-rotates with the magnetosphere of Jupiter. Approximately one ton of material {{is removed from the}} atmosphere every second through this process so that it must be constantly replenished. The most dramatic source of [...] are volcanic plumes, which pump 104 kg of sulfur dioxide per second into Io's atmosphere on average, though most of this condenses back onto the surface. Much of the sulfur dioxide in Io's atmosphere sustained by sunlight-driven sublimation of [...] frozen on the surface. The day-side {{atmosphere is}} largely confined to within 40° of the equator, where the surface is warmest and most active volcanic plumes reside. A sublimation-driven atmosphere is also consistent with observations that Io's atmosphere is densest over the anti-Jupiter hemisphere, where [...] frost is most abundant, and is densest when Io is closer to the Sun. However, some contributions from volcanic plumes are required as the highest observed densities have been seen near volcanic vents. Because the density of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is tied directly to surface temperature, Io's atmosphere partially collapses at night, or when Io is in the shadow of Jupiter (with an ~80% drop in column density). The collapse during eclipse is limited somewhat by the formation of a diffusion layer of sulfur monoxide in the lowest portion of the atmosphere, but the atmosphere pressure of Io's nightside atmosphere is two to four orders of magnitude less than at its peak just past noon. The minor constituents of Io's atmosphere, such as , , , and [...] derive either from: direct volcanic outgassing; <b>photodissociation,</b> or chemical breakdown caused by solar ultraviolet radiation, from or the sputtering of surface deposits by charged particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E

[...] When heated, Fe(CO)5 converts to small amounts of the metal cluster Fe3(CO)12, a green solid. Simple thermolysis, however, is not a useful synthesis, and each iron carbonyl complex exhibits distinct reactivity.|$|E
2500|$|HCN is {{destroyed}} in interstellar clouds {{through a number}} of mechanisms depending on the location in the cloud. In [...] photon-dominated regions (PDRs), <b>photodissociation</b> dominates, producing CN (HCN + ν → CN + H). At further depths, <b>photodissociation</b> by cosmic rays dominate, producing CN (HCN + cr → CN + H). In the dark core, two competing mechanisms destroy it, forming HCN+ and HCNH+ (HCN + H+ → HCN+ + H; HCN + HCO+ → HCNH+ + CO). The reaction with HCO+ dominates by a factor of ~3.5. HCN has been used to analyze a variety of species and processes in the interstellar medium. It has been suggested as a tracer for dense molecular gas and as a tracer of stellar inflow in high-mass star-forming regions. Further, the HNC/HCN ratio {{has been shown to be}} an excellent method for distinguishing between PDRs and X-ray-dominated regions (XDRs). | volume = 242 | pages = 462 |bibcode=2007IAUS..242..462L| doi = 10.1017/S1743921307013609 | arxiv = 0709.3423 }} ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{main cause}} of ozone {{depletion}} and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals, especially man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), HCFCs, freons, halons), [...] referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by winds after being emitted at the surface. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through <b>photodissociation,</b> which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the upper}} atmosphere, a {{particularly}} {{important source of}} radicals is the <b>photodissociation</b> of normally unreactive chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by solar ultraviolet radiation, or by reactions with other stratospheric constituents (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give off the chlorine radical, Cl•, which reacts with ozone in a catalytic chain reaction ending in Ozone depletion and regeneration of the chlorine radical, allowing it to reparticipate in the reaction (see – below). Such reactions {{are believed to be}} the primary cause of depletion of the ozone layer (the net result is shown in [...] below), and this is why the use of chlorofluorocarbons as refrigerants has been restricted.|$|E
2500|$|Ward and Brownlee ask [...] "whether oxygenation, {{and hence}} the rise of animals, would ever have {{occurred}} on a world {{where there were no}} continents to erode". Extraterrestrial free oxygen has recently been detected around other solid objects, including Mercury, Venus, Mars Jupiter's four Galilean moons, Saturn's moons Enceladus, Dione and Rhea and even the atmosphere of a comet. This has led scientists to speculate whether processes other than photosynthesis could be capable of generating an environment rich in free oxygen. Wordsworth (2014) concludes that oxygen generated other than through <b>photodissociation</b> may be likely on Earth-like exoplanets, and could actually lead to false positive detections of life. Narita (2015) suggests photocatalysis by titanium dioxide as a geochemical mechanism for producing oxygen atmospheres.|$|E
2500|$|Star-forming {{regions are}} {{a class of}} {{emission}} nebula associated with giant molecular clouds. These form as a molecular cloud collapses under its own weight, proceeding stars. Massive stars may form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths. The region of ionized hydrogen surrounding the massive stars is known as an H II region while the shells of neutral hydrogen surrounding the H II region are known as <b>photodissociation</b> region. Examples of star-forming regions are the Orion Nebula, the Rosette Nebula and the Omega Nebula. Feedback from star-formation, {{in the form of}} supernova explosions of massive stars, stellar winds or ultraviolet radiation from massive stars, or outflows from low-mass stars may disrupt the cloud, destroying the nebula after several million years.|$|E

50|$|Photoacids are {{molecules}} which {{become more}} acidic upon absorption of light. This is due {{either to the}} formation of strong acids upon <b>photodissociation,</b> or to the dissociation of protons upon photoassociation (e.g. ring-closing). There are two main types of molecules that release protons upon illumination: photoacid generators (PAGs) and photoacids (PAHs). PAGs undergo proton <b>photodissociation</b> irreversibly, while PAHs are molecules that undergo proton <b>photodissociation</b> and thermal reassociation.
