40|$|In railway {{engineering}} {{the monitoring}} of contact force between pantograph and catenary gives {{information about the}} interaction between the two systems and it is useful to check the status of the overhead line. Indeed the failure of the catenary {{is one of the main}} causes of out of order problems. This study was conducted in a test campaign on an underground train instrumented with sensors able to monitor the line status. One of the more important measured quantities is the <b>pantograph</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force,</b> and two measurement systems were implemented: one optical and another electrical. The optical one was based on FBG sensors applied on the pantograph collector strip; the electrical one was based on two load cells positioned at the sides of the collector strip. The in line measurements show that the optical solution is very promising, providing very reliable results that can be successfully used in the monitoring application, allowing the determination of the critical point in the line. The thermal compensation of any FBG sensors is a known problem and here is no exception: a thermal compensator was used to get also mean value measurements and the results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Overhead rail current {{collector}} systems for railway traction offer certain features, such as low installation height and reduced maintenance, which make them predominantly {{suitable for use}} in underground train infrastructures. Due to the increased demands of modern catenary systems and higher running speeds of new vehicles, a more capable design of the conductor rail is needed. A new overhead conductor rail has been developed and its design has been patented [13]. Modern simulation and modelling techniques {{were used in the}} development approach. The new conductor rail profile has a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. Its innovative design permits either an increase of catenary support spacing or a higher vehicle running speed. Both options ensure savings in installation or operating costs. The simulation model used to optimise the existing conductor rail profile included both a finite element model of the catenary and a three-dimensional multi-body system model of the <b>pantograph.</b> The <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> that appears between pantograph and catenary was obtained in simulation.

40|$|Aerodynamics of trains running inside tunnels change more {{significantly}} {{in comparison with}} open air scenarios. It has been confirmed that the lateral vibration {{as well as the}} aerodynamic drag of the trains is increased and the micropressure wave is produced at the tunnel exit when the trains are passing through tunnels. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore the impact of a high-speed train passing through a tunnel on the pantograph aerodynamics and the dynamic behavior of the pantograph–catenary interaction. The aerodynamic forces acting on the pantograph are investigated thoroughly by extensive numerical simulations as well as systematic field tests. To investigate the effects of the aerodynamic forces of pantograph on the quality of current collection, the numerical simulations of the pantograph–catenary dynamic interaction are conducted with our proposed model, taking into consideration the action of the aerodynamic uplift forces obtained by the numerical simulations on the pantograph. Then, a series of numerical simulations are also carried out to analyze the effects of the train speed and the blockage ratio on the aerodynamic uplift forces of the <b>pantograph,</b> on the <b>contact</b> <b>forces,</b> as well as on the displacement of the contact wire, while the train is passing through a tunnel. The results reveal that compared with the open air scenarios, the aerodynamic drag and uplift forces of the pantograph, the mean value of the <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> and the displacement level of the registration arm can considerably increase as the train runs inside a tunnel. Moreover, the statistical values of the <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> and the displacement level of the contact wire become larger while the train is passing through the tunnel at different speeds. On the other hand, the quality of current collection decreases with the increasing of the blockage ratio...|$|R

Elasticity {{variations}} in railway {{overhead contact line}} {{would lead to the}} fluctuation of <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> between <b>pantograph</b> and <b>contact</b> wire and produce a negative effect on the stability of current collection.

In this paper, the influence of dropper spacing on elasticity and quality of current collection have been studied using finite element analysis method by simulation. By analyzing the changes of elasticity value and <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> under different conditions of dropper distribution, the effect laws of dropper spacing on the contact wire elasticity and the quality of current collection under the speeds of 300 km/h, 350 km/h and 400 km/h have been obtained...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} between pantograph and overhead line (OHL) heavily influences {{the quality of}} the current collection that, on one side assures the correct power transmission from the contact wire to the electrical traction drives of the vehicle, {{and on the other side}} affects the amount of wear of both the contact wire of the OHL and the collector strips of the pantograph. Moreover the dynamics of pantograph-catenary coupled system is a mandatory topic when considering the interoperability issues, among which there is the requirement of the assessment of the quality of interaction between a pantograph running on a catenary belonging to a network different from its original one. Usually a pantograph is optimised and set-up for a given category of OHL, but it is not assured that running under different catenaries allows to obtain the same performances. To this purpose the key option is to perform test runs. Nevertheless an analysis before test trials would be very useful for a first evaluation of a new pantograph-OHL combination, enabling to save time and cost of the experimental runs. A first possibility, nowadays widely used especially in the design stage of new catenaries, is to perform numerical simulations by means of a validated numerical model, e. g. according to EN 50318. As an auxiliary option, a hardware in the loop (HIL) indoor set-up can be used in order to analyse the dynamic behaviour of a real pantograph coupled with a overhead line (OHL), virtually simulated in real time. This work focuses on the analysis of the correspondences between indoor test carried out on a pantograph, and the results that are obtained during test runs on the real line. The laboratory tests are fundamentally of two types: classical sinusoidal tests (step sine or sweep sine) and tests with HIL set-up. The results of both approaches are compared with on track test results considering the influence <b>pantograph</b> mean <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> and <b>contact</b> wire mechanical tension. The potentialities of HIL approach as a useful tool for an effective application of the virtual homologation concept are pointed out...|$|R

At present, tyre-road <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> measurement systems are very expensive and modify the non suspended vehicle inertia due to their high mass and rotational inertia moment.
