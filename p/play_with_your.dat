500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there you have to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, {{and for the next}} two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E

[...] Webkinz were {{originally}} released by the Canadian toy company Ganz on April 29, 2005. The toys are similar to many other small plush toys; however, each Webkinz toy has an attached tag with a unique [...] "Secret Code" [...] printed on it {{that allows you to}} <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> pet in the [...] "Webkinz World" [...] website. On Webkinz World, the Secret Code allows the user to own a virtual version of the pet for online play. Lil' Kinz are smaller, less expensive versions of Webkinz, while the Signature collection are larger and slightly more expensive. Sales of plush Webkinz toys are limited to the United States and Canada, but international users can buy virtual pets from the online eStore. In 2006, Webkinz had one million online accounts, and according to one estimate published in Wired they took in $100 million. In 2011, Webkinz made its first commercial on TV. Webkinz was updated in 2015 to Webkinz X, making it more kid friendly.|$|E
2500|$|The PlayStation Move {{has been}} {{generally}} well received. Game Informer gave it an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "The PlayStation Eye and motion controller are a killer combination for accurate and highly responsive motion-based gameplay, and we applaud Sony {{for getting the}} hardware right the first time." [...] Kotaku praised its accuracy, design, use of augmented reality and said that [...] "The Playstation Move is a intuitive, natural feeling way to play games and it brings with it not only a sense of increased immersion to already graphically immersive games, but {{a new way to}} <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> reality and a refreshing form of colorful feedback." [...] IGN gave the Move an 8.5 out of 10, noting that the launch line-up of games for the controller was insufficient though it summarized by saying [...] "At the end of the day, the PlayStation Move {{has the potential to be}} the best motion control system on the current crop of consoles." [...] Joystiq praised the Move, saying [...] "The hardware's great, and I can see it being used in a multitude of really cool ways, but of course it's only as cool as the games that use it" [...] and that the launch line-up was not worth the purchase, though it believed that the Move would be worth the purchase in early 2011 due to a stronger line-up of games such as [...] and Killzone 3. CVG gave the Move an extremely positive review and awarded it 9 out of 10, saying that [...] "Sony's motion control gets beyond being a gimmick. We found ourselves constantly itching for 'one more go'." [...] The Guardian strongly criticized the Move's launch line-up, though it noted that the hardware was strong and that after playing with the Move it was [...] "very hard to go back to the relative inaccuracy of the Wii".|$|E
2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
