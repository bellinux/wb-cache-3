This study carries out an overview of allergens labeling frequencies by distinguishing allergens used in recipes from those listed on <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements,</b> for the fourteen allergen categories for which labeling is mandatory according to European legislation. 17, 309 products were collected, between 2008 and 2012, from 26 food categories. Products were classified per family and type of brand (national brands, retailer brands, entry-level retailer brands, hard discount, and specialized retailer brands). Allergenic ingredients were identified from ingredients lists and <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements.</b> 73 % of the 17, 309 products studied contained at least one allergen in their ingredients list and 39 % had a <b>precautionary</b> <b>statement</b> for one or more allergens.

National brands seemed to use it less frequently. For all these results, differences depended both on food categories and allergen categories.

40|$|AbstractThe safety {{data sheet}} (SDS), {{formerly}} known in the United States as the material {{safety data sheet}} (MSDS), contains important information for the safe handling of chemicals. This manuscript will cover the use of safety data sheets for process design and safe handling of chemicals. Three main categories (flammability, physical properties, and toxicity) listed in a SDS will be explained. Within each category, examples will be presented on how the specific information can be used in the design of safe chemical operations. Further, within the United States, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revised their hazard communication standard in March of 2012. Specifically, the standard has been aligned with the United Nations’ Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Changes include requirements for use of standardized signal words, pictograms, hazard <b>statements,</b> and <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements.</b> The presentation will review examples of these important changes, and relating these to the GHS for safe use of chemicals within the workplace worldwide...|$|R

40|$|The {{completion}} of a risk assessment form is a sequence of three events: chemical information discovery and acquisition; chemical information manipulation; and, assessment form template interpolation. For organisations, {{the costs associated with}} manual risk assessment are very significant; ranging from the wages of those who complete and review the forms, to the damages paid to those who are affected by any errors. We present a software system that uses Semantic Web technologies to assist with and automate the {{completion of}} COSHH risk assessment forms. We use an RDF representation of the GHS and CLP regulation to describe the hazards and <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements</b> that are associated with a library of chemical substances.

We find that the introduction of software systems for automated risk assessment is, on the whole, beneficial to organisations.

40|$|Maintaining bee-friendly {{habitats}} {{in cities}} and suburbs can help conserve the vital pollination services of declining bee populations. Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants, neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees, but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated. After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days, and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop. Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly contaminated by spray residues contained 171 ± 44 ppb clothianidin. Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present {{at the time of}} treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results validate EPA label <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements</b> not to apply neonicotinoids to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears non-hazardous to bumble bees...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{public opinion}} in Saudi Arabia {{regarding}} the technical drug package insert (PI) {{as a source of}} information and to assess the need for potential changes to the existing format in favor of a more patient-oriented package insert (PPI). DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March through May 1998 by means of a self-administered questionnaire. SETTING: Eighty-four community pharmacies in Riyadh. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand twenty-nine customers entering community pharmacies in Riyadh were enrolled in this survey. RESULTS: Results of the survey showed that 88 % of the respondents read the PI. The motives for reading the PI included the desire {{to know more about the}} medication (48. 7 %), to adhere to the prescription (21. 7 %), and to decide whether to take the medication (13. 1 %). From the list of information contained therein, respondents listed indications (47. 1 %) and adverse drug effects (46. 6 %) as the principal sections of interest. Respondents overwhelmingly endorsed the PI as a complementary source of drug information to the verbal instructions of the physician and the pharmacist. However, readers did criticize its detail, legibility, and poor graphic illustration. Respondents indicated their desire to see a concise PPI introduced, one that highlights only the most common adverse effects of a drug. It should be written in simple Arabic and include, whenever possible, illustrations to enhance comprehension. CONCLUSIONS: The PI does not have the power to overrule the physician's or pharmacist's instructions. Since some patients may cease taking their medicines if they feel threatened by the adverse effects mentioned in the PI, <b>precautionary</b> <b>statements</b> should be prominently placed in the PI to explain the purpose of mentioning such information and what proper action should be taken by the patient.

To realize countermeasures by utilizing information systems, we must also implement a drug information database. However, this {{is not easy to}} develop, since the descriptions in package inserts are too complex and their information poorly structured. It is necessary to analyze package insert information and propose a data structure. Methods: We analyzed the descriptions of &# 39;precautions for application&# 39; in package inserts via text mining methods. In order to summarize statements, we applied dependency analysis to statements and visualized their relations between predicate words and other words. Furthermore, we extracted words representing timing to execute the order. Results: We found that there are four types of statements: direct orders such as &quot;使用する&quot; (use), causative orders such as &quot;使用させる&quot; (make someone use), direct interdictions such as &quot;使用しない&quot; (do not use), and causative interdictions such as &quot;使用させない&quot; (do not make user use). As for words representing timing, we extracted six groups: &quot;at the time of delivery,&quot; &quot;at the time of preparation,&quot; &quot;in use,&quot; &quot;after use,&quot; and &quot;at the time of storage. &quot; From these results, we obtained points of consideration concerning the subjects of orders in the statements and timing of their execution. Conclusion: From the obtained knowledge, we can define the information structure used to describe the <b>precautionary</b> <b>statement.</b> It should contain information such as the actions described in the statement, the flag to express an order or interdiction, the subject to be ordered, and the timing.
