5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly <b>political</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw {{the emergence of a new}} generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} unanticipated incentives and related unintended consequences of monocular accounting as practiced {{in the context of}} the European Union's stability and growth pact. Specifically, the Maastricht treaty establishes criteria and rules to ensure budgetary discipline by regulating public debt without taking into account corresponding public assets. In a comparative empirical study of two <b>political</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the Maastricht treaty we find that the latter imposes an ambivalent incentive structure, which produces unintended consequences in cases of rule-following as well as in cases of rule-evasion. In effect, monocular accounting fosters privatization and a reduction in public engagement in the case of rule-following as well as creative accounting practices and changes of public policy goals in the case of rule-evasion...|$|R

40|$|In {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, a wave of anti-Christian {{violence}} broke out in Ottoman Syria. Prevailing interpretations tie this social turmoil to the region’s sudden integration into the modern world economy, further aggravated by state reforms that upset long-standing political hierarchies. This paper argues that the origins of these disturbances lay not in the penetration of the modern world economy but in the extended political crisis that shook the Ottoman Empire during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Sectarian tensions therefore need to be seen, at their root, as <b>political</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the slow disintegration of the early-modern political order. In its timing and causes, this Ottoman experience helps to highlight a broader 2 ̆ 2 sectarian turn 2 ̆ 2 that overtook many other parts of Eurasia in the same period...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} to mid 2000s, the [...] "rolinga" [...] urban tribe started to lose {{popularity}} at {{the advent of the}} cumbia villera genre and the subculture associated with it.

The <b>political</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the República Cromañón nightclub fire included increased safety controls at nightclubs in Buenos Aires, which made the concerts of small bands very expensive.

40|$|The {{topic of}} welfare can start a doozy of a debate. The federal government's role in {{providing}} assistance to the needy is a complex and sensitive issue. Why can't our society seem {{to solve the problem}} of poverty? This thesis follows a historiographical approach to analyze poverty through two lenses, one social and the other political, because both social understandings of poverty and the <b>political</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> poverty have changed over time. Using popular (non-scholarly) literature, this work moves through the history of poverty, then into the era of Clinton welfare reform and beyond. The argument of the thesis is that societal views on the causes of poverty have been consistently reductionist and thus, government solutions have been insufficient. The work concludes with possible government solutions and possible courses of action for the reader to take to work for a sustainable end to poverty. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{documents the}} existence of strategic <b>political</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> public expenditure between rival jurisdictions. These interactions can potentially create a downward expenditure spiral (‘race to the bottom’) or a rising expenditure spiral (‘race to the top’). However, {{in the course of}} identifying {{the existence of}} such interactions and ascertaining their underlying triggers, the empirical evidence has produced markedly heterogeneous findings. Most of this heterogeneity {{can be traced back to}} study design and institutional differences. This paper contributes to the literature by applying meta-regression analysis to quantify the magnitude of strategic inter-jurisdictional expenditure interactions, controlling for study and institutional characteristics. We find several robust results beyond confirming that jurisdictions do engage in strategic expenditure interactions, namely that strategic interactions: (i) are weakening over time, (ii) are stronger among municipalities than among higher levels of government, and (iii) appear to be more influenced from tax competition than yardstick competition, with capital controls and fiscal decentralization shaping the magnitude of fiscal interactions...|$|R

In ethnic and racial terms, America is growing rapidly more diverse. Yet attempts to extend racial threat hypotheses to today’s immigrants have generated inconsistent results. This paper develops the politicized places hypothesis, an alternative which focuses on how national and local conditions interact to construe immigrants as threatening.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the public debates about the {{communist}} past, as triggered by the final report on the communist dictatorship in Romania (the Tismăneanu report) and its presidential endorsement in December 2006. The paper employs narrative and discourse analysis <b>to</b> examine the <b>political</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the official condemnation of communism, {{as well as its}} reflection in several Romanian newspapers. The Tismăneanu report {{was meant to be a}} ‘redressive ritual’ that would provide closure to a traumatic past by retrospectively denouncing the meaning of communism, but instead it generated more public debates and political turmoil. This indicates that the contorted path taken by Romania to confront its communist past is not a finished process yet, but rather represents a dynamic field in which social actors are fighting over which events and actors in the past should be collectively remembered, and especially how they have to be represented in the collective memory of post-communist Romania.
