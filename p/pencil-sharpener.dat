The modern man will wave a cigarette instead of a stick; he will cut his pencil with a little screwing <b>pencil-sharpener</b> instead of a knife; and he will even boldly offer to be warmed by hot water pipes instead of a fire. I have my doubts about pencil-sharpeners even for sharpening pencils; and about hot water pipes even for heat. But {{when we think of}} all those other requirements that these institutions answered, there opens before us the whole horrible harlequinade of our civilization. We see as in a vision a world where a man tries to cut his throat with a pencil-sharpener; where a man must learn single-stick with a cigarette; where a man must try to toast muffins at electric lamps, and see red and golden castles in the surface of hot water pipes.|$|E

By this time, Emma and he had two children, Joan (1908-1972), who later married the Tarzan film actor James Pierce, and Hulbert (1909-1991). During this period, he had copious spare time and began reading pulp-fiction magazines. In 1929, he recalled thinking that ...if people were paid for writing rot such as I read in some of those magazines, that I could write stories just as rotten. As a matter of fact, although I had never written a story, I knew absolutely that I could write stories just as entertaining and probably a whole lot more so than any I chanced to read in those magazines.|$|E
