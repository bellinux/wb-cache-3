40|$|The Kennerdell Bridge {{is located}} within the Allegheny River National Wild and Scenic River Corridor, {{approximately}} 50 miles north of Pittsburgh. The former bridge was identified as being in fair-to-poor condition, with the original main truss spans exhibiting the most serious deterioration. Several bridge replacement options were developed during informal consultation with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) due to the known occurrence of two federally endangered freshwater mussel (Unionidae) species, the clubshell (Pleurobema clava) and the northern riffleshell (Epioblasma torulosa rangiana). The selected option involved {{the replacement of the}} former bridge, with the reuse of the existing river piers. Field surveys of the proposed project area identified a diverse mussel population, including the listed species, around the bridge. The results of the field survey triggered formal Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section (7) consultation with the USFWS, {{and the development of a}} biological assessment. The required assessment included a construction/demolition options evaluation, hydraulic and hydrologic analyses, and development and implementation of a mussel relocation program as one mitigation measure to ameliorate impacts to the species. Overall, 15, 737 mussels representing 17 species were recovered and relocated. A total of 529 federally endangered northern riffleshell (Epioblasma torulosa rangiana) and 41 clubshell (Pleurobema clava) mussels were relocated from the <b>primary</b> <b>impact</b> <b>area</b> of the Kennerdell Bridge construction site. A follow-up one-month monitoring of one relocation site indicated good health of the relocated mussels and mortality rates consistent with undisturbed mussel populations.

It is observed that impact angle has {{little effect on the}} shape of primary craters, except in the case of low angle impacts, where the resulting crater shape becomes less circular and more elliptical.The <b>primary</b> <b>impact</b> angle is much more influential on the morphology (shape) of secondary impacts. Experiments conducted from lunar craters suggests that the ejection angle is at its highest for the early-stage ejecta, that which is ejected from the <b>primary</b> <b>impact</b> at its earliest moments, and that the ejection angle decreases with time for the late-stage ejecta. For example, a <b>primary</b> <b>impact</b> that is vertical to the body surface may produce early-stage ejection angles of 60°-70°, and late-stage ejection angles that have decreases to nearly 30°.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSustainable highway {{infrastructure}} design {{requires a}} good balance between environment and cost. The available computer-based automated highway alignment optimization algorithms minimize the total highway alignment cost towards obtaining the optimized alignment. These are primarily single-objective optimization approaches with limited capability in considering various cost components and {{factors that may}} be dissimilar or conflicting in nature. In these approaches, the <b>impacted</b> <b>area</b> of environmentally preserved land is transformed to monetary value and included in the total highway alignment cost. Also, they have limited capability in yielding a set of alternatives with different levels of trade-off between the total highway alignment cost and <b>impacted</b> <b>area</b> of environmentally preserved land. This leads {{to the need for}} developing a model to estimate the <b>impacted</b> <b>area</b> of environmentally preserved land in terms of non-monetary values and use concurrently with total highway alignment cost providing a perspective comparison of highway alignment alternatives. A multiobjective analysis is presented in this paper to consider the <b>impacted</b> <b>area</b> of environmentally preserved land information expressed in non-monetary unit and total highway alignment cost expressed in monetary unit. In this analysis, a genetic algorithm (GA) based multiobjective optimization technique is adopted. The paper describes a special algorithm developed to estimate the <b>impacted</b> <b>area</b> of environmentally preserved land from a Geographic Information System (GIS) based study area map and simultaneous minimization of <b>impacted</b> <b>area</b> of environmentally preserved land and highway alignment cost. A Pareto-optimal front is used to graphically represent the trade-off values of highway alignment cost and <b>impacted</b> <b>area</b> of environmentally preserved land.

The <b>impact</b> <b>areas</b> of Fort Greely, Alaska, are located on lands withdrawn from the public domain under the Military Lands Withdrawal Act (PL 106 - 65). The Army has pledged to implement a program to identify possible munitions contamination and evaluate the potential for surface water and groundwater contamination. Because of the large size (85, 042 acres) of the <b>impact</b> <b>areas,</b> characterization of the contamination levels will be difficult. We have begun a multiphase sampling program at one <b>impact</b> <b>area</b> by first sampling locations {{that are likely to}} be contaminated and to identify locations that have the greatest potential to contaminate adjacent surface and groundwater. Based on a review of records at the Fort Greely Range Control and consultation with the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), we chose to sample the Washington <b>Impact</b> <b>Area.</b> We focused our sampling on surface soils and collected both composite (multi-increment) and discrete samples at locations of known firing events and from areas on the range that had evidence of range use.
