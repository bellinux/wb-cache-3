This type of behaviour is difficult to assess and its analysis has not always conclusive results. For evaluating such behaviour the data available are compared with theoretical values obtained by using a competitive or a collusive model. When different competitive or collusive models are considered, for the simplicity of calculations the economists use the symmetry assumption of costs and quantities produced / sold. This assumption has the disadvantage that the theoretical values obtained may deviate significantly from actual values (the real values on the market), which can sometimes lead to ambiguous results.

Chapter 1 reviewed the current measures, evaluated their usefulness and highlighted {{the need for an}} accessible psychometric measure. Chapter 2 described the development of the measure highlighting the difficulties involved in assessing such an elusive entity, presenting findings from a small sample of men in custody in the UK. In order to further validate the measure data was collected on other groups (men serving their sentence in the community in Texas, prisoners in less secure conditions in the UK described in Chapter 4 and students, Chapter 6) evoking discussion on the similarities and differences in sexual interest of such groups.

It is a highly interdisciplinary topic. As a term, swarming is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term flocking or 'murmuration' are usually used to refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, herding to refer to swarm behaviour in quadrupeds, shoaling or schooling to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. Phytoplankton also gather in huge swarms called blooms, although these organisms are algae and are not self-propelled the way animals are.

40|$|I give an {{overview}} of the rich phenomenology of dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs) and Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in cataclysmic variable stars (CVs). The favoured interpretation of these rapid brightness modulations (3 - > 1000 s time scales) is that they are magnetic in nature - magnetically channelled accretion from the inner accretion disc for DNOs and possible magnetically excited travelling waves in the disc for QPOs. There is increasing evidence for the magnetic aspects, which extend to lower field the well known properties of strong field (polars) and intermediate strength field (intermediate polars) CVs. The result is that almost all CVs show the presence of magnetic fields on their white dwarf primaries - though for many the intrinsic field may be locally enhanced by the accretion process itself.

40|$|Binge {{drinking}} is an increasingly recognized problem within the UK. We {{have studied the}} relationship of binge drinking to cognitive and emotional functioning in young adults, and have found evidence for increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning. Since in human studies {{it is difficult to}} understand whether such behavioural changes pre-date or are a consequence of binge drinking, we have also studied <b>parallel</b> <b>behaviours</b> in a rodent model, in which rats are exposed to intermittent episodes of alcohol consumption and withdrawal. In this model, and in parallel with our findings in human binge drinkers, and alcoholic patients who have undergone multiple episodes of detoxification, we have found evidence for impairments in aversive conditioning as well as increased impulsivity. These behavioural changes are accompanied by facilitated excitatory neurotransmission and reduced plasticity (long-term potentiation (LTP)) in amygdala and hippocampus. The impaired LTP is accompanied by both impaired associative learning and inappropriate generalization of previously learned associations to irrelevant stimuli. We propose that repeated episodes of withdrawal from alcohol induce aberrant neuronal plasticity that results in altered cognitive and emotional competences...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Treatments {{and risk}} {{assessments}} {{determined by the}} offence <b>paralleling</b> <b>behaviour</b> (OPB) framework appear {{to have found a}} place in practice well ahead of empirical support and conceptual clarity. Although the framework is intuitively appealing its inappropriate use may have profound negative implications for patients. Incapacitation and unnecessary treatments may be demanded when observed behaviours are interpreted as evidence of persistent pathology related to previous patterns of criminal offending. Conversely, behaviours occurring within institutions that are not topographically similar but that fall within the same response class and do represent the continuation of problematic patterns of behaviour may be ignored if observers are not sensitive to the possibility that problem behaviours, albeit muted, may persist within institutions. Methods. This paper presents a study examining the similarity of personality disordered patients' violent index acts with their aggressive behaviour during hospitalization. Results. Results revealed evidence of cross situational similarity for some but not all aggressive behaviours. Conclusion. These results provide support for the OPB framework. However, the lack of similarity on a significant number of incidents indicates a need for thorough, structured analysis to determine whether an aggressive behaviour observed in an institution parallels violent acts preceding incarceration...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{risk for}} future {{violence}} in incarcerated offenders {{is a complex}} task, one which members of parole boards routinely undertake when they consider the suitability of an offender for release. Among the factors shown to influence parole board decision making is institutional aggression. However, several factors complicate the use of institutional aggression {{as a proxy for}} violent behavior following release. This includes environmental influences that may promote or suppress aggression during incarceration, and the process of adaptation to imprisonment that is characteristic of those who are imprisoned for extended periods. Furthermore, the extant research exploring the link between institutional aggression and post-release recidivism has produced varied results. This literature review examines the factors shown to impact on parole release decisions, how the decision-making process has evolved over time, and the use of violence risk assessment approaches to this task. The link between aggressive behavior in custody and aggression within the community is explored, along with the implications this holds for parole decision making and violence risk assessment in incarcerated offenders. The emergent Offence <b>Paralleling</b> <b>Behaviour</b> framework is introduced here as a method that may support the risk assessment process and guide the identification and monitoring of relevant violence risk-related behavior in custody...|$|R

40|$|Co-morbid {{substance}} dependence {{is common}} in patients of secure psychiatric services. Identifying opportunities for intervention, monitoring progress in treatment and assessing risk of relapse are compromised by this group's limited access to illicit substances. This research investigated {{the validity of the}} substance use <b>paralleling</b> <b>behaviour</b> (SUPB) framework, which was developed to assist staff in identifying behaviours indicative of substance dependence in controlled environments. Thirty-one patients admitted to the acute units of a secure forensic psychiatric hospital were interviewed and assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scales, the structured clinical interview for DSM disorders substance use disorders module, and an original questionnaire measuring motivations for drug use and behaviours indicative of substance dependence in a controlled setting (SUPBs). Results showed that patients with a history of substance dependence preceding admission engaged in more SUPBs during hospitalisation than patients without a history of substance dependence. Severity of psychiatric illness was unrelated to the frequency of requests for Pro re nata (PRN) medication and SUPBs. These results provide preliminary support for the SUPB framework and suggest that these behaviours might usefully be considered by staff of secure psychiatric hospitals when planning treatment, measuring progress and ascertaining risk of relapse. Opportunities for clinical application and future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{computation}} {{of covariance}} and correlation matrices {{are critical to}} many data mining applications and processes. Unfortunately the classical covariance and correlation matrices {{are very sensitive to}} outliers. Robust methods, such as QC and the Maronna method, have been proposed. However, existing algorithms for QC only give acceptable performance when the dimensionality of the matrix is in the hundreds; and the Maronna method is rarely used in practice because of its high computational cost. In this paper, we develop parallel algorithms for both QC and the Maronna method. We evaluate these parallel algorithms using a real data set of the gene expression of over 6, 000 genes, giving rise to a matrix of over 18 million entries. In our experimental evaluation, we explore scalability in dimensionality and in the number of processors. We also compare the <b>parallel</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the two methods. After thorough experimentation, we conclude that for many data mining applications, both QC and Maronna are viable options. Less robust, but faster, QC is the recommended choice for small parallel platforms.

40|$|The {{general area}} of developing, {{applying}} and studying new and parallel models of computation {{is motivated by}} a need to overcome the limits of current Von Neumann based architectures. A key area of research in understanding how new technology {{can be applied to}} Al problem solving is through using logic languages. Logic programming languages provide a procedural interpretation for sentences of first order logic, mainly using a class of sentence called Horn clauses. Horn clauses are open {{to a wide variety of}} parallel evaluation models, giving possible speed-ups and alternative parallel models of execution. The research in this thesis is concerned with investigating one class of parallel logic language known as Committed Choice Non-Deterministic languages. The investigation considers the inherent <b>parallel</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Al programs implemented in the CCND languages and the effect of various alternatives open to language implementors and designers. This is achieved by considering how various Al programming techniques map to alternative language designs and the behaviour of these Al programs on alternative implementations of these languages. The aim of this work is to investigate how Al programming techniques are affected (qualitatively and quantitatively) by particular language features. The qualitative evaluation is a consideration of how Al programs can be mapped to the various CCND languages. The applications considered are general search algorithms (which focuses on the committed choice nature of the languages); chart parsing (which focuses on the differences between safe and unsafe languages); and meta-level inference (which focuses on the difference between deep and flat languages). The quantitative evaluation considers the inherent <b>parallel</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the resulting programs and the effect of possible implementation alternatives on this inherent behaviour. To carry out this quantitative evaluation we have implemented a system which improves on the current interpreter based evaluation systems.

40|$|PurposeA clear {{understanding}} of an offender's criminal behaviour {{is a prerequisite for}} determining suitable treatment. In the literature, several specific frameworks or therapeutic approaches that aim to explicate criminal behaviour can be distinguished (e. g., cognitive analytic therapy, offence <b>paralleling</b> <b>behaviour</b> paradigm), but Schema Therapy (ST) is becoming an increasingly popular paradigm. According to forensic ST's theoretical framework, criminal and violent behaviour can be explained by an unfolding sequence of schema modes, or moment-to-moment states that represent emotions, cognitions, and behaviour. In this study, we examine the validity of this theory and the relationship between schema modes, psychopathy, and institutional violence. MethodsSchema modes were assessed retrospectively from descriptions of patients' crimes in a sample of 95 hospitalized cluster B personality disordered offenders. Psychopathy was rated with the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised and institutional transgressions were coded from daily hospital reports. ResultsOur findings show that criminal behaviour is often preceded by schema modes that refer to feelings of vulnerability and abandonment, loneliness, and states of intoxication. Criminal behaviour itself is characterized by schema modes that refer to states of impulsivity, anger, and the use of overcompensatory strategies involving threats, intimidation, and aggression. Schema modes involving bullying and manipulation were positively correlated with the interpersonal facet of psychopathy; the vulnerable child mode was negatively correlated with the affective facet of psychopathy. The schema modes in this study moderately predicted later institutional transgressions. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the schema mode concept is of explanatory value in understanding criminal and violent behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Offence <b>paralleling</b> <b>behaviour</b> (OPB) is a {{relatively}} new concept that emphasizes the assessment and modification of behavioural patterns that parallel criminal offending. Extant empirical research into OPB has typically focussed on the similarity between aggressive behaviours observed in custody and violent index offences perpetrated in the community; the results of these studies have been inconsistent, with the degree of similarity varying within subjects and across studies; (Daffern, Howells, Stacey, Hogue, & Mooney, 2008; Daffern, Howells, Mannion, & Tonkin, 2009). The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the level of similarity between OPB predictions and actual in-patient aggressive behaviours. Method This prospective pilot study used a novel practice algorithm (Jones, 2010 a) to develop a reference formulation from which OPBs and Pro-social alternate behaviours (PABs), the pro-social variants of OPBs, were predicted. Participants were five mentally disordered offenders resident in a UK medium secure psychiatric unit. Following generation of a reference formulation and OPB and PAB predictions the participants were monitored for 6 months. The degree of similarity between predicted and actual OPBs and PABs was calculated using Jaccard's coefficient. Results Results indicated considerable similarity between matched (pairing predictions and their corresponding actual behaviours) OPBs, which were also more similar than random pairs (pairing randomly selected predictions and aggressive behaviours). Conclusion This study revealed the existence of OPB in mentally disordered offenders and has provided the first test of a novel practice algorithm, revealing its potential to guide OPB formulations...|$|R
