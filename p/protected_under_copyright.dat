500|$|Also in the 1970s, Professor Ralph Anspach, who {{had himself}} {{published}} a board game intended {{to illustrate the}} principles of both monopolies and trust busting, fought Parker Brothers and its then parent company, General Mills, over the copyright and trademarks of the Monopoly board game. Through the research of Anspach and others, much of {{the early history of}} the game was [...] "rediscovered" [...] and entered into official United States court records. Because of the lengthy court process, including appeals, the legal status of Parker Brothers' copyright and trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985. The game's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers, as do its specific design elements; other elements of the game are still <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> law. At the conclusion of the court case, the game's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger Monopoly brand, licensed by Parker Brothers' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day. Despite the [...] "rediscovery" [...] of the board game's early history in the 1970s and 1980s, and several books and journal articles on the subject, Hasbro (Parker Brothers' current parent company) did not acknowledge any of the game's history before Charles Darrow on its official Monopoly website as recently as June 2012. Nor did Hasbro acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them, at least as recently as 2009.|$|E
50|$|To {{approach}} this issue, the court fully supported {{the claim that}} non-literal elements of software are <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright.</b> Software is considered a literary work {{for the purposes of}} copyright law, and non-literal elements of literary works are <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright.</b> As such, non-literal elements of software are also protected.|$|E

50|$|On 18 January 2012, the US Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Golan v. Holder that the {{copyright}} {{clause of the}} American Constitution does not prevent the US from meeting its treaty obligations towards copyright protection for foreign works. Following the ruling, notable films such as The Third Man and The 39 Steps were taken {{back out of the}} public domain and became fully <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> American <b>copyright</b> law. <b>Under</b> current US <b>copyright</b> law, The Third Man remains <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> until 1 January 2045.|$|R

50|$|Copyright {{protection}} {{is limited to}} the proper subject matter in Canada. Generally, every original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic work is <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> law. Ideas and facts are not copyrightable, subject to a few exceptions.|$|E
50|$|The {{photography}} of three-dimensional motifs always {{creates a}} photo (or sometimes also a photo work), which is <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> law. This {{derives from the}} creative process, as the photographer must select a location, lighting, etc...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{works of}} the U.S. government, works {{produced}} by contractors under government contracts are <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> U.S. <b>copyright</b> law. The holdership of the copyright depends on {{the terms of the}} contract and the type of work undertaken. Contract terms and conditions vary between agencies; contracts to NASA and the military may differ significantly from civilian agency contracts.|$|R
50|$|CleanFlicks and Huntsman preemptively {{filed suit}} against the DGA on August 29, naming 16 renowned {{directors}} as defendants in U.S. District Court for the district of Colorado, seeking the Court's determination as to whether their editing practices are <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> federal <b>copyright</b> law. Also, the preemptive filing ensured the impending legal battle would play out in Colorado courts rather than in California.|$|R

50|$|The first EU Directive on {{the legal}} {{protection}} of computer programs was Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991.

50|$|Apple Computer Inc v Mackintosh Computers Ltd 1990 2 S.C.R. 209, is a Supreme Court of Canada case on {{copyright}} law regarding the copyrightability of software.

5000|$|Another {{dispute is}} over the {{copyright}} status of The Bluebook. Open-source advocates claim that The Bluebook is not <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> {{because it is a}} critical piece of legal infrastructure. Lawyers who represent the Bluebook publishing consortium claim that the [...] "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" [...] are protected by copyright.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{functional}} {{nature of the}} mask geometry, the designs cannot be effectively <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> law (except perhaps as decorative art). Similarly, because individual lithographic mask works are not clearly protectable subject matter, they also cannot be effectively protected under patent law, although any processes implemented in the work may be patentable. So since the 1990s, national governments have been granting copyright-like exclusive rights conferring time-limited exclusivity to reproduction of a particular layout.|$|E
50|$|Amiga {{emulation}} {{software is}} legal by itself. However, {{a copy of}} a Kickstart ROM from a real Amiga is required for legal use, which is still <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> laws. The Workbench software and many other programs and games are also copyrighted and illegal to download, although {{there are a number of}} recognized sites which offer free legal downloads of Amiga games. The Amiga Forever emulation package offers legal copies of Kickstart, Workbench and various games.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, the land, {{registered}} in Davidson's mother' name, {{was sold to}} a developer. Land registry records {{made no mention of}} an artwork on the property. The Ontario government listed the land as <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act as a green space, while Shift is <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> Canadian <b>copyright</b> law as Serra is a landowner in Nova Scotia. The Toronto-based developer announced in 2010 planned to develop the property for housing. Shift and the surrounding land was designated a <b>protected</b> cultural landscape <b>under</b> the Ontario Heritage Act. In 2013 the Township of King voted to prepare a bylaw to designate Shift as <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the Ontario Heritage Act, preventing its destruction or alteration.|$|R
50|$|Google did not {{dispute that}} it {{displayed}} and distributed protected derivative {{works of the}} plaintiff's images. However, it argued {{that the use of}} the works in such thumbnails was <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the <b>copyright</b> doctrine of fair use. There are four statutory fair use factors in U.S. law: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.|$|R
5000|$|Open {{educational}} resources often involve {{issues relating}} to intellectual property rights. Traditional educational materials, such as textbooks, are <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> conventional <b>copyright</b> terms. However, alternative and more flexible licensing options have become available {{as a result of}} the work of Creative Commons, a non-profit organization that provides ready-made licensing agreements that are less restrictive than the [...] "all rights reserved" [...] terms of standard international copyright. These new options have become a [...] "critical infrastructure service for the OER movement." [...] Another license, typically used by developers of OER software, is the GNU General Public License from the free and open-source software (FOSS) community. Open licensing allows uses of the materials that would not be easily permitted <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> alone.|$|R
50|$|In October 2012, HFA became {{involved}} with copyright claims of musical works {{in the public domain}} on YouTube. As the designated YouTube administrator for thousands of music publishers, HFA uses the Content Management System (CMS) to review YouTube user disputes for the use of song compositions <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> law. Many arrangements of public domain works are under copyright, even if the original is not, and because the CMS tool is not perfect, some false disputes are created.|$|E
50|$|Eventually a {{copyright}} reform process was initiated in two phases: Phase one {{was started in}} 1988 and saw several amendments to the Copyright Act. Computer programs were included as works <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright,</b> the extent of moral rights was clarified, the provision for a compulsory license for the reproduction of musical works was removed, new licensing arrangements were established for orphan works {{in cases where the}} copyright owner could not be found, and rules were enacted on the formation of copyright collecting societies and their supervision by a reformed Copyright Board of Canada.|$|E
50|$|If the {{production}} {{is not a}} work for hire, many of the artists involved have copyrights once {{the production}} is complete. For example, the choreographer’s work is copyrighted. According to the U.S. Copyright Office, in order for choreography to be <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright,</b> {{it needs to be}} “fixed in a tangible medium of expression from which the work can be performed.” In a typical musical, this would make the choreographer’s work copyrighted. This means that his or her copyrighted dance routine cannot be used again without his or her permission and payment.|$|E
50|$|He {{also makes}} smaller {{appearances}} in The Wishing Horse of Oz and Yankee in Oz (in which Jinnicky is instrumental in freeing Ozma {{and the other}} residents of the Emerald City palace from the giant Badmannah). Because all of his appearances except The Silver Princess in Oz are <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> U.S. <b>copyright,</b> he does not figure in books by post-Thompson authors, with the notable exception of Lin Carter, whose estate was able to pay to use the character in his novel, The Tired Tailor of Oz (published posthumously in 2001).|$|R
50|$|The Copyright Act of 1790 did {{not provide}} a formal {{definition}} of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the Copyright Act of 1909 simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the <b>copyright</b> laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies.|$|R
50|$|Although Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.S. § 1(e) {{does not}} {{explicitly}} state that only those {{directly involved in}} the infringement can be liable, it been assumed that parties in{{directly involved in the}} infringement can still be held responsible for infringement. Therefore, the summary judgement for this case set the definition for cases involving secondary liability, for all works <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the <b>Copyright</b> Act of 1909. The court established a piece of the definition of contributory liability, in that a party associated with the secondary infringer may still be held to copyright litigation if it has sufficient knowledge of or involvement in the infringing act.|$|R
50|$|The {{right to}} {{copyright}} does not subsist forever. There is a {{duration of copyright}} to every work that is copyrightable, after which the public is free {{to use it in}} any way it pleases. The Act gives the durations for works <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright.</b> This part of the Copyright Act covers, individuals, bodies corporate, anonymous works audio visual work, sound recordings expressions of folklore and moral rights. The moral rights of authors under Section 6 of the Act exist in perpetuity while the others mentioned above are limited to a certain time frame.|$|E
5000|$|However, TV formats are not {{generally}} <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> law. As a result, copycat formats are sometimes created, which seek {{to duplicate the}} success of an original format without paying the person {{who came up with}} it. Format developers seek to prevent this by various means, including the use of trademarks or withholding distribution of other programs. Establishing [...] "Proof of Review" [...] and exposure to companies reviewing new TV formats is one important aspect of protection by the industry at the Television Writers Vault. The Format Recognition and Protection Association (FRAPA) aims to protect rights to formats and lobbies for legal protection.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2009, Ted Klaudt sent a [...] "Common Law Copyright Notice" [...] to the Associated Press {{and various}} state media outlets warning {{that use of}} his name, Ted Klaudt, without {{permission}} {{is a violation of}} a common-law copyright of a trade name or trademark and could result in a judgment against the offender of up to US$500,000. Laura Malone, associated general counsel for intellectual property at The Associated Press, noted that the names of individuals, including Ted Klaudt, cannot be <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> law. The resulting publicity made his case more famous than ever, a syndrome sometimes termed the [...] "Streisand effect".|$|E
50|$|Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc. {{was a case}} in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California {{regarding}} the copyrightability of digitized typefaces (computer fonts). The case is notable since typeface designs in general are not <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> United States <b>copyright</b> law, as determined in Eltra Corp. v. Ringer. Since that case, the United States Copyright Office has published policy decisions acknowledging the registration of computer programs that generate typefaces. In this case, {{the court held that}} Adobe's Utopia font was protectable <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> and Southern Software, Inc.'s Veracity font was substantially similar and infringing.|$|R
