50|$|The {{reaction}} of MeP and formaldehyde takes place over a fixed bed of catalyst. This catalyst, caesium oxide on silica, achieves good selectivity to MMA from MeP. The {{formation of a}} small amount of heavy, relatively involatile compounds poisons the catalyst. The coke is easily removed and catalyst activity and selectivity restored by controlled, in-situ regeneration. The reactor <b>product</b> <b>stream</b> is separated in a primary distillation so that a crude MMA <b>product</b> <b>stream,</b> free from water, MeP and formaldehyde, is produced. Unreacted MeP and water are recycled via the formaldehyde dehydration process. Pure MMA (>99.9%) is produced from the crude MMA in a series of vacuum distillations and separations. In all cases, the separated streams are returned to the process; there is only one (small) heavy ester purge stream. This is readily disposed of in a thermal oxidizer with heat recovered for use in the process.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{market and}} {{environmental}} forces require the rapid development of better and cheaper separation process solutions. Especially for multicomponent mixtures, {{there are several}} feasible separation process solutions differing significantly in cost and energy consumption in spite of carrying out the same overall process. Therefore a systematic method to identify and design optimal multicomponent separation sequences is needed instead of relying on the inventive activity of a few experienced engineers. Even for a commonly perceived 2 ̆ 2 mature 2 ̆ 2 technology such as distillation, until recently {{there has been an}} absence of systematic methods to (i) elucidate all possible separation configurations and to (ii) identify energy efficient candidates. This research aims to address these needs. ^ In this work, we focus on the continuous distillation of non-azeotropic mixtures into n distinct composition final <b>product</b> <b>streams.</b> We develop a computationally efficient and easy-to-use mathematical framework to generate all the basic distillation configurations that use exactly (n- 1) distillation columns to carry out this n-component separation. We extend the framework to generate all the additional distillation configurations with thermal coupling. We observe that the search space of distillation configurations grows very rapidly as the number of <b>product</b> <b>streams</b> increases. For instance, for a mixture to be separated into 4 <b>product</b> <b>streams,</b> we can choose from 18 basic configurations and 134 additional configurations with thermal coupling; while for a mixture to be separated into 8 <b>product</b> <b>streams,</b> we can choose from 15, 767, 207 basic configurations and 29, 006, 926, 681 additional configurations with thermal coupling.

To this effect, we develop a quick screening optimization tool that identifies configurations with low heat duties. The heat duty requirements are estimated using the Underwood equations.

30|$|Hence, scaled process models provide {{values of}} {{production}} and consumption of intermediate products for the sectors being modeled. Since the process models capture all input requirements, scaling up these models to represent total regional production provides information to calculate the RTCs for sectors modeled {{in the region as}} described further in Sect.  2.1. 2. Additionally, scaling up these process models provides “supply” and “use” side physical flow information. As models are built, element and compound level data are collected about flows entering the production process, allowing us to trace the linkages to their respective production sectors. Each input is thus mapped either to its production sector, the “rest of the economy” or to raw materials. Likewise, <b>product</b> <b>streams</b> are mapped either to residuals or as saleable <b>product</b> <b>streams.</b> This mapping can be stored for automation in future, providing a major advantage for reproducibility and continuity of PIOTs.
