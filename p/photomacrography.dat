50|$|Both Waist-Level Finders {{are useful}} in {{situations}} which require use of a low angle, or for copy work, <b>photomacrography,</b> or astrophotography. The image is reversed left-to-right in the finder. The Waist-Level Finder FN has a collapsible barrel and a flip-up 4.6x magnifier, while the 6x model has a 6x magnified image, and an integral diopter adjustment.|$|E
50|$|Macro {{photography}} (or <b>photomacrography</b> or macrography, {{and sometimes}} macrophotography), is extreme close-up photography, usually of very small subjects and living organisms like insects, {{in which the}} size of the subject in the photograph is greater than life size (though macrophotography technically refers to the art of making very large photographs).By some definitions, a macro photograph is one in which {{the size of the}} subject on the negative or image sensor is life size or greater. However, in other uses it refers to a finished photograph of a subject at greater than life size.|$|E
50|$|Olympus {{made another}} {{significant}} advance with the OM-2 in 1973, featuring aperture-priority automatic exposure with the world's first off-the-film plane available-light metering and off-the-film (which Olympus {{referred to as}} 'OTF') flash metering systems. By metering light in real time off the film plane the OM-2 was able to adjust exposure if light levels changed during exposure. By eliminating flash metering via a built-in photocell on a flash unit the OTF system was able to meter more accurately, and also significantly simplify multi-flash shooting as {{it was no longer}} necessary to calculate and factor-in exposure for multiple light sources. This system was especially valuable in <b>photomacrography</b> (macrophotography) and photomicrography (microphotography).|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{technology}} became {{widespread in the}} 1970s, SLRs have become the main photographic instrument used by dedicated amateur photographers and professionals. Some photographers of static subjects (such as architecture, landscape, and some commercial subjects), however, prefer view cameras because of the capability to control perspective. With a triple-extension bellows 4" [...] × 5" [...] camera such as the Linhof SuperTechnika V, the photographer can correct certain distortions such as [...] "keystoning", where the image 'lines' converge (i.e., photographing a building by pointing a typical camera upward to include {{the top of the}} building). Perspective correction lenses are available in the 35 mm and medium formats to correct this distortion with film cameras, and it can also be corrected after the fact with photo software when using digital cameras. The photographer can also extend the bellows to its full length, tilt the front standard and perform <b>photomacrography</b> (commonly known as 'macro photography'), producing a sharp image with depth-of-field without stopping down the lens diaphram.|$|E
50|$|The BioCommunications Association Inc., in {{a survey}} {{commissioned}} in 2008 of individuals working in medical photography, found that most medical photographers are employed by university affiliated hospitals and research centers. Ten percent were freelancers working in specialty clinics such as dermatology, ophthalmology and plastic surgery. A few of these provided services to the medical-legal profession. Medical photographers photograph patients in clinics, wards and in operating rooms. They may also be called to photograph an autopsy and gross specimens in the pathology department. Specialized photography techniques using <b>photomacrography</b> and ultra-violet and fluorescence photography may also be used. The role of the medical photographer {{has changed over the}} years from being exclusively medical to incorporating more general photography of a commercial or editorial nature to support public relations and education. Video production is playing an increased role; medical photographers are often responsible for video conferencing from operating rooms and are involved in tele-medicine. Departments employing medical photographers tend to number five people or less. Some medical photographers specialize in areas such as ophthalmology and dermatology.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Field {{observations}} of surface hoar crystal formation onto the snow surface {{raised the question}} of the potential influence which the surface snow grains (i. e. the nucleating substrate) may play in the crystal habit of developing surface hoar. Observations made during three seasons in Mount Shasta, CA, USA showed an association of classic planar “feathery ” surface hoar with new snow, whereas, observed cup shaped striated surface hoar was associated with weathered snow surfaces. While detailed meteorological data was not available, parameters such as snow surface temperature and humidity likely play a role. <b>Photomacrography</b> was used to show both the surface hoar crystal and the substrate snow grains. These results encourage continued observation and further studies to better understand processes on and within the snowpack. This project continues to suggest that the snow substrate may have an influence on surface hoar morphology...|$|E
