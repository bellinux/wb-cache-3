Sb oxidation rate was determined using an isotopic sebacate (disodic salt of (1 - 10) 14 C-sebacic acid) infusion (100 mu Ci from the fourth to the eighth hour of the cold sebacate infusion). Blood samples were collected during and after sebacate infusion at intervals of 30 minutes and Sb serum concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Excreted radioactivity (mu Ci/min) was measured by bubbling the expired air into an apparatus containing 3 mEq hyamine to trap CO 2 from a 20 -L Douglas-bag. CO 2 production and O 2 consumption were measured before and at 4 and 8 hours after starting the infusion. Twenty-four hour nitrogen excretion with urine was obtained.

40|$|Abstract Background Food {{insecurity}} among Mexican-origin and Hispanic households is {{a critical}} nutritional health issue of national importance. At the same time, nutrition-related health conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, are increasing in Mexican-origin youth. Risk factors for obesity and type 2 diabetes are more common in Mexican-origin children and include increased intakes of energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods. This study assessed the relationship between children's experience of food insecurity and nutrient intake from food and beverages among Mexican-origin children (age 6 - 11 y) who resided in Texas border colonias. Methods Baseline data from 50 Mexican-origin children were collected in the home by trained promotora -researchers. All survey (demographics and nine-item child food security measure) and 24 -hour dietary recall data were collected in Spanish. Dietary data were collected in person on three occasions using a multiple-pass approach; nutrient intakes were calculated with NDS-R software. Separate multiple regression models were individually fitted for total energy, protein, dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, potassium, sodium, Vitamin C, and percentage {{of calories from fat}} and added sugars. Results Thirty-two children (64 %) reported low or very low food security. Few children met the recommendations for calcium, dietary fiber, and sodium; and none for potassium or vitamin D. Weekend intake was lower than weekday for calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and vitamin C; and higher for <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> from fat. Three-day average dietary intakes of total calories, protein, and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> from added sugars increased with declining food security status.

Measurements: Participants were queried on diet via 24 -hour recalls, food purchasing habits, their use of neighborhood resources and local travel patterns. Frequency and location of self-reported food purchasing and consumption were compared by race. Results: In 2014 and 2015, 49 White and 44 Black older women {{were enrolled in the}} study.

All treatments resulted in a low level of T-chol, LDL, VLDL, HDL, triglyceride and phospholipid compared to normal recommended upper values of 200, 40, 130, 65, 250 and 250 mg/dl, respectively. The different types of palm oil showed higher fecal fat excretion in comparison to soybean oil treatment. Results of this study indicated significant differences in blood serum lipid concentrations and in fecal fatty acid excretions due to alterations in dietary fats. However the alterations in total fecal fat and in fatty acid excretions were too small to account for the lower blood serum lipid values observed in study. ^ In the second study, ten healthy adult human subjects were fed a constant laboratory-controlled diet providing 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>calories</b> from fat; however, two-thirds of the fat (20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the total dietary fat) in each period for each subject was provided by one of the four test oils: palm oil, soybean oil plus palm olein oil (1 : 1), soybean oil plus palm stearin oil (1 : 1), soybean oil plus palm oil (1 : 1). The addition of soybean oil to the different types of palm oil did not show any significant increase in the mean blood cholesterol and lipoprotein levels of subjects. ^ In the third study, four different test oils were employed: palm oil, palm stearin oil, palm olein oil, and soybean oil to evaluate acceptability of fried chin chin. The three types of palm oil were shown by the evaluators to be more acceptable in flavor/odor and overall acceptability when compared to soybean oil. ...|$|R

Production of grain, the source <b>of</b> about 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>calories</b> in the Chinese diet, grew {{at an average}} rate <b>of</b> 2.7 <b>percent</b> a year between 1952 and 1979, while population growth averaged almost 2 percent a year. Total grain output per capita grew from 288 kilograms a year in 1952 to 319 kilograms in 1978, an increase <b>of</b> only 11 <b>percent</b> in 26 years. In 1984, however, a remarkably good harvest produced 396 kilograms of grain per capita, an increase <b>of</b> 24 <b>percent</b> in only 6 years. In 1985 grain output fell below the peak level of 1984, to 365 kilograms per person, and recovered only partially in 1986 to 369 kilograms per capita.|$|R
