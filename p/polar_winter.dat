25|$|These polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) form during winter, in {{the extreme}} cold. <b>Polar</b> <b>winters</b> are dark, {{consisting}} of 3 months without solar radiation (sunlight). The lack of sunlight contributes to a decrease in temperature and the polar vortex traps and chills air. Temperatures hover around or below −80°C. These low temperatures form cloud particles. There are three types of PSC clouds—nitric acid trihydrate clouds, slowly cooling water-ice clouds, and rapid cooling water-ice (nacerous) clouds—provide surfaces for chemical reactions whose products will, in the spring lead to ozone destruction.|$|R
500|$|Nansen {{called this}} first land [...] "Hvidtenland" [...] ("White Island"). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and looked about them. It was {{apparent}} {{that they were in}} an archipelago, but what they could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land. They could only continue south in the hopes of finding a geographical feature they could pinpoint with certainty. On 16 August Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder, marked on Payer's maps as on the western coast of Franz Josef Land. Nansen's objective was now to reach a hut and supplies that had been left by an earlier expedition at a location known as Eira Harbour, {{at the southern end of}} the islands. However, contrary winds and loose ice made further progress in the kayak hazardous, and on 28 August Nansen decided that, with another <b>polar</b> <b>winter</b> drawing near, they should stay where they were and await the following spring.|$|E
60|$|March 5th.-The {{wind had}} entirely ceased, {{but it was}} evident that we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the {{influence}} of a powerful current. And now,--indeed, it would seem reasonable that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were taking-but we felt none. The countenance of Peters indicated nothing of this nature, although it wore at times an expression I could not fathom. The <b>polar</b> <b>winter</b> appeared to be coming on--but coming without its terrors. I felt a numbness of body and mind--a dreaminess of sensation but this was all.|$|E
60|$|OUR situation, {{as it now}} appeared, was {{scarcely}} less dreadful than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. We saw before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity among them. We might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but we must either perish in the long <b>polar</b> <b>winter</b> through cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief.|$|E

25|$|The Martian {{atmosphere}} is very thin and composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with some nitrogen and argon. The average surface pressure on Mars is 0.6-0.9 kPa, compared to about 101 kPa for Earth. This {{results in a}} much lower atmospheric thermal inertia, {{and as a consequence}} Mars is subject to strong thermal tides that can change total atmospheric pressure by up to 10%. The thin atmosphere also increases the variability of the planet's temperature. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of approximately −140°C (−220°F) during the <b>polar</b> <b>winters</b> to highs of up to 20°C (70°F) in summers.|$|R
6000|$|The third {{showed the}} {{pinnacle}} of an iceberg piercing a <b>polar</b> <b>winter</b> sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was [...] "the likeness of a kingly crown;" [...] what it diademed was [...] "the shape which shape had none." ...|$|E
60|$|WE {{now found}} {{ourselves}} in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean, in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no provision but the three turtles. The long <b>polar</b> <b>winter,</b> too, could not be considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course to be pursued. There were six or seven islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each other {{about five or six}} leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to venture. In coming from the northward in the Jane Guy we had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice-this, however little it maybe in accordance with the generally received notions respecting the Antarctic, was a fact--experience would not permit us to deny. To attempt, therefore, getting back would be folly--especially at so late a period of the season. Only one course seemed to be left open for hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there was at least a probability of discovering other lands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate.|$|E
60|$|And {{as there}} are many Hiram Yorkes in the world, it is well that the true poet, quiet {{externally}} though he may be, has often a truculent spirit under his placidity, and is full of shrewdness in his meekness, and can measure the whole stature of those who look down on him, and correctly ascertain the weight and value of the pursuits they disdain him for not having followed. It is happy that he can have his own bliss, his own society with his great friend and goddess Nature, quite independent of those who find little pleasure in him, and in whom he finds no pleasure at all. It is just that while the world and circumstances often turn a dark, cold side to him--and properly, too, because he first turns a dark, cold, careless side to them--he {{should be able to}} maintain a festal brightness and cherishing glow in his bosom, which makes all bright and genial for him; while strangers, perhaps, deem his existence a <b>Polar</b> <b>winter</b> never gladdened by a sun. The true poet is not one whit to be pitied, and he is apt to laugh in his sleeve when any misguided sympathizer whines over his wrongs. Even when utilitarians sit in judgment on him, and pronounce him and his art useless, he hears the sentence with such a hard derision, such a broad, deep, comprehensive, and merciless contempt of the unhappy Pharisees who pronounce it, that he is rather to be chidden than condoled with. These, however, are not Mr. Yorke's reflections, and it is with Mr. Yorke we have at present to do.|$|E

60|$|He {{had made}} Mrs. ------ {{aware of his}} {{presence}} in her room by a sensation of extreme cold, as if a wintry breeze were blowing over her; also by a rustling of the bed-curtains; and, at such times, she had a certain consciousness, as she says, {{that she was not}} ALONE. Through Mr. Home's agency, the ghost was enabled to explain himself, and declared that he was a monk, named Giannane, who died a very long time ago in Mrs. ------'s present bedchamber. He was a murderer, and had been in a restless and miserable state ever since his death, wandering up and down the house, but especially haunting his own death-chamber and a staircase that communicated with the chapel of the villa. All the interviews with this lost spirit were attended with a sensation of severe cold, which was felt by every one present. He made his communications by means of table-rapping, and by the movements of chairs and other articles, which often assumed an angry character. The poor old fellow {{does not seem to have}} known exactly what he wanted with Mrs. ------, but promised to refrain from disturbing her any more, on condition that she would pray that he might find some repose. He had previously declined having any masses said for his soul. Rest, rest, rest, appears to be the continual craving of unhappy spirits; they do not venture to ask for positive bliss: perhaps, in their utter weariness, would rather forego the trouble of active enjoyment, but pray only for rest. The cold atmosphere around this monk suggests new ideas as to the climate of Hades. If all the afore-mentioned twenty-seven monks had a similar one, the combined temperature must have been that of a <b>polar</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E

40|$|Saturn's largest moon Titan has a {{substantial}} nitrogen-methane atmosphere, with strong seasonal effects, including formation of <b>winter</b> <b>polar</b> vortices. Following Titan's 2009 northern spring equinox, peak solar heating {{moved to the}} northern hemisphere, initiating south-polar subsidence and <b>winter</b> <b>polar</b> vortex formation. Throughout 2010 - 2011, strengthening subsidence produced a mesospheric hot-spot and caused extreme enrichment of photochemically produced trace gases. However, in 2012 unexpected and rapid mesospheric cooling was observed. Here we show extreme trace gas enrichment within the polar vortex dramatically increases mesospheric long-wave radiative cooling efficiency, causing unusually cold temperatures 2 - 6 years post-equinox. The long time-frame to reach a stable vortex configuration results from the high infrared opacity of Titan's trace gases and the relatively long atmospheric radiative time constant. <b>Winter</b> <b>polar</b> hot-spots have been observed on other planets, but detection of post-equinox cooling is so far unique to Titan...|$|R

40|$|This {{reference}} publication presents selected {{results from}} space-time spectral analyses of 13 years of version 6 daily global ozone fields from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). One {{purpose is to}} illustrate more quantitatively the well-known richness of structure and variation in total ozone.
