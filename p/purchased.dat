5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later <b>purchased</b> by Philips), Heart Technologies (later <b>purchased</b> by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later <b>purchased</b> by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later <b>purchased</b> by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later <b>purchased</b> by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the decision-making process}} of customers focusing on how <b>purchase</b> intention is transformed into actual <b>purchase.</b> Specifically, we investigate 1) how <b>purchase</b> intention is formed, 2) how <b>purchase</b> intention drives action, and 3) what factors stand between <b>purchase</b> intention and action. After reviewing literature on <b>purchase</b> intention and action, and the product evaluation mechanisms employed by the customer, we propose the following hypotheses. First, product value has {{a positive impact on}} <b>purchase</b> intention (H 1). Second, <b>purchase</b> intention increases the probability of <b>purchase</b> (H 2) and third, the relationship between <b>purchase</b> intention and <b>purchase</b> will be moderated by uncertainty levels in product valuation (H 3). To validate, we conduct a survey regarding four types of products and collect data from 300 respondents. Regression and Probit analyses methods are used for validation. H 1 and H 2 are supported while H 3 is partially supported. This study challenges the conventional notion that customers with high <b>purchase</b> intentions will necessarily move to the <b>purchase</b> stage. To this end, we examine the relationship between <b>purchase</b> intention and <b>purchase,</b> and find that uncertainty in valuation moderates the relationship...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{interest}} in global <b>purchasing</b> has increased significantly in recent years, but {{the impact on}} product innovation is not well understood. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to empirically analyse the impact of global <b>purchasing</b> on product innovation sourced from suppliers, while taking into account how firms integrate their suppliers. Design/methodology/approach – The data used in this study are from the International <b>Purchasing</b> Survey, an international online survey on <b>purchasing</b> and supply management conducted in 2009. The data are analysed using factor and regression analyses. Findings – The paper shows that global <b>purchasing</b> has no direct impact on product innovation performance. However, supplier integration is more strongly associated with product innovation performance for firms <b>purchasing</b> globally compared to firms <b>purchasing</b> regionally. Practical implications – The implication is that when companies <b>purchase</b> globally, they must have a highly developed <b>purchasing</b> department in order to sustain a high level of innovation. For firms <b>purchasing</b> only regionally, the role of the <b>purchasing</b> department is diminished, at least in terms of contributing to innovation. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the discussion of potential advantages and disadvantages of global <b>purchasing.</b> First, the paper provides an explanation for the ambiguous results of previous research. Product innovation does not depend on whether firms are <b>purchasing</b> globally or not, it depends on how they <b>purchase.</b> This paper has showed that when <b>purchasing</b> globally, the role of the <b>purchasing</b> department becomes crucial for product innovation. The proficiency and activities of the <b>purchasing</b> department largely determine the success, in terms of supplier product innovation, of global <b>purchasing...</b>|$|R
