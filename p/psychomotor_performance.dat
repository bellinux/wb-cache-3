25|$|The drug {{causes a}} delay in the onset, and {{decrease}} in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound {{has been reported in}} some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performance</b> and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{effects of}} NREM and REM predominant sleep periods on sleepiness and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performances</b> measured with visual analog scales and the psychomotor vigilance task, respectively. After one week of stable sleep-wake rhythms, 18 healthy sleepers slept 3 hours of early sleep and 3 hours of late sleep, under polysomnographic control, spaced by {{two hours of}} sustained wakefulness between sleep periods in a within subjects split-night, sleep interruption protocol. Power spectra analysis was applied for sleep EEG recordings and sleep phase-relative power proportions were computed for six different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta and gamma). Both sleep periods presented with similar sleep duration and efficiency. As expected, phasic NREM and REM predominances were obtained for early and late sleep conditions, respectively. Albeit revealing additive effects of total sleep duration, our results showed a systematic discrepancy between <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performances</b> and sleepiness levels. In addition, sleepiness remained stable throughout sustained wakefulness during both conditions, whereas <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performances</b> even decreased after the second sleep period. Disregarding exchanges for frequency bands in NREM or stability in REM, correlations between outcome measures and EEG power proportions further evidenced directional divergence with respect to sleepiness and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performances,</b> respectively.

50|$|On {{the basis}} of {{structural}} homology it has been proposed that the product of RHD gene, the RhD protein, is a membrane transport protein of uncertain specificity (CO2 or NH3) and unknown physiological role. The three-dimensional structure of the related RHCG protein and biochemical analysis of the RhD protein complex indicates that the RhD protein {{is one of three}} subunits of an ammonia transporter. Three recent studies have reported a protective effect of the RhD-positive phenotype, especially RhD heterozygosity, against the negative effect of latent toxoplasmosis on <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performance</b> in infected subjects. RhD-negative compared to RhD-positive subjects without anamnestic titres of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies have shorter reaction times in tests of simple reaction times. And conversely, RhD-negative subjects with anamnestic titres (i.e. with latent toxoplasmosis) exhibited much longer reaction times than their RhD-positive counterparts. The published data suggested that only the protection of RhD-positive heterozygotes was long term in nature; the protection of RhD-positive homozygotes decreased with duration of the infection while the performance of RhD-negative homozygotes decreased immediately after the infection. The overall change in reaction times was always larger in the RhD-negative group than in the RhD-positive.|$|E

Our purpose was to study the cognitive and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performances</b> of orthopaedic trauma surgeons {{on the basis of}} the amount of sleep that they obtained. Methods: We prospectively studied the performances of thirty-two orthopaedic trauma surgeons (residents, fellows, and attending surgeons) over two four-week periods at an urban academic trauma center. Testing sessions used handheld computers to administer validated cognitive and psychomotor function tests. We conducted a multivariate analysis to examine the independent association between test performance and multiple covariates, including the amount of sleep the night before testing. Results: Our analysis demonstrated that orthopaedic surgeons who had slept four hours or less the night before the test had 1. 43 times the odds (95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 to 1. 95; p = 0. 03) of committing at least one error on an individual test compared with orthopaedic surgeons who had slept more than four hours the previous night. The Running Memory test, which assesses sustained attention, concentration, and working memory, was most sensitive to deterioration in performance in participants who had had four hours of sleep or less; when controlling for other covariates, the test demonstrated a 72 % increase in the odds of making at least one error (odds ratio, 1. 72 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 to 2. 90]; p = 0. 04).

5000|$|For a long time, {{the origin}} of RHD {{polymorphism}} was an evolutionary enigma. Before the advent of modern medicine, the carriers of the rarer allele (e.g. RhD-negative women in a population of RhD positives or RhD-positive men in a population of RhD negatives) were at a disadvantage as some of their children (RhD-positive children born to preimmunised RhD-negative mothers) were at {{a higher risk of}} fetal or newborn death or health impairment from hemolytic disease. It was suggested that higher tolerance of RhD-positive heterozygotes against Toxoplasma-induced impairment of reaction time [...] and Toxoplasma-induced increase of risk of traffic accident could counterbalance the disadvantage of the rarer allele and could be responsible both for the initial spread of the RhD allele among the RhD-negative population and for a stable RhD polymorphism in most human populations. It was also suggested that differences in the prevalence of Toxoplasma infection between geographical regions (0-95%) could also explain the striking variation in the frequency of RhD-negative alleles between populations. According to some parasitologists [...] {{it is possible that the}} better <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performance</b> of RhD-negative subjects in the Toxoplasma-free population could be the reason for spreading of the “d allele” (deletion) in the European population. In contrast to the situation in Africa and certain (but not all) regions of Asia, the abundance of wild cats (definitive hosts of Toxoplasma gondii) in Europe was very low before the advent of the domestic cat.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Our aim was {{to study}} the brain regions {{involved}} in a divided attention tracking task related to driving in occasional cannabis smokers. In addition we assessed the relationship between THC levels in whole blood and changes in brain activity, behavioural and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performances.</b> Methods: Twenty-one smokers participated to two independent cross-over fMRI experiments before and after smoking cannabis and a placebo. The paradigm {{was based on a}} visuo-motor tracking task, alternating active tracking blocks with passive tracking viewing and rest condition. Half of the active tracking conditions included randomly presented traffic lights as distractors. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals to determine the time-profiles of the major cannabinoids. Their levels during the fMRI experiments were interpolated from concentrations measured by GCMS/ MS just before and after brain imaging. Results: Behavioural data, such as the discard between target and cursor, the time of correct tracking and the reaction time during traffic lights appearance showed a statistical significant impairment of subject s skills due to THC intoxication. Highest THC blood concentrations were measured soon after smoking and ranged between 28. 8 and 167. 9 ng/ml. These concentrations reached values of a few ng/ml during the fMRI. fMRI results pointed out that under the effect of THC, high order visual areas (V 3 d) and Intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showed an higher activation compared to the control condition. The opposite comparison showed a decrease of activation during the THC condition in the anterior cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal areas. In these locations, the BOLD showed a negative correlation with the THC level. Conclusion: Acute cannabis smoking significantly impairs performances and brain activity during active tracking tasks, partly reorganizing the recruitment of brain areas of the attention network.

Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs at 50 - 100 % maximal voluntary contraction; MVC), recruitment curves (MEPs at 30 - 100 % maximal stimulator power output at 50 % MVC), cortical silent periods (CSP), and VA were measured in normoxia and after 1 (n = 12) or 3 (n = 10) h of hypoxia (Fi(O(2)) = 0. 12). One-hour hypoxia did not modify any parameters of corticospinal excitability but reduced slightly VA, probably due to the repetition of contractions 1 h apart (96 ± 4 % vs. 94 ± 4 %; P = 0. 03). Conversely, 3 -h hypoxia significantly increased 1) MEPs of the quadriceps muscles at all force levels (+ 26 ± 14 %, + 24 ± 12 %, and + 27 ± 17 % at 50, 75, and 100 % MVC, respectively; P = 0. 01) and stimulator power outputs (e. g., + 21 ± 14 % at 70 % maximal power), and 2) CSP at all force levels (+ 20 ± 18 %, + 18 ± 19 %, and + 14 ± 22 % at 50, 75, and 100 % MVC, respectively; P = 0. 02) and stimulator power outputs (e. g., + 9 ± 8 % at 70 % maximal power), but did not modify VA (98 ± 1 % vs. 97 ± 3 %; P = 0. 42).

Among patients with atypical neuroleptics, 7 patients (24 %) passed all test parameters without major failures. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel. ...|$|E
40|$|Eight healthy male volunteers {{participated in}} four {{experimental}} sessions {{in which they}} ingested {{one of the following}} drugs: ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg), cimetidine hydrochloride (400 mg), thioridazine hydrochloride (50 mg), placebo (lactose). Drugs were allocated to subjects and sessions in a double-blind fashion, according to a balanced cross-over design. The subjects' mood state and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performance</b> were assessed 1 and 3 h after drug taking. Mood state was measured using a battery of visual analogue scales, and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performance</b> using pencil-and-paper tests, critical flicker fusion frequency, wire-maze tracing and tapping. Ranitidine and cimetidine had no significant effect on subjectively rated alertness, whereas thioridazine caused a significant decrease in alertness. Ranitidine and cimetidine had no significant effect on performance on the pencil-and-paper tests (digit cancellation, digit symbol substitution, symbol copying), whereas thioridazine caused a significant decrement on these tests. Ranitidine and cimetidine had no significant effect on critical flicker fusion frequency, wire-maze tracing, and tapping rate. Thioridazine caused a significant impairment of <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performance</b> as evidenced by all the instrumental tests. It is concluded that, in contrast to thioridazine and similarly to cimetidine, ranitidine has little effect on subjectively rated alertness and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>performance</b> in healthy volunteers...|$|E
25|$|Like other opioid drugs, {{pethidine}} has {{the potential}} to cause physical dependence or addiction. It {{may be more likely to}} be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, hydromorphone, and placebo, pethidine was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired <b>psychomotor</b> and cognitive <b>performance</b> when administered to healthy volunteers. The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids—serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor—are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{characterization}} of partially sighted users 2 ̆ 7 performance within a graphical user interface environment. Participants, ranging in visual abilities from fully sighted (FSU) with no visual impairments to partially sighted (PSU) with limited visual abilities, participated in computer-based search and select tasks. It is shown that visual search strategies employed by both PSU and FSU within a graphical user interface can be described by Steinberg 2 ̆ 7 s (1969) Additive Factor Model. In addition, selection strategies, measured by mouse movement times, are linearly related and highly correlated to the Index of Difficulty as explained by Fitts 2 ̆ 7 Law. This is the first study of its kind that links the physiology of partial vision to behaviors and strategies exhibited during <b>psychomotor</b> task <b>performance.</b> These results can enable system interface designers to effectively design and accommodate {{the wide range of}} visual capabilities of today 2 ̆ 7 s growing population of computer users...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis {{is the second}} phase of a longitudinal study comparing the fatigue levels, workload, and performance of crewmembers working on the 3 -hrs on/ 9 -hrs off (3 / 9) and the 5 -hrs on/ 10 -hrs off (5 / 10) watchstanding schedules. Detailed results on the 5 / 10 are included elsewhere (Shattuck, Matsangas, & Powley, 2015). Crewmembers from the Reactor Department on the USS NIMITZ (N= 117, 24. 6 ± 3. 89 years old, 95 males, 109 enlisted, with 4. 25 ± 2. 65 years of active duty) participated in this study. Results show that the 3 / 9 is better than the 5 / 10 in terms of sleep quality, subjective levels of fatigue, mood, <b>psychomotor</b> vigilance <b>performance,</b> and acceptance by the Sailors. Although crewmembers on both the 5 / 10 and the 3 / 9 received, on average, approximately seven hours of sleep per day, the sleep hygiene and acceptance of the two schedules differ considerably. On the 3 / 9, significantly fewer Sailors reported not having enough time to sleep, as contrasted with the 5 / 10 (3 / 9 : 52 %; 5 / 10 : 88 %; p< 0. 001). There were differences between crewmembers on the two schedules in the expression of negative opinions about the adequacy of their sleep (3 / 9 : 30 %; 5 / 10 : 80 %) with over twice as many negative opinions for the 5 / 10 group. Daytime sleepiness and mood states deteriorated during the underway when using the 5 / 10, whereas daytime sleepiness and mood states of Sailors on the 3 / 9 did not change. Crewmembers on the 5 / 10 also had lower <b>psychomotor</b> vigilance <b>performance</b> than their counterparts on the 3 / 9 schedule (15 % longer reaction times and 59 % more 355 -millisecond lapses greater combined with false starts). Crewmembers on the 5 / 10 also had lower <b>psychomotor</b> vigilance <b>performance</b> than their counterparts on the 3 / 9 schedule (15 % longer reaction times and 59 % more 355 -millisecond lapses greater combined with false starts). Overall, these results may be explained by considering the timing of sleep and the periods of sustained wakefulness experienced on the 5 / 10. Over a 3 -day rotation cycle, a crewmember on the 5 / 10 watchstanding schedule sleeps at three distinctly different times on each subsequent day, experiences two periods of sustained wakefulness, and has one night with only a 4 -hour opportunity for sleep. In contrast, Sailors on the 3 / 9 have a fixed sleep schedule every day and they experience, at most, 16 - to 17 -hour periods of sustained wakefulness. Even though the 3 / 9 schedule, as a whole, is better than the 5 / 10, analysis showed that two 3 / 9 watch sections, those standing the night watches, were accepted less by the Sailors. We postulate that concerns about the implementation of the 3 / 9 schedule may be ameliorated by adjusting sunlight exposure, providing sleep hygiene training, and by considering an alternative distribution of duties between watch sections to allow protected sleep times for those on night watch duty.
