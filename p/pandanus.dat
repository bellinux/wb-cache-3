5|$|Planted karuka (<b>Pandanus</b> julianettii), {{cultivated}} species, {{planted by}} {{roughly half the}} rural population of Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Wild karuka (<b>Pandanus</b> brosimos), {{important}} {{food source}} in villages at higher altitudes in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Karuka (<b>Pandanus</b> spp.), {{native to}} Papua New Guinea. Both the planted and wild species are eaten raw, roasted or boiled, {{providing}} food security when other foods are less available.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela is occasionally {{found in}} swampy woodlands, casuarina woodlands and open forest, particularly those with <b>Pandanus</b> and paperbarks, {{as well as}} on coconut farms.|$|E
5|$|They live {{throughout}} rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, <b>Pandanus</b> thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, watercourses, and wetter {{areas of}} semi-arid regions, {{as well as}} parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland where the blue-faced honeyeater is found is most commonly composed of grasses such as Triodia, but sometimes it {{is made up of}} shrubs or small trees such as grevilleas, paperbarks, wattles, Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and <b>Pandanus</b> but were missing from pure stands of either plant.|$|E
5|$|The only fertile {{areas on}} Nauru {{are on the}} narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land {{surrounding}} Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, <b>pandanus</b> trees and indigenous hardwoods such as the tomano tree.|$|E
5|$|Ochetellus ants are omnivores {{that feed}} {{primarily}} on arthropods, but they show {{a preference for}} fluids and sweets when they enter human houses. Workers will prey on Ornithoptera richmondia eggs, fruit fly pupae, Plutella larvae and attack wasp nests. Honeydew, nectar, Pacific reef heron feces, carrion, <b>Pandanus</b> fruits, plants, seeds, sucrose, fats and grease will also be consumed. O. glaber is known to exploit the extrafloral nectaries on plants without providing protection.|$|E
5|$|Banksia dentata {{is one of}} four Banksia species {{collected}} by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of Banksia. Within the genus, it is classified in the series Salicinae, a group of species from Australia's eastern states. Genetic studies show it is a basal member (early offshoot) within the group. Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna, associated with <b>Pandanus</b> and Melaleuca. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|In Fakaofo, {{the storm}} surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was {{destroyed}} while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the coconut harvest and 50% of the livestock {{were killed by the}} cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the banana and <b>pandanus</b> harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage).|$|E
5|$|Several {{plants are}} {{immediately}} evident to the visitor. Banyan (Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris) {{is a remarkable}} tree with a buttressed trunk and pendulous aerial roots: {{it can be seen}} on the track to Clear Place and near Ned's Beach. <b>Pandanus</b> tree (<b>Pandanus</b> forsteri) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas like creek beds and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. There are ten species of orchid on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (Dendrobium macropus subsp. howeanum) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream flowers from August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red flowers of mountain rose (Metrosideros nervulosa and Metrosideros sclerocarpa), the massed small yellow flowers of corokia (Corokia carpodetoides), orange plump flowers of pumpkin tree (Negria rhabdothamnoides), and white spikes of Fitzgerald tree (Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii). The kava bush has large, aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. After heavy rain the endemic glowing mushrooms Mycena chlorophanos and Omphalotus nidiformis {{can be found in the}} palm forests.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and <b>Pandanus</b> utilis.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{of coconut}} crabs {{consists}} primarily of fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, <b>Pandanus</b> elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{generally}} forages in {{the branches}} and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock with the little friarbird (Philemon citreogularis). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), beetles such as bark beetles, chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus Xanthophaea), darkling beetles (genera Chalcopteroides and Homotrysis), leaf beetles (genus Paropsis), ladybirds of the genus Scymnus, weevils such as the pinhole borer (Platypus australis), {{and members of the}} genera Mandalotus, Polyphrades and Prypnus, as well as flies, moths, bees, ants and spiders. Birds have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of the screw palm <b>Pandanus</b> spiralis.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{probably}} breeds {{throughout its}} range. The breeding season is from June to January, {{with one or}} two broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy deep bowl of sticks and bits of bark in the fork of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. <b>Pandanus</b> palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (P. ruficeps), other honeyeaters including noisy (Philemon corniculatus), little and silver-crowned friarbirds (P. argenticeps), the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and artamids such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a paperbark (Melaleuca) which had been lined with messmate bark had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of paperbark. Two or rarely three eggs are laid, 22 × 32mm (1 × 1⅓ in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs, over a period of 16 or 17 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and <b>Pandanus</b> trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pandanus</b> spiralis, Screw palm., {{and perhaps}} other <b>Pandanus</b> spp.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Island's endemic plants {{include the}} trees Arenga listeri, <b>Pandanus</b> elatus and Dendrocnide peltata var. murrayana; the shrubs Abutilon listeri, Colubrina pedunculata, Grewia insularis and <b>Pandanus</b> christmatensis; the vines Hoya aldrichii and Zehneria alba; the herbs Asystasia alba, Dicliptera maclearii and Peperomia rossii; the grass Ischaemum nativitatis; the fern Asplenium listeri; and the orchids Brachypeza archytas, Flickingeria nativitatis, Phreatia listeri and Zeuxine exilis.|$|E
25|$|They {{spend the}} day in the {{protection}} of <b>Pandanus</b> roots or other structures, and feed at night.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} herbivorous. They eat {{fruits of the}} Manilkara genus and the <b>Pandanus</b> genus, {{including}} screw-pine and thatch screwpine.|$|E
25|$|The islanders {{cultivated}} native foods including coconut, <b>pandanus,</b> papaya, banana, arrowroot, taro, limes, breadfruit, and pumpkin. A {{wide variety}} of other trees and plants are also present on the islands.|$|E
25|$|Type IIa: Distylium-Schima dry forest {{occurs in}} cloudy upland areas with fine-textured soils. These forests contain many rare and endemic species, with <b>Pandanus</b> boninensis and Syzygium buxifolium as the {{predominant}} trees.|$|E
25|$|Type IIb: Raphiolepsis-Livistona dry {{forest is}} found in upland areas with few clouds and rocky soils. Rhaphiolepis integerrima is the {{dominant}} tree species, along with the fan palm Livistona chinensis var. bonensis, <b>Pandanus</b> boninensis and Ochrosia nakaiana.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} {{ancestor of}} the people of Funafuti is described as being from Samoa. The name of one of the islets Funafala means 'the <b>pandanus</b> of Funa', the name of a chief, after whom also the atoll has been named Funafuti.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{auxiliary}} languages with accompanying creation myths are attested {{elsewhere in}} the world. One notable case is the Damin ceremonial language of the Gulf of Carpentaria which {{is said to have}} been the creation of the ancestor Kalthad; another are the <b>pandanus</b> languages of the Medan region of Papua New Guinea.|$|E
25|$|On formal {{occasions}} women too wear a taovala, or {{more often}} a kiekie, a string skirt {{attached to a}} waistband. It is lighter and cooler than a mat. Kiekie are made from many different materials, from the traditional (<b>pandanus</b> leaves, as used in mats) to the innovative (unspooled magnetic tape from tape cassettes).|$|E
25|$|Many unique {{species of}} aquatic life {{including}} crabs, frogs and mudskippers, water birds such as terns, kingfishers, darters and cormorants, and {{animals such as}} otters and turtles live in and alongside the backwaters. Palm trees, <b>pandanus</b> shrubs, various leafy plants and bushes grow alongside the backwaters, providing a green hue to the surrounding landscape.|$|E
25|$|Food {{consists}} {{primarily of}} plants {{gathered in the}} forest, coconuts, which are frequently found on the beaches as flotsam, pigs, and, presumably, other wildlife (which apart from sea turtles is limited to some smaller birds and invertebrates). Wild honey {{is known to be}} collected and the Sentinelese use a kind of rake to pull down branches to gather fruit or nuts, such as sapodilla and <b>pandanus.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{plants and}} trees are still {{used in the}} Art of Tuvalu to make {{traditional}} artwork and handicraft. Tuvaluan women continue to make Te titi tao, which is a traditional skirt made of dried <b>pandanus</b> leaves that are dyed using Tongo (Rhizophora mucronata) and Nonu (Morinda citrifolia). The art of making a titi tao is passed down from Fafinematua (elder woman) to the Tamaliki Fafine (young girls) who are preparing for their first Fatele.|$|E
25|$|Green fodders {{are used}} widely for {{intensive}} milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or trimmings of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, <b>Pandanus,</b> peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and turnips. Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% {{of the standard}} feed mixture.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{the lagoon}} shore, {{about a quarter}} of Toke islet is planted in {{coconuts}} with a thick ground cover of Microsorum scolopendria. There is a small grove of Pisonia grandis, {{while the rest of the}} islet is covered with brushy woods of Heliotropium foertherianum, Portulaca oleracea, and <b>Pandanus</b> tectorius, fringed by Lepturus repens grasses, Laportea ruderalis shrubs, Boerhavia diffusa, B. tetrandra and other typical Marshallese species. There is also a tiny grove of Pisonia on Lojiron.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{buildings of}} Tuvalu used plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest, including timber from: Pouka, (Hernandia peltata); Ngia or Ingia bush, (Pemphis acidula); Miro, (Thespesia populnea); Tonga, (Rhizophora mucronata); Fau or Fo fafini, or woman's fibre tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus). and fibre from: coconut; Ferra, native fig (Ficus aspem); Fala, screw pine or <b>Pandanus.</b> The buildings were constructed without nails and were lashed and tied {{together with a}} plaited sennit rope that was handmade from dried coconut fibre.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{species of}} atoll forest include <b>Pandanus</b> tectorius, Lepturus repens, Cocos nucifera, Boerhavia repens, Pisonia grandis, Portulaca lutea, Triumfetta procumbens, Tournefortia argentea and Scaevola sericea, {{as well as}} areas of atoll scrub and vines. Much of the Pisonia forest noted in earlier surveys was devastated by a cyclone, perhaps Typhoon Mary in 1977. This is likely a {{naturally}} recurring event. A small number of coconut palms planted by visiting islanders survive. A 1952 survey found that they produced small nuts containing bitter milk.|$|E
25|$|There was an upsurge of hunting, fishing, harvesting, {{and other}} {{traditional}} practices which {{had fallen into}} disuse during colonisation. Men would go up the cliffs hunting black noddy, a local small bird, while women were collecting sea food in the reefs; everyone was fishing as much as possible. Nauruan women produced twine, made of coconut tree fiber, which was used for construction in lieu of nails, {{as well as for}} canoe making and fishing. From <b>pandanus</b> leaves, they made a strong fabric used for mats, baskets, shelter-pieces, and sails.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, {{the people}} of Kiribati mostly lived in villages with populations between 50 and 3,000 on the outer islands. Most houses are made of {{materials}} obtained from coconut and <b>pandanus</b> trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation has raised the population of South Tarawa to 50,182.|$|E
25|$|Causeways were {{constructed}} to link all villages {{on the main}} islet making transportation easy. The island resembles an incomplete “G” letter, with two reef passages; one is located in between Abatiku and Tabiang village at the north-western end. The other is between Biike and Kenna, the latter being the southernmost end of the main islet. The island is surrounded with an exposed reef at the windward side and submerged reef at the leeward side where Biike and Abatiku are situated. Most of the important food crops in Kiribati such as coconut, giant taro, <b>pandanus</b> and breadfruit grow well in Abemama.|$|E
25|$|Bánh đúc is a cake {{made from}} non-glutinous rice flour (although corn flour {{is also used}} in {{northern}} Vietnam). In the north it is typically garnished with savory ingredients such as ground pork, tôm chấy (grilled ground shrimp), fried onions, sesame seeds, salt, peanuts, lime juice, and soy sauce or fish sauce. In the south, it is served as a dessert, and {{takes the form of}} gelatinous blocks that are often colored green by the addition of <b>Pandanus</b> amaryllifolius leaf extract. It is cooked by boiling the ingredients and allowing them to cool, solidifying into a jelly-like sheetphoto that is then cut into blocks.|$|E
