40|$|Wood cribs {{are used}} {{extensively}} to stabilize openings in underground coal mines. This U. S. Bureau of Mines report describes {{the results of}} full-scale testing of several multitimbered wood crib configurations. Multitimbered configurations are wood cribs that are constructed with two or more timbers per layer. Nine different crib configurations were evaluated. Configuration parameters under study included the aspect ratio (height-to-width relationship) {{and the percentage of}} solid rr:aterial used in crib construction. Test results and generalized wood crib behavior are discussed and recommendations are made concerning crib constructions to maximize strength and stability. Crib performance is enhanced by reducing buckling effects by decreasing the aspect ratio and geometry considerations that increase the moment of inertia. A cost benefit analysis of multitimbered wood crib configurations is made. Generally, increasing the percentage of solid provides more resistance at less unit construction cost. A comparison of laboratory results and underground observations of several wood <b>pack</b> <b>wall</b> supports suggest in situ load capacity is less than that measured in laboratory testing. Reasons for the apparent decrease of in situ load-bearing capability include load rate effects, stiffness of reaction surfaces, and varying boundary conditions that alter the load transfer mechanics of the crib structure...|$|E
30|$|Technologies for roadways include {{support with}} {{strengthened}} bolting, meshing, and grout injection, a self-moving shield for reinforced support in mining-perturbed roadways, and building of <b>packing</b> <b>walls</b> for retaining gob-side roadways. Other key technologies include {{the development of}} materials capable of withstanding high loading for the <b>packing</b> <b>walls,</b> a modular shield for constructing the <b>packing</b> <b>walls,</b> and pre-fracturing of the working face roof for de-stressing. The initial and periodic caving intervals can be reduced by weakening the roof strength using advanced deep-hole pre-splitting blasting. An initiative for support roofing with high stiffness has been proposed, which emphasizes the “three high” bolting system, i.e., high strength, high pretension, and high stiffness of bolts (Yuan et al. 2011 a, b).|$|R

The roadway floor seriously heaved, and the abutment stress resulting from sudden breaking of a large area of overhanging roof in the working face was very high. Various measures were taken to resolve these issues. Roof stress was relieved by pre-splitting explosion with roof long boreholes and the “three high and one strong” support technique was used to control roadway stability.

40|$|The Impact and Crashworthiness Laboratory at MIT {{has formed}} a battery {{consortium}} to promote research concerning the crash characteristics of new lithium-ion battery technologies as used in automotive applications. Within {{a broad range of}} tests, there was a need to perform compression tests with a variable amount of confinement. A spring-loaded detainment device was designed which allows the battery to be confined in the axis perpendicular to compression without completely rigid walls. This provides a testing environment far more similar to the conditions of a real world crash situation. During an automobile crash event, the battery pack acts as a unit where each individual cell may experience a range of stresses from nearby cells or <b>pack</b> <b>walls.</b> An appropriate device was designed in Solidworks and used in the MIT ICL for testing with adjustable confinement during compression testing.

40|$|International audienceMass {{transfer}} and liquid hold-up in structured packing geometry are investigated using {{the volume of}} fluid method. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional co-current gas-liquid flow on structured packing with interfacial mass transfer are performed. The volume of fluid method is used to capture the gas-liquid interface motion. The mass transfer is computed by solving the concentration equation with an adapted modeling of the solubility (Haroun et al., 2010 b). The liquid hold-up and the mass transfer are studied as function of liquid flow rate and structured packing geometry. Results show how the liquid flow rate and the complex geometry affect the liquid film flow topology and the interfacial mass transfer. For a specified packing geometry, it is demonstrated that for low liquid flow rate, the liquid film remains uniform and follow closely {{the profile of the}} structured wall. For uniform liquid film flow along <b>packing</b> <b>wall,</b> it is found that the liquid hold-up is in good agreement with the model proposed by Billet and Schultes (1999) and Raynal and Royon-Lebeaud (2007). When increasing the liquid flow rate, the liquid film does not follow the shape of the structured wall anymore, a static hold- up (recirculation zone) form in the cavities and grows as the Reynolds number increases until covering most of the packing cavities. The present work gives the liquid hold-up evolution for each liquid film flow regime according to the Reynolds number and the dimensionless amplitude of the corrugation. Concerning the liquid side mass transfer, it is found that the liquid side mass transfer is well predicted by the Higbie (1935) theory provided that adequate velocity and length scales are considered for exposure time determination. The exposure time of fluid element at the interface corresponds to the ratio between the curvilinear distance between two periodic corrugation contact point and the interface velocity. An exposure time model is proposed taking into the account physical and geometric parameters...|$|R

40|$|Aerosols are a {{suspension}} of solid or liquid particles in gas. The size of particles ranges from about 0. 001 #mu#m to 100 #mu#m. The concentration of aerosol varies from 10 " 2 1 /cm" 3 to 10 " 9 1 /cm" 3. Before industrialisation aerosols came from natural sources, for example, salt particles from ocean spray or smog from volcanic eruption. But nowadays aerosols are also {{produced in the}} industry, such as automobiles, industrial combustion processes with coal, biomass or waste, and so on. These aerosols affect not only visibility and climate, but also our health {{and quality of the}} life. The European directive 1999 / 30 /EG (1999) sets stringent limits for sub-micron particle immission in the air until year 2010. The new TA-Luft and the 17. BImSchV have set stringent particle emission limits for waste incinerators in Germany. Therefore, aerosols or particles in flue gas from industrial combustion processes have to be separated before the flue gas emits into the air. The goal of this work is to develop a low-cost process to decrease sub-micron particles in flue gas from waste incinerator. This thesis reports the experimental investigations and theoretical study on separation of particles in flue gas from waste incinerator. A simple process has been developed in this work for separation of sub-micron particles in flue gas from waste incinerator. This process consists of a quench, a packed column trickled with circulation water, a Multiwir-packing trickled with water and a Kimre-droplet-separator. The FLUENT-simulation indicates in the Multiwir-packung three flows: kernel flow in canal (Z), half-spiral canal-comprehensive flow in a packing layer (N) and direction-changed flow in the near of <b>packing</b> <b>wall</b> (U). By the flows Z and N the particles are separated weakly. In contrast by the flow U the particles are separated considerably. The result of the simulation is very well consistent with the experiment result. Furthermore, the experimental curves of separation efficiency are approximately simulated. The calculation indicates that the temperature of flue gas plays an important role for the particle separation. (orig.)

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis {{is part of a}} broader ongoing effort aimed at validating at the laboratory scale the use of laponite suspensions for treating liquefiable soils, as an alternative to sodium pyro-phosphate treated bentonite suspensions. The specific objectives of the work were: (a) the characterization of laponite—a material new to the geotechnical community, (b) a study of the rheology of concentrated laponite-water suspensions, and (c) an investigation into differences in cyclic triaxial behavior observed between dry-mixed and permeated specimens. Through the work performed new insights were also gained into the microstructure of laponite suspensions. ^ Characterization of laponite relied on a number of techniques including TEM, TGA, XRD and sorption/desorption tests. Rheological measurements on the laponite-water suspensions were conducted using a Physica MCR 301 Rheometer. Falling head tests were performed to measure the hydraulic conductivity of Ottawa sand-laponite specimens. Microstructural observations on both the suspensions and the sand-laponite specimens were conducted employing cryo-SEM. ^ Based on rheological measurements, laponite appears to be a viable material for treating liquefiable soils: a 3 % suspension exhibits Newtonian behavior over a time window of a few hours, indicating that injection may be practical in the field; once delivered into the sand matrix, within a few hours, the suspension develops a gel structure with properties {{that in the case of}} bentonite have been associated with mitigation or elimination of liquefaction. ^ Cryo-SEM observations indicate that the gel microstructure is formed by elongated cells with the longest dimension over three orders of magnitude greater than the 25 – 50 nm size of the laponite particles. Increased ionic strength (10 − 4 M NaCl– 1 M NaCl), results in more densely <b>packed</b> <b>walls.</b> These observations are consistent with changes in the rheological behavior, and raise questions about existing phase diagrams for this material. ^ Hydraulic conductivity measurements and cryo-SEM observations highlight differences between sand-laponite specimens prepared through dry-mixing and permeation. In the first, the gel in the sand pores appears denser and more concentrated in proximity to the particle contacts, and higher values of k are measured. ...|$|R
