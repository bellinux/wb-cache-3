The two technologies supplement each other and their results meet well. There are mainly positive <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windward surface, negative <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof, the leeward surface and the side. Especially, negative pressure is higher in the leeward region of the building corner. Its effect induced by {{the shape of the}} complex-shape building is remarkable...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{characterize}} and compare pressure patterns in the skate boot of elite and recreational players during the forward crossover turn. In-skate pressure patterns of eight elite varsity level hockey players (mean +/- SD: height (m) = 1. 80 +/- 0. 07, weight (kg) = 87 +/- 0. 06) and eight recreational hockey players (mean +/- SD: height = 1. 76 (m) +/- 0. 06, weight (kg) = 82 +/- 0. 07) were measured using fifteen piezo-resistive sensors per foot during the forward crossover skating stride. Each participant performed three trials in both the clock-wise (CW) and counter clock-wise (CCW) directions. For each trial the pressure profiles of three strides were cut and averaged according to ability groups and turn directions. The results showed that the elite skaters performed the skill quicker than the recreational skaters (6. 85 (sec) +/- 0. 114 vs 7. 62 (sec) +/- 0. 125), respectively (p < 0. 01). Other significant differences (p < 0. 05) were found in peak <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plantar, medial and lateral surfaces between groups. No significant differences were found when turn directions were compared. These results show that recreational skaters differ from elite skaters by displaying higher peak <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plantar surface and lower peak <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral and medial surfaces. Also, <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plantar, medial and lateral surfaces appeared to be higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside foot when compared to <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside foot for both groups...|$|R

The {{front wall}} of the perforated caissons is usually perforated above a certain water level considering {{the stability of the}} structure, and the chamber of the perforated caisson is filled with rock. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> RANS and k-ε equations, the numerical method to simulate the interaction of the irregular wave with the perforated breakwaters is researched. Moreover, <b>the</b> wave <b>pressures</b> distribution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front perforated wall and the back wall are discussed through the numerical calculations, respectively. Then, the simplified formulas to compute <b>the</b> wave <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> different position of perforated caisson are obtained from experimental data by using the least-squares method...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting {{until the last minute}} to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E
