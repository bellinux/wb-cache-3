25|$|The {{ellipsoidal}} reflector spotlight (ERS), {{also known as}} profile (after its ability to project the silhouette or profile of anything put in the gate) (UK) and DÃ©coupe (French), is the most abundant instrument type currently in theatrical use. The flexibility of the ERS allows it to fulfill the bulk of lighting roles in the theater. They are sometimes known as a <b>profile</b> <b>spotlight</b> (in Europe) or by their brand names, especially the Source Four (a popular lantern from ETC) and 2 the Leko (short for Lekolite, from Strand lighting).|$|E

50|$|Ellipsoidal {{reflector}} spotlight (abbreviated to ERS, or colloquially ellipsoidal or ellipse) {{is the name}} for a type of stage lighting instrument, named for the ellipsoidal reflector used to collect and direct the light through a barrel that contains a lens or lens train. The optics of an ERS instrument are roughly {{similar to those of}} a 35 mm slide projector. There are many types of ERS that are designed for the myriad applications found in the entertainment industry. ERS instruments come in all shapes and sizes. Each particular model of ERS has its own set of characteristics. Generally, ERS instruments are the most varied and utilized type of stage lighting instrument. ERS may also be referred to as <b>Profile</b> <b>Spotlights</b> (especially in Europe) because the beam can be shaped to the profile of an object. Ellipsoidal reflectors are used for their strong, well-defined light and their versatility. Leko and Source Four are brand names which are often, but inaccurately, used to refer to any sort of ellipsoidal.|$|R

40|$|Mutations {{in either}} the {{mitochondrial}} or nuclear genomes can give rise to respiratory chain disease (RCD), a large class of devastating metabolic disorders. Their clinical management is challenging, in part because we lack facile and accurate biomarkers to aid in diagnosis and in the monitoring of disease progression. Here we introduce a sequential strategy that combines biochemical analysis of spent media from cell culture with analysis of patient plasma to identify disease biomarkers. First, we applied global metabolic <b>profiling</b> to <b>spotlight</b> 32 metabolites whose uptake or secretion kinetics were altered by chemical inhibition of the respiratory chain in cultured muscle. These metabolites span {{a wide range of}} pathways and include lactate and alanine, which are used clinically as biomarkers of RCD. We next measured the cell culture-defined metabolites in human plasma to discover that creatine is reproducibly elevated in two independent cohorts of RCD patients, exceeding lactate and alanine in magnitude of elevation and statistical significance. In cell culture extracellular creatine was inversely related to the intracellular phosphocreatine:creatine ratio suggesting that the elevation of plasma creatine in RCD patients signals a low energetic state of tissues using the phosphocreatine shuttle. Our study identifies plasma creatine as a potential biomarker of human mitochondrial dysfunction that could be clinically useful. More generally, we illustrate how spent media from cellular models of disease may provide a window into the biochemical derangements in human plasma, an approach that could, in principle, be extended to a range of complex diseases.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} 			with {{the results}} regarding the flow behavior of some non- Newtonian 			fluids under different circumstances. First of all, some concepts 			regarding Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, constitutive 			equations, equations of motion, and integral transforms have been 			discussed. Then the exact {{solutions for the}} velocity field and the 			shear stress corresponding to some flows with technical relevance 			have been established for second grade, Maxwell, and Oldroyd-B 			fluids with fractional derivatives model. 			In Chapter 2, the velocity field and the adequate shear stress, 			corresponding to the flow of a second grade fluid with fractional 			derivatives in an annular region, due to a constant/time-dependent 			shear stress, are determined {{by means of the}} Laplace and the finite 			Hankel transforms. The corresponding solutions for a second grade and 			Newtonian fluids, performing the same motion, are obtained from our 			general solutions. 			Chapter 3 deals with the motion of a Maxwell fluid with fractional 			derivatives, and we studied the flow starting from rest due to the 			sliding of the cylinder along its axis with a constant 			acceleration. The velocity and the adequate shear stress, obtained by 			means of the finite Hankel and Laplace transforms, are presented 			under series form in terms of the generalized G functions. The 			similar solutions for the ordinary Maxwell fluid, performing the 			same motion, are obtained as special cases of our general solution. 			Chapter 4 concerns with the unsteady flow of an incompressible 			Oldroyd-B fluid with fractional derivatives, induced by a constantly 			accelerating plate between two side walls perpendicular to the 			plate. The solutions have been studied using Fourier sine and Laplace 			transforms. The expressions for the velocity field and the shear 			stresses, written in terms of the generalized G and R functions, are 			presented as sum of the similar Newtonian solutions and the 			corresponding non-Newtonian contributions. Furthermore, the 			solutions for Maxwell fluid with fractional derivatives, ordinary 			Oldroyd-B, Maxwell and Newtonian fluids, performing the same motion, 			are also obtained as limiting cases of our general solutions. In the 			absence of the side walls, namely when the distance between the two 			walls tends to infinity, the solutions corresponding to the motion 			over an infinite constantly accelerating plate are recovered. 			Finally, the effect of the material parameters on the velocity 			<b>profile</b> is <b>spotlighted</b> by means of the graphical illustrations. 			Chapter 5 intends to establish exact and approximative expressions 			for dissipation, the power due to the shear stress at the wall and 			the boundary layer thickness corresponding to the unsteady motion of 			a second grade fluid, induced by an infinite plate subject to a 			shear stress. As a limiting case of our general solutions, the 			similar results for Newtonian fluids performing the same motion, are 			obtained. The results that have been here obtained are different of 			those corresponding to the Rayleigh- Stokes problem. A series 			solution for the velocity field is also determined. Its form, as it 			was to be expected, is identical to that resulting from the general 			solution by asymptotic approximations...|$|R
