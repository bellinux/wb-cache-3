60|$|She drew up the kaross over me, again <b>patted</b> <b>my</b> {{hand in her}} motherly {{fashion and}} departed, still smiling, after which I went to sleep again, so dreamlessly that I think there was some native {{soporific}} in that soup.|$|E

6000|$|... "O, I think I should <b>pat</b> <b>my</b> foot," [...] {{answered}} Kitty; and in {{fact the}} charming simpleton on shore, having perfected her attitude, was tapping the ground nervously with the toe of her adorable slipper.|$|R

60|$|The {{battered}} tin snuff-box {{was given}} to me before I had done speaking; the paternal hand <b>patted</b> <b>my</b> back more approvingly than ever; the feeble, husky voice grew glib and eloquent in my praise.

6000|$|He {{broke out}} with it. [...] "Mother, what's the reason I can't go with Benny, and Mr. Hingston, and the Little Flock?

6000|$|Bitter and rebellious of mood, uneasy and {{uncertain}} of purpose my talks with him resulted only in irritation and discord, but my mother, with an abiding faith in my powers, offered no objection.

Ten dollars. Major! As much as you earn yourself at that miserable bookkeeping!" ...|$|E
