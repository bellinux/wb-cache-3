40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} temperature of the polar lower stratosphere during spring is key to understanding ozone loss in the Arctic <b>polar</b> vortex. <b>Spring</b> ozone loss rates are directly tied to polar stratospheric temperatures by the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, and the conversion of chlorine species to reactive forms on these cloud particle surfaces. In this paper, we study those factors that control temperatures in the polar lower stratosphere. We use the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) /NCAR reanalysis data covering the last two decades to investigate how planetary wave driving of the stratosphere is connected to polar temperatures. In particular, we show that planetary waves forced in the troposphere in mid- to late winter (January-February) are principally responsible for the mean polar temperature during the March period. These planetary waves are forced by both thermal and orographic processes in the troposphere, and propagate into the stratosphere in the mid and high latitudes. Strong mid-winter planetary wave forcing leads to a warmer Arctic lower stratosphere in early spring, while weak mid-winter forcing leads to cooler Arctic temperatures...|$|R

Recent field and aerial measurements of the proxy BrO in the free troposphere suggest an even more pervasive global role for bromine.

This discrepancy effectively implies a ubiquitous tropospheric background level of ∼ 4 ppt Br_y of unknown origin. Here, we report that I^- efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of Br^- and Cl^- in aqueous nanodroplets exposed to ozone, the everpresent atmospheric oxidizer, under conditions resembling those encountered in marine aerosols. Br^- and Cl^-, which are rather unreactive toward O_ 3 and were previously deemed unlikely direct precursors of atmospheric halogens, are readily converted into IBr_ 2 ^- and ICl_ 2 ^- en route to Br_ 2 (g) and Cl_ 2 (g) in the presence of I^-.
