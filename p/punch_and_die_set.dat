However the failure mechanisms of the rapid prototyped tools are not clearly understood, thus making the prediction of tool life difficult. As a fundamental step for effective tool life estimation, the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the polymer composite tooling material were characterized. A finite element model of 90 degrees V-die bending process was developed, {{and the effects of}} process parameters on stress distribution in <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> were investigated through simulation.

40|$|The {{separation}} of the blank from a work-piece occurs in punching through crack propagation. To examine the eect of clearance between the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> the <b>die</b> on crack propagation, experiments were conducted using a modied Compact Tension Shear (CTS) specimen with double notch under mode-II loading. It was observed that when {{the gap between the}} notches was in-creased for clearance of 5 mm, the width of the shear band reduced. The reduction in the width of the shear band is an indication of the absence of secondary shear that ought to occur during punching. Finite element sim-ulations were also carried out to compare with experimental results. Only preliminary results are presented as the results were not conclusive. The process of punching for realizing meso-scale (0. 01 to 1 mm) metal devices is compared with chemical etching by making a miniature compliant gripper using both the processes as it was evident that punching will have an advantage over chemical etching if it is possible to realize features of high aspect ratio through punching. In order to demonstrate high aspect ratio in <b>punching,</b> <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> of hardened steel were made and holes of diameter 2. 5 mm with an aspect ratio upto two were successfully punched in aluminium sheets. An important observation of this work is that compressive strength of the punch material should be substantially more than the shear strength of the work-piece. i Acknowledgments I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to my guides Prof. G.

40|$|Metal forming {{applications}} are, {{by their}} very nature, taxing on the tools and machines used to achieve a finished component. Material degradation and wear is of critical importance in any such operation as a failing in the tool or machine {{has the potential to}} cause health hazards and/or significant monetary losses. The wear of material is due to the contact of two opposing surfaces and their subsequent motion relative to each other. It can take many forms some examples of which are: a two or three body abrasive type, a rolling fatigue type or an adhesion type. Much research has been done in the area of surface treatment for cutting and forming tools; with the aim of preventing premature failure of components in mechanical processes. Of particular interest are the PVD and CDV approaches to surface treatment, both of which have held prominent positions in this field for the last two decades. In the metal forming area research has ranged from production of low-friction coatings for sheet metal forming[1] to coatings designed for high hardness in metal cutting applications[2]. A large percentage of researchers aim to improve or optimise a coating; concentrating on performance in a particular area of interest (e. g. frictional performance) or for a particular application (e. g. milling tools). To achieve this extensive knowledge of the variables influencing coating quality is essential. The characteristics of the coating produced depend primarily on the materials selected, the deposition process, the substrate being coated and on post/pre treatment of the coatings. These areas can be further refined to produce a more comprehensive list of coating parameters. Optimisation of the coating must be guided by an analysis of these parameters; this analysis should influence material selection and also the selection of deposition parameters. To supplement practical experiments, computational techniques have been used extensively to increase the understanding of these coatings; both the material deposition and the material breakdown during operation. These investigations have ranged from improvement of the deposition processes[3] to modelling voids and inclusions in the coating. The complexity of coating technology is reflected in the diversity of studies {{to be found in the}} literature. The aim of this work is to review recent developments in PVD and CVD coatings with specific focus on those utilised to enhance the performance and working life of <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} combine {{through-hole}} punching with a surface patterning during microembossing would greatly enhance {{the production of}} a variety of microfluidic devices. In support of that goal, a series of theoretical simulations and physical tests were performed to investigate the effect of clearance, shear speed and temperature in creating through-holes. A better understanding of the effects of these parameters in through-hole punching has useful implications in the development of better tools for hot embossing. Theoretical simulations modeling the punch and die mechanics for various punch sizes and clearances were performed using ADINA finite element analysis (FEA) software; similar simulations were done for a straight shearing situation for comparison. A special straight-line <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>set</b> with a movable was then machined for use with an existing hot-embossing machine. Tests were done while varying the temperature of the sample, the clearance of the shear and the shear speed. From the finite element analysis, we gathered data about the shear stress distribution in the samples during the shearing process. The physical experiments gave us information about the peak stress for each test, allowing for some quantitative analysis. The parts were also assessed qualitatively under 10 x magnification and classified accordingly. Ultimately, we were able to see some signs of shear quality degradation with increased clearance, but the differences were less pronounced at small clearances (25 microns or less). by Stuart Graham Rossen.

40|$|The compactional {{behaviour}} of a {{range of}} materials has been investigated by using an instrumented, 25. 4 mm diameter <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>set</b> in conjunction with a Mayes Hydraulic Testing Machine. A CBM microcomputer with a multi-channel 3 D-ADC was employed to monitor applied force of up to 45 kN, the radially transmitted pressure to the die wall, die base reaction and punch displacement. Avicel and Sta-Rx compacts exhibited greater contact time, energy absorbtion and higher rate of radial pressure transmission to the die wall than was shown by Emdex, Emcompress and Paracetamol DC. It was deduced from the form of Heckel plots that time dependent bases Avicel and Sta-Rx underwent further densification when held under a constant stress. Densification of the mate ials were usually greater if a slower speed of compression was used. Time dependent strain movements of the formed compacts held under a constant stress within the die have been investigated. The elastic and viscoelastic recoveries observed on load release have also been studied. The effects of various parameters on these movements and the feasibilty of using an elastic recovery index to predict the quality of a material are discussed. Avicel and Sta-Rx exhibited an extended plastic flow when held under a constant stress. Poorly compressible materials such as magnesium stearate and paracetamol exhibited the least strain movements and the greatest elastic expansion. It was found that the elastic recovery indices of the compressible materials were always lower than those of poorly compressible powders. Viscoelastic behaviour of the compacts after ejection has been studied following the changes in depth of penetration of an indenter over a long period into the surface of the compacts. Creep compliance curves obtained from the above two techniques have been compared. Both tests enable important viscoelastic parameters of the materials to be determined. Viscoelastic properties deduced from indentation tests were brought 1 y similar to those obtained by compression within the die. Throughout the work all data were recorded, processed and presented using a microcomputer and disk storage.

Breakthroughs and innovations are needed merely to survive in manufacturing industry. Punching is the common process of using a cutting <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> in the manufacturing process. A variety of physical phenomena occur in the metal cutting process such as metal flow, friction between the material and tools, process heat and changes in the microstructure of the material.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper {{is focused on the}} optimal clearance design of micro-punching die by abductive network and SA method. Design/methodology/approach: The <b>punching</b> data (input) <b>and</b> wear size (output) were collected for a training database. In order to select proper clearance to evaluate the wear of die, the abductive network was used to establish an efficient relationship between input parameters and output result. This can help to predict wear size under any degree of clearance and hence to replace worn <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> at the right time. A simulated annealing (SA) optimization algorithm with a performance index is then applied to the neural network for searching the optimal clearance parameters, and obtains rather satisfactory result as compared with the corresponding experiment verification. Findings: This study aims to identify the relationship between clearance and service life of micro punches using the Neural Network, and to find relational data involving the service life of <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>punching</b> parameters in non-metal blanking processes. The result can be used to estimate optimal clearance between <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> for industrial applications. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the practical punching processes with different punching conditions were carried out for a set of training data. A trained model exhibited a relationship between service life and clearance of micro <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> through an abductive network system. The predicted value of wear by abductive network is very close to the actual experimental value, with an error of less than 8 %. This result satisfies the required standard for IC factory production. Originality/value: A good clearance design not only increases the quality of product manufactured, but also reduces product’s burr.
