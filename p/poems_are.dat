5|$|Names {{of three}} poets from the 11th century {{and some of}} their <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> available. Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler turned saint, is {{considered}} by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first Vachana poet, and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century, including Basavanna. Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his resentment of the caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are extant today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A dalit by birth, his six available <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a few of her <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> available.|$|E
5|$|While Yeats's early poetry drew {{heavily on}} Irish myth and folklore, his later work was engaged with more {{contemporary}} issues, and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His {{work can be}} divided into three general periods. The early <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as The Isle of Statues and The Wanderings of Oisin. His other early <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work and attempt to turn himself into a Landor-style social ironist.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Perl {{poetry is}} the {{practice}} of writing poems that can be compiled as legal Perl code, for example the piece known as Black Perl.

5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning. Many of these <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> anonymous, but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Becoming {{increasingly}} belligerent {{toward his}} father, Riley {{moved out of}} the family home and briefly had a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870. He was recruited as a Bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of Rushville, Indiana. The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter. He completed the study and opened a business in Greenfield creating and maintaining signs. His earliest known <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers.|$|E
50|$|Later when Wolfgang grew up, he {{purified}} {{his creation}} by destroying many <b>poems</b> that <b>were</b> irrelevant {{to that time}} period. In Wolfgang’s eyes, {{what was left of}} his <b>poems</b> <b>were</b> not of high quality. Therefore, what survived from his <b>poems</b> <b>were</b> mostly included in his letters to Aline Bussmann, Ruth Hager, Carl Albert Lange and Hugo Seiker. Those <b>poems</b> <b>were</b> not to be published, or at least that was the intention of Borchert. However, in 1960, his mother Hertha Borchert and the American Stanley Tschopp gathered around two hundred <b>poems</b> to <b>be</b> published but that did not happen until 1996 when Allein mit meinem Schattten und dem Mond , a compiled selection of Wolfgang Borchert’s <b>poems,</b> <b>was</b> published.|$|R

5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, typified by Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> shorter and reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models. He identified {{himself and his}} work as post-symbolist {{in the early part}} of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.|$|E

5|$|Lines of <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|Many of Riley's <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> {{filled with}} musical references. Riley had no musical education, {{and could not}} read sheet music, but learned from his father how to play guitar, and from a friend how to play violin. He {{performed}} in two different local bands, and became so proficient on the violin {{he was invited to}} play with a group of adult Freemasons at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being A Short'nin' Bread Song—Pieced Out.|$|E
5|$|The Lucy <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> {{a series}} of five poems {{composed}} by the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth (1770–1850) between 1798 and 1801. All but one were first published during 1800 in the second edition of Lyrical Ballads, a collaboration between Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge that was both Wordsworth's first major publication and a milestone in the early English Romantic movement. In the series, Wordsworth sought to write unaffected English verse infused with abstract ideals of beauty, nature, love, longing and death.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversation}} <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> a {{group of}} eight poems composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) between 1795 and 1807. Each details a particular life experience {{which led to the}} poet's examination of nature and the role of poetry. They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if there is a place for simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E
5|$|While Dickinson was a {{prolific}} private poet, {{fewer than a}} dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime. The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Dickinson's <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, {{it must be remembered}} that the <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E
