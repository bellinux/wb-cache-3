A <b>pebbling</b> move on a graph consists of taking two pebbles off one vertex and placing one on an adjacent vertex (the second removed pebble is discarded from play). π(G), the <b>pebbling</b> number of a graph G is the lowest natural number n that satisfies the following condition: Given any target or 'root' vertex in the graph and any initial configuration of n pebbles on the graph, it is possible, after a series of <b>pebbling</b> moves, to reach a new configuration in which the designated root vertex has one or more pebbles.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} rock {{fragment}} eccentricity on the deposition of airborne dust was examined in a wind tunnel. Eccentricity {{was defined as}} the ratio a/b, where a is the longest and b the intermediate axis of the rock fragments. The effect of eccentricity on the deposition of dust on the <b>pebbles,</b> on the deposition of dust between and underneath the <b>pebbles,</b> and on total dust deposition (<b>pebbles</b> + interpebble space) was measured separately, and this for different values of <b>pebble</b> size, <b>pebble</b> flattening, cover density and wind speed. The more <b>pebbles</b> are elongated, the larger dust deposition on them will be. This effect is more pronounced as <b>pebbles</b> become larger, as they become less flattened, and as wind speed increases, but no correlation is observed with cover density. It also holds that the more <b>pebbles</b> are elongated, the less dust settles between and underneath them. This effect is more pronounced as <b>pebbles</b> become smaller and cover density becomes larger, but there is no relationship with <b>pebble</b> flattening. Whether or not there is a relationship with wind speed is unclear. <b>Pebble</b> eccentricity indirectly influences total dust deposition on a <b>pebble</b> field, since it determines whether or not (and to what extent) total dust deposition will be a function of <b>pebble</b> size. For circular <b>pebbles,</b> total dust deposition is independent of <b>pebble</b> size, but once <b>pebbles</b> become elongated, total dust deposition will be smaller on <b>pebble</b> fields composed of small <b>pebbles</b> than on <b>pebble</b> fields composed of large <b>pebbles.</b> It was also demonstrated that the more <b>pebbles</b> are elongated, the more the dust will tend to settle on the <b>pebbles</b> rather than between or underneath them. Air flow separation plays a primary role in the deposition of dust on a rock fragment field, since it determines the location and size of the low-sedimentation areas that are connected to the air flow separation bubbles. Highly-elongated <b>pebbles</b> oriented parallel to the wind catch much more dust (also per unit surface) than circular <b>pebbles,</b> the surface of which is largely located in a zone of very low deposition. Dust deposition density on highly-elongated <b>pebbles</b> normal to the wind, on the contrary, is equal to dust deposition on circular <b>pebbles.</b> It should be noted that all data in this study refer to initial dust deposition (not accumulation), since only wind velocities below the dust deflation threshold were tested. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The <b>pebbling</b> {{number for}} a {{complete}} graph on n vertices is easily verified to be n: If we had (n &minus; 1) pebbles {{to put on the}} graph, then we could put 1 pebble on each vertex except one. This would make it impossible to place a pebble on the last vertex. Since this last vertex could have been the designated target vertex, the <b>pebbling</b> number must be greater than n &minus; 1. If we were to add 1 more pebble to the graph there are 2 possible cases. First, we could add it to the empty vertex, which would put a pebble on every vertex. Or secondly, we could add it to one of the vertices with only 1 pebble on them. Once any vertex has 2 pebbles on it, it becomes possible to make a <b>pebbling</b> move to any other vertex in the complete graph.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, one {{can define}} {{this in terms}} of a <b>pebble</b> game, or more {{precisely}} as a cops and robber game. Consider the following game, played on an undirected graph. There are two players, a robber and a cop. The robber has one <b>pebble</b> he can move along the edges of the given graph. The cop has an unlimited number of <b>pebbles,</b> but she wants to minimize the amount of <b>pebbles</b> she uses. The cop cannot move a <b>pebble</b> after it has been placed on the graph. The game proceeds as follows. The robber places his <b>pebble.</b> The cop then announces where she wants to place a new cop <b>pebble.</b> The robber can then move his <b>pebble</b> along edges, but not through occupied vertices. The game is over when the cop player places a <b>pebble</b> on top of the robber <b>pebble.</b> The tree-depth of the given graph is the minimum number of <b>pebbles</b> needed by the cop to guarantee a win. [...] For a star graph, two <b>pebbles</b> suffice: the strategy is to place a <b>pebble</b> at the center vertex, forcing the robber to one arm, and then to place the remaining <b>pebble</b> on the robber. For a path with [...] vertices, the cop uses a binary search strategy, which guarantees that at most [...] <b>pebbles</b> are needed.|$|R

5000|$|Running time: The trivial {{solution}} is to pebble an n-vertex graph in n steps using n pebbles. Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant [...] showed that any vertex of an n-vertex graph can be pebbled with O(n/log n) pebbles where the constant depends on the maximum in-degree. This enabled them to prove that DTIME(f(n)) is contained in DSPACE(f(n)/log f(n)) for all time-constructible f. Lipton and Tarjan [...] showed that any n-vertex planar acyclic directed graph with maximum in-degree k can be pebbled using O( [...] √n + k log2 [...] n) pebbles. They also proved {{that it is possible}} to obtain a substantial reduction in pebbles while preserving a polynomial bound on the number of <b>pebbling</b> steps with a theorem that any n-vertex planar acyclic directed graph with maximum in-degree k can be pebbled using O(n2/3 +k) pebbles in O(n5/3 [...] ) time. Alon, Seymour and Thomas [...] showed that any n-vertex acyclic directed graph with no kh -minor and with maximum in-degree k can be pebbled using O(h3/2 n1/2 +k log n) pebbles.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} PoSpace extends on proof of storage to means the user can both {{read and write}} data to storage space. A version called weak proof of space (wPoSpace) has been formalized to define {{situations}} where the user can only access space. In interactive proof-of-space systems, a proof-of-space {{is a piece of}} data that a prover sends to a verifier to prove that he has reserved a certain amount of space, usually as one file. For the system to be practical there have to be bounds on, most importantly, the computational time and space complexity of verification and the communication complexity so that neither of the parties have all of their bandwidth constantly drained by a PoSpace application. To avoid having to send a very large file to the prover, the prover can generate the file locally. And for verification, it is unfeasible for the prover to send the whole file through the communication channel, so he might be asked to send a random subset of the data. A solution might be to send the prover a pseudorandom function and have him build a table of preimages for the function. Later the verifier can ask for the inverse of random values of the function and the prover can do a table lookup and report back the inverse to prove that he has stored the table. But is important also, for soundness, that the time for generating this file be long enough to prevent dishonest users from deleting the file after sending their proof and then reconstructing it again whenever needed. One of the ways of implementing PoSpace is by using hard-to-pebble graphs. This exploits the time and space tradeoffs of <b>pebbling.</b> The verifier will ask the prover to build a labeling of a graph based on the information given by the verifier. The prover then can commit to the labeling and send a commitment to the verifier (possibly a Merkle hash of all the labels). To make sure that the storage space has been correctly allocated, the verifier will ask the prover to open several random locations in the commitment. The prover then responds with proofs for the locations. A proof of work should also have the property of completeness. Completeness means that the verifier will always accept a proof from an honest prover. One consideration to make is that in most architectures the user has a memory hierarchy who accesses data through a fast cache. In viewing PoSpace as a pricing function, these cache accesses are considered free, and the user is charged for every memory fetch that he has to make.|$|E

40|$|Mulching of {{agricultural}} fields and gardens with <b>pebbles</b> {{has long been}} practiced to conserve soil 	moisture in some semi-arid regions with low precipitation. Rainfall interception by the <b>pebble</b> mulch 	itself {{is an important part}} of the computation of the water balance for the <b>pebble</b> mulched fields and 	gardens. The mean equivalent diameter (MED) was used to characterize the <b>pebble</b> size. The maximum 	static rainfall retention in <b>pebble</b> mulch is based on the water penetrating into the pores of <b>pebbles,</b> the 	water adhering to the outside surfaces of <b>pebbles</b> and the water held between <b>pebbles</b> of the 	mulch.
