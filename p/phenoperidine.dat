5000|$|<b>Phenoperidine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1957 by Paul Janssen, {{of the company}} now known as Janssen Pharmaceutica, who was seeking better opioid pain-killers. [...] His two prototype drugs were methadone and pethidine, each which had been invented in 1930s by Otto Eisleb, who worked for IG Farben. His initial work starting with methadone yielded dextromoramide in 1954. Janssen then turned to making pethidine analogues, {{due in part to}} the less complicated chemistry of the compound. During his explorations, he replaced the methyl group attached to the pethidine nitrogen with a propiophenone group, and this yielded <b>phenoperidine,</b> in 1957. <b>Phenoperidine</b> was determined to have decreased stability and enhanced lipophilicity compared to pethidine. Soon after, studies in mice showed that <b>phenoperidine</b> was over 100 times more potent than pethidine.|$|E

50|$|In 1959, the {{combination}} of <b>phenoperidine</b> and haloperidol was first used in Europe in anesthesia to induce a detached, pain free state called Neuroleptic analgesia; {{the use of that}} mixture boomed in early 1960s but was overtaken by {{the combination}} of fentanyl and droperidol, which was widely used through the 1980s. These combination approaches were not adopted in the US.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, {{the same}} line of work yielded “one of the {{greatest}} advances of the 20th century psychiatry", haloperidol, as well as diphenoxylate, which lacked the opioid's analgesic properties but still stopped peristalsis in the intestines, a typical side effect of opioids; Janssen brought diphenoxylate to market as a drug to treat diarrhea. And through further advances, Janssen created fentanyl in 1960, which proved to be ten times more potent than <b>phenoperidine.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the general properties of fentanyl and <b>phenoperidine</b> has been made by including them in the continuing trial of drugs given before anaesthesia. Fentanyl and <b>phenoperidine</b> both differed from morphine in that they produced much less sedation, while the incidence of restlessness was greater after fentanyl than it was with morphine or <b>phenoperidine.</b> None of the drugs had any remarkable effect on cardio-vascular system stability, although both fentanyl and <b>phenoperidine</b> were associated with a notable incidence of tachycardia. Neither drug showed as strong an emetic effect as did morphine, <b>phenoperidine</b> causing the least sickness while fentanyl occupied an intermediate position. The effect of addition of droperidol to fentanyl and <b>phenoperidine</b> was to increase the sedative effect over that of either drug given alone, whilst the unpleasant subjective effects and restlessness associated with droperidol given alone were also reduced by combination with the opiates. The anti-emetic effect of droperidol was confirmed. r Although the chief interest attached to the evalua...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} some {{intravenously}} administered drugs on sensitivity to tibial pressure-induced somatic pain were investigated in a controlled, double-blind trial. The drugs included those commonly employed in neuroleptanaesthesia (fentanyl, <b>phenoperidine</b> and droperidol), standard opiates (morphine, diamorphine), {{and a standard}} tranquillizer (diazepam). The analgesics were given in what are commonly regarded as clinically equipotent dosages. Fentanyl and <b>phenoperidine</b> decreased the subjects ' sensitivity to somatic pain, whilst saline, morphine, diamorphine and diazepam {{did not have any}} effect. Droperidol caused an increase in sensitivity, and the addition of droperidol to either <b>phenoperidine</b> or fentanyl was associated with a simple summation of effect. It was concluded that there is a difference in the mode of action of fentanyl and <b>phenoperidine</b> in comparison to morphine, the former having a relatively greater effect on the perceptual mechanisms of pain and the latter a relatively greater effect on the affective experience of pain.

40|$|Fifty male {{patients}} undergoing {{elective surgery}} for duodenal ulcer received either <b>phenoperidine</b> or halothane 0. 5 % for the supplementation of anaesthesia. The {{patients in the}} <b>phenoperidine</b> group required the first postoperative dose of analgesic later and had lower pain scores in the first 2 h after operation. In {{the course of the}} 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd days, the two groups of patients showed a similar pattern after operation with regard to pain scores, vital capacity impairment and oxygen tension measurements. The factors predisposing to pain and pulmonary complications following surgery have been considered in two previous publications (Dalrymple, Parbrook and Steel, 1973; Parbrook, Steel and Dalrymple, 1973) in which the importance of the patients ' psycho-logical profiles, and in particular their neuroticism scores, was demonstrated. In addition, in the second study those patients who received analgesics during the operation had lower pain scores 24 h after surgery...|$|E
40|$|Narcotic analgesics are {{administered}} commonly to those patients in traumatic coma requiring mechanical ventilation—to provide analgesia (particularly {{in the presence}} of multiple injuries) and to suppress spontaneous, asynchronous ven-tilatory movements. Since the maintainance of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is fundamental to successful management in such patients, the influence of narcotics on intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is of particular relevance. Although a number of investigations have suggested that narcotics have little effect on ICP (Barker et al., 1968; Fitch et al., 1969; Misfeldt et al. j 1976), these were performed on patients undergoing elective neurosurgical procedures, in many of whom ICP was normal, whereas in others intracranial hypertension was secondary to focal space-occupying lesions. Consequently, the re-sults of these studies may not be directly applicable to patients with severe head injury. This view is supported by a recent case report which described significant increases in ICP following the administration of bolus doses of <b>phenoperidine</b> i. v. to a patient in traumatic coma (Grummitt and Goat, 1984). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine further the influence of i. v. bolus doses of the narcotic analgesic <b>phenoperidine</b> on ICP, mean arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in head-injured patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} injections of alfentanil, fentanyl, <b>phenoperidine</b> or morphine on respiratory and peak inspiratory air flow rate, the diaphragm electromyogram (EMG), the activity recorded extracellularly from respiratory neurones {{located in the}} ventral respiratory group and the cardiovascular system were examined in anaesthetized rats. Alfentanil produced dose-dependent changes in peripheral and central respiratory parameters, which were prevented by naloxone pretreatment. Minimal effects were produced on the cardiovascular system. The bradypnoea was principally due to a prolongation of the inspiratory phase and {{was accompanied by a}} comparable decrease in the peak inspiratory air flow rate. Alfentanil prolonged the discharge duration of inspiratory neurones such that it still maintained a strict phase correlation with the diaphragm EMG, but changes in firing frequency were inconsistent and negligible. The action on expiratory neuronal discharge was analogous to that on inspiratory neuronal discharge but delayed in onset. Hypotension produced by morphine limited the dose used but the respiratory responses to morphine and other selected narcotic analgesics were otherwise similar to that of alfentanil, differing mainly in time-course and magnitude. From the respiratory parameters assessed, the order of duration of effect was morphine greater than <b>phenoperidine</b> greater than fentanyl greater than alfentanil and the relative potencies were 0. 1, 0. 5, 2. 5 and 1 respectively. The selective prolongation of inspiration and the immediate action on inspiratory neurones suggests that systemically administered narcotic analgesics may alter the mechanisms within the central respiratory rhythm generator which determine the cessation of inspiration...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{a mixture}} of 2 mg <b>phenoperidine</b> and 5 mg {{droperidol}} {{as an adjunct to}} topical anaesthesia for bronchography, with or without prior bronchoscopy, is reported in 100 adult patients. Given slowly over 2 to 10 minutes this produces good operating conditions in the majority of patients. However, if parenteral pethidine or diazepam are used as premedication, patients may be too drowsy to co-operate with changes in posture. In the absence of excessive sedation respiratory depression will respond to the simple expedient of asking the patient to breathe. It is recommended that atropine alone be given as premedication, perhaps with oral diazepam in apprehensive patients. Despite the good operating conditions most patients remembered the procedure and half of them found it to be unpleasant...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of 8 -aminolaevulinic acid synthase (E. C. 2, 3. 1. 37) (the rate-limiting enzyme for haem and porphynn biosynthesis) has been {{measured in the}} rat liver after the repeated administration of anaesthetic agents in vivo. The {{activity of}} the enzyme was increased by Althesin, chlordiazepoxide, enfiuranej etomidate, lignocaine, methohexitone, methoxyflurane, pentazocine and thiopentone and decreased by procaine. No significant changes in activity occurred after the administration of amethocaine, atropine, bupivacaine, diazepam, droperidol, halothane, ketamine, morphine, nitrous oxide, pethidine, <b>phenoperidine,</b> prilocaine and propanidid. It is suggested that those anaesthetic agents which induced activity of the enzyme should not be administered to patients with an acute porphyria. Drugs are the commonest of the exogenous factors which can precipitate attacks of the acute porphyrias, and the barbiturates are implicated most commonly (Eales, 1971).

40|$|Experience of neuroleptanaesthesia using {{droperidol}} and fentanyl or <b>phenoperidine</b> for 500 patients undergoing elective {{major surgery}} is reported. In {{the majority of}} patients the technique offers considerable advantages such as smooth, uncomplicated induction, cardiovascular stability during maintenance of anaesthesia and a recovery phase notable for rapid return of consciousness {{and the absence of}} restlessness and vomiting. Arterial pressure decreases during induction of anaesthesia tended to be greater in the elderly patients, but were always rapidly restored by infusion of Hartmann's solution, and vasopressors were never needed. Rigidity immediately following induction occurred in a small percentage of patients. It is concluded that this technique has advantages which make it particularly suitable for major surgery even in elderly and poor-risk patients. Neuroleptanalgesia was first introduced into clinical practice by de Castro and Mundeleer in 1959 and the rationale of the technique has been discussed by Nilsson (1963).

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of alcuronium (0. 15 mg/kg body weight) on heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resis-tance in 22 artificially ventilated patients anaesthetized with 60 per cent nitrous oxide in oxygen, plus either tubocurarine (25 - 35 mg, according to body weight) and 0. 2 per cent methoxyflurane—series I—or <b>phenoperidine</b> (1 mg/ 15 kg body weight) —series II. End-tidal Pco 3 was maintained constant. The most striking effect was a significant increase of heart rate in the series II patients, accompanied by a significant fall of cardiac output and of stroke volume. There was no significant change of mean arterial pressure in either series of patients; therefore the fall of cardiac output was accom-panied by a compensatory increase of total peripheral resistance. Alcuronium, a synthetic derivative of the alkaloid C-toxiferine-I, was introduced into anaesthetic practice by Hiigin and Kissling in 1961.

40|$|A {{total of}} 102 {{patients}} with phaeochromocytoma who underwent surgery {{by the same}} team between 1964 and 1976 were allocated to three groups according to the anaesthetic protocol used: (1) balanced anaesthesia and control of hypotension with noradrenaline; (2) anaesthesia with halothane and replacement of blood volume; (3) neuroleptanalgesia (droperidol and <b>phenoperidine)</b> and replace-ment of blood volume. None of the patients {{in any of the}} three groups received adrenergic inhibitors before anaesthesia. Comparison of the results in the three groups revealed that the major factor responsible for reduction of operative mortality to almost zero was control of hypotension by replacement of blood volume rather than by the use of noradrenaline following resection of the tumour, whereas the type of anaesthetic agent used was of secondary importance. istic paroxysmal arterial hypertension with normal pressure between the crises was present in only 30 % of patients.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of bolus doses of {{midazolam}} 0. 15 mg kg' 1 i. v. on intracranialpressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in 12 patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score ^ 6). The study was performed in patients aged 17 - 44 yr who were sedated (<b>phenoperidine</b> 20 pg kg- 1 / r ') and paralysed (vecuronium 2 mg h' 1). Midazolam re-duced MAP from 89. 0 mm Hg to 75. 0 mm Hg (P < 0. 0001), while CPP decreased from 71. 0 mm Hg to 55. 8 mm Hg (P < 0. 0001). During the study, CPP decreased to less than 50 mm Hg in four patients. Midazolam induced small, non-significant changes in ICP. However, when control ICP was less than 18 mm Hg (n = 7 patients), an increase in ICP was observed. The remaining five patients (control ICP ^ 18 mmHg) exhibited a slight decrease in ICP. These findings suggest that bolus administration of midazolam should be performed with great caution in patients with severe head injury, especially when ICP is less than 18 mm Hg. (Br. J.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of pancuronium bromide (0. 07 mg/kg body weight) on heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and calculated total peripheral resistance in ten artificially ventilated patients, anaesthetized with 60 per cent nitrous oxide in oxygen plus <b>phenoperidine</b> (1 mg/ 15 kg body weight). End-tidal Pco 2 was maintained constant at 30 ± 2 mm Hg. There was a marked and statistically significant increase of heart rate of about 25 per cent, accompanied by lesser, but still statistically significant, increases of cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure. Total peripheral resistance was unchanged, suggesting that pancuronium has little ganglion-blocking activity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the neuroleptanalgesic drug combinations, {{droperidol}} 5 mg + phenoperi-dine 1. 5 mg, and droperidol 5 mg + fentanyl 0. 1 mg, on the cerebrospinal fluid (c. s. f.) pressure, have been studied in patients with normal c. s. f. pathways during controlled ventilation. The influence of droperidol 5 mg+fentanyl 0. 1 mg on intracranial pressure has also been investigated in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions. In patients with normal c. s. f. pathways, droperidol and <b>phenoperidine</b> produced only small alterations in c. s. f. pressure in either direction, while droperidol plus fentanyl resulted in falls in c. s. f. pressure in each case studied, with {{a significant decrease in}} overall mean c. s. f. pressure. Similarly, in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions, droperidol plus fentanyl produced decreases in c. s. f. pressure in {{all but one of the}} cases studied. The striking difference between the effect on c. s. f. pressure of these drugs and of the volatile anaesthetic agents could be of importance to the clinical anaesthetist dealing with head injuries or working in a neurosurgical unit, when under conditions of controlled ventilation these drugs could be used as adjuvants to nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia. In the past few years, it has been recognized that volatile anaesthetic agents can elevate the intra-cranial pressure even in the absence of hyper-capnia (Hunter, 1964; McDowall, Barker and Jennett, 1966); and that the increases in intra-cranial pressure produced by these drugs are markedly greater in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions than in patients with normal cerebrospinal fluid (c. s. f.) pathway...|$|E
40|$|S UMM A R Y Cerebral {{blood flow}} (CBF) was {{measured}} {{before and after}} intravenous injection of the cerebral vasodilator nicergoline in 13 patients with cerebrovascular disease. CBF increased in seven. The possibility {{that the effect of}} the drug in the remainder may have been masked by a fall of CBF which occurs during sequential measurement of patients at rest is discussed. Nicergoline (1, 6 -dimethyl- 8 beta- (5 -bromonico-tinoyl-oxymethyl) - 10 alpha-methoxy-ergoline) is an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agent (Arcari et al., 1968) which affects cerebral blood flow by reducing cerebrovascular resistance (Benzi et al., 1971). The present study was undertaken to assess the acute effect of the drug on cerebral blood flow and blood pressure in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Methods Thirteen patients (10 with multi-infarct dementia of moderate degree and three with transient ischaemic attacks) gave informed consent to measurement of cerebral blood flow before and after intravenous injection of 2 mg nicergoline, using the intracarotid 133 Xenon technique de-veloped by Wilkinson et al. (1969). The studies were performed under general anaesthesia before cerebral angiography carried out for diagnostic purposes. Anaesthesia was induced by methohexi-tone and acoline, and maintained by nitrous oxide and oxygen supplemented by <b>phenoperidine.</b> Cerebral blood flow was estimated from the slope of the first two minutes of the semilogarithmic display of the clearance curve described by Olesen et al.

40|$|The circulatory and {{ventilatory}} {{influences of}} various combinations of the narcotic analgesics <b>phenoperidine</b> and fentanyl, and the neuroleptics haloperidol and dehydro-benzperidol, were investigated during nitrous oxide anaesthesia in 230 patients. Measurements of cardiac output and other haemodynamic variables in nine patients supported the general findings that the cardiovascular {{effects of the}} analgesics were modified by alterations of ventilation, in particular the haemodynamic effects of concurrent hypercapnia. Serious circulatory disturbances were not found following premedication with neuroleptic drugs. Mechanisms of ventilatory depression following {{the use of the}} analgesics have been evaluated, and indices of ventilation and arterial oxygenation show that postoperative values after neuroleptanalgesia are comparable to those- after other methods of anaesthesia. The rationale of neuroleptanalgesia combined with light general anaesthesia is explored and the pharmacology of the drugs is reviewed. Since the inception of a technique of anaesthesia which combined the neuroleptic properties of certain butyrophenones, with the profound anal-gesia produced by potent, short-acting analgesics, the concept of neuroleptanalgesia (De Castro and Mundeleer, 1959; Delay and Deniker, 1961; Alder, 1961) has attracted much attention but has also been greeted with considerable scepticism. As an alternative to general anaesthesia (Nilsson and Janssen, 1961) it has only found application in the relatively specialized fields of neurosurgery (Brown, 1964), ophthalmic surgery (Trifogli and Manni, 1964), and for repeated burns dressings (Smith and Hollis, 1966). Recent developments in the use of both neuroleptics and analgesics have followed the trend set by Brown, Horton and Macrae (1963), and have been directed toward their inclusion with nitrous oxide and a muscle relaxant as part of a balanced anaesthetic tech-nique. It is perhaps unfortunate that the original term "neuroleptanalgesia " should still be used in Based on papers delivered to the Second British Symposium on the use of neuroleptanalgesia in anaes-thetic practice, and to a meeting of the Yorkshire Society of Anaesthetists held jointly with the Hickma...|$|E
