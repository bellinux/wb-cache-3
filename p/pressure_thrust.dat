40|$|Hybrid rockets {{are being}} studied as a {{potential}} replacement for the solid rocket boosters on the NASA space shuttle. One physical characteristic of hybrid rockets that must be understood and overcome is potentially severe pressure oscillations during combustion. Pressure oscillations inside the rocket combustion chamber lead to oscillations in {{the thrust of the}} rocket. These oscillations are damaging to potential human passengers and cargo and must be minimized. Current theories surmise that the oscillations are caused by combustion chamber geometry, oxygen feed line parameters, and/or fuel combustion characteristics. This study focuses {{on the role of the}} fuel characteristics in <b>pressure</b> and <b>thrust</b> oscillations. The standard hybrid rocket fuel is hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). A fuel additive, guanidinium azo-tetrazolate (GAT), has been shown to increase thrust and impulse of the rocket when added as 15 % by mass to the fuel. This study compares the amplitude of the <b>pressure</b> and <b>thrust</b> oscillations of the rocket when burning HTPB fuels and when burning GAT-added fuels.

For the case of droplet formation from a vibration nozzle, the nozzle vibration is simulated by large deflection plate vibration equation. Droplet formation from a rigid nozzle is studied simply by setting the nozzle deflection always to be zero. The one-dimensional model is solved by MacCormack method. The large deflection plate vibration equation is solved by mode shape approximation and RungaKuta time integration method. Three different effect factors, the driving <b>pressure</b> <b>thrust</b> input effects, the fluid viscosity effects, and the nozzle vibration effects, on droplet formation are studied.

The nozzle vibration effects are studied by Redacted for Privacy comparing the results from a vibration nozzle with the results from a rigid nozzle. Results show: 1) the primary droplet break-off time is constant if the driving pressure magnitude is high, but the primary droplet volume and primary droplet velocity increase slightly as the driving <b>pressure</b> <b>thrust</b> input increase; 2) higher thrust input can possibly result in the occurrence of overturn phenomenon; 3) increasing the fluid viscosity cause the primary droplet break-off later, but the primary droplet volume and the primary droplet velocity does not change significantly by fluid viscosity; 4) the nozzle vibration effect on the primary droplet break-off time and the primary droplet size is small, but the nozzle vibration cause the primary droplet velocity to increase by an amount of the nozzle vibration velocity magnitude; 5) nozzle vibration cause longer liquid thread to form and the total satellite droplet volume to increase significantly which eventually break into multiple satellite droplet. © Copyright by Guozhong Yan...|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{the solid}} rocket motor {{community}} has made {{increasing use of}} composite materials for thermal and structural applications. This is particularly true of solid rocket nozzles, which have used carbon phenolic and, increasingly, carbon-carbon materials to provide structural integrity and thermal protection at the high temperatures encountered during motor burn. To evaluate the degree of structural performance of nozzles and their materials and to verify analysis models, many subscale and full-scale tests are run. These provide engineers with valuable data needed to optimize design and to analyze nozzle hardware. Included among these data are strains, <b>pressures,</b> <b>thrust,</b> temperatures, and displacements. Recent nozzle test hardware has made increasing use of strain gauges embedded in the carbon composite material to measure internal strains. In order to evaluate strength, these data must be transformed into strains along the fiber directions. The fiber-direction stresses can then be calculated.

Methods: Eye dropper bottle models, solution models (filtrate water/surfactant solution) and a dispensing time measuring apparatus were prepared to measure the dispensing time. Results: With filtrate water and <b>pressure</b> <b>thrust</b> load of 0. 3 MPa, the dispensing time significantly increased from 1. 1 &plusmn; 0. 5 seconds to 4. 6 &plusmn; 1. 1 seconds depending on the decrease of inner aperture diameters from 0. 4 mm to 0. 2 mm (P &lt; 0. 0001). When using the bottle models with inner aperture diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger, the dispensing time became constant. The dispensing time using surfactant solution showed the same tendency as above. When <b>pressure</b> <b>thrust</b> load was large (0. 07 MPa), the solution flew out continuously with inner aperture diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger and the dispensing time could not be measured.
