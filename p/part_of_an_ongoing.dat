5|$|Controversy exists {{over the}} Falklands' {{discovery}} and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, although Argentina maintains {{its claim to}} the islands. In April 1982, Argentine forces temporarily occupied the islands. British administration was restored two months later {{at the end of}} the Falklands War. Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory, but its sovereignty status is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
5|$|Batwoman {{was created}} by writer Edmond Hamilton and artist Sheldon Moldoff under the {{direction}} of editor Jack Schiff, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> effort to expand Batman's cast of supporting characters. Batwoman began appearing in DC Comics stories beginning with Detective Comics #233 (1956), in which she was introduced as a love interest for Batman in order to combat the allegations of Batman's homosexuality arising from the controversial book Seduction of the Innocent (1954). When Julius Schwartz became editor of the Batman-related comic books in 1964, he removed non-essential characters including Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Bat-Mite, and Bat-Hound. Later, the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths retroactively established that Batwoman had never existed, though her alter ego Kathy Kane continued to be referred to occasionally.|$|E

The request was entirely optional, but as the captain was preoccupied with {{the details of the}} upcoming sortie to Cuba he gave the letter little attention and instead referred the matter to his operations officer, Commander John R. Millett, who in turn referred the letter to the ship's navigator, Lieutenant Commander Frank G. Morris.|$|E

50|$|The {{music in}} video or {{computer}} games and certain films {{is meant to}} draw the audience through a storyline using two distinct techniques: horizontal re-sequencing and vertical re-orchestration. Horizontal re-sequencing is the method by which pre-composed segments of music can be re-shuffled according to <b>a</b> player’s choice <b>of</b> where they go in a storyline or environment. vertical re-orchestration is the technique of changing the mix <b>of</b> separate <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> loop <b>of</b> music {{in relation to a}} player’s movement within the narrative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game. Games, such as Halo 2, employ <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> these techniques in the creation of their soundtracks. Street Fighter II and Mario Kart DS are examples of games which change the music's tempo under certain circumstances.|$|R

5|$|A third game {{entitled}} Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse {{was confirmed}} in May 2008 for release in 2009; {{the title was}} later pushed back to 2010, with concept art emerging after Telltale's completion of Tales of Monkey Island. The season again ran for five episodes, released monthly from April to August 2010. The Devil's Playhouse followed a structure similar to Tales of Monkey Island, with each episode forming a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> narrative, involving psychic powers and forces that would use them for world domination. A two-minute Flash cartoon also accompanied the game, dealing with the origin story of General Skun-ka'pe, one of the game's antagonists. Max also appears in Telltale's 2010 casual game Poker Night at the Inventory alongside Tycho Brahe from Penny Arcade, the Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Strong Bad from Homestar Runner. Sam and Max (now voiced by Dave Boat) also appear in the game's sequel alongside Claptrap from Borderlands, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros., Ash Williams from Evil Dead and GLaDOS from Portal.|$|E

5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2005 Greater Manchester police {{announced}} that they would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move would almost certainly {{have resulted in the}} stadium's safety certificate being revoked, effectively forcing the team to play behind closed doors. The move was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> dispute between the police force and Dave Whelan surrounding GB£300,000 in unpaid policing costs. The police's decision would not have affected Wigan Warriors, whose games are stewarded instead of policed. The situation was temporarily resolved on 8 March with both sides reaching an agreement that would allow Athletic to play at the ground {{until the end of the}} season. Four months later, Wigan Athletic, facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, grudgingly paid the money they owed to the police. The club successfully appealed against the payments in court and won damages from the police.|$|E

Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and {{a federal grand jury}} subpoenaed the contracts. A federal grand jury in Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients of tuition waivers to state universities request by three current and two former state legislators, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The scholarship program, begun in 1905, allowed each state legislator to waive the tuition and fees of any of the state's 12 public universities, for any two students who live within the legislator's district, without regard to academic achievement or financial need. No charges were filed against anyone in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The Water Boiler was an aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactor, a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is dissolved in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of uranium nitrate because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the Water Boiler did take up an inordinate amount of T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the Water Boiler.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attack on}} Île de la Passe was {{launched}} {{on the evening}} of 10 August, with Staunch towing boats carrying over 400 soldiers, Royal Marines and volunteer sailors to the island under cover of darkness, guided by Nereides pilot. During the night however, the pilot became lost and the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn. To distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where {{the main body of the}} French squadron, led by Hamelin in Vénus, was based. Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack. Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second in command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery. Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle, in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners. Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission and the officers exchanged angry letters, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{demonstration}} extends {{previous work}} on the agile workflow management system CAKE II [2]. CAKE focuses on structural changes of longterm workflows at run time. A workflow modeling GUI that allows the user to suspend <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ongoing</b> workflow instance and to adapt it is demonstrated in conjunction with CAKE’s workflow enactment service and a worklist GUI. The CAKE prototype has been applied in chip design, in the banking sector, and in the office domain. This demo uses <b>a</b> repository <b>of</b> office workflows that have been collected during a case study with three offices of research groups at the University of Trier. The repository consists of 24 workflow templates, for instance, on making an application for leave and of agile instances that deal with unforeseen cases like finding a substitution for a professor {{in order to get}} a signature. The demonstration aims at showing how CAKE is able to handle structural adaptations in form of ad hoc changes and late modeling, which both occur frequently in office workflows...|$|R
