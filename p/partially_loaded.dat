The South Korean-built Valemax ship, <b>partially</b> <b>loaded</b> with 260,000 tons of iron ore, was towed away from Pier 1 by tugboats in the following day and as a precaution against environmental damage the Brazilian authorities requested her fuel tanks to be emptied. Since there are no facilities to unload iron ore from the ship at Ponta da Madeira and no large shipyards in the region, emergency repairs had to be performed by divers and the cargo redistributed while the ship is anchored offshore before it could be towed to a shipyard.|$|E

Whilst XMI is widely supported, the XMI parser provided by EMF is inefficient in some cases where models are readonly (such as input models for model query, model-to-model transformation, etc) as it always requires loading the entire model into memory.

40|$|When T {{cells are}} primed by {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) to initiate antigen-specific immune responses screening for matching anti-gen receptor–MHC/peptide pairs {{takes place in}} DC–T-cell conjugates. For an immune response DC–T-cell conjugates formed during priming events need to dissolve. Although detailed knowledge on molecules involved in the conjugate formation is available, dissolving of them has not been {{considered to be an}} active process. Here, we identify CYTIP (cytohe-sin-interacting protein) to mediate DC–T-cell deattachment. CYTIP, which is in-duced during maturation of DCs, shortly accumulates to the contact zones with T cells within the first hour of coculture. Specific silencing of CYTIP results in stronger adhesion of DCs to T cells and to fibronectin. When a need for deattach-ment is created in a T-cell priming assay by only <b>partially</b> <b>loading</b> DCs with anti-gen, CYTIP silencing causes reduced priming capacity. Thus, CYTIP allows DCs to actively control DC–T-cell interactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the study of {{tensegrity}} active control in situations of <b>partially</b> defined <b>loading</b> and damage events. Self-diagnosis and self-repair methodologies are proposed and validated experimentally on a full-scale active tensegrity structure. Selfdiagnosis involves load identification and damage location. The response of the structure to a load and damage is measured and compared with the response of the structure to candidate solutions for load and damage. Self-diagnosis solutions result in sets of candidate solutions for loads and damage. These solutions are employed to compute control commands of shape control and self-repair for the structure. Self-repairing control commands increase stiffness and decrease stresses with respect to the damaged state. Self-repairing control commands are computed using a multiobjective approach. The application of a control command results in self-stress modifications by changing the length of active struts. The proposed methodologies are attractive for tensegrity active control in situations of <b>partially</b> defined <b>loading</b> and damage events...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Existing model {{persistence}} frameworks either store {{models as}} a whole or object by object. Since most modeling tasks work with larger aggregates of a model, existing persistence frameworks either load too many objects or access many objects individually. We propose to persist a model broken into larger fragments. First, we assess the size of large models and describe typical usage pat-terns to show that most applications work with aggregates of model ob-jects. Secondly, we provide an analytical framework to assess execution time gains for <b>partially</b> <b>loading</b> models fragmented with different gran-ularity. Thirdly, we propose meta-model-based fragmentation that we implemented in an EMF based framework. Fourthly, we analyze our ap-proach in comparison to other persistence frameworks (XMI, CDO, and Morsa) based on four common modeling tasks: create/modify, traverse, query, and partial loads. We {{show that there is}} no generally optimal fragmentation, that fragmen-tation can be achieved automatically and transparently, and that frag-mentation provides considerable performance gains compared to other persistence strategies. ...|$|R

To do this, a comprehensive methodology to quantify different operating reserves categories within the real-time system operation is proposed. The quantification {{is based on an}} iterative process where the total costs of the system are minimised, that is the sum of the operating costs (including the additional costs of <b>partially</b> <b>loading</b> generating units due to operating reserves) and the costs of the expected energy not supplied. The PDA considers conventional generation outages; load and wind forecast uncertainty on an hourly basis as well as load and wind variability in a 10 min time frame.

50|$|The {{internal}} preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is {{a departure}} from previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ. When the trigger is pulled, the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not <b>partially</b> <b>load</b> the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N. Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It {{should be noted that}} the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.|$|R

40|$|Foreign object damage (FOD) {{behavior}} of a gas-turbine grade SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composite (CMC) was determined at 25 and 1316 C, employing impact velocities from 115 to 440 meters per second by 1. 59 -mm diameter stell-ball projectiles. Two different types of specimen support were used at each temperature: fully supported and partially supported. For a given temperature, the degree of post-impact strength degradation increased with increasing impact velocity, and was greater in a partially supported configuration than in a fully supported one. The elevated-temperature FOD resistance of the composite, particularly under <b>partially</b> supported <b>loading</b> at higher impact velocities {{greater than or equal}} to 350 meters per second, was significantly less than the ambient-temperature counterpart, attributed to a weakening effect of the composite. For fully supported loading, frontal contact stress played a major role in generating composite damage; whereas, for <b>partially</b> supported <b>loading,</b> both frontal contact and backside bending stresses were combined sources of damage generation.
