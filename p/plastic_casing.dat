5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a <b>plastic</b> <b>casing</b> and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The <b>plastic</b> <b>casing</b> began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a <b>plastic</b> <b>casing</b> instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E

A rope light with relatively wider plastic tubing is more durable to external elements but less flexible. Thinner plastic tubing, on the other hand, is far more flexible but less robust. Generally, rope lights for heavy use outdoors feature thicker <b>plastic</b> <b>casings</b> while those used for more decorative purposes indoors have relatively thin <b>plastic</b> <b>casings.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>casings</b> are {{generally}} made from polymers such as polyamide, polypropylene, or polyethylene. Polyamide (Nylon) <b>plastic</b> <b>casings</b> {{are the most}} commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide casings come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide are shrinkable casings and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide casings remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide casings has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of casings such as multilayer casings.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, sausage casings {{were made}} of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs {{in the case of}} haggis and other {{traditional}} puddings. Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even <b>plastic</b> <b>casings,</b> {{especially in the case of}} industrially manufactured sausages. Some forms of sausage, such as sliced sausage, are prepared without a casing. Additionally, luncheon meat and sausage meat are now available without casings in tin cans and jars.|$|R
50|$|Mines {{manufactured}} {{after the}} 1950s generally use <b>plastic</b> <b>casings</b> to hinder detection by electronic mine detectors. Some, {{referred to as}} minimum metal mines, are constructed with as little metal as possible - often around 1 g - to make them difficult to detect. Mines containing absolutely no metal have been produced, but are uncommon. By its nature, a mine without any metal components in it cannot be found using a metal detector.|$|R

5000|$|Domestic {{examples}} of composites {{can be seen}} in the [...] "plastic" [...] casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These <b>plastic</b> <b>casings</b> are usually a composite made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) in which calcium carbonate chalk, talc, glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for strength, bulk, or electro-static dispersion.

5000|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>casings</b> are not eaten. They {{also can}} be flat or shirred.

5000|$|Flame retardants: Some {{flame retardants}} like Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs), {{which can be}} found in e-waste plastic to make {{electronic}} products more flame resistant, are emitted into the environment through e-waste dismantling and become dust and air. BFRs are one of the materials that are used in the making of circuit boards and <b>plastic</b> <b>casings.</b> BFRs, which are fat-soluble, bioaccumulate causing neurological disorders and endocrine disruption. PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), a class of BFRs, interfere with brain development of animals and in the hormones associated with sexual development. Long Term exposure to this toxin can result in problems concerning learning capability and memory function. Because of their toxicity, electronic manufacturers are phasing out BFRs.|$|R
5000|$|Grommets are {{generally}} used whenever wires pass through punched/drilled sheet metal or <b>plastic</b> <b>casings</b> for this reason. [...] Molded and continuous strip grommets, {{also known as}} edge grommets, are manufactured {{in a wide variety}} of sizes and lengths expressly for this purpose; they are usually a single piece which can be inserted by hand. Two-piece hard plastic devices are available which also grip the wire that passes through. These are called strain relief bushings and are often used to insulate, anchor, and protect power cords where they enter panels. Preventing a tug or twist on the wire from stressing the electrical connections inside the connected equipment. Sleeved grommets have a flexible extension (sleeve), usually tapered or moulded to flex increasingly towards the free end in order to reduce fracturing of electrical insulation.|$|R

5000|$|Threaded inserts are {{commonly}} used in <b>plastic</b> <b>casings,</b> housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws {{to be used in}} the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. [...] Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the threaded insert into a molded hollow boss (hole) of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the metal insert is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the threaded insert to ensure a good retention.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} not only main flame retardants but also of related {{degradation}} products or impurities has gained attention {{in the last years}} and is relevant to assess the safety of our consumer products and the emission of potential contaminants into the environment. In this study, we show that <b>plastics</b> <b>casings</b> of electric/electronic devices containing TBBPA contain also a complex mixture of related brominated chemicals. These compounds were most probably coming from impurities, byproducts, or degradation products of TBBPA and TBBPA derivatives. A total of 14 brominated compounds were identified based on accurate mass measurements (formulas and tentative structures proposed). The formulas (or number of bromine elements) for 19 other brominated compounds of minor intensity are also provided. A new script for the recognition of halogenated compounds based on combining a simplified isotope pattern and mass defect cluster analysis was developed in R for the screening.
