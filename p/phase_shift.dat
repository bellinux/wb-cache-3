Hilliard's solution was to use higher linearity transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company, in consultation with founder Jim Lansing. Earlier, Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife's, Dr. John Blackburn, and in 1934, he helped Blackburn get a position as design engineer at Lansing Manufacturing. The following year, Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald's flat and weak soprano voice, picking up an Academy Award for Sound Recording on the duo's first film together: Naughty Marietta.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method: wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method. By {{different}} combinations of a quarter-wave-plate, a half-wave-plate, and an analyzer, phase delays are introduced in the interference light path {{in order to achieve}} the <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> digital holog-raphy. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiments are conducted to verify the validity of this method. The numerical simulation shows that the result of the wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method is consistent with that of the traditional four-step <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method. The experimen-tal results successfully reconstruct the object light intensity in the image plane. Based on the wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method, a pixelated wave-plate array structure is designed to achieve real-time <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> digital holography. The wave-plate array <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method not only can reconstruct object image of high quality, but also can be used in dynamic phase measurement. Therefore, pixelated wave-plate array structure and wave-plate array <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method could be widely used in practical applications. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10. 1117 / 1.
