40|$|Einstein’s General Relativity {{has been}} our best theory of gravity for nearly a century, yet we know it cannot be the final word. In this thesis, we {{consider}} modifications to General Relativity, motivated by both high and low energy physics. In the quantum realm, we focus on Horava gravity, a theory which breaks Lorentz invariance {{in order to obtain}} good ultraviolet physics by adding higher spatial derivatives to <b>the</b> <b>action</b> (improving propagator behaviour in loops) but not temporal (avoiding Ostrogradski ghosts). By using the Stückelberg trick, we demonstrate <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> introducing a Lorentz violating scale into the theory, far below the Planck scale, to evade strong coupling concerns. Using this formalism we then show explicitly that Horava gravity breaks the Weak Equivalence Principle, for which there are very strict experimental bounds. Moving on to considering matter in such theories, we construct DiffF(M) invariant actions for both scalar and gauge fields at a classical level, before demonstrating that they are only consistent with the Equivalence Principle in the case that they reduce to their covariant form. This motivates us to consider <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> Lorentz violating effects induced by loop corrections of Horava gravity coupled to a Lorentz invariant matter sector. Our analysis reveals potential light cone fine tuning problems, in addition to evidence that troublesome higher order time derivatives may be generated. At low energies, we demonstrate a class of theories which modify gravity to solve the cosmological constant problem. The mechanism involves a composite metric with <b>the</b> square root <b>of</b> its determinant a total derivative or topological invariant, thus ensuring <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> proportional to <b>the</b> volume element do not contribute to the dynamics. After demonstrating general properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposal, we work through a specific example, demonstrating freedom from Ostrogradski ghosts at quadratic order (in <b>the</b> <b>action)</b> on maximally symmetric backgrounds. We go on to demonstrate sufficient conditions for a theory in this class to share a solution space equal to that of Einstein’s equations plus a cosmological constant, before determining the cosmology these extra solutions may have when present...|$|R

40|$|A central {{question}} in health hazard associated with environmental pollution is <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> level {{of exposure to}} a mixture <b>of</b> carcinogens and <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global health impact on the residents. The point is important to found a public health decision for site intervention or residents relocalisation. Belgium had to face such a problem at Mellery, a village which became internationally famous some years ago, when local residents denonced a local pollution originating from an industrial waste depository facility situated only 500 m from <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> their village, in a former sand quarry. A central <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authorities was the original campaign organised to measure directly <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> exposure to carcinogens of {{a large group of}} voluntary local residents, children included, by measuring biomarkers of exposure in blood lymphocytes : for its high sensitivity, <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> sister chromatid exchanges (SCES) had been chosen. This biomonitoring method, quite commonly used to monitor occupational environment, had never before been applied to evaluate the potential health impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment on a general population. Such data, although sophisticate and integrative, are only indicators of exposure and cannot be used, so far, as individual quantitative predictors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual persons. First designed as an epidemiological study, the campaign at Mellery revealed so high exposure levels that the experts did not keep with the original experimental line and decided to release individual information to the concerned persons, without much preparation nor risk communication policy. Several groups (experts, local doctors, local and regional authorities, public agencies and residents associations) were active integrating the information in their respective discourses, giving them specific interpretative and competing meanings. Any scenario for intervention had to be embedded in some meaningful and legitimating discourse : a quite difficult task for the authorities. <b>The</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expertise system used for public decision-making were marked by several such uncertainties (geological, biological, medical) but also by <b>the</b> difficult integration <b>of</b> health related aspects within environment interventions in the regulatory structures in Belgium : health responsibilities are scattered between federal and "communautaire" bodies, while most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environmental <b>actions</b> are funded at the regional level. In this first heavy case, the young regional institutions reacted in a disorganized manner: they choose to not put at risk their frail power equilibrium and to not reconsider <b>the</b> attribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsibilities. The authors propose to analyse how peculiar interlocking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biological and political uncertainties were at <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general failure in public risk management around this landfill site: Mellery, after 10 years and a huge budget for site treatment, is still a nightmare for environmental authorities in Southern Belgium...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a range of}} aspects of theoretical physics. It is composed of two parts. In the first part we motivate our line of research, and introduce and discuss the relevant concepts. In the second part, four research papers are collected. The first paper deals with a possible extension of general relativity, namely the recently discovered classically consistent bimetric theory. In this paper we study <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> perturbations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metric(s) around cosmologically viable background solutions. In the second paper, we explore possibilities for particle physics with low-scale supersymmetry. In particular we consider <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> supersymmetric higher-dimensional operators to the minimal supersymmetric standard model, and study collider phenomenology in this class <b>of</b> models. <b>The</b> third paper deals with a possible extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> Lie algebras within category theory. Considering Lie algebras as objects in additive symmetric ribbon categories we define the proper Killing form morphism and explore its role towards a structure theory of Lie algebras in this setting. Finally, the last paper is concerned with <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> string amplitudes in four dimensional models with reduced supersymmetry. In particular, we develop general techniques to compute amplitudes involving gauge bosons and gravitons and explicitly compute the corresponding three- and four-point functions. On the one hand, these results {{can be used to}} extract important <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effective <b>actions</b> that string theory dictates, on the other they {{can be used as a}} tool to compute the corresponding field theory amplitudes. Over the last twenty years there have been spectacular observations and experimental achievements in fundamental physics. Nevertheless all the physical phenomena observed so far can still be explained in terms of two old models, namely <b>the</b> Standard Model <b>of</b> particle physics and the ΛCDM cosmological model. These models are based on profoundly different theories, quantum field theory and <b>the</b> general theory <b>of</b> relativity. There are many reasons to believe that the SM and the ΛCDM are effective models, that is they are valid at the energy scales probed so far but need to be extended and generalized to account of phenomena at higher energies. There are several proposals to extend these models and one promising theory that unifies all <b>the</b> fundamental interactions <b>of</b> nature: string theory. With the research documented in this thesis we contribute with four tiny drops to <b>the</b> filling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental physics research pot.

5000|$|Hyde {{goes on to}} {{elucidate}} interpretive pitfalls of treating hamartia as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including Hamlet and Oedipus the King. Hyde observes that students often cite [...] "thinking too much" [...] as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his demise in the story depends. That citation does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests {{he ought to have}} murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. In Oedipus the King, she observes that regard of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads, or his trust in his intellect as the qualities upon which <b>the</b> change <b>of</b> fortune relies, is incomplete. Instead, to regard his ignorance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true identity <b>of</b> his parents as the keystone to his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack <b>of</b> information, is <b>the</b> more complete interpretation. [...] In his 1978 Classical World article Hamartia, Ate, and Oedipus, Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place hamartia's definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, Ate, or divine intervention, plays in hamartia. <b>The</b> Butcher translation <b>of</b> [...] "Poetics" [...] references hamartia as both a [...] "single great error", and [...] "a single great defect in character", prompting critics to raise arguments. Mid-twentieth century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees hamartia as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads. Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' hamartia, [...] "no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one <b>of</b> blindly following <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> one's own intellect." [...] He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be <b>the</b> agent <b>of</b> his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part {{in order to create a}} tragic irony. O. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived <b>of</b> key <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> information, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> brings disastrous results. J.M. Bremer then conducted a thorough study of hamartia in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and Homer. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite hamartia as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.|$|R
