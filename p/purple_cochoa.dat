50|$|The <b>purple</b> <b>cochoa</b> (Cochoa purpurea) is {{a brightly}} {{coloured}} bird {{found in the}} temperate forests of Asia. It is a quiet and elusive bird species that has been considered {{to be related to}} the thrushes of family Turdidae or the related Muscicapidae (Old World flycatchers). They are found in dark forested areas and is found in the canopy, where it often sits motionless.|$|E
50|$|Usually seen {{in pairs}} or small groups sitting in tall trees. They usually feed {{close to the}} ground, on molluscs, insects and berries. They {{sometimes}} launch aerial sallies to capture insects. This species breeds in summer and the nest is much {{like that of the}} <b>purple</b> <b>cochoa</b> but is usually placed close to water. Both parents take turns to incubate. The song is a thin and clear feeeee that dies away. Calls include a short high-pitched pok and harsh notes.|$|E

Two more species of laughingthrush {{are thought to be}} endemic to these mountains: brown-capped laughingthrush (Garrulax austeni) and striped laughingthrush (Garrulax virgatus).|$|R
50|$|Gazetted in 1996 {{to cover}} {{an area of}} 36883 ha, Tam Đảo National Park {{encompasses}} the provinces of Vĩnh Phúc, Thái Nguyên and Tuyên Quang, and includes 21982 ha of natural forest and 1351 ha of plantation forest. The highest mountain in the park is Mount Tam Dao Bac at elevation of 1592 m and the lowest point is about 100 m. Vegetation in the park has high concentration of tree species in the families of Fabaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Meliaceae, Burseraceae, Myrtaceae and Anacardiaceae. It is an important Bird Area with many biome-restricted bird species such as blue-naped pitta (nipalensis), <b>purple</b> <b>cochoa</b> (purpurea), chestnut-headed tesia (castaneocoronata), pale-footed bush warbler (Cettia pallidipes) and greater rufous-headed parrotbill (Paradoxornis ruficeps). It is rich {{with a variety of}} insect species, as also many species of reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|The Phawngpui National Park is {{the natural}} home of a {{wonderful}} range of birdlife including the rare Blyth's tragopan, falcon, sunbirds, dark-rumped swift, and Mrs. Hume's pheasant, which is the Mizoram state bird, and also rare animals like the mountain goat, slow loris, tiger, leopard, leopard cat, serow, goral, Asiatic black bear, stump-tailed macaque and capped langur. In 2000, rare bird species were recorded such as mountain bamboo partridge, oriental pied hornbill, <b>purple</b> <b>cochoa,</b> striped laughingthrush, grey sibia, black eagle and large-billed crow. The clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa was spotted and documented {{for the first time}} in 1997. [...] The landscape {{is the natural}} habitat of various grasses (in fact is the origin of the name, phawng in Lai dialect means [...] "meadow", and -pui is the suffix for [...] "great"). The steep slopes are covered by orchids and rhododendrons, with areas of bamboos.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the earlier}} {{papers on the}} birds of Namdapha was {{published}} in 1990. The park has about 425 bird species with many more to be recorded from work in the higher areas. There are five species of hornbills recorded from the area. Several species of rare wren-babblers have been recorded in Namdapha. Other bird groups include laughing thrushes, parrotbills, fulvettas, shrike babblers and scimitar babblers. The snowythroated babbler is a rare species of babbler found only in the Patkai and Mishmi hills and nearby areas in Northern Myanmar, is found in Namdapha. Other rare, restricted range or globally endangered species include the rufous-necked hornbill, green cochoa, <b>purple</b> <b>cochoa,</b> beautiful nuthatch, Ward's trogon, ruddy kingfisher, blue-eared kingfisher, white-tailed fish eagle, Eurasian hobby, pied falconet, white-winged wood duck, Himalayan wood-owl, rufous-throated hill-partridge, and whitecheeked hill partridge. Several leaf warblers and migrants such as amur falcon and several thrushes can be seen here. The first mid-winter waterfowl census in Namdapha was conducted in 1994 when species such as the white-bellied heron, a critically endangered bird was recorded for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Several of {{his early}} {{publications}} were based on studies of the bird collection at the BNHS. These include the extension {{in the range of}} Dinopium shorii in the Eastern Ghats, the validity of Otus bakkamoena stewarti, an extension of the range of Asian palm swift Cypsiurus parvus infumatus (north of the Brahmaputra river) In the course of his travels he noted several range extensions including the brown-winged kingfisher from Chilka, Cetti's warbler from Bharatpur, <b>purple</b> <b>cochoa</b> from Mussoorie (western most limit). His finding of the broad-tailed grassbird from Point Calimere opens up the possibility of the species in Sri Lanka, from where an old questionable specimen record exists. In 1972 he visited Narcondam Island to study the Narcondam hornbill, capturing two adult hornbills and their chicks. The two hornbill chicks were taken to Bombay, the male died on the ship journey while the female escaped in Madras, never to be found. The chicks lived for about 6 years, the female showed aggression to the male sibling and an injury to the male resulted in death. Based on his observations he suggested that the species was closer to Rhyticeros plicatus than to Rhyticeros undulatus. In the summer of 1977 he and Salim Ali, went to Bhutan to look for the yellow-rumped honeyguide. He noted the opportunistic behaviour of the honeyguides, making use of the attacks of Vespa mandarinia on the hives of Apis dorsata laboriosa. He also saw a honeyguide in the Valley of Flowers which he suggested should belong to the little-known subspecies radcliffi described by Allan Octavian Hume. He described a new subspecies of the bay owl Phodilus badius (P. b. ripleyi) in 1977. In 1983 he surveyed the black-necked crane in Ladakh. He published several observations made during ringing camps, particularly at Point Calimere. In 1992 he wrote about the distribution and status of the white-winged tit in Kutch.|$|E
