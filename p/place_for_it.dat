25|$|Eumenius {{was born}} in Gallia Lugdunensis at Augustodunum (modern day Autun), the civitas capital of the Celtic Aedui. He was of Greek descent; his grandfather, who had {{migrated}} from Athens to Rome, finally settled at Augustodunum as a teacher of rhetoric. Eumenius probably took his fathers <b>place,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was from Augustodunum {{that he went to}} be magister memoriae (private secretary) to the emperor Constantius Chlorus, whom he accompanied on several of his campaigns.|$|E
25|$|CBS had {{originally}} planned {{on making the}} As the World Turns expansion {{at the beginning of}} the new season in September 1975. ABC's daytime schedule was full at the time, and the earliest they could have a spot open on the schedule would be December. This meant that it would be approximately three months at least before Edge would air its first episode on ABC and the network did not want to do that. Instead, a compromise was struck. CBS would keep The Edge of Night on its schedule for the time being, and once ABC found a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> which it did when they cancelled You Don't Say! in November 1975, the expansion and network change would take place.|$|E

25|$|In {{this society}} he soon became known to and patronized {{by people of}} the first rank, and was in names or {{intimacy}} with many of them; particularly the Earl of Burlington, so well known for his taste in the fine arts, especially architecture. For him he painted, among others, a large picture {{of the royal family}} of England: in the middle compartment are all the younger branches of the family on a very large canvas, and on one hand above the door a half length of her majesty Queen Caroline; the picture of the king was intended to fill the niche opposite to it, but Mr. Aikman's death happening before it was begun, the <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> is left blank. This picture came into the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, whose father married Lady Mary Boyle, daughter and only child to the Earl of Burlington.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty <b>place,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
25|$|Once {{recovered}} from injury, Zohar regained his fitness at Maccabi Herzliya before joining Maccabi Netanya. Zohar {{was an instant}} success and started to receive money off the pitch as a spokesperson for local brands. His career was dealt a setback when he was caught hurling racial slurs towards Tzafririm Holon's Ziv Caveda (an Israeli footballer of Ethiopian extraction). In his defense, he claimed that his comments were directed at Holon's Hamisi Amani-Dove (an African American). The event startled the Israel Football Association which never had racism between players {{on the field and}} had no punishment system in <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Aside from receiving a one match ban and ₪5,000 fine, Zohar was publicly lambasted for his words that shook up the football world in Israel that {{was in the middle of}} promoting racial equality in Israel. After being released from his contract in Netanya, club manager, Uri Malmilian, left the club in protest. Zohar rejoined Beitar, where he was a central part of the club and helped steer the club away from the relegation zone of the table. He continued there for another season after which he announced he was retiring from football.|$|E

[...] "Vámonos Negrito" [...] is a tribute to her Latin American roots that she started writing after a show in Colombia and finished in Cuba; in this song, one of her favorites, she tried to create a musical landscape with instruments, textures, and harmonies. The bolero [...] "Antes de Huir", is a [...] "sad and hopeful" [...] song. It is about not letting go of the things we love. [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer" [...] is, according to Lafourcade, an obscure folk-pop song about finding that one cannot be in a relationship anymore; it was written during a concert tour in Monterrey.|$|E

2500|$|The name {{consists}} of two elements; [...] "Culve" [...] and [...] "stan", the second element being Old English for a stone (such as a boundary or standing stone). The meaning of the first element is much less certain, and may derive from a personal name, possibly Cuthwulf. The stone presumably referred to the original folkmoot <b>place,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was common for Anglo-Saxon communities to meet at a specific moot hill, tree or stone, and many Anglo-Saxon hundreds are then named after that specific place. However for Culvestan {{it is not known}} where this original meeting place was, other than within the bounds of the hundred (which may have shifted {{by the time of the}} Domesday survey).|$|E
2500|$|The Period of Reforms (1825–1848) left several lasting {{marks on}} the life of Eger, {{especially}} on its culture. Pyrker László János, the archbishop of that time, founded a gallery which he donated to the Hungarian National Museum because the town did not guarantee an appropriate <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> It was Pyrker's present which served as a base for the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts that was opened in 1900. In 1828 Pyrker established the first Hungarian teachers training college in Eger and {{he was the one who}} ordered the construction of the basilica which was built in neo-classical style, in accordance with the plans of József Hild. On the basis of its size, this basilica is the second among the churches of Hungary.

In the wake of Jews being detained and dying, Trepp saw his role as being part of [...] "a very rewarding rabbinate because the Jews needed me".
