The properties examined included thermal analysis (by T G A and DSC), IR spectroscopy and {{the zero point}} o f charge From D S C analysis {{it was found that}} the ignition point for the peat materials occurred at about 200 °C. Above this temperature there were three exothermic peaks recorded, the first at c 333 °C corresponded to the decomposition of cellulose, the second at c 438 °C to the decomposition of bitumens and/or humic substance and the third at c 479 °C to the decomposition of lignin. The surface area of the <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> was measured by methylene blue dye adsorption, N 2 adsorption and the negative adsorption o f chloride 1 0 ns. The surface areas measured by the three methods were 307, 2 3 and 0 05 m 2 g_l respectively. The variation m surface areas was in keeping with the large differences in surface areas which have been reported for SOM. The sorption of a series of alcohols from vapour and aqueous phase by <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> was also studied. It was found that the sorption of alcohols from the vapour phase decreased in the order ethanol > 2 -propanol > 1 -butanol > 1 -pentanol while the sorption from the aqueous phase decreased in the order 1 -hexanol > 1 -pentanol > 1 - butanol > 2 -propanol > ethanol. The results were inconclusive, but suggested that the sorption from the vapour phase was princ ipally by adsorption followed by absorption into the interior o f the peat, while the sorption from the aqueous phase was princ ipally by adsorption.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{challenges}} associated with {{the determination of the}} Atterberg limits for peat, fundamental issues regarding the appropriateness of Atterberg limit concepts applied to peat and peaty soils and their use in characterising the engineering behaviour of these materials. As demonstrated in the present study, different sample preparation methods and preloading of the peat material (which gives the organic solids some stress history because of their compressible nature) can result in significantly different Atterberg limit values being measured. The significance of reinforcement and scale effects related to the <b>peat</b> <b>fibres</b> for the thread-rolling method is investigated. It is concluded that the Atterberg limit tests are not appropriate for peat in that the deduced plastic range for the peat test material is notional and the calculated liquidity index values are not reliable indicators of its consistency.

40|$|Stability {{assessment}} of existing dikes build on soft soil generates {{questions on the}} available stability calculation techniques and material models. Especially peat behaviour is not easily captured by standard design methods. This has led to disapproval, based on calculations, of dikes {{that have been in}} operation for several hundreds of years. To establish the weak points in the stability assessment prescribed by the available handbooks on dike engineering, a series of 5 field tests is started. These field tests give the option to compare the different design methods and different parameter assessment techniques to the test results. The series includes single stage and multi stage loading. This paper focuses on the single stage loading tests. The tests result in a failure mode that differs from the circular type failure planes that are used in engineering practice. Horizontal and vertical fractures dominate the active side of the failure while at the passive side the peat is compressed. The tests indicate that tensile strength of <b>peat,</b> or <b>peat</b> <b>fibres,</b> is important in understanding stability problems in which thick peat deposits are involved. Furthermore, the tests show that over-consolidated behaviour is important to understand the measurements, while in engineering practice peat is usually modelled as a normally consolidated material...|$|R

The reactivities of these organics with respect to OH radicals and Cl atoms were observed to be affected by the presence and position of halogen atoms and the presence of a carbonyl oxygen atom for haloalkanes and ketones respectively; polarity effects and stenc contributions were also observed to influence the magnitude of the rate constant values. The atmospheric lifetimes calculated for the organics under investigation were all sufficiently short to ensure that they would undergo transformation in the troposphere and thus could not be considered a threat to stratospheric ozone. O f the organic compounds investigated in this work dichloromethane is the most commonly used chemical in the industrial work place, therefore methods of monitoring and removing this compound are important. Biofiltration techniques are currently being considered for tlus purpose as they are efficient, cheap and clean. In this work a laboratory-scale biofilter unit containing <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> as the filter material was used to remove dichloromethane from an artificially generated gas stream.

40|$|Summary Construction on peat soils {{has proven}} to be a {{challenging}} task to civil engineers as this soil type is highly compressible. Especially in densely populated delta area’s as the Rijn or the Maas delta in the western of the Netherlands infrastructure needs to be constructed on soft non-bearing soil layers. Construction on soft soils like peat is frequently accompanied by high geotechnical risks and costs. In conclusion, a peat layer is often unsuitable to use as a founding material. Conventional stabilization techniques have several disadvantages, among which is a strong reduction in the water storage capacity of the peat layer. A novel stabilization method was proposed, which takes infiltration and reactive transport as the starting point. The goal was to strengthen the soil matrix without a significant loss of porosity. The aim was to create a silicate coating which encloses or at least connects the peat fibres, hereafter referred to as fibre encapsulation. It was proposed that encapsulation of the fibre alters the mechanical and chemical bulk properties of a peat layer. Stabilization should have been achieved by infiltration and transport of the reactive components (in-situ process). Transport distances well over 1 meter and low injection pressures increased the efficiency of the stabilization technique and thereby its applicability. The starting point for this research project was the patent “Soil Strengthening Composition” (Zon, 2007). This patent introduces an in-situ treatment method to strengthen the solid matrix of a peat soil. However, several steps in the patented technique are not feasible when applied in the field. Hence, optimization of the patented treatment method and evaluation of its feasibility under continuous flow conditions was necessary. The most critical aspects of the patented method, which were the subjects of optimization, are enumerated below. First of all, a highly concentrated source of silica was required that could function as injection fluid in a peat soil. A high silica load would reduce the number of flushes needed to stabilize a certain bulk volume. However, a distinctive characteristic of a peat soil is acidic to neutral pH conditions. The presence of silica in solution is restricted to concentrations less than 100 mg Si per liter in the pH range of 2 to 9. 5 at soil temperature. To increase the efficiency of the treatment method the load of silica in the injection fluid had to be elevated well above the solubility product of amorphous silica. Therefore the phase transition of silica, from dissolved to solid form, needed to be inhibited or at least delayed. The biopolymer Celquat L 200 was added to retard the polymerization process of silica and the subsequent growth of silica particles. Silica and the biopolymer were thereby the reactive components of the injection fluid. Secondly, a hardened layer of amorphous silica had to encapsulate the <b>peat</b> <b>fibre.</b> Mass transfer of silica from the pore fluid to fibre surface was therefore needed. Preservation of porosity was the aim. Hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity of the layer had to be retained. Thirdly, infiltration was the method of choice to transport and place the reactive components. The horizontal hydraulic conductivity of a peat layer had to be 10 - 6 to 10 - 7 m/s or higher to obtain significant transport distances in one week. This was a crucial aspect to develop a promising in-situ stabilization technique. Objective and research questions The general objective was stabilization of peat through the formation of a silica based coating supplied by infiltration of the reactants. To reach the general objective, the critical aspects of the stabilization method as patented by Van der Zon (2007) were studied separately. The research parts concerned: (I) retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth, (II) attachment of silica to peat solids, and (III) infiltration of injection fluid trough peat. The related research questions are shortly described below. Retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth The injection fluid had to be a highly concentrated source of silicon at neutral to acid pH conditions. It was proposed that the concentration of dissolved and dispersed colloidal silica in the injection fluid could be elevated by the addition of the biopolymer Celquat L 200. The following questions were formulated: -	Does the biopolymer retard the polymerization process silica and the growth of silica particles? And what is the optimum composition of the injection fluid in terms of initial silica and biopolymer concentration? -	What is the impact of dissolved and particulate organic matter on the efficiency of the biopolymer to retard silica polymerization and to retard silica particle growth? -	What is the impact of the biopolymer on the zeta potential, as measure for the surface charge of a particle? Attachment of silica to <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> surface Attachment of silica to peat solids had to be obtained to improve the mechanical properties of the bulk material. However, repulsion between fibre surface and silica species in pore water was likely to oppose attachment of silica to fibre surface. In neutral to acid pH conditions, the surface charge of peat is negative. The surface charge of dissolved or colloidal silica is neutral to negative at pH values lower than 9. 5. Equal charged surfaces result into repulsion. The proposed solution was again the use of cationic biopolymer Celquat L 200 to initiate attachment between <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> and silica. The following research questions were formulated: -	Does the biopolymer Celquat L 200 initiate silica attachment to peat solids? And what is the optimum initial concentration of silica in the injection fluid to maximize attachment? Infiltration of injection fluid in peat To achieve transport distances well over one meter of the reactive components through peat three conditions need to be met. The following research questions were formulated: -	Is the hydraulic conductivity of the peat material high enough to allow reasonable horizontal flow velocities with a limited pressure gradient (at least 10 - 6 to 10 - 7 m/sec) ? -	Is the volume fraction of pores that conducts flow in peat large enough to allow sufficient stabilization of the bulk volume? -	What is the impact of infiltration of the reactive fluid on hydraulic conductivity of peat? Do the reactive components, silica and biopolymer, attach and precipitate preferably on the peat fibres, and not in the pore space where precipitation could lead complete clogging? Experimental Methods The feasibility of the proposed stabilization technique was determined based on laboratory research. To answer the specific research questions, three laboratory experiments were performed. A batch experiment was performed to research the design of the injection fluid (Retardation of silica…). A batch experiment in the presence of peat was performed to research attachment of silica to peat (Attachment of silica…). At last, an infiltration experiment was performed to investigate the transport of the reactive components and to evaluate the effect of injection on the porosity of a peat column (Infiltration of injection fluid…). Peat material as used in the Attachment and Infiltration experiments originated from Bellingwedde. The infiltration test an extra type of peat was tested that originated from location close to Zegveld. Peat from Bellingwedde was a reed-sedge bog peat. Peat from Zegveld was a fen peat classified as sedge type of peat. The materials and methods used to answer the research questions, as formulated for the three separate research parts, are shortly described in this section. Retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth The polymerization and aggregation of silica was monitored in the presence of the biopolymer Celquat L 200. Flasks were prepared with an initial silica concentration of 100, 300, 600 or 1250 ppm SiO 2 using sodium metasilicate as the source of silicon. These flasks contained a biopolymer to silica weight ratio of 1 to 1, 0. 5 to 1 or 0. 1 to 1. The polymerization reactions were induced by neutralizing the super saturated alkaline silica solution (from pH > 12 to 7. 5) and monitored by the time-dependent depletion of dissolved silica and time-dependent particle formation and growth. The experiment was completed 113 hours after pH adjustment. Attachment of silica to <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> surface The attachment efficiency of silica to peat solids was determined at initial concentrations of 60, 100, 300, 600 and 1250 ppm as SiO 2; and a biopolymer to silicate wt. ratio of 1. The distribution of silica and biopolymer between the liquid and the solid phase in presence of peat was the subject of research. The amount of silicate and biopolymer in the solid phase was calculated from the difference between the initial dissolved concentration before adjustment of pH and the final dissolved concentration after exposure to peat. The starting point of the attachment test was the moment the pH was adjusted to 7. 5. The dissolved concentration of silica and biopolymer were measured after 65 hours and 113 hours of incubation. Infiltration of injection fluid in peat To derive the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of Bellingwedde and Zegveld peat a constant head test was performed. By in line electrical conductivity measurements and analyses of effluent composition at specific time intervals breakthrough curves of tracer infiltration and elution were constructed. Five peat columns were treated. Injection and elution of sodium chloride solution (0. 09 and 0. 07 M) was performed. Injection and elution of saturated silica solution (217. 5 and 199. 5 ppm SiO 2) was performed; followed by the injection and partial elution of reactive colloidal suspensions (1247 ppm and 705 ppm SiO 2 / ppm L 200). And the fifth column was infiltrated with a biopolymer solution of 1962 ppm L 200. Conclusions The conclusions drawn per research part are described below. These conclusions are directly related to the results of the experimental tests. In the next section the implication of these conclusions for the feasibility of in-situ stabilization of peat soil by infiltration of reactants, is given. Retardation of silica polymerization and silica particle growth The biopolymer Celquat L 200 does effectively retard the polymerization process of silica. Dissolved silica concentrations of 300 to 400 ppm SiO 2 were achieved. The efficiency in which the biopolymer retards the polymerization of silica does not depend on initial silica concentration and biopolymer dosage. The biopolymer Celquat L 200 does effectively retard the growth of silica particles and this does depend on initial silica concentration and biopolymer dosage. Colloidal suspensions were formed during the 113 hours of incubation. Optimum composition of the injection fluid is obtained at initial silica concentration of 600 ppm SiO 2 and the 600 ppm biopolymer Celquat L 200. Attachment of silica to <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> surface The biopolymer Celquat L 200 effectively adsorbs to peat in the presence and absence of silica; 90 % to 99 % of the biopolymer initially added was removed from solution. Attachment of silica to peat solids in the presence of the biopolymer Celquat L 200 is effective; 79 % to 90 % of silica was removed from solution in the presence of the biopolymer Celquat L 200. Infiltration of injection fluid in peat It appeared not to be possible to obtain sufficient infiltration of the injection fluid in the peat columns (with permeabilities of 10 - 6 and 10 - 7 m/s). A hard transparent gel was observed at the inlet on the interface between the porous disc and the peat. Penetration of the gel was in the order of millimeters. It appeared that the attachment was too fast to get sufficient infiltration. This has to be researched further before the method can be used in the field. Implications for the Application Solely based on present results in-situ stabilization of peat is not feasible, though the performed research is far from complete. If significant transport distances of the reactants can be obtained in-situ stabilization of peat might be feasible. And significant transport distances might be achieved if the attachment of silica is delayed. It should however be noted, that the intrinsic hydrologic properties of a peat soil complicates infiltration of reactants – irrespective of the properties of the reactants. Given the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of peat, the small pore volume that actually conducts flow and the heterogeneity of the aspects on small and bulk scale, the question arises if the method could be efficient and under which conditions. That is, efficient in the period of infiltration needed and the bulk strength obtained within this period. In-situ stabilization would provide a solution for a niche of the construction-market on soft soils. The focus is at applications where time is not a constrain. Treatment could then be applied as long-term method; with the advantage of preservation of water storage capacity of the peat layer, and low burden to the surroundings, as opposed to the common applied long term method of preloading. A better assessment could be made if in-situ stabilization or even mixed in place stabilization technique is the method of choice for a specific type of peat; or if they are at all efficient methods to apply; in the case chemical and botanic characteristics of peat are known. This aspect should be acknowledged when aiming for optimization of the mechanical properties of peat – and therefore included in geotechnical research on behavior and stabilization of peat soils...|$|E

40|$|Pore dilation, the {{compaction}} of humic acids on <b>peat</b> <b>fibres</b> due to {{the process}} of flocculation, causes the hydraulic conductivity of peat to increase with increasing pore water electrical conductivity. This is a reversible process and a reduction in the pore water conductivity produces a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity {{due to the}} constriction of pores. We verify how this dilation and constriction of pores, resulting from the application of artificial pore water (primarily deionized water), affects laboratory measurements of the hydraulic conductivity of peat. Repeat measurements of the hydraulic conductivity were performed on samples of Sphagnum peat. It is shown that the application of deionized water during constant head permeameter tests causes a significant decrease in the hydraulic conductivity. Between tests, the hydraulic conductivity of the peat continues to decline without an associate decrease in the pore water electrical conductivity because of a lagged pore constriction effect. We suggest that the use of artificially high or low pore water electrical conductivities, during laboratory hydraulic conductivity measurements, is likely to lead to significant errors. Experimental protocols must, therefore, be revised to take better account of the pore water chemistry. The ionic concentrations of the natural pore fluid should be replicated during hydraulic conductivity tests, either by using pore fluid extracted from the study site or by artificially replicating the major ionic composition of the natural pore fluid. In addition, prior to the hydraulic conductivity measurements, peat samples should be flushed with this solution until the hydraulic conductivity stabilizes and the samples subsequently allowed to equilibrat...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to develop robust tools and {{policies}} for stability and hazard risk assessments in order to manage upland peat landslides in locations such as the British Isles where they have frequently occurred and caused harm to the environment. One of the particular difficulties is that reliable values of peat strength are difficult to obtain. The objectives of this research were to establish the nature of any relationships between the strength characteristics and the botanical, {{physical and chemical properties}} of the peat, and to determine whether palaeobotanical analyses of samples of the basal peat can provide a reliable indication of potential instability in upland blanket bogs. The research was carried out at the Straduff Townland (Co. Sligo), Slieve Anierin (Co. Leitrim) and Slieve Rushen (Co. Cavan) landslides, all located in northwest Ireland, from the margins of which monolith and core peat samples were collected. Standard and validated paleobotanical, chemical and geotechnical protocols, modified or refined where necessary to suit the nature of the peat, were used in the study. The triaxial, direct shear and tensile strength tests were conducted using experimental very low stress conditions in order to fully replicate in-situ conditions. The reliability of the measured strength parameters was examined by performing deterministic and probabilistic stability analyses of the failed slopes using industry-standard „limit equilibrium‟ software (SLOPE/W). The nature, extent and spatial distribution of the hydrocarbons unexpectedly found in the basal peats during the fieldwork were also investigated. This research found that blanket peat dominated by monocotyledons (with mainly E. vaginatum) is likely to be susceptible to failure because its „effective structural properties‟, specifically the high degree of humification and low fibre content of its basal peat, cause it to have very low strength and also therefore a very low bearing capacity. Furthermore, monocotyledons or its remains in peat have morphological, chemical, biological features that can promote bogflow-type failure. These may include for example (i) their parallel and elongated leaf veinations that promote flow, (ii) the genesis of hydrocarbons such as bitumen from their lignified tissues and (ii) being host to a hydrocarbon-producing aphid Colopha compressa. Laboratory measurements of undrained strength of the weak basal peats were consistently < 3 kPa, and deterministic stability analyses revealed that the value of the tensile strength can be used as an indicator of the undrained shear strength. A new classification (i. e. "the modified fibre content scheme") and a modified procedure for assessing upland peat failure for construction projects has been proposed based on <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> and humification characteristics and their apparent influences on peat strength. Deposits of hydrocarbons such as bitumens within the basal peat constitute a previously unrecognised factor that probably contributed to the occurrence of the studied landslides due to their hydrophobic properties...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of research conducted to define the response of peat foundations underlying railway embankments to heavy axle loads. Three field sites were investigated, two in Northern Alberta on Canadian National Railway’s Edson and Lac-La-Biche subdivisions, and one on the Lévis subdivision in southern Quebec. The scope of this thesis is fourfold: the development and installation of instrumentation; the laboratory testing of peat specimens retrieved from each site; the development of a conceptual model for the behaviour of peat beneath an embankment subjected to heavy axle loads; and finally, the modelling of the strength of the peat foundations relative to the applied loads. The first component of this research included the development and installation of instrumentation to measure in situ the distribution and magnitude of strain and pore pressure generation. The development included the assembly of instrumentation systems to measure all of the required parameters, and the development of the ShapeAccelArrayTM (SAA) from Measurand Inc. to measure horizontal cyclic motion under train loading. It was found the SAA, as provided by the manufacturer, was not able to provide accurate measurements of displacement. A method for determining the magnitude of cyclic displacement from the output of the MEMS accelerometers was developed from the laboratory testing data done as part of this study. This resulted in the ability to obtain a profile of cyclic displacement with depth. The second component of the research was the laboratory testing of peat specimens retrieved from the sites. Consolidated undrained triaxial tests and direct shear tests were conducted on remoulded peat, remoulded <b>peat</b> <b>fibre</b> and Shelby specimens of peat to investigate the fundamental mechanisms which control the strength of peat. The results were analyzed within the frameworks of elastic behaviour of cross-anisotropic materials and shear strength of fibre-reinforced soil. The test results from samples collected at all three sites were compared and the influence of peat fibres on the undrained strength was explored. The third component was the development of conceptual models for the undrained behaviour of peat, and peat foundations subjected to moving axle loads. A model for peat was developed from the cross-anisotropic response observed during the laboratory testing and correlations to fibre reinforced soil literature. This material model was then applied to the spatial distribution of stresses and orientation of principal stresses below embankments. The final component of the project was an analysis of the field data collected from all three sites to provide the magnitude and distribution of strain and pore pressure generation developed within the peat foundations. Further analysis of the measured response was conducted with both with calculations of effective stress paths and finite element modelling to determine the distribution of stress, the locations of potential yielding within the foundations and to determine how close to yielding the peat is under the maximum applied stresses. The results of this thesis provide new tools for the railway industry to evaluate the response and stability of railway embankments over peat foundations. The development of the SAA allows for the in situ measurement of the magnitude and distribution of displacement, and from this the strain, within soft soils under heavy axle loading. The conceptual models developed and applied to the undrained response of peat foundations provide a framework to evaluate the stability of railway embankments over soft foundations. The results of the application of this framework to the study sites included in this thesis provide context for further investigations...|$|E

Natural and waste product materials showed high adsorption capacity for metals and organic pollutants and {{proved to be a}} good alternative to commercial adsorbents. Adsorption of Pb, Cu, Zn and Cr onto <b>peat</b> moss, <b>fibre</b> sludge ash, pine bark, sawdust, shrimp shells and seaweed was studied in batch adsorption systems. Artificial solutions and real landfill leachates were used. All the materials showed high uptake of metals from solutions with a concentration range typical for severely polluted groundwater. The adsorption capacities found for the conditions applied were 1. 3  1. 8 mgg 1. Materials having the highest uptake for metals, including <b>peat</b> moss, <b>fibre</b> sludge ash and bark were further studied in column experiments for possible implementation in treatment of leachate at a landfill. The adsorption capacities for adsorption from the artificial solution were one order of magnitude higher than those for the real leachate. This was attributed to competition between different metals for adsorption sites {{in the case of the}} leachate. These results may indicate that laboratory tests with artificial solutions can overestimate the performance of an adsorbent, and that specific experiments using real leachates are needed when a water treatment application is developed. A peat-ash mixture showed lower adsorption capacity than the peat itself, and these materials are suggested to be used separately. The presence of Fe in the solution reduced the adsorption of all studied metals to half the normal. Thus, Fe precipitation is recommended as a pretreatment step. Adsorption of Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu and Zn in low concentrations onto peat and ash was studied in detail since adsorption mechanisms were suggested to depend on concentration. Kinetic and equilibrium batch adsorption studies were conducted and data complied with a second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model. An empirical model for predicting adsorption of metal ions at a given time was derived from kinetic model constants. Possible mechanisms of adsorption onto biosorbents and mineral surfaces were summarised and suggestions made for the mechanisms of adsorption onto peat and ash. An explanation for the orders of affinity of metal ions to adsorption sites found was proposed on the basis of the chemical properties of the metals.

Moreover, according to their low expected running period, their implementation remains expensive, such as activated carbon which induce overweening costs (> 100, 000 €[*]an− 1 for the treatment of 40, 000 m 3 h− 1 with a 60 -s empty bed gas residence time). Considering economical aspects, physico-chemical and biological properties, pines barks, composted wood mulch and expanded schist seem fit for this application. The performance of these materials was therefore investigated in a pilot-scale study conducted on a rendering site. According to its appropriate pH (8. 62) and water-holding capacity (1. 41 g g− 1) and its highest nutrients content and colonization at the biofilter start-up (93 g of ATP m− 3, 29. 1013 CFU m− 3), composted would mulch show the best odour removal efficiency during the 134 days of operation. Performances ranged between 75 and 93 % for the treatment of odourous inlet load between 1. 16 and 10. 10 [*]*[*] 106 ouE m− 3 h− 1 with an empty bed gas residence time of 47 s. However, the pressure drop of the compost bed decreased, suggesting structural changes which may impact the performances in the long term...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} styrene was studied using 2 biofilters packed with <b>peat</b> and coconut <b>fibre</b> (BF 1 -P and BF 2 -C, respectively) and 1 {{biotrickling}} filter (BTF) packed with plastic rings. Two inoculation procedures were applied: an enriched culture with strain Pseudomonas putida CECT 324 for biofilters and activated sludge from a municipal {{wastewater treatment plant}} for the BTF. Inlet loads (ILs) between 10 and 45 g m- 3 h- 1 and empty bed residence times (EBRTs) from 30 to 120 s were applied. At inlet concentrations ranging between 200 and 400 mg Nm- 3, removal efficiencies between 70 and 95 % were obtained in the 3 bioreactors. Maximum elimination capacities (ECs) of 81 and 39 g m- 3 h- 1 were obtained for {{the first quarter of the}} BF 1 -P and BF 2 -C, respectively (IL of 173 g m- 3 h- 1 and EBRT of 60 s in BF 1 -P; IL of 89 g m- 3 h- 1 and EBRT of 90 s in BF 2 -C). A maximum EC of 52 g m- 3 h- 1 was obtained for the first third of the BTF (IL of 116 g m- 3 h- 1, EBRT of 45 s). Problems regarding high pressure drop appeared in the peat biofilter, whereas drying episodes occurred in the coconut fibre biofilter. DGGE revealed that the pure culture used for biofilter inoculation was not detected by day 105. Although 2 different inoculation procedures were applied, similar styrene removal at the end of the experiments was observed. The use as inoculum of activated sludge from {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} appears a more feasible option...|$|R
