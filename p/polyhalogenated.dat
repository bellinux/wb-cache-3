5000|$|Trimethylindium (abbr: TMI or TMIn), In(CH3)3, (CAS #: 3385-78-2) is the {{preferred}} organometallic source of indium for metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) of indium-containing compound semiconductors, such as InP, InAs, InN, InSb, GaInAs, InGaN, AlGaInP, AlInP, AlInGaNP, etc. TMI is a white, crystalline and sublimable solid, with melting point 88 °C. TMI is pyrophoric (ignites spontaneously upon contact with air), and its decomposition is often found to be uncontrollable as the temperature of its surrounding exceeds its melting point (i.e. > 88 °C) and reaches 101 °C and above. TMI is also reported to exhibit autocatalytic behavior during its thermal decomposition. [...] TMI therefore needs to be handled with the utmost care and caution, e.g. stored in preferably cool, dry place at 0-25 °C, and operating temperatures under 50 °C {{in order to avoid}} deterioration. TMI also reacts extremely violently with oxidizers and <b>polyhalogenated</b> compounds (such as CCl4 or CBrCl3), with which TMI is therefore incompatible. Hence, mixtures of TMI with oxidizers and/or <b>polyhalogenated</b> compounds must be avoided as they are potentially dangerous and explosive.|$|E

50|$|POPs {{typically}} are halogenated organic compounds (see lists below) {{and as such}} exhibit high lipid solubility. For this reason, they bioaccumulate in fatty tissues. Halogenated compounds also exhibit great stability reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward hydrolysis and photolytic degradation. The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus <b>polyhalogenated</b> organic compounds are of particular concern. They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels. Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as PBTs (Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic) or TOMPs (Toxic Organic Micro Pollutants).|$|E
5000|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers or PBDEs, are organobromine {{compounds that}} are used as flame retardant.

They are structurally akin to the PCBs and other <b>polyhalogenated</b> compounds, consisting of two halogenated aromatic rings. PBDEs are classified according to the average number of bromine atoms in the molecule. The health hazards of these chemicals have attracted increasing scrutiny, and they have been shown to reduce fertility in humans at levels found in households. [...] Their chlorine analogs are polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs). Because of their toxicity and persistence, the industrial production of some PBDEs is restricted under the Stockholm Convention, a treaty to control and phase out major persistent organic pollutants (POPs).|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to dechlorination of CAHs, microbes {{have also been}} reported to act on chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. An example of a reaction where aromatic AOX content has been reduced is demonstrated in figure 2 above. While {{little is known about}} the dehalogenation mechanisms of <b>polyhalogenated</b> phenols (PHPs) and <b>polyhalogenated</b> benzenes (PHBs), regioselectivity for halide location on the aromatic ring was observed. This regioselectivity is however dominated by both redox potentials for the reaction and the microbe's familiarity to the reaction. Moreover, due to the specificity of most microbes along with complex aromatic structures, in order to achieve a complete dehalogenation, a mixture of more than one species of bacteria and/or fungi (often known as a consortium) is utilized. [...] The reaction in figure 2 shows the reductive debromination of 2,4,6 Tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) by Ochrabactrum. Based on the relative degradation of the molecule along with analytical results, it has been postulated that degradation of 2,4,6-TBP proceeds through debromination of ortho-bromine in the first step by a dehalogenase to yield 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP). Since there are two ortho bromines, debromination of either ortho carbons would yield the same product [...] Other species such as Pseudomonas galthei or Azotobacter sp. showed preference for para-halide over the meta- or ortho -halides. For example, the Azotobacter sp. degrades 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) into 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone due to TCP-4-monooxygenase selectivity differences between ortho- and para-halide. These differences in regioselectivity between the species can be attributed to the specificity of the 3-dimensional enzyme structure and its hindrance from steric interactions. It has been postulated that a proton lost by the phenol group of 2,4,6-TBP resulting in the formation of a negatively charged halo-phenolate ion. Subsequent attack of the para-carbon with a hydride anion from NAD(P)H in a nucleophilic attack manner and resonance rearrangement results in substitution of bromine with hydride and formation of 2,4-DBP. Subsequent steps in a similar pattern yield 2-bromophenol, and phenol in the final step. Phenol can be metabolized by microorganisms to make methane and carbon dioxide or can be extracted easier than AOXs.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenolic}} {{hydroxyl group}} of tyrosine residue plays {{a crucial role}} in the structure and function of many proteins.

In this study, we found, unexpectedly, that the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine can be rapidly and efficiently modified by tetrafluoro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone and other <b>polyhalogenated</b> quinones, which are the major genotoxic and carcinogenic quinoid metabolites of <b>polyhalogenated</b> aromatic compounds. The modification was found to be mainly due to the formation of a variety of fluoroquinone-O-tyrosine conjugates and their hydroxylated derivatives via nucleophilic substitution pathway. Analogous modifications were observed for tyrosine-containing peptides. Further studies showed that the blockade of the reactive phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine in the substrate peptide, even by very low concentration of tetrafluoro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone, can prevent the kinase catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation.

40|$|A new {{thermodynamic}} model for calculating the dissociation constants of complexes formed between the {{aryl hydrocarbon receptor}} (AhR) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is reported. The free energies of binding of PCBs to AhR are controlled by their lipophilicities, electron affinities, and entropies. The corresponding physicochemical properties of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans also control their interactions with AhR.

The reported methodology is likely to be applicable to other <b>polyhalogenated</b> and mixed <b>polyhalogenated</b> bi- and terphenyls and related xenobiotics; thus, it could minimize the number of in vivo studies in laboratory animals and facilitate the identification of potentially hazardous aromatic xenobiotics...|$|E
