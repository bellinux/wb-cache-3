40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to experimentally investigate the payload sensitivity of model-based control algorithms for the class of vertically articulated industrial manipulators with high torque amplification drive systems. Once the pay-load sensitivity was established, the minimum subset of payload parameters required to <b>permit</b> <b>payload</b> invariant tracking performance was determined. Analysis of open-loop feedforward compensation torques correctly predicted the experimental PUMA results. High amplification drive sys-tems reduce, but do not eliminate, the payload sensitivity of industrial manipulator dynamics. Model-based controllers must adapt to payload variation in order to maintain high speed tracking accuracy. For a wide range of end-effector payload, the payload estimation/adaptation algorithm for the large positioning links need only compensate for variation in payload mass. To accurately adapt to changes in small link dynamics, the algorithm must estimate both the payload mass and centroid. Knowledge of payload sensitivity can re-duce the complexity of all model-based adaptation schemes and bring them a step closer to routine implementation. 1...|$|R

IAX {{was developed by}} the open source community for the Asterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and is targeted primarily at Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it can be used with streaming video or any other type of multimedia. IAX is an "all in one " protocol for handling multimedia in IP networks. It combines both control and media services in the same protocol. In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall management. IAX employs a compact encoding that decreases bandwidth usage and is well suited for Internet telephony service. In addition, its open nature <b>permits</b> new <b>payload</b> type additions needed to support additional services.

40|$|Life {{support systems}} are an {{enabling}} technology {{and have become}} integral {{to the success of}} living and working in space. As NASA embarks on human exploration and development of space to open the space frontier by exploring, using and enabling the development of space and to expand the human experience into the far reaches of space, it becomes imperative, for considerations of safety, cost, and crew health, to minimize consumables and increase the autonomy of the life support system. Utilizing advanced life support technologies increases this autonomy by reducing mass, power, and volume necessary for human support, thus <b>permitting</b> larger <b>payload</b> allocations for science and exploration. Two basic classes of life support systems must be developed, those directed toward applications on transportation/habitation vehicles (e. g., Space Shuttle, International Space Station (ISS), next generation launch vehicles, crew-tended stations/observatories, planetary transit spacecraft, etc.) and those directed toward applications on the planetary surfaces (e. g., lunar or Martian landing spacecraft, planetary habitats and facilities, etc.). In general, it can be viewed as those systems compatible with microgravity and those compatible with hypogravity environments. Part B of the Appendix defines the technology development 'Roadmap' to be followed in providing the necessary systems for these missions. The purpose of this Project Plan is to define the Project objectives, Project-level requirements, the management organizations responsible for the Project throughout its life cycle, and Project-level resources, schedules and controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} Cassini mission {{concept for}} intensive Saturn exploration included dual atmospheric probes - to Titan and Saturn. The Saturn probe {{was lost in}} Cassini Project cost reduction, but the Saturn atmospheric goals are still important to the planetary science community - especially it measurements can be acquired during synoptic coverage by the Cassini Orbiter. New advanced technology and design heritage from the Pluto Fast Flyby mission permit a low cost mission concept for launch early {{in the first decade}} of the 21 st century, in time to take advantage of the Cassini spacecraft being in orbit around Saturn. This paper will describe such a concept. The mini-probe carrier can be a relatively simple design, depending on a solar array/battery power system design instead of Radioactive Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) with their attendant programmatic complexities, costs, and constraints. The Atlas IIAS/Star 48 B, Proton, and STS with upper stage are launch vehicle options which <b>permit</b> modest <b>payload</b> deliveries to Saturn with relatively short flight times (3 to 4 years) such that the mini-probes arrive in the time period when the Cassini Orbiter is operating at Saturn.

40|$|Modern exploit {{payloads}} {{in commercial}} and open-source penetration testing frameworks have grown much {{more advanced than}} the traditional shellcode they replaced. These <b>payloads</b> <b>permit</b> interactive access without launching a shell, network proxying, and many other rich features. Available payload frameworks have several limitations, however. They make little use of encryption to secure delivery and communications, especially in earlier stage payloads. In addition, their richer features require a constant network connection to the penetration tester, making them unsuitable against mobile clients, such as laptops, PDAs, and smart phones. This work introduces a first-stage exploit payload that is able to securely establish an encrypted channel using ElGamal key agreement and the RC 4 stream cipher. The key agreement implementation requires only modular exponentiation and RC 4 also lends itself to an implementation requiring a very small amount of executable code. This secure channel is used to send further executable code and deliver a fully-featured interpreter to execute mission logic written in the high-level Lua scripting language. This scripting environment permits secure code delivery as well as disconnected operation and execution of penetration testing mission logic. ...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal {{permeation}} enhancers (PEs) are {{key components}} in ∼ 12 oral peptide formulations {{in clinical trials}} {{for a range of}} molecules, primarily insulin and glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP- 1) analogs. The main PEs comprise medium chain fatty acid-based systems (sodium caprate, sodium caprylate, and N-[8 -(2 -hydroxybenzoyl) amino] caprylate (SNAC)), bile salts, acyl carnitines, and EDTA. Their mechanism of action is complex with subtle differences between the different molecules. With the exception of SNAC and EDTA, most PEs fluidize the plasma membrane causing plasma membrane perturbation, as well as enzymatic and intracellular mediator changes that lead to alteration of intestinal epithelial tight junction protein expression. The question arises as to whether PEs can cause irreversible epithelial damage and tight junction openings sufficient to <b>permit</b> co-absorption of <b>payloads</b> with bystander pathogens, lipopolysaccharides and its fragment, or exo- and endotoxins that may be associated with sepsis, inflammation and autoimmune conditions. Most PEs seem to cause membrane perturbation to varying extents that is rapidly reversible, and overall evidence of pathogen co-absorption is generally lacking. It is unknown however, whether the intestinal epithelial damage-repair cycle is sustained during repeat-dosing regimens for chronic therapy...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the Citation X was first announced at the National Business Aviation Association Convention in New Orleans in October 1990, with the first prototype making its maiden flight on December 21, 1993. Originally scheduled for August 1995, the certification of the Cessna Citation X was delayed several times. First, failure of the airframe and engine to meet Federal Aviation Administration requirements caused the planned certification date postponement to late November 1995. The main delay reasons were troubles integrating the avionics and the engine to the aircraft, high-altitude and low-speed engine flame out (high wing attack angles caused insufficient airflow), engines not meeting the bird strike criteria, and directional stability challenges. Efforts to increase the maximum take-off weight of the Citation X by about 800 pounds again delayed the FAA certification schedule, this time to April 1996. These changes were aimed at <b>permitting</b> a full-fuel <b>payload</b> of 1,400 pounds (seven passengers), but Cessna had difficulty achieving a balance between reducing Citation X cabin noise and minimizing the extra weight of sound-dampening materials. The certification, FAA FAR Part 25, Amendment 74, Certification 3, was finally achieved on June 3, 1996.|$|R
50|$|A variant {{fitted to}} the British Royal Navy's Leander class frigate {{differed}} in several respects {{from the original}} Australian version designed {{to operate in the}} Pacific. The Royal Navy required changes to the frequencies used, to enable Ikara {{to be used in the}} NATO area, where different electronic warfare conditions and international frequency agreements had to be taken into account. Neither the Australian-built analogue computer system, or the American Bunker Ramo Corporation 133 digital computer system, used in most RAN systems, were compatible with the ADA digital battle-control computers being fitted into Royal Navy ships, and this was also changed. The UK-manufactured version of the Mark 44 torpedo also differed from the US-built version purchased by the Australians for their Ikara missiles. The British also required the missile payload to be changeable aboard ship to <b>permit</b> different <b>payload</b> combinations to be used, including a Nuclear Depth Bomb (NDB) option, and this, together with the different internal ship layouts required further changes to the missile, storage and handling arrangements. The Australian practice was to combine the missile and payload at a shore-based ordnance facility, before issuing the complete unit to a ship. Repair or maintenance was only possible ashore, whereas in the British ships, the changes made enabled a faulty torpedo to be removed and replaced on a functioning missile, and thereby increasing the flexibility of use of very limited stocks aboard; especially on lengthy deployments around the globe, as was more common with British ships than their Australian counterparts. The facility to change a torpedo payload aboard ship also permitted a change from a conventional torpedo to a WE.177A NDB, a facility for a nuclear option that was not needed on ships fitted with the Australian variant of Ikara. The British launcher also differed, covered by a zareba when not in use to prevent icing in northern waters and hyper accurate in training in bearing. It was also notoriously noisy.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 24 - 27, 1983 / Sheraton-Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaAn {{unprecedented}} {{challenge to}} NASA’s data systems is {{presented by the}} operational Space Transportation System and the attendant planned permanent facilities in space. Large, extremely high data rate experiments are now possible. More importantly, re-visit capabilities <b>permit</b> in-orbit <b>payload</b> change-out, precluding conventional ground testing of the total system. End-to-end data system engineering and flexible architectural design are mandatory if this challenge is to be met economically and effectively. A simple, top-level logical reference model of the end-to-end data system is being developed, which identifies the numerous functions and services which every automated space data system must provide. Each function or service may be mapped into specific physical subsystems, so that interface relationships are evident and “standard” protocols may be identified for development. By virture of this interface standardization, subsystems can be designed not only independently and in parallel, but with confidence that when the subsystems are aggregated the end-to-end system will operate efficiently and at low cost. A second purpose of the model is to identify technical opportunities for interoperability between the space data networks owned by different agencies or countries, thereby promoting cooperative international cross support of space missions. Fully-automated virtual connection between an investigator and a sensor in space is postulated, with the intervening system being fully transparent regardless of the physical configuration or ownership of that system. To date this standardization effort has been principally directed toward a problem unique to space missions, namely the space to ground link. Mature “Guidelines” have been prepared for the formatting and coding of telemetry data, and these guidelines are being coordinated with approximately 12 other countries who have significant space activity. Other developmental Guidelines include telecommand formats and protocols, timetags, radio frequency/modulation techniques, and globally interpretable methods for the exchange of {{many different types of}} message data. A formal work-flow has been established whereby these Guidelines progress from concept papers to initial drafts (“White Books”), then through iterative review cycles where they exist as Drafts (“Red Books”) and finally as completed Guidelines (“Blue Books”).

40|$|Fluorescent imaging {{offers the}} ability to monitor {{biological}} functions, in this case biological responses to space-related environments. For plants, fluorescent imaging can include general health indicators such as chlorophyll fluorescence as well as specific metabolic indicators such as engineered fluorescent reporters. This paper describes the Flex Imager a fluorescent imaging payload designed for Middeck Locker deployment and now tested on multiple flight and flight-related platforms. The Flex Imager and associated payload elements have been developed {{with a focus on}} ‘flexibility’ allowing for multiple imaging modalities and change-out of individual imaging or control components in the field. The imaging platform is contained within the standard Middeck Locker spaceflight form factor, with components affixed to a baseplate that permits easy rearrangement and fine adjustment of components. The Flex Imager utilizes standard software packages to simplify operation, operator training, and evaluation by flight provider flight test engineers, or by researchers processing the raw data. Images are obtained using a commercial cooled CCD image sensor, with light-emitting diodes for excitation and a suite of filters that allow biological samples to be imaged over wavelength bands of interest. Although baselined for the monitoring of green fluorescent protein and chlorophyll fluorescence from Arabidopsis samples, the Flex Imager <b>payload</b> <b>permits</b> imaging of any biological sample contained within a standard 10 cm by 10 cm square Petri plate. A sample holder was developed to secure sample plates under different flight profiles while permitting sample change-out should crewed operations be possible. In addition to crew-directed imaging, autonomous or telemetric operation of the payload is also a viable operational mode. An infrared camera has also been integrated into the Flex Imager payload to allow concurrent fluorescent and thermal imaging of samples. The Flex Imager has been utilized to assess, in real-time, the response of plants to novel environments including various spaceflight analogs, including several parabolic flight environments as well as hypobaric plant growth chambers. Basic performance results obtained under these operational environments, as well as laboratory-based tests are described.
