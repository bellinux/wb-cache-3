40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} fracture rates and fracture prevalence from fracture histories in normal postmenopausal women. DESIGN [...] Apparently healthy postmenopausal women were recruited by advertising in the media. Fracture histories were obtained by personal interview in 1983 and again by interview or questionnaire in 1988. Fracture rates were calculated prospectively and retrospectively. PARTICIPANTS [...] 492 women (mean age 58. 6 years) were selected from over 1000 applicants {{on the basis that}} they were suffering from no disease nor taking any therapy which might affect their bones. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Retrospective premenopausal and postmenopausal fracture rates were calculated in 1983, <b>prospective</b> <b>rates</b> calculated from 1983 to 1988, and retrospective rates checked again on the second occasion. The retrospective and <b>prospective</b> fracture <b>rates</b> were very similar. The five year fracture rates were low and steady until the menopause, when they rose by a factor of 10 and reached a new plateau after about 15 years. The results were comparable to those obtained from hospital statistics. CONCLUSIONS [...] The menopausal rise in fracture rates not only involves wrist fractures but most peripheral fractures, and probably reflects postmenopausal loss of trabecular bone. Meaningful fracture rates can be calculated from individual fracture histories in a well defined population. This technique may be particularly useful in developing countries where public health data may be incomplete...|$|R
40|$|UNLABELLED In this study, {{we compare}} {{the extent to}} which seven {{available}} definitions of sarcopenia and two related definitions predict the rate of falling. Our results suggest that the definitions of Baumgartner and Cruz-Jentoft best predict the rate of falls among sarcopenic versus non-sarcopenic community-dwelling seniors. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the study is to compare {{the extent to which}} seven available definitions of sarcopenia and two related definitions predict the <b>prospective</b> <b>rate</b> of falling. METHODS We studied a cohort of 445 seniors (mean age 71 years, 45 % men) living in the community who were followed with a detailed fall assessment for 3 years. For comparing the rate of falls in sarcopenic versus non-sarcopenic individuals, we used multivariate Poisson regression analyses adjusting for gender and treatment (original intervention tested vitamin D plus calcium against placebo). Of the seven available definitions, three were based on low lean mass alone (Baumgartner, Delmonico 1 and 2) and four required both low muscle mass and decreased performance in a functional test (Fielding, Cruz-Jentoft, Morley, Muscaritoli). The two related definitions were based on low lean mass alone (Studenski 1) and low lean mass contributing to weakness (Studenski 2). RESULTS Among 445 participants, 231 fell, sustaining 514 falls over the 3 -year follow-up. The <b>prospective</b> <b>rate</b> of falls in sarcopenic versus non-sarcopenic individuals was best predicted by the Baumgartner definition based on low lean mass alone (RR[*]=[*] 1. 54; 95 % CI 1. 09 - 2. 18) with 11 % prevalence of sarcopenia and the Cruz-Jentoft definition based on low lean mass plus decreased functional performance (RR[*]=[*] 1. 82; 95 % CI 1. 24 - 2. 69) with 7. 1 % prevalence of sarcopenia. Consistently, fall rate was non-significantly higher in sarcopenic versus non-sarcopenic individuals based on the definitions of Delmonico 1, Fielding, and Morley. CONCLUSION Among the definitions investigated, the Baumgartner definition and the Cruz-Jentoft definition had the highest validity for predicting the rate of falls...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} how accelerating inflation has led households in different economic and demographic classes to reallocate their "transactable savings. " We use cross-section {{data from the}} 1962 and 1970 Surveys of Consumer Finances to estimate both the composition of accumulated household saving and <b>prospective</b> <b>rates</b> of return on this saving. We show that accelerating inflation has, {{in the presence of}} comprehensive ceilings on deposit interest rates, altered the savings incentives of different types of households. The effect has been to bias small savers toward leveraged investments in tangible assets (especially real estate) and large savers toward certificates of deposit and marketable bonds. Small savers with disadvantaged access to credit are simply victimized. Our analysis helps to explain a number of anomalous features of the 1975 - 1979 macroeconomic recovery, particularly the dominant role of consumer spending, the unprecedented expansion of household debt, the boom in housing and declining flows of household savings into deposit institutions. These data underscore the unintended consequences of trying to reconcile deposit-rate ceilings with accelerating inflation. This combination of policies unpleasantly distorts the sectoral composition of spending and risk-bearing (crowding out some productive business investment) and aggravates inequities in th...|$|R

This study examines {{the effect of a}} change in Medicaid payment on the location and amount of service provided by case managers. Amounts of service given by treatment providers to 185 of their clients in community settings and in mental health centers were compared before and after reimbursement changed from an all-inclusive <b>prospective</b> <b>rate</b> to a mixed prospective/retrospective payment. Clients were enrolled in two different treatment programs: continuous treatment teams with extensive training in in vivo treatment, and a case management program that emphasized office-based treatment. In-community service increased, and the amount of office-based treatment decreased. Continuous treatment teams increased in-community services more than case managers did; case managers decreased office-based treatment more. There was no change in total amount of services provided. It was concluded that mixed prospective and retrospective reimbursement can remove financial barriers to in-community treatment, but it works best in combination with a training program.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} {{a higher incidence of}} sports related knee injuries among female athletes compared to their male counterparts regardless of exposure time and activity level. Different intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been proposed as risk factors in women. The hormonal variation during the menstrual cycle has been suggested as one of the intrinsic factors and an association between sport injuries in female athletes and the menstrual cycle has been reported. An increased injury rate has been observed during the premenstrual and menstrual phase, whereas one author reported a higher incidence during the ovulatory phase. It has been suggested that impaired neuromuscular function due to the specific hormonal influence of the menstrual cycle contributes to the association between sport injuries and different phases of the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, women with premenstrual symptoms (PMS) {{have been shown to be}} at greater risk of injury compared to women without PMS. The overall aim of this work was to explore if and how neuromuscular performance and balance vary across three well defined and hormonally confirmed phases of the menstrual cycle in moderately active women and to study if PMS can affect performance. Muscle strength and endurance, knee joint kinesthesia, neuromuscular coordination and postural control were measured in the early follicular phase (FP), the ovulatory phase (OP) and the mid luteal phase (LP) of the menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle phases were determined by analysis of sex hormone levels in serum and ovulation was detected by the luteinising hormone surge in urine. A <b>prospective</b> <b>rating</b> of PMS was used to divide the subjects into two groups, one with PMS and one without. No significant variations in muscle strength or muscle endurance during the menstrual cycle were detected. An impaired knee joint kinesthesia was detected in the LP and women with PMS showed an overall greater threshold for detection of passive movements than women without PMS. Neuromuscular coordination was significantly improved in the OP compared to the other phases. A significantly altered postural control was detected in the LP in the PMS group, but no differences were shown between phases in the non-PMS group. There was no significant difference in hormone levels between the PMS group and the non-PMS group and there were no correlations between hormone levels and the variables tested. The results of this thesis demonstrate a significant variation in knee joint kinesthesia, neuromuscular coordination and postural control during the menstrual cycle, while no differences in muscle strength or endurance were observed. Impaired neuromuscular performance and balance may contribute to the increased incidence of sports injuries in female athletes. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanisms for menstrual cycle related variation in neuromuscular performance and postural control...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of an {{alternative}} method of paying home health agencies for services to Medicare beneficiaries, based on a demonstration program. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Primary and secondary data collected on participating home health agencies in five states and their patients during the three-year demonstration period. Primary data included patient surveys at discharge and six months later, and two rounds of interviews with executive staff of the agencies. Secondary data included agencies' Medicare cost reports, quality assurance reviews, Medicare claims data, demonstration claims data, demonstration patient intake forms, and plan of treatment forms. STUDY DESIGN: The 47 agencies volunteering {{to participate in the}} demonstration were each randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. Treatment group agencies were paid a predetermined rate based on their inflation-adjusted cost per visit during the year preceding the demonstration; control group agencies were paid under Medicare's conventional cost reimbursement method. Demonstration impacts were estimated by comparing outcomes for the two groups of agencies and their respective patients, using regression models to control for any remaining differences. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Agencies paid under <b>prospective</b> <b>rate</b> setting were slightly better at holding per-visit cost increases below inflation than were control group agencies. The change in payment method had no effect on agencies' volume of Medicare visits or quality of care, nor on patients' use of Medicare services or other formal or informal care services. CONCLUSION: Changing from cost-based reimbursement to predetermined payment rates for Medicare home healthcare visits would not lead to large savings for the Medicare program, but would not increase costs to Medicare or adversely affect patients or their caregivers...|$|R

So, the forecasting of the indexes of regional social and economic development has become especially relevant. The authors offer a technique of the forecasting of regional social and economic development, it consists of two blocks. The first one is the estimation and forecasting {{of the level of}} regional social and economic development. For the purposes of this block, we applied a method of development level and some adaptive methods. The informative basis is the data on the social and economic development of the Republic of Crimea. The change of the integrated index’s growth rate, which is used for the inertial and realistic scenarios, defined the conclusions on the regional socio-economic development. The second block of this technique includes the estimation and forecasting of the social and economic state of considered region. This block is based on the methods of cluster, discriminate and adaptive analyses. The information basis is the data of the social and {{economic situation}} of 79 Russian regions for the last 14 years. On the basis of cluster analysis, we divide all Russian regions into two clusters according to their social and economic position.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} nurses risk {{of exposure to}} blood resulting from injuries with needles and sharps, the methods of estimating those risks, and the factors affecting risks. METHODS: Nurses on 40 medical units in 20 hospitals in cities with {{a high incidence of}} AIDS were studied. Percutaneous injuries were documented for every shift during a 30 -day period. These prospective reports were compared with retrospective and institutional reports. Factors affecting the likelihood of injuries were explored. RESULTS: Based on the <b>prospective</b> reports, the <b>rate</b> of injuries to staff nurses was 0. 8 per nurse-year. <b>Prospective</b> and retrospective <b>rates</b> were similar, while institutional rates were significantly lower. Factors associated with increased injuries included recapping needles and temporary work assignments.

40|$|Biomedical HIV {{prevention}} may significantly decrease HIV incidence among gay {{and bisexual}} men (GBM), but understanding its relationships with sexual, relational and community contexts {{is required to}} maximise effectiveness. The objective of this thesis is to examine emerging biomedical HIV prevention strategies in terms of behavioural and psychosocial contextual factors relevant to GBM, with a particular focus on regular sexual relationships. The first project identified that Australian GBM were likely to increase their frequency of HIV testing if home self-testing was available. The second project examined characteristics of HIV serodiscordant and seroconcordant relationships, <b>prospective</b> <b>rates</b> of relationship break-up, and HIV incidence in HIV-negative men in homosexual male serodiscordant couples. HIV incidence among HIV-negative men with HIV-positive regular partners was highest {{in the first year}} of the relationship. The third project explored attitudes and knowledge about treatment as prevention (TasP) and willingness of Australian GBM to act upon their beliefs. A minority of men reported willingness to have condomless sex with an opposite-status sexual partner when the HIV-positive partner was on treatments; those more willing tended to engage in higher risk practices. The fourth and fifth projects were analyses of regular partnerships among Australian GBM, demonstrating that diverse partnership types, practices, and HIV risks exist within the overarching category of regular partner. The sixth project explored HIV prevention strategies used by homosexual male serodiscordant couples, showing that when accounting for a range of risk reduction strategies, only a small proportion of acts of anal intercourse were high risk for transmission. The research in this thesis highlights the complexities of incorporating biomedical prevention into existing strategies. HIV prevention needs to be viewed in context to gain a better understanding of: sexual partnerships, both casual and regular; impacts of biomedical prevention on HIV risk and behaviour; attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about new and traditional forms of HIV prevention; how HIV community education needs to adapt; and the HIV research implications arising from the new prevention environment...|$|R
