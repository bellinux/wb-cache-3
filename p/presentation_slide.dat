5000|$|For young learners, {{the use of}} {{animation}} directs their attention to important features and prompts them to help ensure correct responses. Teachers can create literacy lessons with attention-grabbing elements such as moving graphic images. For example, a teacher might focus on the initial /d/ sound in the word [...] "dog" [...] as an instructional goal; a <b>presentation</b> <b>slide</b> for this would show {{a picture of a}} dog, and the teacher would select three possible letters to represent the initial sound in dog, such as /b/, /c/, and /d/. After showing the picture of the dog, and then displaying each of the three letter choices one-by-one, the teacher would ask the student what letter he or she thinks [...] "dog" [...] starts with. Other types of presentation software for literacy instruction, such as Photo Story, can allow teachers to add a variety of special effects, soundtracks, captions, and their own voice narration to the photo stories.|$|E
50|$|PowerPoint {{has become}} the {{ubiquitous}} solution for professionals to present their ideas, companies and products alike to their audience. Since its inception in 1984 and although purely electronic, PowerPoint has followed the thought process of its physical predecessor, the overhead projector, in which a presenter physically wrote the text and diagrams of the story board sequence on a roll of acetate transparencies.In both scenarios, the presenter is mandated to follow the sequential flow of the <b>presentation</b> <b>slide</b> material. In modern business environments, the audience is often likely to ask questions out of sequence and for a PowerPoint presenter, this {{can be dealt with}} in one of three ways. The first is to the defer the question which can be frustrating for the person raising it, even more so if the presenter forgets to answer it. The second is to rapidly press the Page Down and Page Up keys on the computer keyboard in order to find the slide with the relevant information to answer the question. The third solution and the least elegant is for the presenter to press the Escape key, which exists the slide show mode in PowerPoint, and manually locate the slide in question followed by a restart of the slide show. In all cases, the end result is one which appears unprofessional.|$|E

40|$|Lectures are {{consisting}} of two components which are content and delivery. Both components are essential elements for creating an interesting lecture. How good the lecture is dependent upon {{the quality of the}} delivery. However, lecture is best suited for elaborating certain information and is not the best method for convey large amounts of information. Large amount of information is better presented in text format, so that students can access whenever they need it. Therefore, many lecturers find PowerPoint™ is useful in enhancing lectures and emphasizing key point to their students. Nevertheless, mistakes in making the slide design can lead to a room full of bored looks. In order to improve the <b>presentation</b> <b>slide</b> design Gestalt Law of screen design such as balance/symmetry, continuation, closure, figure-ground, focal point, isomorphic correspondence, prägnanz, proximity, similarity, simplicity, and unity/harmony were consulted. To test the usefulness of these laws in visual screen design they were applied to the redesign of a <b>presentation</b> <b>slide</b> design, ‘System Development Environment’. The original presentation slides were redesigned according to these principles. The new screen designs were then evaluated by distributing questionnaires to students to compare the designs. The students were also asked to rate the value of using the Gestalt design principles in the redesign, both for improving the product’s appearance and improving its value for learning. The results show a very positive feedback from the students. Therefore, this principle should be implemented in designing other <b>presentation</b> <b>slide</b> in order to capture learners’ attention...|$|E
