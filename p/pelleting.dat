Fecal <b>pellets</b> were collected in a moored sediment trap from 2005 to 2009, along the continental shelf of the WAP. Fecal <b>pellet</b> shape, size, and color were quantified to assess flux of <b>pellets</b> from different zooplankton taxa, and compared between seasons and years. Fecal <b>pellet</b> POC flux constituted a significant proportion of total POC flux, with summer <b>pellet</b> C flux (68 % of total) significantly higher than in winter (36 %) (n = 11, 270). Cylindrical <b>pellets,</b> produced by euphausiids, contributed to a monthly mean of 79 % of fecal <b>pellet</b> flux, with copepod and salp <b>pellets</b> contributing significantly less (15 % and 6 %, respectively, of total fecal <b>pellet</b> flux). Cylindrical and ovoid <b>pellets</b> were significantly higher in summer samples, while 90 % of tabular <b>pellet</b> flux occurred in the winter. Tabular <b>pellets</b> were the largest (median size = 0. 8 �gC/fecal <b>pellet),</b> followed by cylindrical <b>pellets</b> (0. 2 �gC/fecal <b>pellet),</b> with ovoid <b>pellets</b> the smallest (0. 02 �gC/fecal <b>pellet).</b> The largest tabular <b>pellets</b> contained up to 3 -orders of magnitude more carbon than cylindrical <b>pellets.</b> Most fecal <b>pellets</b> were dark or light brown in color (suggesting an herbivorous or omnivorous diet), and < 1 % of <b>pellets</b> were white or red (detritivorous/ carnivorous diet).

40|$|At {{the present}} work the UO 2 fuel {{production}} process was extensively studied and analyzed. The objectives of such investigation were {{to understand and}} analyze the influence of different additives and the variation of the production process steps on the microstructure and consequently in the mechanical strength of the nuclear fuel <b>pellet.</b> Moreover, an improvement of the qualitative characteristics of the ceramic fuel <b>pellets</b> was also aimed. For this purpose UO 2 <b>pellets</b> without additives, the so-called standard <b>pellets,</b> <b>pellets</b> containing as additive for example AZB (Azodicarbonamid), black U 3 O 8 (Oxidized uranium <b>pellet</b> scrap - OS), green U 3 O 8 (Oxidized uranium powder - OP), keratin fibers (a non conventional additive) were produced. The introduction of these additives to the UO 2 powder mixture prior or after the granulation production step and in different concentrations produced several microstructure configurations. As {{it would not be}} possible to analyze all of them here so during the investigation pre-tests some of them were separated to be studied in more detail. <b>Pellets</b> with AZB added after the granulation presented larger grains and larger pores than those with AZB added before granulation, also porosity free grains and a granulate structure instead of a homogeneous one. <b>Pellets</b> with OS present fine porosity distributed all over the <b>pellet</b> matrix with some porosity clusters whereas <b>pellets</b> containing OP show in its matrix porosity agglomerated in form of hooks. As for the grain size, a more uniform grain size distribution can be observed in <b>pellets</b> OS than in <b>pellets</b> with OP. The variations in the amount of keratin fibers added, sintering dwell time and green density resulted indeed in different microstructures. Nevertheless, some common characteristics among them were observed such as the presence of elongated pores, porosity clusters and larger grains located at the <b>pellets</b> borders while the smaller ones were concentrated more in {{the central part of the}} <b>pellet.</b> This distribution of grains was identified as bi-modal structure. The mentioned microstructure aspects certainly influence on the mechanical properties of the fuel <b>pellet.</b> However, the sintering parameters, the green and final <b>pellet</b> density and the <b>pellet</b> dimensions also have an influence on the mechanical characteristics of the <b>pellets.</b> For studying the influence of all these parameters on the <b>pellet</b> mechanical properties four testing procedures were utilized the so-called squirrel-cage where the mechanical resistance of the not sintered <b>pellets</b> against mechanical shocks was tested, the diametrical compression test (Brazilian Test) where the strength of sintered and not sintered <b>pellets</b> was studied, the Vickers indentation technique and the creep test where the <b>pellet</b> plasticity respectively at room and at elevated temperatures was analyzed. The squirrel-cage results showed that the <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers were much more mechanically resistant than those <b>pellets</b> without it, which means that the keratin fibers acted, prior sintering, as a powder binder increasing the cohesion among the powder granules proportionating the green <b>pellets</b> higher mechanical resistance against impacts. The Brazilian test evaluated the influence of the <b>pellet</b> length to the <b>pellet</b> diameter (L/D ratio), the influence of different additives mixed to the UO 2 powder and the different <b>pellet</b> production processes. The L/D influence analysis showed that if one fixes the <b>pellet</b> diameter and increase the <b>pellet</b> length the Weibull modulus (here a measure of the <b>pellet</b> lot reliability) will also increase. By comparing <b>pellets</b> with OS, OP and 0. 3 % keratin fibers it was observed that <b>pellets</b> with OS presented the highest volume of pores smaller than 10 mm while <b>pellets</b> with OP and keratin presented the highest volume of pores larger than 20 mm. It seems that this relevant characteristic favored to the highest Weibull strength value for <b>pellets</b> with OS. In the indentation test standard <b>pellets,</b> <b>pellets</b> with OS and <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers were tested. The results showed that the calculated hardness for the standard <b>pellets</b> is slightly lower when compared to the values obtained by the <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers. Also the <b>pellets</b> containing OS when compared to the keratin fibers <b>pellets</b> have in most of the cases a lower hardness. The calculated fracture toughness and fracture surface energy values show also a better mechanical behavior for the keratin fibre <b>pellets</b> than in the standard <b>pellets.</b> Standard <b>pellets,</b> <b>pellets</b> with 30 %OP, which had the smallest grain size, <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers, having the bi-modal structure and <b>pellets</b> with chromium oxide, which had the largest grain size, were tested in the creep furnace. The results showed that all <b>pellets</b> with additives presented a better creep behavior than the standard <b>pellets.</b> Among the <b>pellets</b> prepared with additives the comparison clearly showed that under lower stresses <b>pellets</b> with smaller grains have a better creep rate. By increasing the applied stresses we observe an improvement of the creep rate of the <b>pellets</b> with chromium oxide and keratin fibre even slightly overcoming the <b>pellets</b> with 30 %OP at the highest applied stress.
