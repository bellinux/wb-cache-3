40|$|The {{most common}} pear psyllid in Denmark is Cacopsylla pyri L. (Homoptera: Psyllidae). The {{effectiveness}} of anthocorids in controlling <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> was evaluated {{in a series}} of experiments conducted from 2002 to 2004. The anthocorids tested were Anthocoris nemorum (L.) and A. nemoralis F. In 2002, two preliminary studies were conducted with adult anthocorids under sleeve cages. In 2003, a more detailed study was carried on releasing A. nemoralis in two orchards. Females were allowed to lay their eggs under sleeve cages. The effectiveness of their young offspring in controlling <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> was evaluated. In 2004, second, third and fourth instar nymphs of A. nemoralis were released on naturally infested trees in three orchards. In 2002, A. nemoralis reduced the number of psyllids by 54 %, and A. nemorum reduced the number of psyllids by 31 % in only two days. Later that year, another experiment was carried out in which one of the following combinations was placed in each cage: one male and one female of A. nemorum; one male and one female of A. nemoralis; or one male and one female of A. nemorum and one male and one female o...|$|E
40|$|Psyllids {{belong to}} the {{superfamily}} Psylloidea (Hemiptera) and there are about 2, 500 recorded species worldwide. <b>Pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> are a group of psyllids that infest pear trees and {{belong to the}} genus Cacopsylla (Psyllidae: Psyllinae). More than 28 psyllid species infest cultivated pear trees in temperate and subtropical regions of the world. Not until a decade ago, a first Cacopsylla species, Cacopsylla qianli (Yang & Li), was found in 1994 in pear orchards of central Taiwan. Later on, another group of <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> with varied body colors and unknown biology outbroke in 2002. The major goal {{of the present study}} is to clarify the taxonomic status of the later discovered <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> with varied body-color, and to establish their biological information. After a thorough examination of both adult and nymphal morphology, and a comparison with type material, these <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> are identified as the same species as C. chinensis (Yang & Li), which was formerly described only from northern China. C. chinensis has seasonal dimorphism, the summer form and the winter form. The summer form of C. chinensis exhibits a variation in body color from light green to light yellow, while the winter form with body colors of dark brown. Fifth instar nymphs of C. chinensis has many long simple setae on the body surface, and female individuals have a Y-shape suture in front of circumanal pore ring, which is absent in male. Field investigation showed that the major occurent peaks of adults of C. chinensis were in July, while the peaks of nymphs and eggs were in August and July, respectively. The population size of C. chinensis in Taiwan increased rapidly in April, it is suggested that management should take place in March or April before the raises of population density. Laboratory studies showed that it took about 50 ~ 70 days for C. chinensis to complete its life cycle. The length of life cycle of the winter form was longer than that of the summer form, and the life cycle was lengthened under low temperature treatments. Regardless of different temperature treatments, the light-color individuals of summer form were obtained under long photoperiod conditions, while the short photoperiod treatments produced dark-color individuals of winter form. The results suggest that the length of photoperiod is an important environmental factor affecting the seasonal dimorphism of C. chinensis. 木蝨為半翅目(Hemiptera) 木蝨總科(Psylloidea) 的昆蟲。全世界木蝨約有 2, 500 已紀錄種，其中以梨樹為寄主的木蝨通稱為梨木蝨，在分類上屬於木蝨科 (Psyllidae) 木蝨亞科 (Psyllinae) 之Cacopsylla屬。目前於溫帶及亞熱帶地區為害栽培梨樹之梨木蝨至少 28 種。台灣在十年前並無任何梨木蝨之紀錄，直到 1994 年於中部梨園始有黔梨木蝨(Cacopsylla qianli (Yang & Li)) 之發表紀錄， 2002 年有一群體色變異極大之梨木蝨大發生，其生物學特性亟待確立。本研究之目的主要為進行該群多色型梨木蝨之形態鑑定與分類描述，並建立基本生物學資料。研究結果顯示此多色型之梨木蝨為原產自中國大陸北方之中國梨木蝨(Cacopsylla chinensis (Yang and Li)) ，具有夏季(淡色) 及冬季(深色) 兩大型之體色多型性。夏型成蟲呈現淡黃至淡綠之體色變化，前翅無翅斑，而冬型則為紅棕至深褐色，前翅具翅斑；五齡若蟲體緣具許多長的簡單型剛毛，且雌性於腹部圍肛環前方具一Y型縫線，雄性則闕如。 2003 年 3 月至 2004 年 2 月間之田間調查顯示， 7 月為中國梨木蝨成蟲發生高峰期，若蟲與卵者則分別為 8 月及 7 月。台灣之梨木蝨族群數量自 4 月起便開始迅速上升，建議在防治上應及早於 3 至 4 月間便開始實施。室內研究顯示，中國梨木蝨完成一生活環約需 50 至 70 餘日，而冬型成蟲生活環之長度皆長於夏型，且低溫處理較高溫處理要多出十餘日；於四組控制個人工環境條件下(21 ℃/ 14 L: 10 D; 11 L: 13 D; 17 ℃/ 14 L: 10 D; 11 L: 13 D) 進行飼育，結果發現，無論在何種溫度處理下，長光週期(14 L) 條件僅產生夏季型成蟲個體，而短光週期(11 L) 則產生冬季型個體，顯示光週期長度影響中國梨木蝨季節二型體色變化的重要因子。目 次 中文摘要 英文摘要 前言……………………………………………………………… [...] . ………………… 1 前人研究…………………………………………………… [...] . ……………………… 3 壹、外部形態鑑定與分類描述……………………………………………………… 6 材料與方法. ………………………………………………………………… [...] . …… 6 一、標本來源與處理……………………………………………………………. 6 二、形態特徵與量測………………………… [...] . ……. ………………………… 7 成蟲………………………… [...] . …………. ………………………………… [...] 7 若蟲………………………………. ……… [...] . ………………………………… 8 結果與討論…. ……………………………… [...] . ………………………………… [...] 10 Cacopsylla qianli (Yang & Li) 黔梨木蝨…………. ………………………… [...] 10 成蟲…………………………………. …………. …………………. ……… [...] . 10 五齡若蟲………………………………………… [...] . ……. …………. ………. 11 Cacopsylla chinensis (Yang & Li) 中國梨木蝨…………… [...] ………… [...] ……. 12 成蟲………………………………………………………. …………………. 12 (一) 夏型……………………………………………………. …………… 12 (二) 冬型……………………………………………. …………………… 13 五齡若蟲……………………… [...] . ………………………. ………………… [...] 14 貳、基本生物學………………………………………………………. ……………. 18 材料與方法…………………………………………………………. ……………. 18 (一) 田間生物學…………………… [...] . ………………………. ………………. 18 (二) 室內生物學……………………………………… [...] . ……. ………………. 19 (1) 供試蟲源…………………………………………………. …………… [...] 19 (2) 室內環境條件設定與供試植物……………………………. … [...] . …… [...] . 19 結果與討論…………………………………………………………. ……………. 21 (一) 田間生物學………………… [...] . ……………………………. ……………. 21 (二) 室內生物學…… [...] ……… [...] . … [...] ………………………… [...] ……………… 22 總結………………………………………………………… [...] ……………………… 25 參考文獻………………………………………………………………… [...] ………… 26 圖…………………………………………………………………………… [...] ……… 30 表………………………………………………………… [...] ………………………… 57 附錄………………………………………………………………………………… [...] 6...|$|E
40|$|Cacopsylla pyri (pear psylla) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious pests of pear (Pyrus spp.) in Europe. It can cause high yield losses, and its control has become {{difficult}} since it has developed resistance to a wide range of pesticides. Pear breeders are developing new cultivars resistant to <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids,</b> and Asian species, such as Pyrus ussuriensis and Pyrus × bretschneideri, are good sources of resistance. Antixenosis and antibiosis resistance to psylla were both identified in pear; they may differ in the biological mechanism and probably have different genetic backgrounds. We crossed interspecific P. × bretschneideri × Pyrus communis hybrid PEAR 3, resistant to pear psylla, with the susceptible European pear cultivar ‘Moonglow’ to obtain an F 1 population for the genetic mapping of the resistance. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was carried out for antibiosis by measuring the number of surviving nymphs and the nymphal development, using a novel phenotyping protocol and a saturated genetic map made of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and microsatellite (simple sequence repeats (SSR)) markers. A stable QTL was detected on linkage group (LG) 8 of PEAR 3 (R 2 [*]=[*] 17. 2 – 39. 1 %).

40|$|Cacopsylla pyricola (Förster, 1848) (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is {{a serious}} pest of pear in all pear growing areas. In the scope of an {{integrated}} pest management, a two consecutive years study was carried out {{to determine the effects}} of plant cover on <b>pear</b> <b>psyllid</b> population and its predators. Two treatments including plant cover and bare ground were applied in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The sampling of the pest and its predators were done weekly by beating technique and leaf sampling. The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that plant cover had significant effect on the increase of predators on the trees (P < 0. 001). The psyllid specialist predator, Anthocoris nemoralis (Fabricius, 1794), had the highest population among the <b>pear</b> <b>psyllid</b> predators (0. 29 per sample).

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out in {{germplasm}} nurseries and commercial orchards from ten provinces in Turkey dur-ing 2003 - 2005. Samples were collected from trees show-ing European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) and Pear de-cline (PD) symptoms. A total of 270 stone fruit and six pear samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Universal phytoplasma primers P 1 /P 7 and R 16 F 2 n/R 2 were used for one-step and nested PCR as-says, respectively. Nested-PCR products were digested with RsaI, SspI and MseI restriction enzymes. Twenty-eight of 270 samples including plum, apricot, peach and almond were infected by Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum. Infection rate by the same phytoplasma species of germplasm nurseries containing mostly for-eign cultivars was 54. 8 %, whereas it was only 3. 2 % in commercial orchards. Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum was detected {{for the first time in}} Antalya, Gaziantep, Içel, Isparta, and Yalova provinces in local apricot cultivars as well as Japanese plum, apricot, and almond cultivars imported from Japan. PCR and RFLP tests of pear sam-ples collected from commercial orchards in the Bursa province showed that the local pear cultivar ‘Deveci’ was infected by Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri, which was also found in the <b>pear</b> <b>psyllid</b> Cacopsylla pyri L.

40|$|Previous work {{showed that}} anthocorid predators {{aggregate}} around gauze cages containing Psylla-infested trees in a pear orchard. Because anthocorids responded to odor from Psylla-infested leaves {{in a laboratory}} test, {{it was hypothesized that}} these aggregative responses in the field were triggered by olfaction of compounds associated with Psylla injury. We present chemical analyses of volatiles from damaged and undamaged plants and studies on behavioral responses of anthocorid predators to compounds released by damaged plants. Leaf headspace volatiles from clean and Psylla-infested pear trees were collected on Tenax and identified by GC-MS after thermodesorption. Twelve volatiles were found exclusively in headspace samples from Psylla-infested leaves. Six were present in significantly higher quantities in samples from infested leaves: the monoterpene, (E,E) -?-farnesene, the phenolic, methyl salicylate, and the green leaf compounds, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, 1 -hexyl-acetate, and 1 -penten- 3 -ol. These compounds are known to be produced by plants, and damage by <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> seems to trigger their emission. Blend composition varied and was partly correlated with tree or leaf age and degree of Psylla infestation. To study whether compounds associated with leaf injury elicit olfactory responses in anthocorid predators, apple-extracted (E,E) -?-farnesene, synthetic methyl salicylate, and (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate were offered in a Y-tube olfactometer to field-collected adult Anthocoris spp. Significant positive responses were found to both the monoterpene and the phenolic, but not to the green leaf volatile. The results lend support to the hypothesis that predator attraction to herbivore-infested pear trees is mediated by herbivory-induced plant volatiles...|$|E
40|$|Farmers in Norway {{are facing}} {{challenges}} like reduced access to pesticides, {{climate change and}} problems associated with increased homogeneity of crops in farming. Biological control may provide a solution to these challenges, by increasing the biodiversity and robustness in the surrounding ecosystems. The anthocorid bugs Anthocoris nemorum and A. nemoralis {{are considered to be}} effective predators on three important pest species in Norwegian fruit production: the pear psyllid Cacopsylla pyri in pear, and the green apple aphid Aphis pomi and the rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea in apple. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of A. nemorum and A. nemoralis as biological control agents of these pest species in Norway. Field surveys and semi-field experiments were carried out in apple and pear orchards in western Norway. The predation potential was tested by performing sleeve-cage experiments. Information about spatial and temporal patterns of natural populations of A. nemorum and A. nemoralis and their prey was obtained by sampling orchards and analyzing the data with generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) incorporating the spatial structure. The results from the sleeve cage experiments showed that A. nemorum has the potential to control both C. pyri populations in pear and aphid populations in apple. Surprisingly, commercially bought A. nemoralis did not manage to reduce C. pyri populations, when compared to the control. Differences between commercially reared and natural populations of A. nemoralis should be researched. Results from the orchard survey in pear supported the hypothesis that natural populations of A. nemoralis are more specialized towards finding C. pyri nymphs and eggs than A. nemorum. However, A. nemorum was present in the orchard earlier, and in larger abundances than other studies has suggested. This highlights that A. nemorum’s role in controlling <b>pear</b> <b>psyllids</b> may be more important in Norway than previously assumed. The presence of ants was negatively related to number of Anthocorid nymphs in pear, and to imago A. nemorum in apple. Ants should therefore be taken into account when biocontrol systems in orchards are planned...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Biocontrol using {{naturally}} occurring predators is often limited by population parameters of those predators. Earwigs, Forficula auricularia L. (Dermaptera: Forficulidae), are important predators in fruit orchards. They {{are capable of}} suppressing outbreaks of pest species, such as <b>pear</b> <b>psyllid</b> and various apple aphid species. Earwigs therefore {{play an important role}} in integrated pest management in fruit orchards and are essential in organic top fruit cultures. However, earwig populations are very unstable, showing large between-year variation in densities, which limits their practical use. Extensive knowledge of regulating processes of populations is therefore crucial for efficient orchard management. A 2 -year phenological study in several apple and pear orchards in Belgium showed a significant displacement of third instars during the second brood in relation to the presence of adults. We also observed a yearly population crash at the time of moulting into adults. This population decrease was correlated with earwig numbers at peak density. The crash occurred at lower earwig densities in apple orchards than in pear orchards. Six possible regulating mechanisms for this density-dependent decrease are discussed: (1) migration, (2) pesticides or orchard management, (3) starvation, (4) pathogens, (5) parasites and parasitoids, and (6) predation or cannibalism. If we can identify these regulating processes, specific management activities could be developed to prevent the population crash, hereby increasing population densities in the orchards...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the trophic {{interactions}} between prey and its predators {{is vital for}} both population ecology and integrated pest management (IPM). In IPM, knowledge of how the trophic interactions in an ecosystem affect prey densities are exploited to improve pest management strategies. In Norwegian pear orchards, excessive use of non-specific pesticides has led the <b>pear</b> <b>psyllid</b> Cacopsylla pyri to become a major pest. Because of a renewed focus on pear production in Norway, alternative pest management strategies are needed. The predatory bugs Anthocoris nemorum and A. nemoralis {{are two of the}} most abundant predators in fruit orchards, and are considered {{a vital part of the}} natural control of pome fruit pest species. Both species are considered generalist predators, though A. nemoralis has been shown to prefer psyllids over other prey. In order to assess the importance of A. nemorum and A. nemoralis as beneficial predators in Norwegian pear orchards, field samples were collected from a commercial pear orchard in Hardanger. Molecular gut-content analysis was performed in the laboratory to verify presence of prey DNA, using PCR including previously designed primers by Agustí et al. (2003 b). To study the functional response of anthocorid bugs to C. pyri, the predation rate (defined as the proportion of psyllid-positive bugs) was compared to field prey densities. In addition, feeding studies were conducted in the laboratory to determine how long C. pyri DNA is detectable in the guts of A. nemorum and A. nemoralis under Norwegian field conditions. The primer set Cp 2 F/Cp 7 R, reported to be specific for Cacopsylla pyricola and C. pyri, failed to amplify C. pyri DNA in this study. However, a second primer set, Cp 3 F/Cp 6 R, did successfully amplify all Psyllidae species tested, and showed no cross-amplification of nontarget organisms. Detection half-lives obtained in this study were much longer than expected, and possible reasons are discussed. Using the primer set Cp 3 F/Cp 6 R, a high predation rate on psyllids was detected, ranging from 82 - 92 %, supporting the assumption that anthocorid bugs are important beneficial predators in fruit orchards. In addition, the relatively high number of anthocorids present in the field was surprising. C. pyri constituted 89 % of prey available, indicating that C. pyri is an important part of A. nemorum and A. nemoralis diets. Thus, the results obtained in this study suggest the importance of generalist predators in pest control. Lastly, A. nemorum predation on psyllids was found to be negatively related to the presence of the ant Lasius niger...|$|R
