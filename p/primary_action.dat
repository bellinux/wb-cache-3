25|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>action</b> of buffer stocks, {{creating}} price stability, {{is often}} {{combined with other}} mechanisms to meet other goals such as the promotion of domestic industry. That is achieved by setting a minimum price for a certain product above the equilibrium price, {{the point at which}} the supply and demand curves cross, which guarantees a minimum price to producers, encouraging them to produce more and thus creating a surplus ready to be used as a buffer stock. The price stability itself may also tempt firms into the market, further boosting supply.|$|E
25|$|Further {{down the}} field that same lap, Vandoorne passed his {{teammate}} Izawa but then impacted the rear-end of de Jong's car at turn four, damaging his front wing and forcing Vandoorne to reduce his speed. Vandoorne was then forced into the sand by the faster Markelov before he could limp back to the pit lane for repairs and {{dropped out of the}} top ten. Rossi sustained a puncture on the third lap and was required to make an unscheduled pit stop for soft compound tyres in an attempt to record the race's fastest lap. Since no mandatory pit stops had to be made, Palmer was still leading though his advantage over Trummer was less than a second. Leal was also close by despite raising concerns over suspected damage to his car. Evans passed de Jong for eighth place on lap six while Haryanto fell behind Izawa, Daly and Markelow by the eleventh lap. By the race's halfway point, questions were raised about which drivers used their tyres too hard {{in the early stages of}} the event and who used their compounds economically with the view for an late attack. The <b>primary</b> <b>action</b> at this point was Abt and Berthon battling for 15th place and both drivers caught Marciello's lapped car. Daly retired on lap 15 after sustaining a possible puncture caused by driving over a turning vane from Binder's vehicle ahead of him.|$|E
500|$|The {{bumblebee}} tongue (the proboscis) is a long, hairy {{structure that}} extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla. The <b>primary</b> <b>action</b> {{of the tongue}} is lapping, that is, repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid.|$|E

2500|$|A unique facet to the Dirk Pitt novels is {{that they}} {{generally}} feature a prologue set in an earlier period of history than when the <b>primary</b> <b>action</b> is set.

2500|$|There are {{numerous}} appropriate approaches to handling pain resulting from Achilles tendinitis. The <b>primary</b> <b>action</b> is to rest. Activities {{that do not}} provide additional stress to the affected tendon are also recommended. Wearing orthothics or prostheses will provide cushion and will prevent the affected Achilles tendon from experiencing further stress when walking and performing therapeutic stretches. A few stretch modalities or eccentric exercises such as toe extension and flexion and calf and heel stretch are beneficial in lowering pain with Achilles tendinopathy patients (Figure 4) ...|$|E
40|$|Pairs {{of actions}} such as write x throw and throw x racquet were {{examined}} for {{items of the}} Annett Hand Preference Questionnaire (AHPQ). Right (R) and left (L) responses were described for frequencies of RR, RL, LR and LL pairings (write x throw etc.) in a large representative combined sample {{with the aim of}} discovering the distribution over the population as a whole. The frequencies of RL pairings varied significantly over the different item pairs but the frequencies of LR pairings were fairly constant. An important difference was found between <b>primary</b> <b>actions</b> (originally write, throw, racquet, match, toothbrush, hammer with the later addition of scissors for right-handers) and non-primary actions (needle and thread, broom, spade, dealing playing cards and unscrewing the lid of a jar). For <b>primary</b> <b>actions,</b> there were similar numbers of right and left writers using the ‘other’ hand. For non-primary actions more right-handers used the left hand than for <b>primary</b> <b>actions</b> but more left-handers did not use the right hand. That is, different frequencies of response to <b>primary</b> versus non-primary <b>actions</b> were found for right-handers but not for left-handers. The pattern of findings was repeated for a corresponding analysis of left-handed throwing x AHPQ actions. The findings have implications for the classification of hand preferences and for analyses of the nature of hand skill...|$|R

Stuart was in the town at the time and managed to escape before his brigades under Munford and Beverly Robertson routed Duffié in an early morning assault on June 18. The <b>primary</b> <b>action</b> of the Battle of Middleburg occurred on the morning of June 19 when Col. J. Irvin Gregg's brigade advanced west from Aldie and attacked Stuart's line on a ridge west of Middleburg. Stuart repulsed Gregg's charge, counterattacked, then fell back to defensive positions [...] to the west.|$|E

60|$|A dread (half-unconscious, it may be) of {{this last}} {{practical}} result, {{seems to have}} crossed {{the mind of the}} author on whom I have been commenting; for he confesses, honestly enough (and he writes throughout like an honest man) that in human life 'no rational thinker hopes to discover more than some few <b>primary</b> <b>actions</b> of law, and some approximative theory of growth.' I have higher hopes of a possible science of history; because I fall back on those old moral laws, which I think he wishes to ignore: but I can conceive that he will not; because he cannot, on his own definitions of law and growth. They are (if I understand him aright) to be irresistible and inevitable. I say that they are not so, even in the case of trees and stones; much more in the world of man. Facts, when he goes on to verify his theories, will leave him with a very few <b>primary</b> <b>actions</b> of law, a very faint approximative theory; because his theories, in plain English, will not work. At the first step, at every step, they are stopped short by those disturbing forces, or at least disturbed phaenomena, which have been as yet, and probably will be hereafter, attributed (as the only explanation of them) to the existence, for good and evil, of a human will.|$|R
