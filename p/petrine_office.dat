This perspective on the duality of the roles of Mary and Peter highlights the subjective holiness of the heart and the holiness {{of the structure of the}} Church. In this duality the <b>Petrine</b> <b>office</b> logically examines the charisms for their theological soundness, while the Marian dual provides a balance in the spiritual and emotional sense via the service of love that the office can never encompass. Mariology and the doctrine of office are thus not [...] "side chapels" [...] in Roman Catholic teachings, but are central and integrating elements of it. As referenced in the encyclical on the Mystical Body of Christ, Pius XII, 1943, her fiat gave consent for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature, thus giving humanity the means to salvation. [...] Mary's rights (wedding feast at Cana), and Mary's love (fiat) are essential to salvation.|$|E

50|$|Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Christians have an {{understanding}} of what full communion means that is very {{similar to that of the}} Catholic Church. Though they have no figure corresponding to that of the Roman Catholic Pope, performing a function like that of the Pope's <b>Petrine</b> <b>Office</b> for the whole of their respective communions, they see each of their autocephalous churches as embodiments of, respectively, the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They too consider full communion an essential condition for common sharing in the Eucharist. The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, as first among equals among the Eastern Orthodox autocephalous churches, though not having authority similar to that of the Roman Catholic Pope, serves as their spokesman. The Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria holds a somewhat similar position in Oriental Orthodoxy.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of the {{resignation}} of Pope Benedict XVI, G채nswein said that [...] "I am certain, indeed convinced, that history will offer a judgment that will be different than what one often read in the last years of his pontificate because the sources are clear and clarity springs from them." [...] In 2016 he said that [...] "Vatileaks" [...] or other issues had [...] "little or nothing" [...] to do with Benedict's resignation. G채nswein said that Francis and Benedict are not two popes [...] "in competition" [...] with one another, but represent one [...] "expanded" [...] <b>Petrine</b> <b>Office</b> with an [...] "active" [...] member and a [...] "contemplative" [...] one. He said that Benedict had not abandoned the papacy like Pope Celestine V in the 13th century but rather sought to continue his in a more appropriate way given his frailty and that [...] "Therefore, from 11 February 2013, the papal ministry is not the same as before. It is and remains the foundation of the Catholic Church; and yet it is a foundation that Benedict XVI has profoundly and lastingly transformed by his exceptional pontificate." ...|$|E
50|$|Baumann {{was born}} in Stuttgart, Germany. After {{studying}} Protestant theology at T체bingen and Marburg since 1922, Baumann was pastor of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W체rttemberg. Because of his Bible study and {{under the influence of}} Kirchenkampf during the Third Reich as well as intensive contact to Catholic Christians especially during the Second World War, he came in 1941 to the conclusion that after the Gospel of Matthew 16.18 and Gospel of John from 21.15 to 17 Jesus said Simon Peter was transmitted order to be understood as a continuing until the end of time office, which in the Roman Pope was realized. For a mystical experience on August 19, 1942 at Binzwangen he found himself assigned to unite the Protestant Church with the Roman Catholic Church.In 1946 Baumann publicly expressed view brought him into conflict with his Protestant Church, which it found to be incompatible with their basic beliefs and Baumann in 1947 in the waiting state replied. Since this would not voluntarily give up his office, there were in 1953 first teaching breeding process {{in the history of the}} EKD. This process is based on a specially adopted teaching breeding regulation ended with the removal Baumann from the rectory. The procedure and the judgment of the college motto of this method was also used by evangelical authors (in what Hans Asmussen and Max Lackmann criticized) sometimes violently.A key point of criticism of the educational process against Richard Baumann is that the church's motto College, chaired by the Landesbischof had refused to submit a binding teaching on the question of the duration of the <b>Petrine</b> <b>office</b> (as Baumann had demanded it, in this case, he had a has offered to retract his theses), while in fact, the prevailing view in the judgment against Baumann set legally binding.At the Second Vatican Council, Baumann took part as an unofficial observer.|$|E
40|$|On {{the opening}} day of the fourth session of the Second Vatican Council, September 14, 1965, Pope Paul VI {{announced}} to the council fathers that a synod of bishops would be established in the near future. On the following day, September 15, in the presence of Pope Paul VI, Cardinal P. Marella, presented to the fathers the motu proprio, Apostolica sollicitudo, establishing the synod of bishops on a permanent basis. According to the motu proprio, among the important reasons for the establishment of the synod of bishops was the pope's ministry as universal pastor. Thus, the synod of bishops would serve the pope by consolidating the unity and mutual help between himself and the bishops, and ensure that direct and accurate information is provided to the pope on vital issues. These ideas were later codified into law, which states that, in exercising his office, the Roman Pontiff is assisted in various ways, among these being the synod of bishops (c. 334). Since its creation, many assemblies of the synod of bishops have been realized, one of which was convoked especially for Africa, on February 6, 1989. In 1994 this assembly was concluded in Rome. Among the issues discussed during the Synod, some have canonical implications. For instance, the existence of small Christian communities alongside parishes; the formation of the principal agents of evangelization in Africa which involves local churches especially the episcopal conferences and the small Christian communities; the ecclesial identity and ministry of the catechist; marriage; and inculturation of liturgy. From the inquiry of the raison d'etre of the synod of bishops according to the Second Vatican Council and the 1983 Code of Canon Law, we have explored {{the extent to which the}} current legislation of the Church can be of assistance in the implementation of the above issues. Since Africa is a big continent with a wide range of peoples with different cultural, ethnic, and political backgrounds, we deliberately limited our discussions to general canonical elements that we consider important in the implementation of any one of the synodal conclusions. As a consultative organ available to the Roman Pontiff in the exercise of his <b>Petrine</b> <b>office,</b> the African Synod was a success. Also, the African Synod enabled the heads of the particular churches in Africa to work together for the first time, in that manner. However, like any human institutions, the synod of bishops, per se, can be improved. For this reason, we have made some suggestions to this effect...|$|E
