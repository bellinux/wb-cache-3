The will would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, and designated Alexandria as the site for a tomb for him and his queen. In late 32BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's <b>powers</b> <b>as</b> consul and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Commandant, whose {{title was}} changed to Grand Marshal in 119 BC before {{reverting}} to Grand Commandant in 51 AD, was the irregularly posted commander {{of the military and}} then regent during the Western Han period.

5|$|Turbines {{were never}} {{replaced}} in battleship design. Diesel engines were eventually {{considered by some}} <b>powers,</b> <b>as</b> they offered very good endurance and an engineering space taking up less {{of the length of}} the ship. They were also heavier, however, took up a greater vertical space, offered less power, and were considered unreliable.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, {{the bulk}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time {{permitted}} to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, Nassau and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied <b>powers</b> <b>as</b> replacements for the sunken ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With no use for the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|Mathematics {{education}} is powerful. This is an assertion that appears often in mathematics education research papers. However, {{the meaning of}} the assertion is far from being clear. An analysis of different ways of talking about power in relation to mathematics education, in research literature, is put forward. Three main discourses are identified: <b>Power</b> <b>as</b> an intrinsic capacity, <b>power</b> <b>as</b> structural imbalance, and <b>power</b> <b>as</b> distributed positioning. Identifying these discourses allows clarifying the values associated to mathematics education and the pedagogical imaginaries that are possible to envision for mathematics teaching and learning...|$|R

5|$|After the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany, however, and were therefore spared {{the destruction of the}} fleet in Scapa Flow. Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied <b>powers</b> <b>as</b> war reparations; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy. She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war. As {{part of the}} Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, the ships were awarded to the victorious <b>powers</b> <b>as</b> war prizes. Kolberg was {{allocated}} to France, where she was commissioned into the French Navy as Colmar. Augsburg was transferred to Japanese control; having no use for her, they sold the ship for scrapping. Colmar saw one tour on colonial duty in Asia in 1924, where she participated in a multinational operation to protect foreign nationals from Chinese unrest in Shanghai. She was subsequently stricken in 1927 and broken up for scrap in Brest, France.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{when the}} Sisters of Death arrived in Mega-City One, they found Kraken there instead of Dredd. Finding Kraken to be {{vulnerable}} to manipulation by their psychic <b>powers,</b> <b>as</b> he was still torn by latent subconscious loyalty to his late master Judd, {{they were able to}} use him as their agent to free Judge Death from captivity and begin their conquest of the city. Had Dredd not resigned, they might not have found their task so easy. Dredd eventually returned to the city and defeated them.|$|E

The Kingdom of Italy was unhappy with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious <b>powers.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were 12 torpedo boats, and they had to build their naval forces almost from scratch.|$|E

He followed this up with a show of military strength, by sending a small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E

5|$|Jennings's salary as governor, {{which was}} the highest for an elected {{official}} in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited <b>powers</b> <b>as</b> governor.|$|E

5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial <b>powers</b> <b>as</b> presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making <b>powers,</b> <b>as</b> it is for public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it {{is the job of}} the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E

He also proposed the creation of a Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side, and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.|$|E
