The contact between prefabricated <b>pile</b> and <b>pile</b> clamping jaws under <b>pile</b> driving was investigated. It was revealed that when the force of <b>pile</b> clamping cylinder is small, the contact between prefabricated <b>pile</b> and <b>pile</b> clamping jaws under <b>pile</b> driving can be considered that between the elastic inner cylindrical surface and the axis parallel elastic outer cylindrical surface.

40|$|AbstractCyclic lateral-loading {{centrifuge}} {{tests were}} conducted on a new <b>pile</b> located {{at the center of}} 2 × 2 existing <b>piles,</b> to evaluate the effects of the existing <b>piles</b> on the new <b>pile's</b> lateral resistance when the <b>piles</b> of an old building are left derelict. Furthermore, two-dimensional FEM analyses of the horizontal cross sections of the pile–soil systems were carried out. The centrifuge test results show that the lateral resistance of a new <b>pile,</b> located among existing <b>piles,</b> shows slight increases. The existing <b>piles</b> increase the horizontal subgrade reaction of {{the upper part of the}} new <b>pile,</b> but slightly decrease that of the lower part of the new <b>pile.</b> Numerical analyses reveal that the key to whether an existing <b>pile</b> increases the horizontal subgrade reaction of a new <b>pile</b> or not, is the soil displacement at the location of the existing <b>pile.</b> An existing <b>pile</b> increases the horizontal subgrade reaction of a new <b>pile</b> when the existing <b>pile</b> displacement is less than the soil displacement caused by the new <b>pile.</b> Conversely, an existing <b>pile</b> decreases the horizontal subgrade reaction of a new <b>pile</b> when the existing <b>pile</b> displacement is greater than the soil displacement caused by the new <b>pile...</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{were some}} initial {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, {{there were so many}} aircraft <b>piling</b> up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area Gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|E

Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams <b>piling</b> on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions.

40|$|Five <b>pile</b> {{tests have}} been performed, {{at the west}} coast of Mexico, in order to {{evaluate}} their <b>pile</b> bearing capacity. The Kentledge system (a test <b>pile</b> loaded in between two tension <b>piles)</b> has been used to execute the <b>pile</b> tests. The soil stratigraphy has been surveyed with standard penetration tests, cone penetration tests and borings, and consists of a ten to twelve meter soft clayey soil on top of a hard clay layer. Three identical <b>pile</b> tests have been performed on bored <b>piles</b> with a <b>pile</b> diameter of 0. 6 m and a <b>pile</b> length of 30 m. In addition, two identical <b>pile</b> tests have been performed on driven <b>piles</b> with a squared cross section of 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m and a <b>pile</b> length of about 21 m. The aims of these tests were, first to evaluate the <b>pile</b> bearing capacity for both the bored and the driven <b>pile</b> types, in order to decide which <b>pile</b> type will be used finally, for the foundation of a factory; and second, to study the influence of the <b>pile</b> installation process on the <b>pile</b> bearing capacity of both <b>pile</b> types. During the testing of the bored <b>piles,</b> load measurements in different sections of the <b>pile</b> suggested that almost all bearing capacity came from the <b>pile</b> section in the upper soft clay layer. Since it is impossible to have such a relative large friction along the <b>pile</b> shaft in the soft soil, and because far more concrete was used for making the <b>pile</b> than expected, it had to be concluded that the liquid concrete has widened the <b>pile</b> diameter just above the hard soil layer, leading to a bulking effect in the <b>pile.</b> Therefore, the <b>pile</b> was leaning on this hard soil layer. For the driven test <b>piles,</b> the measurements showed a normal behaviour of both the <b>pile</b> shaft friction and the <b>pile</b> tip bearing capacity...|$|R

5|$|In a motte-and-bailey design, {{a castle}} {{would include a}} mound called a motte, usually artificially {{constructed}} by <b>piling</b> up turf and soil, and a bailey, a lower walled enclosure.

Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander keep. Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square structure that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design.

5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by <b>piling</b> soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} <b>piling</b> up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E
