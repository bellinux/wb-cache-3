5|$|As for all metals, {{molecular}} {{compounds and}} polyatomic ions of cobalt {{are classified as}} coordination complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several ligands. The principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness {{of a series of}} ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co+3 complexes tend to have ammine ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, <b>phosphine</b> ligands tend to feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C6H5)3)3CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+ derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs2CoF6) and potassium percobaltate (K3CoO4).|$|E
5|$|Other organothorium {{compounds}} are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH2C6H5), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C3H5)4, are known, {{but their}} structures {{have not been}} determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH3)4, is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by <b>phosphine</b> ligands.|$|E
5|$|This {{characteristic}} {{is employed}} in analytical techniques using EDTA as a ligand. EDTA preferentially forms octahedral complexes– thus absorbing other cations such as Al3+ which might interfere – for example, in the solvent extraction {{of a complex}} formed between Be2+ and acetylacetone. Beryllium(II) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as <b>phosphine</b> oxides and arsine oxides. There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show {{the stability of the}} O-Be bond.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary <b>phosphines</b> are {{prepared}} analogously {{to the primary}} <b>phosphines.</b> [...] They are also obtained by alkali-metal reductive cleavage of triarylphosphines followed by hydrolysis of the resulting phosphide salt. [...] The latter route is employed to prepare diphenylphosphine (Ph2PH). [...] Diorganophosphinic acids, R2P(O)OH, can also be reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride. [...] Secondary <b>phosphines</b> are typically protic in character.|$|R
2500|$|Tertiary <b>phosphines</b> are {{generally}} obtained by treatment of phosphorus trichloride or triphenylphosphite with organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents. [...] Tertiary <b>phosphines</b> {{of the type}} PRR'R" [...] are chiral and optically stable.|$|R

This report describes {{the synthesis of}} {{a new class of}} monodentate tertiary <b>phosphines</b> built upon the commonly employed tetraphenylborate anion. These new <b>phosphines</b> are highly stable and strongly electron-releasing and readily coordinate transition metals.

5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, <b>phosphine</b> and methane have been {{detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with <b>phosphine</b> gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphine</b> (PH3) and its organic {{derivatives}} (PR3) are structural analogues with ammonia (NH3) but {{the bond}} angles at phosphorus {{are closer to}} 90° for <b>phosphine</b> and its organic derivatives. It is an ill-smelling, toxic compound. Phosphorus has an oxidation number of -3 in <b>phosphine.</b> <b>Phosphine</b> is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide, Ca3P2. Unlike ammonia, <b>phosphine</b> is oxidised by air. <b>Phosphine</b> is also far less basic than ammonia. Other phophines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula PnHn+2. The highly flammable gas diphosphine (P2H4) is an analogue of hydrazine.|$|E
50|$|In organometalic chemistry, <b>phosphines</b> {{are widely}} used as ligands. This {{is due to the}} fact that they are strong σ-donors and are also capable of π-backbonding with metals (dπ-dπ and dπ-σ* interactions). Furthermore, by {{changing}} the substituents, <b>phosphines</b> can be used to tune the electronic and steric characteristics of the metals they bind to. Their most important application is in catalysis where the use of enantiomerically pure tertiary <b>phosphines</b> can induce stereoselectivity in reactions; asymmetric catalysis.|$|R
50|$|The main {{reaction}} {{types of}} <b>phosphines</b> are as nucleophiles and bases. Their nucleophilicity is evidence by their reactions with alkyl halides to phosphonium salts. <b>Phosphines</b> are nucleophilic catalysts in the dimerization of enones in various reactions in organic synthesis, e.g. the Rauhut-Currier reaction.|$|R
2500|$|Organophosphines are {{compounds}} {{with the}} formula PRnH3−n. [...] These compounds are often classified {{according to the}} value of n: primary <b>phosphines</b> (n = 1), secondary <b>phosphines</b> (n = 2), tertiary <b>phosphines</b> (n = 3). All adopt pyramidal structures. [...] Their reactivity is also similar - they can be oxidized to the phosphorus(V) level, they can be protonated and alkylated at phosphorus to give phosphonium salts, and, for primary and secondary derivatives, they can be deprotonated by strong bases to give organophosphide derivatives.|$|R
25|$|<b>Phosphine</b> can {{be absorbed}} into the body by inhalation. Direct contact with <b>phosphine</b> liquid – {{although}} unlikely to occur – may cause frostbite, like other cryogenic liquids. The main target organ of <b>phosphine</b> gas is the respiratory tract. According to the 2009 U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pocket guide, and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation, the 8 hour average respiratory exposure should not exceed 0.3 ppm. NIOSH recommends that the short term respiratory exposure to <b>phosphine</b> gas should not exceed 1ppm. The Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health level is 50ppm. Overexposure to <b>phosphine</b> gas causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, thirst, chest tightness, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), muscle pain, chills, stupor or syncope, and pulmonary edema. <b>Phosphine</b> {{has been reported to}} have the odor of decaying fish or garlic at concentrations below 0.3 ppm. The smell is normally restricted to laboratory areas or <b>phosphine</b> processing since the smell comes from the way the <b>phosphine</b> is extracted from the environment. However, it may occur elsewhere, such as in industrial waste landfills. Exposure to higher concentrations may cause olfactory fatigue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphine</b> (IUPAC name: phosphane) is the {{compound}} with the chemical formula PH3. It is a colorless, flammable, toxic gas and pnictogen hydride. Pure <b>phosphine</b> is odorless, but technical grade samples have a highly unpleasant odor like garlic or rotting fish, {{due to the}} presence of substituted <b>phosphine</b> and diphosphane (P2H4). With traces of P2H4 present, PH3 is spontaneously flammable in air, burning with a luminous flame. Phosphines are also a group of organophosphorus compounds with the formula R3P (R = organic derivative). Organophosphines are important in catalysts where they complex to various metal ions; complexes derived from a chiral <b>phosphine</b> can catalyze reactions to give chiral, enantioenriched products.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively the acid-catalyzed disproportioning {{of white}} {{phosphorus}} yields phosphoric acid and <b>phosphine.</b> Both routes have industrial significance; the acid route is preferred method if further {{reaction of the}} <b>phosphine</b> to substituted phosphines is needed. The acid route requires purification and pressurizing. It can also be made (as described above) by the hydrolysis of a metal phosphide, such as aluminium phosphide or calcium phosphide. Pure samples of <b>phosphine,</b> free from P2H4, may be prepared using the action of potassium hydroxide on phosphonium iodide (PH4I).|$|E

25|$|Because the {{previously}} popular fumigant methyl bromide has been phased {{out in some}} countries under the Montreal Protocol, <b>phosphine</b> is the only widely used, cost-effective, rapidly acting fumigant that does not leave residues on the stored product. Pests {{with high levels of}} resistance toward <b>phosphine</b> have become common in Asia, Australia and Brazil. High level resistance is also likely to occur in other regions, but has not been as closely monitored. Genetic variants that contribute to high level resistance to <b>phosphine</b> have been identified in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene. Identification of this gene now allows rapid molecular identification of resistant insects.|$|E
