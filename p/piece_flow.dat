5000|$|Flow through {{reducing}} batch sizes: Every traditional business, {{whether in}} production or services, is addicted to batch. The idea as that once work {{is set up}} one way, we’d better get on and quickly make as many pieces of work as we can to keep the unit cost down. Lean thinking looks at this differently in trying to optimize the flow of work {{in order to satisfy}} real demand now, not imaginary demand next month. By working strenuously on reducing change-over time and difficulty, it is possible to approach the lean thinking ideal of single <b>piece</b> <b>flow.</b> In doing so, one reduces dramatically the general cost of the business by eliminating the need for warehouses, transports, systems, subcontractor use and so on.|$|E

40|$|We prove a {{structure}} theorem for pseudo-Anosov flows restricted to Seifert fibered pieces of three manifolds. The piece is called periodic {{if there is}} a Seifert fibration so that a regular fiber is freely homotopic, up to powers, to a closed orbit of the flow. A non periodic Seifert fibered piece is called free. In a previous paper [Ba-Fe 1] we described the structure of a pseudo-Anosov flow restricted to a periodic piece up to isotopy along the flow. In the present paper we consider free Seifert pieces. We show that, in a carefully defined neighborhood of the free <b>piece,</b> the pseudo-Anosov <b>flow</b> is orbitally equivalent to a hyperbolic blow up of a geodesic <b>flow</b> <b>piece.</b> A geodesic <b>flow</b> <b>piece</b> is a finite cover of the geodesic flow on a compact hyperbolic surface, usually with boundary. In the proof we introduce almost k-convergence groups and prove a convergence theorem. We also introduce an alternative model for the geodesic flow of a hyperbolic surface that is suitable to prove these results, and we carefully define what is a hyperbolic blow up...|$|R

40|$|In this research, {{a system}} level {{analysis}} was performed on a one <b>piece</b> <b>flow</b> layout design for a factory manufacturing AC motor control drives. The requirement {{was to create a}} layout for a new product while integrating existing manufacturing lines. Analytical methods and simulation techniques were used to validate the performance of the proposed line. The thesis outlines the manufacturing processes required to make the new product and presents an approach used to predict the new line's performance. A hybrid approach was employed wherein analytical methods were used to create a baseline plan of the production line. The baseline requirements were refined by modeling the line in a discrete event simulation to emulate existing factory constraints. The use of simulation enabled definition of lower level details like shift breaks times, machine breakdown trends and product batching policies. The simulation model was used to predict the impact of factory scenarios that were determined as necessary milestones in transforming the factory layout from existing layout to the proposed layout. The concept of changing the layout from process based to one <b>piece</b> <b>flow</b> was validated through a Kaizen event. The event resulted in floor space savings of 500 sq. ft. and a reduction in work in progress inventory of 2160 drives. The Kaizen event facilitated in familiarizing with the existing factory processes which was essential in creating the new factory layout. by Vrushank S. Phadnis. Thesis: M.

30|$|The {{ability of}} {{manufacturing}} system {{to adjust the}} volume of production (supply) as per the customers demand is termed as volume flexibility. Manufacturer should be in position {{to meet the demand}} of variety of products at peak level at rapid rate with competitive price and also remain efficient during slack period. Hence, small batch size (ideally single <b>piece</b> <b>flow)</b> is preferable. Flexible assembly line is desirable in this case. Thus, JIT offers the flexibility to the organization and keeps the manufacturing system in synchronization with its ever changing environmental conditions. A flexible work force and flexible machines both are equally vital to achieve JIT manufacturing. The operators should be multi-skilled and machine/equipment must be set up as quickly as possible to cope up with small lot size of variety of products. Since, volume flexibility practices can help in achieving reliable delivery, we can start implementation of this bundle simultaneously with conformance quality practices.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{increase}} {{output and}} meet customers' needs, companies {{have turned to}} the development of production management systems: Kaizen, one <b>piece</b> <b>flow,</b> Kanban, etc. The aim of such systems is to accelerate decisions, react to environmental issues and manage various productions. In the main, this type of management system has led to the continuous improvement of production performance. Consequently, such production management systems can have unexpected negative effects on operators' health and safety. Conversely, regulation and control systems focusing on work-related risks have obliged firms to implement health and safety management systems such as OHSAS 18001. The purpose of this type of system, also based on continuous improvement, is to reduce risks, facilitate work-related activities and identify solutions in terms of equipment and tools. However, the prevention actions introduced through health and safety systems often result in other unexpected and unwanted effects on production. This paper shows how companies can improve the way they are run by taking into account both types of management system...|$|E

40|$|To manage {{any company}} process, it is {{essential}} to measure its performance. Lean production as a process of a change in a production, {{which is one of the}} main company processes, is no exception. We see that the universal methodology of a practically applicable evaluation of the level of leanness of production is missing. Many authors use some form of qualitative methodology - especially in form of questionnaires. In this paper, we focus on an analysis of possible approach using a quantitative methodology. We take Little's Law formula describing direct correlation between lead time and work in process to use lead time as a main metric to evaluate leanness of production. Thanks to the formula, we know that the shorter the production time is, the less buffers are kept and the more effective and thus the “leaner” the material flow is. As a benchmark for ideal lean company, we use one <b>piece</b> <b>flow</b> representing the top level of lean production...|$|E

We conclude that both gravity and the geometry of the pulmonary vascular tree influence regional pulmonary blood flow.
