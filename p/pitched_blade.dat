40|$|The {{performance}} of a down- and up-pumping <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> turbine and A 315 for gas-liquid dispersion and mass transfer was evaluated and then {{compared with that of}} Rushton and Scaba turbines in a small laboratory scale vessel. The results show that when the axial flow impellers are operated in the up-pumping mode, the overall performance is largely improved compared with the down-pumping configuration. Compared with the radial turbines, the up-pumping A 315 has a high gas handling capacity, equivalent to the Scaba turbine and is economically much more efficient in terms of mass transfer than both turbines. On the other hand, the uppumping <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> turbine is not as well adapted to such applications.

A four-blade <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impeller (pitch angle α = 30 °), pumping downwards, was investigated in a pilot plant fully baffled agitated vessel with a water suspension of corundum. The results of  experiments show that the erosion wear rate of the impeller blades is proportional to n 2. 7 and that the rate exhibits a monotonous dependence (increase) with increasing size of the particles. However, the erosion rate of the <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impeller reaches a maximum at a certain concentration, and above this value it decreases as the proportion of solid particles increases.

The pumping capacity was calculated from the radial profile of the axial flow, under the assumption of axial symmetry of the discharge flow. The mean velocity was measured using laser Doppler anemometry in a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm, provided with a standard dished bottom. Three and six blade <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers (the pitch angle varied within the interval a Îá 24 °; 45 °ń) of impeller/vessel diameter ratio D/T = 0. 36, as well as a three blade <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impeller with folded blades of the same diameter, were tested. The calculated results were compared with the results of experiments mentioned in the literature, above all in cylindrical vessels with a flat bottom. Both arrangements of the agitated system were described by the impeller energetic efficiency, i. e, a criterion including in dimensionless form both the impeller energy consumption (impeller power input) and the impeller pumping effect (impeller pumping capacity).

The influence of the geometry of the <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers (pitch angle, number of blades) and the off-bottom impeller clearance of both high-speed impellers tested on the impeller power input is determined in two sizes of the cylindrical vessel (0. 3 m and 0. 8 m diameter of vessel). A strain gauge torquemeter is used in the small vessel and a phase shift mechanical torquemeter is used in the large vessel. All results of the experiments correspond to the condition that the Reynolds number modified for the impeller exceeds ten thousand. The results of this study show that the significant influence of the separating disk thickness of the turbine impeller corresponds fairly well to the empirical equations presented in the literature. Both the influence of the number of impeller blades and the blade pitch angle of the <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impeller were expressed quantitatively by means of the power dependence of the recently published correlations: the higher the pitch angle and the number of blades, the higher the values of the impeller power input.

The conductivity method is used to determine of the blending (homogenization) time of miscible liquids in pilot plant mixing equipment with standard radial baffles. For the given homogeneity degree (98 %) a three-blade <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impeller is tested with various off-bottom clearances, vessel/ impeller diameter ratios and various impeller pitch angles. The experimental results show in accordance with theoretical data from the literature, that the greatest effect on the dimensionless blending time is exhibited by the vessel/ impeller diameter ratio and the impeller pitch angle. The number of total circulations necessary for reaching the chosen homogeneity degree depends on the impeller pitch angle and amounts more than three. Finally, the energetic efficiency of the blending process is calculated.

By comparison to the turbulent system (Ibrahim and Nienow, 1996), at high viscosity, there was less random particle movement across the base prior to suspension. On the other hand, once the agitation speed, N, was high enough to achieve suspension, i. e., N = N(js), particles remained longer in suspension after a reduction to N 3000, the optimum overall configuration was a D/T of about 0. 4 with the downward pumping HE- 3 and <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> turbines, whilst at Re 3000, the optimum overall configuration was a D/T of about 0. 4 with the downward pumping HE- 3 and <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> turbines, whilst at Re< 3000, the optimimum was the HE- 3 at a D/T of about 0. 5.

40|$|Abstract – The newly {{developed}} tomographical dual wavelength photometry enables {{the measurement of}} the local intensity of segregation at a multitude of points inside the stirred vessel. This is done by injecting a mixture of an inert and a reacting dye into the vessel. The inert dye serves as a tracer for the macromixing, whereas the vanishing of the reacting dye shows the micromixing. The concentration fields of the dyes are measured simultaneously by transluminating the vessel from three directions with superimposed laser beams of different wavelength. The light absorption by the dyes is measured with CCD-cameras and these projections are used for the tomographic reconstruction of the concentration fields. Low Reynolds number measurements were performed {{with a combination of}} two Rushton turbines and a combination of two <b>Pitched</b> <b>Blade</b> Impellers. The combination of the <b>Pitched</b> <b>Blade</b> Impellers yields a good axial transport but a slow micromixing.

The draught tube was equipped with four equally spaced radial baffles above the impeller pumping liquid upwards towards the liquid surface. In all investigated cases the liquid aspect ratio H/T = 1. 2 - 1. 5, the draught tube / vessel diameter ratios DT /T = 0. 2 and 0. 4 and the impeller / draught tube diameter ratio D/DT = 0. 875. The pumping capacity of the impeller was calculated from the radial profile of the axial component of the mean velocity in the draught tube below the impeller at such an axial distance from the impeller that the rotor does not affect the vorticity of the flow. The mean velocity was measured using a laser Doppler anemometer with forward scatter mode in a transparent draught tube and a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm. Two series of experiments were performed, both of them under a turbulent regime of flow of the agitated liquid. First, the optimum height of the dished bottom was sought, and then the dependences of the dimensionless flow rate criterion and the impeller power number on the number of impeller blades were determined for both pitch angles tested under conditions of optimum ratio HT /DT. It follows from the results of the experiments that the optimum ratio HT /DT = 0. 25 when the cross sectional areas of the horizontal flow around the bottom and the vertical inflow to the draught tube are the same. For all the tested <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers the impeller power number when α = 45 ° exceeds the value of this quantity when pitch angle α  =   35 °, while the flow rate number when α = 35 ° exceeds this quantity when α = 45 °. On the other hand, the absolute values of the impeller power number when the draught tube was introduced correspond fairly well to the dimensionless impeller power input measured in a system without a draught tube. However, the absolute values of the flow rate number found in the former system are significantly lower than the dimensionless impeller pumping capacity determined in the latter system. The hydraulic efficiency of <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers N 3 Qp/Po for the investigated geometry of the agitated systems does not depend on the number of impeller blades, but it is significantly lower than the quantity determined in an agitated system with a dished bottom but without the draught tube. </p...|$|E
