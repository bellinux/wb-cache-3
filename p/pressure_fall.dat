50|$|The mesocyclone {{associated}} with the tornado was tracked by {{a large number of}} meteorologists and storm chasers. A small probe was placed directly in the tornado's damage path. The vortex traveled directly over the instrument, and record-breaking meteorological data was obtained by the probe. It managed to survive winds at the time estimated to be up to 260 mph (418 km/h) and measured a barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>fall</b> of around 100 millibars {{near the center of the}} half-mile wide tornado. Current estimates of wind speeds in an EF4-rated tornado would be in the 166-200 mph (267-322 km/h) range.|$|E
50|$|Overheating is {{a serious}} concern for the engine, since the engine block is of an open-deck design, severe {{overheating}} could cause the cylinder barrels to warp and {{pull away from the}} head gasket, causing coolant leaks into the cylinders and cylinder scuffing. Maintaining oil and coolant levels is crucial for the engine. The engine is equipped with an oil pressure switch which grounds out the primary-ignition system should the oil <b>pressure</b> <b>fall</b> below 6 psi during operation, thus stopping and preventing the engine from being restarted until the oil level was replenished or the mechanical cause of low-oil pressure was remedied. Chevrolet dealers installed a coolant-recovery tank, a low-coolant warning light and extended Vega's engine warranty to 50000 mi to all Vega owners. This proved costly for Chevrolet.|$|E
50|$|Gravity: The {{effects of}} gravity on venous return seem {{paradoxical}} because {{when a person}} stands up, hydrostatic forces cause the right atrial pressure to decrease and the venous pressure in the dependent limbs to increase. This increases the pressure gradient for venous return from the dependent limbs to the right atrium; however, venous return actually decreases. The {{reason for this is}} when a person initially stands, cardiac output and arterial pressure decrease (because right atrial <b>pressure</b> <b>falls).</b> The flow through the entire systemic circulation <b>falls</b> because arterial <b>pressure</b> <b>falls</b> more than right atrial pressure; therefore the pressure gradient driving flow throughout the entire circulatory system is decreased.|$|R

5000|$|In 1994 Nguyen began chasing {{storms in}} Texas and soon {{expanded}} his range {{to the larger}} area of the central United States commonly known as Tornado Alley. Nguyen began publishing images regularly in Accord Publishing's popular annual Weather Guide Calendar series, Smithsonian Magazine, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, as well as Weatherwise, Storm Track, UCAR Quarterly, textbooks, and other venues. His Mulvane, Kansas image of white tornado with a rainbow {{is one of the}} most frequently licensed tornado images of all time and several other of his photos have appeared in publications and presentations around the world. Nguyen's storm and tornado photography was considered among the most expressive in the field, with a particular emphasis on unusual palettes and the use of foreground elements to create dynamic line structures in the composition. On April 21, 2007, Nguyen and his storm chasing partner, Amos Magliocco, were struck by a tornado in Tulia, Texas. Nguyen's scientific grade weather instrumentation survived the hit and arguably measured the sharpest <b>pressure</b> <b>fall</b> ever recorded on Earth. Upon his death, hundreds of weather enthusiasts from around the world praised Nguyen's skills as a photographer and chaser in the online journal Storm Track The University of Oklahoma hosted a memorial tribute ceremony in the National Weather Center (NWC) on September 22, 2007. The keynote speaker was Dr. Charles A. Doswell III. An endowed scholarship for graduate and undergraduate meteorology students was created in Nguyen's name at OU's prestigious School of Meteorology (SoM). Nguyen's imagery is represented by the stock photo agency Corbis Int'l which notes that the Mulvane, Kansas tornado image is [...] "Widely considered among stormchasers as the greatest tornado photo of all time..." [...] A five-week exhibition of Nguyen's photography was held at the Todd/Browning Gallery in Los Angeles from March 15-April 23.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} right ventricular (RV) {{and left}} ventricular (LV) diastolic tolerance to afterload and SERCA 2 a, phospholamban and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) gene expression in Wistar rats. Time constant tau and end-diastolic pressure-dimension relation (EDPDR) were analyzed {{in response to}} progressive RV or LV afterload elevations, induced by beat-to-beat pulmonary trunk or aortic root constrictions, respectively. Afterload elevations decreased LV-tau, but increased RV-tau. Whereas LV-tau analyzed the major course of <b>pressure</b> <b>fall,</b> RV-tau only assessed the last fourth. Furthermore, RV afterload elevations progressively upward shifted RV-EDPDR, whilst LV afterload elevations did not change LV-EDPDR. SERCA 2 a and phospholamban mRNA were similar in both ventricles. NCX-mRNA was almost 50 % lower in RV than in LV. Left ventricular afterload elevations, therefore, accelerated the <b>pressure</b> <b>fall</b> and did not induce diastolic dysfunction, indicating high LV diastolic tolerance to afterload. On the contrary, RV afterload elevations decelerated the late RV <b>pressure</b> <b>fall</b> and induced diastolic dysfunction, indicating small RV diastolic tolerance to afterload. These results support previous findings relating NCX with late Ca 2 + reuptake, late relaxation and diastolic dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that incomplete relaxation explains certain increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure relative to volume, {{there has been no}} clear demonstration that incomplete relaxation occurs in the intact working ventricle. To identify incomplete relaxation, left ventricular pressure-dimension relationships were studied in 10 canine right heart bypass preparations during ventricular pacing. The fully relaxed, exponential diastolic pressure-dimension line for each ventricle was first determined from pressure and dimension values at the end of prolonged diastoles after interruption of pacing. For 167 beats during pacing under widely varying hemodynamic conditions, diastolic pressure-dimension values encountered this line defining the fully relaxed state during the filling period indicating that relaxation was complete before end diastole. The time constant for isovolumic exponential <b>pressure</b> <b>fall</b> (T) was determined for all beats. For this exponential function, if no diastolic filling occurred, 97 % of <b>pressure</b> <b>fall</b> would be complete by 3. 5 T after maximal negative dP/dt. For the 167 beats the fully relaxed pressure-dimension line was always encountered before 3. 5 T...|$|E
