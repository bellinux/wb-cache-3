40|$|Abstract—In the past, {{the process}} {{capability}} index (PCI) {{was the only one}} used in on-line quality management; there were no researches on off-line applications, such as product design or process planning. In using conventional PCI for off-line application, designers normally established the process mean close to the design target, and minimized the process variance so that the PCI value would be maximized. The process variance is determined by the <b>process</b> <b>tolerance,</b> which affects the production cost. This factor must be considered because cost will increase as <b>process</b> <b>tolerance</b> is minimized. Simply averting small tolerance for the sake of cost reduction is not always a rational choice, because a great tolerance value generally results in poor quality. Hence, the conventional PCI value does not truly represent the measurement score for off-line applications during product design or process planning. In this regard, the off-line PCI expression is developed with consideration of the balance between product quality and production cost. The product quality is represented by quality loss function, and production cost is expressed by tolerance cost function. These two functions are simultaneously related to process mean and <b>process</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Thus, the new PCI expression can be used to determine appropriate process mean and <b>process</b> <b>tolerance,</b> as well as a measurement score for comparison and selection among candidates. Consequently, an economical and quality of product design and process planning can be achieved during off-line applications. Index Terms—Process capability index (PCI); Process Mean; Process tolerance; Off-line application...|$|E
40|$|An optimal {{approach}} for <b>process</b> <b>tolerance</b> balancing is presented. The new approach {{is based on}} process capabilities and {{is to be used}} in the stage of process planning. A nonlinear programming model is used to simultaneously optimise process tolerances of required operations. In the optimisation model, the objective function is to minimise the total manufacturing cost with different weighting factors. Using the estimated standard deviations of the dimensions and the manufacturing cost-tolerance functions, the constraint equations for the <b>process</b> <b>tolerance</b> chains and the manufacturing capability indices are established, together with a model for the economical tolerance bounds of machine tools. A practical example was used to verify the usefulness of the proposed approach. The results of the comparative study show that the proposed approach is more advantageous in relaxing tolerance requirements and in reducing scrap rates generally, compared with the existing methods...|$|E
30|$|<b>Process</b> <b>tolerancing</b> {{based on}} the process {{capability}} studies is the optimistic and pragmatic approach of determining the manufacturing <b>process</b> <b>tolerances.</b> On adopting the define–measure–analyze–improve–control approach, the process potential capability index (C p) and the process performance capability index (C pk) values of identified process characteristics of connecting rod machining process are achieved to be greater than the industry benchmark of 1.33, i.e., four sigma level. The tolerance chain diagram methodology {{is applied to the}} connecting rod in order to verify the manufacturing <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> at various operations of the connecting rod manufacturing process. This paper bridges the gap between the existing dimensional tolerances obtained via <b>tolerance</b> charting and <b>process</b> capability studies of the connecting rod component.

40|$|Concurrent {{tolerance}} allocation {{has been}} the focus of extensive research, yet very few researchers have considered how to concurrently allocate design and <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> for mechanical assemblies with interrelated dimension chains. To address this question, this paper presents a new tolerance allocation method that applies the concept of concurrent engineering. The proposed method allocates the required functional assembly tolerances to the design and <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> by formulating the tolerance allocation problem into a comprehensive model and solving the model using a non-linear programming software package. A multivariate quality loss function of interrelated critical dimensions is first derived, each component design tolerance is formulated as the function of its related <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> according to the given process planning, both manufacturing cost and quality loss are further expressed as functions of <b>process</b> <b>tolerances.</b> And then, the objective function of the model, which is to minimize the sum of manufacturing cost and expected quality loss, is established and the constraints are formulated based on the assembly requirements and process constraints. The purpose of the model is to balance manufacturing cost and quality loss so that concurrent optimal allocation of design and <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> is realized and quality improvement and product cost reduction is achieved. The proposed method is tested on a practical example...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Power {{dissipation}} {{and tolerance}} to process variations pose conflicting design requirements. Scaling of voltage {{is associated with}} larger variations, while Vdd upscaling or transistor up-sizing for <b>process</b> <b>tolerance</b> can be detrimental for power dissipation. However, for certain signal processing systems such as those used in color image processing, we noted that effective trade-offs can be achieved between Vdd scaling, <b>process</b> <b>tolerance</b> and “output quality”. In this paper we demonstrate how these tradeoffs can be effectively utilized {{in the development of}} novel low-power variation tolerant architectures for color interpolation. The proposed architecture supports a graceful degradation in the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) under aggressive voltage scaling as well as extreme process variations in sub- 70 nm technologies. This is achieved by exploiting the fact that some computations are more important and contribute more to the PSNR improvement compared to the others. The computations are mapped to the hardware {{in such a way that}} only the less important computations are affected by Vdd-scaling and process variations. Simulation results show that even at a scaled voltage of 60 % of nominal Vdd value, our design provides reasonable image PSNR with 69 % power savings. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{approaches}} for process planning of manufacturing operations preset fixed process means and <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> for all operations and permit outputs to be dis-tributed around these fixed values, {{provided that the}} final outputs meet acceptable specifica-tions. These approaches are inappropriate for high-value and precision manufacturing processes, especially those where a complex part may suffer from process deterioration. The problem is that in these approaches, process means and <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> {{are considered to be}} independent decision variables, whereby the resultant process means are equal to or close to the design targets of the blueprint dimensions. In addition, they do not consider the phe-nomena of process shifting or deterioration as factors of manufacturing operations, but assume that process variability is small in comparison to the quality requirements. Therefore, in this study a process optimization model is introduced that simultaneously takes process means and <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> into account. Furthermore, it reduces process variability and offsets process deterioration by means of sequential operation adjustment. With the scheme developed in this study built into the control system, a real-time system for integrated process control and modification for making adaptive process planning can be realized...|$|R

Process-oriented tolerancing was focused upon, by considering all the variations arising due to tool wear, measurement device fluctuations, tolerance stack-up propagation (Ding et al. 2005). A process optimization model was introduced which considers process means and <b>process</b> <b>tolerances</b> simultaneously, with sequential operation adjustment to reduce process variability, and with part compensation to offset process shifting (Jeang et al. 2007).
