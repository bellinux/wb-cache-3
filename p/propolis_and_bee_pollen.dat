Poultry enterococci carrying antimicrobial resistance genes may not only transfer these genes to other, possibly pathogenic, bacteria in the chicken gut, but upon transfer to zoonotic bacteria they also may pose a human health hazard. Antibiotic resistance prevalence of E. faecalis isolates found in the crop was subsequently found in the ileum and caecum within each group of broiler chickens. No resistance of E. faecalis isolates was found against vancomycin and teicoplanin.

Both <b>propolis</b> wax <b>and</b> beeswax formed organogel thanks {{to the presence of}} crystal networks made of needle-like β′-form crystals. Based on FTIR spectroscopy, mainly van der Waals interactions were formed in the systems. Propolis wax organogels displayed lower firmness and G′ and G″ modulus in comparison to the corresponding beeswax samples. This was due to the presence of larger crystals with a less organized network. The observed behaviors were attributed to differences in chemical composition between these two types of waxes. The combined use of <b>propolis</b> wax <b>and</b> beeswax led to organogels with behavior in between the organogels with single waxes, probably {{as a consequence of the}} formation of mixed crystals.

In a first step, a rearing system using eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) as a food and synthetic polyester wadding as an oviposition substrate was compared with a natural rearing system using the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), as to its effects on the predator's developmental and reproductive parameters. In a second series of experiments the performance of C. montrouzieri on <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> or on a mixture of E. kuehniella eggs <b>and</b> <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> was assessed. E. kuehniella eggs {{proved to be a}} suitable food to support larval development of the predator.

Despite a prolongation of the preoviposition period with ca. eight days and a decrease in egg hatch by about 10 %, C. montrouzieri females fed moth eggs accepted the synthetic wadding as an oviposition substrate and deposited the same number of eggs their counterparts maintained on mealybugs. A mixture of E. kuehniella eggs with pollen yielded similar developmental and reproductive rates as E. kuehniella eggs alone, but a diet of <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> alone was not adequate for the predator. Our findings indicate the potential of a rearing system using E. kuehniella eggs as a factitious food and synthetic wadding as an artificial oviposition substrate for the mass production of C. montrouzieri...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{characterize}} native bee plants regarding their capacity to extract and accumulate trace elements from the soil and its consequences to the sanity of the produced pollen. The trace elements Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn were analyzed in soil, plants <b>and</b> <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> from Teresina region (PI), Brazil, by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Considering the studied plant species, Cu and Pb metals presented in the highest levels in the roots of B. platypetala with 47. 35 and 32. 71 &# 956;g. mL- 1 and H. suaveolens with 39. 69 and 17. 06 &# 956;g. mL- 1, respectively, while in the aerial parts Mn and Zn metals presented the highest levels in S. verticillata with 199. 18 and 85. 73 &# 956;g. mL- 1. In the pollen, the levels of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn vary from 5. 44 to 11. 75 &# 956;g. mL- 1; 34. 31 to 85. 75 &# 956;g. mL- 1; 13. 98 to 18. 19 &# 956;g. mL- 1 and 50. 19 to 90. 35 &# 956;g. mL- 1, respectively. These results indicate that in the apicultural pasture the translocation (from soil to pollen) of Mn and Zn was more effective than in case of Cu and Pb, therefore, the <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> can be used as food supplement without causing risks to human health...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> {{moisture}} {{value is}} one of the quality parameters for this product. Some countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Poland <b>and</b> Switzerland have <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> regulations on quality parameters, but these are not clear regarding which method should be used for moisture determination. The aim of this paper was to compare six methods of moisture determination in dried <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> samples. The methods were: conventional oven at 100 °C, vacuum oven at 70 °C, desiccator with sulfuric acid, drying out process with infrared light at 85 °C, lyophilization and Karl Fisher's method. Based on the results, the best methods for moisture determination of <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> were the drying process with infrared and the lyophilization, since these have shown lower moisture values...|$|R
40|$|The estrogenic/antiestrogenic {{activity}} and the genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity of <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> from Salix alba L. and Cystus incanus L. and its derivative extracts in yeast and human cells was investigated. All samples showed a marked inhibitory effect on {{the activity of the}} natural estrogen 17 beta-estradiol (higher than 90 % for extracts 2) and failed to cause estrogenic {{activity and}} chromosome damage. At least one preparation from each species showed a marked antigenotoxic effect against the action of the anticancer drugs mytomicin C, bleomycin, <b>and</b> vincristine. <b>Bee</b> <b>pollens</b> from C. incanus and S. alba were found to be neither genotoxic nor estrogenic as well as effective estrogen inhibitors, and able to reduce the chromosome damage induced by the three cancer drugs used, thus supporting their use as a safe food supplement and future chemoprotective/chemopreventive agents...|$|R
40|$|The aim of my {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to create}} a summary of pollen pasture of the European honey bee in the Mladá Boleslav area. In theoretical part, I have put together basic information related to the European honey <b>bee</b> <b>and</b> <b>pollen</b> (<b>bee</b> colony, body structure, bee evolution, <b>bee</b> communication, pests <b>and</b> diseases, <b>bee</b> <b>and</b> plant relationship, harvesting and consumption of <b>pollen,</b> <b>pollen</b> load <b>and</b> <b>bee</b> products). In the practical part, I have determined the pollen load's origin by analyzing pollen. This method was carried out with an illuminated binocular microscope. The plants are sorted into families. This data was then used in statistics, graphs and charts. Altogether, It was collected 4 721 pollen loads between the years 2015 and 2016. I gathered 2 553 samples in 2015 and 2 168 samples in the following year. The biggest pollen pasture was offered by the Brassicaceae family in 2015 and by family Lamiaceae in 2016...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small noncoding RNA that, through {{mediating}} posttranscriptional gene regulation, {{play a critical role}} in nearly all biological processes. Over the last decade it has become apparent that plant miRNAs may serve as a novel functional component of food with therapeutic effects including anti-influenza <b>and</b> antitumor. Rapeseed <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> has good properties in enhancing immune function as well as preventing and treating disease. In this study, we identified the exogenous miRNAs from rapeseed <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> in mice blood using RNA-seq technology. We found that miR- 166 a was the most highly enriched exogenous plant miRNAs in the blood of mice fed with rapeseed <b>bee</b> <b>pollen,</b> followed by miR- 159. Subsequently, RT-qPCR results confirmed that these two miRNAs also can be detected in rapeseed <b>bee</b> <b>pollen.</b> Our results suggested that food-derived exogenous miRNAs from rapeseed <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> could be absorbed in mice and the abundance of exogenous miRNAs in mouse blood is dependent on their original levels in the rapeseed <b>bee</b> <b>pollen...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> {{has been}} used for many years in {{traditional}} medicine <b>and</b> supplementary nutrients. <b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> is mainly composed of nutrients and bioactive substances which might act as potential antioxidants and tyrosinase inhibitors. In this study, 14 species of monofloral <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> from China were collected to analyse their antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibitory properties. Our results revealed that virtually all the <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> samples possessed powerful antioxidant or tyrosinase inhibitory activities. These properties varied greatly depending on the fl oral species and extraction solvents. To extract phenolics of various species of <b>bee</b> <b>pollen,</b> the most effective solvent may be a solvent which is a 75 wt. % ethanol/water. Extracts of wuweizi, rape, phellodendron, apricot, and dandelion pollen had stronger antioxidant activities; on the other hand, those of apricot, camellia, and sunflower presented excellent tyrosinase inhibitory activities. In addition, we may have found a novel discovery: that apricot pollen exhibits both powerful antioxidant and strong tyrosinase inhibitory activities...|$|R
50|$|Apitherapy is {{the medical}} use of {{honeybee}} {{products such as}} honey, <b>pollen,</b> <b>bee</b> bread, <b>propolis,</b> royal jelly <b>and</b> <b>bee</b> venom. One of the major peptides in bee venom, called Melittin, {{has the potential to}} treat inflammation in sufferers of Rheumatoid arthritis and Multiple sclerosis. Melittin blocks the expression of inflammatory genes, thus reducing swelling and pain. It is administered by direct insect sting, or intramuscular injections. Bee products demonstrate a wide array of antimicrobial factors and in laboratory studies and have been shown to kill antibiotic resistant bacteria, pancreatic cancer cells, and many other infectious microbes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The stingless {{bees are}} {{important}} flowers visitors of several plant species, {{due to their}} feeding habits and foraging behavior, constituting an important group to maintain biodiversity and the dynamics of tropical communities. Among stingless bees, Tetragonisca angustula is widely distributed in tropical habitats, and has been considered an important pollinator of different plant families. To support a rational economic use of this group, {{there is a need}} to characterize the plant species that represent important sources as part of their diet, as preferred, alternative or casual food sources. The aim of this survey was to distinguish the plant species that T. angustula visited most often. The study was undertaken in four regions of the Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro state (Brazil) over a year from March 2008 to February 2009. For this, we collected <b>bees,</b> flowering plants <b>and</b> <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> loads from the four sites, and evaluated pollen morphology in the laboratory. Field obser-vations showed the presence of plants belonging to ten different families and pollen loads showed the presence of pollen types belonging to 26 plant families. There were strong differences between pollen types, especially regarding pollen grain shape. The present survey suggests a high value of these plant species as trophic resource...|$|R
5000|$|There {{exists a}} mutualistic {{relationship}} between the honey-guide bird and humans: {{in order to obtain}} wax, the bird guides people (and, according to popular legend, honey-badgers, although the relationship between honey-guides and honey badgers has since been called into question) to the nests of wild bees. The Hadza honey hunter, typically a man, will engage in a whistle [...] "dialogue" [...] between himself and the honey-guide bird. [...] The hunter and the bird communicate back and forth, via this series of chatters and whistles, until the bird guides the Hadza man to the hive. Once they have located the hive, the honey hunter hammers pegs into the tree, climbs to the hive (which can be located thirty feet up the trunk of the tree), uses his axe to chop into the tree to uncover the hive, smokes the bees in order to pacify them, and retrieves the honey comb. The Hadza honey hunter consumes the liquid honey and larvae while the honey guide bird consumes the wax <b>and</b> the <b>bees.</b> The role of the honey-guide is reflected also in Hadza mythology, both in naturalistic and personified forms. Honey represents {{a substantial portion of the}} Hadza diet and this reliance on honey (as well as larvae <b>and</b> <b>bee</b> <b>pollen),</b> exemplified by the Hadza, may have a long and rich history in human evolution.|$|R
