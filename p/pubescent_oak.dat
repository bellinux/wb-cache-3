The Mediterranean zone is dominated, among other, by <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens) and Oriental Hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), the deciduous zone by European oak (Quercus robur) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and the coniferous— by Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce), Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The subalpine line is mainly covered with dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and common juniper (Juniperus communis). The alpine line is covered with grass, moss, lichen and abundant in bilberries and rare flowers such as the edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum).

40|$|Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the inner-Alpine dry {{valleys of}} Switzerland have {{suffered}} from increased mortality during the past decades, which has been caused by longer and more frequent dry periods. In addition, a proceeding replacement of Scots pines by <b>pubescent</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.) has been observed. In 2003, an irrigation experiment was performed to track changes by reducing drought pressure on the natural pine forest. After nine years of irrigation, we observed major adaptations in the vegetation and shifts in Scots pine fine root abundance and structure. Irrigation permitted new plant species to assemble and promote canopy closure with a subsequent loss of herb and moss coverage. Fine root dry weight increased under irrigation and fine roots {{had a tendency to}} elongate. Structural composition of fine roots remained unaffected by irrigation, expressing preserved proportions of cellulose, lignin and phenolic substances. A shift to a more negative δ 13 C signal in the fine root C indicates an increased photosynthetic activity in irrigated pine trees. Using radiocarbon (14 C) measurement, a reduced mean age of the fine roots in irrigated plots was revealed. The reason for this is either an increase in newly produced fine roots, supported by the increase in fine root biomass, or a reduced lifespan of fine roots which corresponds to an enhanced turnover rate. Overall, the responses belowground to irrigation are less conspicuous than the more rapid adaptations aboveground. Lagged and conservative adaptations of tree roots with decadal lifespans are challenging to detect, hence demanding for long-term surveys. Investigations concerning fine root turnover rate and degradation processes under a changing climate are crucial for a complete understanding of C cycling...|$|R

Furthermore, sand lizards (lacerta bilineata) and praying mantis (Mantis religiosa) live here - species which mainly occur in the Mediterranean area. (However, according to the latest research results the sand lizard presumably belongs to the allochthone species of the European green lizard (Lacerta viridis)). The <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens) is a Xerophyte and normally only occurs in Southern Europe, but is also able to survive at the Kaiserstuhl. This species has a disjunct distribution, which means away from its normal habitat. It is a relict of a postglacial warm period where there had been a much warmer climate around the Kaiserstuhl. After the end of the warm period only the named species were able to survive. Besides there is a larger population of the May beetle (Melolontha melolontha).

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescensWilld.) and {{holm oak}} (Quercus ilex L.) are climatozonal {{species in the}} area of Zadar, where the {{communities}} formed by these two species have an ecological- protective role. The aim of this research is {{to address the problem of}} the disturbed stability of these stands and the possibility of their post-fire regeneration. Materials and Methods: Research was undertaken in burned and unburned areas of the Zadar Forest Office. This included <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> coppices, scrub, thickets, maquis and garrigue. The relevés were made according to the plant sociology method (Braun-Blanquet 1964, Dierschke 1994). Pedological research involved taking composite samples of the humus-accumulative horizon. Chemical soil analyses were performed according to the standard methods. Results: The number of <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> individuals was about 2. 5 times higher in burned areas compared to unburned ones. This was in contrast to holm oak, which showed poorer occurrence in burned areas in relation to unburned ones. The average number of all trees and shrubs in degraded forms of <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> was 11. 567 per hectare, whereas in degraded forms of holm oak forest this number was more than twice as high and amounted to 2. 550 individuals per hectare. Conclusions: Forest fires are an important cause of soil degradation. Burned areas are subject to erosion, the disappearance of or a decrease in soil biological activity, and extreme ecological effects.

40|$|In {{the area}} of the western Balkans, xerothermal broad-leaf forests hold a very special position, the main species being <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.). The study {{comprises}} 36 populations of <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia. Genetic variability and population diversity was analysed on chloroplast DNA in order to determine to which haplotype an individual or studied population belongs, as well as how they are related. For the detection of one haplotype analysed four sequences (AS, TF, DT and CD) on the chloroplasts DNA. The results of the analysis suggest that there are six different haplotypes of <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (2, 4, 5, 17, 31, 33) in the studied populations. Two more sub-haplotypes were found in haplotype 5 (a and b), but only in populations occurring in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

"Transpiration of montane Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus pubescens Willd. forest stands measured with sap flow sensors in NE Spain. " Stand transpiration was measured during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons using heat dissipation sap flow sensors in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and a <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.) forest {{located in a}} montane area of the Eastern Pyrenees (NE Spain). Over the studied period of 2003, characterised by a severe drought episode during the summer, the oak stand Ec was only 110 mm compared to the 239 mm transpired by the Scots pine stand. Scots pine showed a strong reduction in Ec/ET 0 as the drought developed, whereas <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> was less affected by soil moisture deficits in the upper soil. Rainfall {{during the summer months}} (June-September) in 2003 was almost 40 % less than in the same interval in 2004. Accordingly, transpiration was also reduced about 25 % in 2003. 2. "Variation in the radial patterns of sap flux density in <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.) and its implications for tree and stand transpiration measurements". Radial variation in sap flux density along the sapwood was assessed in several Quercus pubescens Wild. trees with the Heat Field Deformation method. Sapwood depth could be delimited by identifying the point of zero flow in radial patterns of sap flow, yielding tree sapwood areas which were 1. 5 - 2 times larger than previous visual identifications on wood cores. Radial patterns varied among trees and diurnally, with a significant contribution from the inner sapwood during the early morning and late in the day. Stand transpiration calculated using the new sapwood areas and radial correction coefficients was similar (year 2003) or about 25 % higher (year 2004) than previous uncorrected values. 3. "Parameterisation and validation of a two-source evapotranspiration model for Pinus sylvestris L. stands. " We used a two-layer evapotranspiration model to predict canopy transpiration and soil evaporation in a Scots pine stand. A Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) calibration was carried out using 2003 and 2004 data. Parameters representing reference stomatal aperture and sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit were the most relevant, whereas those controlling the response to soil moisture deficit only appeared sensitive when calibration against 2004 data was done. Combining calibration results from 2003 and 2004 showed how predictive uncertainty was reduced and the value of some parameters was constrained. 4. "Response of co-occurring Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.) to soil and atmospheric water deficits. " The physiological responses to water deficits of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.) under similar climatic conditions have been studied in two stands located in the Eastern Pyrenees. Leaf water potentials at midday were generally lower for <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak.</b> Sap flow relative to its species-specific maximum value was shown to decline with increasing vapour pressure deficit above a threshold of ca. 1. 2 kPa for both species. Extreme drought conditions during the summer of 2003, promoted an enhanced stomatal control in Scots pine. 5. "Plasticity in structural and functional hydraulic characters in Scots pine: Analysis of variability across Eurasia. " A meta-analysis of Pinus sylvestris L. sap flow and its response to environmental variables was conducted using datasets from across its whole geographical range. Transpiration per unit leaf area at a given vapour pressure deficit increased in drier/warmer climates. This physiological acclimation was linked to the previously reported climate- and size-related structural acclimation of leaf to sapwood area ratios. Our results suggest that these structural adjustments {{may not be enough to}} prevent lower xylem tensions at the driest sites. La tesi tracta diversos aspectes ecohidrològics d'especial interès en àrees de muntanya mitjana Mediterrània i s'engloba en les investigacions de tipus hidrològic i geomorfològic dutes a terme a les conques experimentals de Vallcebre. Aquestes conques són representatives dels processos d'aforestació que han tingut lloc a muntanya des del declivi de l'activitat agrícola. Els estudis presentats es centren concretament en la transpiració de boscos, el principal component de l'evapotranspiració en els ambients estudiats. La transpiració en aquest estudi ha estat avaluada mitjançant mesures de flux de saba, principalment el mètode de dissipació tèrmica. La regulació fisiològica de la transpiració s'ha avaluat des del punt de vista de la regulació estomàtica, el seguiment dels potencials hídrics foliars i de la capacitat conductora del xilema. En els últims anys s'ha demostrat que donades les interaccions entre el control estomàtic de la transpiració i les característiques estructurals que caracteritzen el camí de l'aigua des de les arrels fins a les fulles, cal estudiar les respostes de la planta als dèficits hídrics a nivell d'organisme.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the Bayesian {{algorithm}} implemented in the software STRUCTURE in order to detect the number of clusters, by using microsatellite data from four oak species.

The averaged 20 -Hz records were related to microclimatic conditions in air and soil, sap-flow rates and stem-radius fluctuations de-trended for growth (ΔW). • Within a low-dB range (27 ± 1 dB), UAE regularly increased and decreased in a diurnal rhythm in parallel with ΔW on cloudy days and at night. These low-dB emissions were interrupted by UAE abruptly switching between the low-dB range and a high-dB range (36 ± 1 dB) on clear, sunny days, corresponding to the widely supported interpretation of UAE as sound from cavitations. • It is hypothesized that the low-dB signals in drought-stressed trees are caused by respiration and/or cambial growth as these physiological activities are tissue water-content dependent and have been shown to produce courses of CO 2 efflux similar to our courses of ΔW and low-dB UAE...|$|E
40|$|After {{the acute}} {{emergency}} of decline in European woodland {{at the beginning}} of 1980 ’s, forest health was the subject of several studies in Trentino and South-Tyrol. Since 1992 investigations focused on an integrated monitoring under the UN-ECE-ICP pro-gramme in 4 selected areas, 2 in subalpine Norway spruce woodland (Lavazè Pass and Renon), and 2 in thermophilous <b>Pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> woodland (Pomarolo and Monticolo). The interdisciplinary programme of integrated monitoring aimed to investigate the state of alpine semi-natural forests in relation to air pollution, anthropogenic stresses, climate changes and trophic-energetic balances. As-sessment of forest health by means of crown conditions showed very low levels of defoliation and discoloration in the subalpine ar-eas, while in the other ones the same parameters had slightly higher values. Every year and in all the sites the mean percentages val-ues were always in class 0 and class 1, hence indicating no danger. Weather patterns showed the presence of occasional water defi-cit, albeit general trends were not observed. High level of pollution were never detected while the level of acidity in rainfall has been slightly decreasing in all the investigated plots. Only ozone showed higher values than normal but there was no correlation with any damage. Foliar mineral nutrient contents ranged quite always within the threshold level. Because of the few years of observation and the absence of relevant stress, {{it is not possible to}} get any indication about the relationship between the forest health status and th...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics in {{microclimate}} {{and physiological}} plant traits were studied for <b>Pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> and Scots pine {{in a dry}} inner-alpine valley in Switzerland, at a 10 min resolution for three consecutive years (2001 - 2003). As expected, stomata tended to close with increasing drought in air and soil. However, stomatal aperture in oak was smaller than in pine under relatively wet conditions, but larger under dry conditions. To explore underlying mechanisms, a model was applied that (i) quantifies water relations within trees from physical principles (mechanistic part) and (ii) assumes that signals from light, stomatal aperture, crown water potential, and tree water deficit in storage pools control stomata (systemic part). The stomata of pine showed a more sensitive response to increasing drought because both factors, the slowly changing tree water deficit and the rapidly changing crown water potential, closed the stomata. By contrast, the stomata of oak became less drought-sensitive as the closing signal of crown water potential was opposed by the opening signal of tree water deficit. Moreover, parameter optimization suggests that oak withdrew more water from the storage pools and reduced leaf water potentials to lower levels, without risking serious damage by cavitation. The new model thus suggests how the hydraulic water flow and storage system determines the responses in stomatal aperture and transpiration to drought at time scales ranging from hours to multiple years, and why pine and oak might differ in such responses. These differences explain why oaks are more efficient competitors during drought periods, although {{this was not the}} case in the extremely dry year 2003, which provoked massive leaf loss and, from July onwards, physiological activity almost cease...|$|E
40|$|Summary Leaf {{specific}} conductivity (LSC; {{the ratio of}} stem conductivity (KP) to leaf area (AL)), {{a measure of the}} hydraulic capacity of the stem to supply leaves with water, varies with soil water content. Empirical evidence for LSC responses to drought is ambiguous, because previously published results were subject to many confounding factors. We tested howLSC of similar-sized trees of the same population, under similar climatic conditions, responds to persistently wet or dry soil. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescensWilld.) trees were compared between a dry site and a wet site in theValais, an inner alpine valley in Switzerland. Soilwater strongly influenced AL and KP and the plant components affecting KP, such as conduit radius, conduit density and functional sapwood area. Trees at the dry site had lower LSC than trees with the same stem diameter at the wet site. Low LSC in trees at the dry site was associated with a smaller functional sapwood area and narrower conduits, resulting in a stronger reduction in KP than in AL. These observations support the hypothesis that trees maintain a homeostatic water pressure gradient. An alternative hypothesis is that relatively high investments in leaves compared with sapwood contribute to carbon gain over an entire season by enabling rapid whole-plant photosynthesis during periods of high water availability (e. g., in spring, after rain events and during morning hours when leafto- air vapor pressure deficit is small). Dynamic data and a hydraulic plant growth model are needed to test how investments in leaves versus sapwood and roots contribute to transpiration and to maximizing carbon gain throughout entire growth seasons.

40|$|Assessment {{activity}} and surveillance {{of the forests}} health, held at the global, regional and local level, has continuously developed, culminating {{in the current period}} with interdisciplinary and extensive scientific researches, that evaluate the effects of the main factors on forest ecosystems state, in particular, air pollution and climate change. Scientific researches have shown that among trees ecophysiological processes, forest life processes and meteorological parameters there are direct dependences, particularly in the case of trees supply with water during the growing period (May-July), with major influences for critical months (July and August), which have a decisive impact on growth, vitality and production of organic matter in forests. Dry years, {{from the beginning of the}} third millennium can lead to a decrease of mesophilic forests area (beech, sessile oak and penduculate oak), which will tend to retreat towards the center of the area (central Europe) in favor of thermophilic forests with <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak.</b> It was determined that a most significant negative impact of climate aridization will feel the forest ecosystems from Southern and central regions of country (conditioned by the mean air temperature (July-August), monthly rainfall (May-August), evapotranspiration and geographic latitude), and less - the Northern part of the country (Forestry Aridity Index calculated for 3 experimental stations revealed variations of this index between 7. 8 - 8. 3 - in the Central part of country, and 8. 4 - 8. 6 - for Southern part of country). At the same time the impact of climate change will determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of pests and pathogenic species. The phenomenon of climate aridization was expressed also through the impact of the Microsphaera alphitoides disease, intensity of “mildew” attack being based on the climatic conditions of the study region. Obtained data, for confirmation, were correlated with indications of bioindicators, present in the study region...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} reported on forest declines and vegetation shifts triggered by drought. In the Swiss Rhone valley (Valais), one of the driest inner-Alpine regions, the species composition in low elevation forests is changing: The sub-boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominating the dry forests is showing high mortality rates. Concurrently the sub-Mediterranean <b>pubescent</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.) has locally increased in abundance. However, it remains unclear whether this local change in species composition is part of a larger-scale vegetation shift. To study variability in mortality and regeneration in these dry forests we analysed data from the Swiss national forest inventory (NFI) on a regular grid between 1983 and 2003, and combined it with annual mortality data from a monitoring site. Pine mortality was found to be highest at low elevation (below 1000 m a. s. l.). Annual variation in pine mortality was correlated with a drought index computed for the summer months prior to observed tree death. A generalized linear mixed-effects model indicated for the NFI data increased pine mortality on dryer sites with high stand competition, particularly for small-diameter trees. Pine regeneration was low in comparison to its occurrence in the overstorey, whereas oak regeneration was comparably abundant. Although both species regenerated well at dry sites, pine regeneration was favoured at cooler sites at higher altitude and oak regeneration was more frequent at warmer sites, indicating a higher adaptation potential of oaks under future warming. Our results thus suggest that an extended shift in species composition is actually occurring in the pine forests in the Valais. The main driving factors are found to be climatic variability, particularly drought, and variability in stand structure and topography. Thus, pine forests at low elevations are developing into oak forests with unknown consequences for these ecosystems and their goods and services...|$|E
