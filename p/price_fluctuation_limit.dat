We show that the future cash flows of a security subject to price limit regulation resemble that of a distinctive contingent claim. Assuming that the security price follows a lognormal distribution, we use the risk-neutral valuation relation (RNVR) developed by [4] to derive the security valuation, {{in the presence of}} <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>limits.</b> The characteristics of the pricing formula are examined analytically and numerically.

The objective {{of this study was}} to present the <b>fluctuations</b> in potato <b>prices</b> and their reasons, and offer solutions to deal with the severity of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> In the study, secondary statistical data that were gathered from the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Turkish Statistical Institute were used as parent material. Seasonal and annual <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> were calculated by means of the Basic and Chain Index, and the Table Analysis Method. Projections were conducted by the Least Squares (Regression) Method. According to the research results, during the time period between 2005 and 2014, potato prices generally had an increase trend, and followed a fluctuating pattern in 2 and 3 year time periods. Seasonally, it was examined that potato prices started increasing by January and continued until the harvest season. Prices started to decrease slighly by harvest time, and started increasing again by September. In the time periods that were examined, the current price average of potato was 0. 62 TL/kg and the real price average was 0. 70 TL/kg. It could be said that potato real prices decreased in general. One of the important outcomes of this study was that although <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are <b>limited</b> in agricultural products that can be stocked like potato, an opposite result was observed because of the speculative stockpiling in 2014. It is neccessary to take some precautions, such as licensed warehouses, in order to prevent speculative actions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} dynamic buying and selling of shares from a collection of N stocks with random <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> To <b>limit</b> investment risk, we place an upper bound on {{the total number of}} shares kept at any time. Assuming that prices evolve according to an ergodic process with a mild decaying memory property, and assuming constraints on the total number of shares that can be bought and sold at any time, we develop a trading policy that comes arbitrarily close to achieving the profit of an ideal policy that has perfect knowledge of future events. Proximity to the optimal profit comes with a corresponding tradeoff in the maximum required stock level and in the timescales associated with convergence. We then consider arbitrary (possibly non-ergodic) price processes, and show that the same algorithm comes close to the profit of a frame based policy that can look a fixed number of slots into the future. Our analysis uses techniques of Lyapunov Optimization that we originally developed for stochastic network optimization problems.

40|$|Farmers in the Nicaragua {{countryside}} face {{substantial risk}} due to legal uncertainty regarding property rights, <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and <b>limited</b> access to rural financial markets. Income shocks {{can lead to}} obligations to sell land, can fuel differentiation processes, and can drive people into poverty. We review empirical evidence on income shocks and related distress sales by households of different wealth endowments. From panel data of the 1995 and 2000 land market surveys, estimates are made to identify relevant farm household characteristics and the market forces that determine distress sales. Results show that small farms are most affected by idiosyncratic shocks and usually try to adopt a defensive strategy based on reduced consumption to retain their land resources. In the long run, this strategy occasionally succeeds in preserving land ownership and maintaining income at higher levels than those enjoyed by landless peasants. But the pressures towards distress sales can, nevertheless, be powerful, and different responses to income shocks by poor, middle and rich peasants are likely to increase rural differentiation...|$|R

An alternative scheme for regulating the Kenyan maize market is suggested and proposals are made for the implementation of such a scheme.

The Board would act as a buyer and seller of maize to keep <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> within certain <b>limits,</b> and in addition keep a strategic reserve in case of drought. The implementation of this system requires a network of rural collection centres and Maize and Produce Board stores, located in these centres as well as in strategic markets in deficit areas.

One reason for this interest is that financial markets are examples of complex interacting systems for which a huge amount of data exist and it is possible that #nancial time series viewed from a different perspective might yield new results. This article reviews the results of three recent phenomenological studies [...] - (i) The probability distribution of stock price fluctuations: Stock <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> occur in all magnitudes, in analogy to earthquakes [...] - from tiny fluctuations to drastic events, such as market crashes. The distribution of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> decays with a power-law tail well outside the Levy stable regime and describes fluctuations that differ by as much as eight orders of magnitude. In addition, this distribution preserves its functional form for fluctuations on time scales that differ by three orders of magnitude, from 1 min up to approximately 10 d. (ii) Correlations in financial time series: While <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> themselves have rapidly decaying correlations, the magnitude of fluctuations measured by either the absolute value or the square of the <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> has correlations that decay as a power-law and persist for several months.

Note that the range of daily <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation</b> is <b>limited</b> in Chinese stock markets, that is, the changing limits of daily returns for stock prices and stock market indexes are between - 10 % and 10 %. In order to make the financial price model satisfy the changing limits of daily returns for Chinese stock markets, the value of ¿ is chosen dependently on the value of ¿ in Section 4. According to the empirical research of the model in Table 2, for each fixed boundary condition ¿, the value of depth parameter ¿ has the tend to decrease as {{the intensity}} parameter ¿ is increasing. And for each fixed value of intensity parameter ¿, when the boundary conditions are neither [...] " [...] + [...] " [...] nor [...] " [...] - [...] " [...] predominates the other, for example the boundary conditions ¿ 1, ¿ 2 and ¿ 3 (which are usually called the [...] "weak boundary conditions"), the corresponding values of depth parameters ¿ are larger than that of depth parameter ¿ of plus boundary condition ¿ 6 (when the plus (or the minus) is the overwhelming part of boundary sites, it is usually called the [...] "strong boundary condition"). The large value of intensity parameter ¿ of the financial price model will exhibit the strong interaction among the market participants, this implies that the information or news about the market may spread far and wide among the market investors. The strong boundary condition of the model also shows that the external investing environment has a strong impact on the fluctuation of financial market. In the present article, by following the trading rules of Chinese stock markets, we find that when the interaction among the market investors increases or the external environment is dominant by one view for a long time, the value of depth parameter ¿ may decrease. This behavior may suggest that the possibility of long time continuous large volatilities of stock prices is small.|$|R
