The virulence of over 200 recombinant clones was tested; {{they all were}} as virulent on immature Bartlett pear fruits (and, in the smaller series of strains tested, also, on Pyracantha twigs) as was the parent donor strain. Although the avirulent recipeint strains are amino acid auxotrophs, addition of the required amino acids to the inocula in plant virulence trials does not of itself restore virulence. Two small series of <b>prototrophic</b> <b>revertant</b> clones were selected from the auxotrophic avirulent recipient strains; only nine of the 21 <b>prototrophic</b> <b>revertant</b> clones regained virulence, whereas the other 12 <b>prototrophic</b> <b>revertant</b> clones remained avirulent, again suggesting a lack of parallelism between nutritional status and virulence in this system. Preliminary interrupted mating trials, carried out at 15 -min intervals over 3 h, show that ser is transferred during the first 15 min, that pro starts entering at about 75 min (and with a higher frequency later), and that lac (originating from an integrated Escherichia coli F'lac) enters {{toward the end of}} the 3 -h mating period and at a reduced frequency compared to the other markers. The gene or genes which determine(s) plant virulence in this Escherichia amylovora donor strain appear(s) to be transferred readily and seemingly completely to recipient strains during the first 15 min of a 3 -h mating period.

Strain I- 110 ARS was the parent of auxotrophic mutant TA 11. Plants inoculated with TA 11 NOD+ contained significantly more nitrogen per plant than did plants inoculated with wild-type bacteria (275. 9 ± 35 versus 184 ± 18 mg). Also, plants that received the revertant were larger, averaging 8. 4 ± 0. 9 g (dry weight) versus 6. 4 ± 0. 6 g for those that received the wild-type bacterial strain. Additionally, plants that received the NOD+ strain had 56 % more nodules and 41 % more nodule mass than did control plants. With both inocula, average nodule size and amount of nitrogen fixed per gram of nodule were about the same. These data indicated that the improvement in nitrogen fixation observed with the TA 11 NOD+ resulted from an increase in the overall nodule number.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} phenotypic {{classes of}} lysine requiring auxotrophs of Escherichia coli are described. Mutants of the LysA class produce {{little or no}} active diaminopimelic acid (DAP) decarboxylase and specifically require lysine for growth. Mutants of the LysB class produce a cryptic DAP decarboxylase which can be activated both in vivo and in vitro by higher than normal levels of its cofactor, pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate. The LysB mutants have an alternate requirement for lysine or pyridoxine. Both LysA and LysB mutations map at 55 min, close to the thyA locus of E. coli. The association between pyridoxal phosphate and DAP decarboxylase appears to be much weaker in LysB mutants than in wild-type bacteria, and the mutant enzyme also sediments more slowly than wild-type enzyme in sucrose density gradients. The {{results suggest that the}} LysB mutations alter a specific region (or subunit) of the enzyme molecule which is needed to stabilize the binding of pyridoxal phosphate.

Such suppressor mutations were obtained directly by mutation of the wild-type pheA gene as well as indirectly by partial reversion of a variety of nonleaky pheA and tyrA mutations. The suppressor strains have only a portion of the normal level of the pheA or tyrA enzyme activity and thus experience a partial limitation in the synthesis of phenylalanine or tyrosine. This limitation leads to a relaxation of end-product regulation of the phenylalanine- or tyrosine-specific enzymes of the common aromatic pathway and to the overproduction of the branch point intermediate, chorismic acid, {{which is one of the}} substrates of the anthranilate synthetase reaction. It is proposed that the high intracellular level of chorismic acid acts to elevate the non-physiological NH 3 -dependent anthranilate synthetase activity of the component I subunit, thereby eliminating the need for the glutamine amidotransferase activity of the component II subunit. Consistent with this is the finding that phenylalanine and tyrosine are specific inhibitors of growth of the pheA and tyrA suppressor strains, respectively, causing a shutdown of the overproduction of chorismic acid by reestablishing normal end-product control of the common pathway...|$|R

The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) for deoxyuridine- 5 ′-monophosphate and inhibition constant (K i) for 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine- 5 ′-monophosphate, measured by whole-cell enzyme assay, appear to be similar for the wild-type and revertant cell lines.

Concomitant utilization of sulfur and methyl group from methylmercaptan or S-methylcysteine has been demonstrated. In the absence of added methylated intermediates, the methyl group of methionine formed from ethionine is derived from serine. In vitro studies with crude extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that this synthesis of methionine occurs by the following reactions: CH 3 -SH + ethionine ⇌ methionine + C 2 H 5 SH and S-methylcysteine + ethionine ⇌ methionine + S-ethylcysteine. In the forward direction, the second product of the second reaction was shown to be S-ethylcysteine; this reaction has also been found reversible, leading to ethionine formation. Genetic and kinetic data have shown that homocysteine synthetase catalyzes these two reactions, at 0. 3 % of the rate it catalyzes direct homocysteine synthesis: O-Ac-homoserine + Na 2 S → homocysteine + acetate. The three reactions are lost together in a met 8 mutant and are recovered to the same extent in spontaneous <b>prototrophic</b> <b>revertants</b> from this strain. Methionine-mediated regulation of enzyme synthesis affects the three activities and is modified to the same extent by the presence of the recessive allele (eth- 2 r) of the regulatory gene eth- 2.

Moreover, ethionine, the substrate of the second reaction, inhibits the third reaction, whereas O-acetyl-homoserine, the substrate of the third reaction, inhibits the second reaction. An enzymatic cleavage of S-methylcysteine, leading to methylmercaptan production, has been shown to occur in crude yeast extracts. It is concluded that the enzyme homocysteine synthetase participates in the two alternate pathways leading to methionine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae, one involving O-acetyl-homoserine and H 2 S, the other involving the 4 -carbon chain of ethionine and a mercaptyl donor.

40|$|Cytochrome P- 450, the {{terminal}} oxidase of the metabolic mono-oxygenase system, {{is thought to}} exist in multiple forms, which have differing substrate specificities, and are variably inducible by different enzyme inducers. Many mutagens, themselves unreactive, require metabolic activation {{by one or more}} of these cytochrome P- 450 -dependent microsomal enzymes for mutagenic activity. Such mutagens may be detected in the Salmonella mutagenicity test only by the incorporation of an hepatic microsomal (59) fraction into the assay (as a first approximation to in vivo metabolism). Induction of the microsomal enzymes by different agents enhances the metabolic activation of mutagens; in fact, many mutagens are only detected when the 59 fraction has been induced by appropriate agents. Inducers of the phenobarbital-type are known to enhance microsomal steroid hydroxylation when administered at supraphysiological levels, inducers of several mono-oxygenase activities. and, in turn, the steroids, have been reported to be The inductive effects of the female sex-steroids and the combined effects of steroid and phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment on the metabolic activation of four mutagens have been investigated using the Salmonella assay. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were pret reated with 17 a-oestradiol (E 2) or progesterone (PRG), at a level of either 1 mg/kg or 20 mg / kg daily for 14 days. A duplicate set of similarly pretreated groups were also induced with PB. Hepatic microsomal fractions were prepared from each group and incubated with each of the te st mutagens in the presence of a tester strain known to detect each particular type of mutagen. Induction of the hepatic metabolizing system by PB increased the activation of the mutagens significantly (as reflected by an increased number of <b>revertant</b> <b>prototrophic</b> S. typhimurium colonies). The administration of PRG also caused significant, and dose-dependent, induction of the activation of af l atoxin B 1, benzo(a) pyrene, and dimethylnitrosamine. In general, E 2 exhibited no inductive effect, but it did produce an increase in the activation of aflatoxin B 1 (a reaction which is known to be catalysed by a mono-oxygenase prefe rentially inducible by PB). When use was made of a microsomal fraction that was prepared from animals which were both steroidpretreated and induced by PB, mutagenic activation was of the same order of magnitude as that observed when induction was brought about by PB alone. The absence of additive effect, taken together with the observations already mentioned, indicate that steroids induce the same cytochrome isozymes that are induced by PB. The implications of sex-hormonal regulation of the metabolic activation of mutagens are briefly discussed. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 53 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R
