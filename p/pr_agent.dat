The role of various industry actors (e. g. game publishers, <b>PR</b> <b>agents</b> and brand managers) will be positioned against those of the peripheral industry (e. g. critics, journalists, and editors). Because the game industry is the principal advertiser for many game publications, and because of its tight grip on the most valuable source material, i. e.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/ AIDS) {{is a disease}} pertained to the human immune system. Given its crucial role in viral replication, HIV- 1 protease (HIV- 1 PR) is a prime therapeutic target in AIDS therapy. In this regard, the dynamic aspects of ligand-enzyme interactions may indicate an important role of conformational variability in HIV- 1 PR inhibitor/drug design. In the present contribution, the effect of HIV- 1 PR flexibility (within multiple crystallographic structures of HIV- 1 PR) on binding to the Amprenavir was elucidated via an ensemble docking approach. Molecular docking studies were performed via advanced AutoDock 4. 2 software. Ensemble docking of Amprenavir into the active site of various conformations of HIV- 1 PR predicted different interaction modes/ energies. Analysis of binding factors in terms of docking false negatives/positives revealed a determinant role of enzyme conformational variation in prediction of optimum induced fit (PDB ID: 1 HPV). The outcomes of this study demonstrated that conformation of receptor may significantly affect the accuracy of docking/binding results in structure-based rational design of anti HIV- 1 <b>PR</b> <b>agents.</b> Furthermore; some strategies to re-score the docking results in HIV-...|$|R

Resigning themselves to the inevitable, they contacted EMI and set up the promised new recording, for three months ahead. They employed an outside <b>PR</b> <b>agent,</b> Jim Haswell, who managed to get some small reviews for them, but Wheatley was unable to find an agency that would book them, and although Ford insisted on keeping up the regime of regular rehearsals, they had no live work. At this point a new UK label Bronze—who had just signed Slade and Uriah Heep—made an approach to the band to become their third act. Although the group was hesitant, being still signed to EMI, they decided to use the offer as leverage in hopes of getting a better deal out of EMI. Wheatley delivered an ultimatum to EMI Australia, demanding that they either release the band from their contract or match Bronze's offer of £90,000 (or $180,000 in Australia). Predictably, EMI did neither, responding with an advance of $1000.

The nature of these responses ranges from politely directing the user at airline’s website or call center to providing a detailed answer.

40|$|For decades, the {{relationship}} between journalists and PR representatives {{has been found to}} be a difficult one, due to a lot of economic and professional pressure on journalists, and <b>PR</b> <b>agents</b> trying to push their agenda. Digitalization has brought many new tools into the game and one of them is turning this relationship around: Media Catching. Such services put the power back into the hands of journalists and other content creators, by giving them the opportunity of crowdsourcing sources for their specific stories by sending out a request to a big pool of sources including <b>PR</b> <b>agents,</b> entrepreneurs, experts etc. While such services are growing in the US, they are not established in Sweden yet. Hence, this study looks at two questions: (1) How should a media catching service in Sweden be designed, in order to meet the requirements of the Swedish media and PR landscape? (2) For which different target groups within the Media and PR landscape could this service be beneficial? To find answers, this research conducted qualitative interviews with three representatives of the Swedish media and five <b>PR</b> <b>agents</b> and/or entrepreneurs. Literature research, previous studies and a benchmark analysis of media catching services delivered further insights. In terms of designing a media catching service, the results showed that it should allow journalists to choose whether they want to be contacted via mail, phone or social media; it should send out requests via mail; different Facebook integrations are discussed due to its big popularity; it should include an option for users to gather the contacts they made through the service; the question whether it should offer an online community should further be investigated; Users should be given personalization and targeting options so that sources can choose how often and which media requests they want to receive, and so that content creators can send their requests to their specific target group. At least four different user groups were found that could benefit of a media catching service in Sweden. Due to their different demands, knowledge and target groups the media catching service should either focus only on two of these groups or offer enough targeting and personalization options to make it successful for all of them. Finally, it is important to ensure quality on a media catching platform which can be achieved through different steps, like offering trainings for the users or implementing different control functions. Hence, when establishing a media catching service in Sweden, all of the above mentioned findings can serve as a guideline for designing it and for understanding which groups could be targeted with it to create a user base.  Sedan årtionden tillbaka har förhållandet mellan journalister och PR-representanter visat sig vara problematiskt, på grund av en både större ekonomisk och professionell press på journalister samt att PR-agenter trycker på att få igenom sin egen agenda.

40|$|Swelling-activated Cl− current (ICl,swell) is an outwardly-rectifying current {{that plays}} an {{important}} role in cardiac electrical activity, cellular volume regulation, apoptosis, and acts as a potential effector of mechanoelectrical feedback. Persistent activation of ICl,swell has been observed in models of cardiovascular disease. We previously suggested sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) activates volume-sensitive Cl- current (ICl,swell) by ROS-dependent signaling. S 1 P and its analog, FTY 720 (fingolimod), primarily act via G-protein coupled receptors (S 1 PR; S 1 PR 1 - 3 in heart), but several intracellular S 1 P ligands are known. We investigated how these agents regulate ICl,swell. ICl,swell was elicited by bath S 1 P (500 nM), FTY 720 (S 1 PR 1, 3 agonist; 10 μM), and SEW 2871 (S 1 PR 1 agonist; 10 μM) and was fully inhibited by DCPIB, a specific blocker. These data suggested role of S 1 PR in activation of ICl,swell. Surprisingly, neither CAY 10444 (S 1 PR 3 antagonist; 10 μM) nor VPC 23019 (S 1 PR 1, 3 antagonist; 13 μM) blocked FTY 720 -induced ICl,swell. Also, gallein a pan Gbeta-gamma inhibitor, failed to block the S 1 P-induced current. Moreover, 100 nM FTY 720 applied via the pipette evoked a larger, faster activating current than 10 μM bath FTY 720. Similarly, 500 nM S 1 P gave larger, faster activating ICl,swell when added to the pipette than when added in the bath. In contrast to FTY 720, bath S 1 P-induced ICl,swell was blocked by CAY 10444, but a 3 -fold higher concentration failed to eliminate the response to pipette S 1 P, and VPC 23019 failed to suppress bath and pipette S 1 P-induced currents. Taken together, inconsistencies in the responses to S 1 <b>PR</b> <b>agents</b> and the greater sensitivity to pipette than bath S 1 P and FTY 720 support the notion that intracellular ligands rather than sarcolemmal S 1 PR activated ICl,swell. Next we tested if S 1 P and FTY 720, like osmotic swelling, require both NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial ROS production to evoke ICl,swell. S 1 P- and FTY 720 -induced ICl,swell were blocked by rotenone but were insensitive to gp 91 ds-tat, suggesting only mitochondrial ROS production was needed. One possibility is that S 1 P and FTY 720 elicit ICl,swell by binding to mitochondrial prohibitin- 2, an S 1 P ligand whose knockdown augments mitochondrial ROS productions. These data suggest ICl,swell may be activated by S 1 P accumulation in ischemia-reperfusion and CHF. Understanding S 1 P-signaling that elicits ICl,swell may provide insight into electrophysiological mechanisms of cardiac pathology and help identify novel targets for therapy...|$|R

30|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and biological}} {{evaluation of a}} focused library of non-steroidal PR ligands for PET imaging highlighted compound 2 {{as a candidate for}} further biological evaluation. A radiosynthetic route to access [18 F] 2 was developed to allow in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Radioligand [18 F] 2 demonstrated significant in vitro uptake in PR++ T 47 D cells which could be blocked in a dose dependent manner with progesterone. However, [18 F] 2 showed poor in vivo metabolic stability with rapid defluorination within the time frame of the imaging protocol. In vitro metabolite analysis of 2 in MLM confirmed defluorination and oxidative metabolism of the thiocarbamate to oxocarbamate moiety by mass spectrometry. In summary, [18 F] 2 has inadequate stability for in vivo imaging in mice and with a similar metabolic profile in HLM, is predicted to be unsuitable for use in humans. The future development of <b>PR</b> imaging <b>agents</b> based around the benzoxazinthione pharmacophore should proceed with caution due to the described metabolic conversion into the benzoxazinone derivative. In addition, we have shown that 2 -[18 F]fluoropyridine moieties should not be assumed to be metabolically stable to defluorination. In a scenario where [18 F] 2 was stable to defluorination, conversion from the thiocarbamate into the oxocarbamate may change the properties of the ligand such as receptor affinity which could confound in vivo evaluation. The development of metabolically stable non-steroidal imaging <b>agents</b> targeting <b>PR</b> is ongoing.|$|R
30|$|In {{the potency}} assay {{comparison}} between oxo- and thiocarbamate compounds showed the “flip” between agonist and antagonist profiles {{in agreement with}} the literature (Table 1) (Fensome et al., 2005). Compounds 1 and 3 were predicted to be the least lipophilic compounds in the library; however they did not induce an agonist response within the assay parameters (EC 50  <[*] 10, 000 [*]nM), suggesting a stronger antagonist profile. The ability to bind PR was confirmed by competition with progesterone (3 [*]mM); 1 and 3 exhibited low micromolar antagonist activity (844.8 [*]±[*] 0.23 and 795.0 [*]±[*] 0.25 [*]nM respectively). Compound 6 was ca 5 -fold more potent (EC 50  =[*] 432.5 [*]±[*] 0.24 [*]nM) than the corresponding oxocarbamate derivative 5 (EC 50  =[*] 2294 [*]±[*] 0.29); with cLogP values ≥ 5 and low micromolar potency, these compounds did not meet the required characteristics for evaluation as <b>PR</b> imaging <b>agents.</b> The most potent compound in the library was 2 (EC 50  =[*] 4.7 [*]±[*] 0.07 [*]nM) and was predicted to exhibit a similar lipophilicity to Tanaproget. The binding specificity of compound 2 was evaluated in a GR nuclear translocation assay using CHO-K 1 cells and failed to elicit a response at 0.5 [*]μM, suggesting little cross-reactivity (Additional file 1 : Figure S 33). The failure to elicit a response in the GR nuclear translocation assay provided confidence that 2 was specific to PR without evaluating the full SHR family. Confidence in extrapolating cross-reactivity to the whole SHR family based upon GR alone came from the high degree of homology between SHRs and the extensive investigation into the cross-reactivity of benzoxazin(thi)one derivatives in the literature.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{observed}} high selective binding to both the human and rat progesterone receptor (PR) in vitro, three 17 alpha-iodovinyl-substituted nortestosterone derivatives, i. e., the Z-isomer of 17 alpha-iodovinyl- 19 -nortestosterone (Z-IVNT; Z-IPG 1) and both the stereoisomers of 17 alpha-iodovinyl- 18 -methyl- 11 -methylene- 19 -nortestosterone (E- and Z-IPG 2), were selected for radio-iodination and subsequently evaluated as potential radioligands for PR imaging in human breast cancer. Their target tissue uptake, retention, and uptake selectivity were studied in female rats. The distribution studies revealed that PR-mediated uptake in the uterus and ovaries could only be demonstrated for Z-[123 I]IPG 2. The target tissue uptake selectivity was, however, low, with the highest uterus-to-nontarget tissue uptake ratios observed at 2 - 4 h postinjection (p. i.), being 4. 4, 1. 8, and 7. 4 for the uterus-to-blood, -fat, and -muscle ratio, respectively. For Z-[123 I]IPG 2, distribution was also studied in dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) -induced mammary tumour-bearing rats and in normal rabbits. Mammary tumour uptake of Z-[123 I]IPG 2 in the mammary tumour-bearing rat was also found to be PR-specific. In rabbits, higher selective target tissue uptake of Z-[123 I]IPG 2 was observed than in rats, resulting in uterus-to-blood, -fat, and -muscle ratios of 6. 6, 2. 2, and 21. 3 at 2 - 4 h p. i., respectively. In conclusion, Z-[123 I]IPG 2, which displayed high binding affinity for both the human and rat PR in vitro, showed specific PR-mediated target tissue uptake in rats and rabbits in vivo, the uptake selectivity being highest in the latter.

40|$|Five {{putative}} iodinated progesterone receptor (PR) binding ligands were synthesized {{and evaluated}} as potential imaging agents for PR-positive human breast tumours. Two compounds (E- and Z- 17 -hydroxy- 21 -iodo- 19 -nor- 17 alpha-pregna- 4, 20 -dien- 3 -one; E- and Z-IPG 1) were previously described, but are re-evaluated. The other three were novel compounds: two nortestosterone analogues derived from ORG 3236 (E- and Z- 13 -ethyl- 17 -hydroxy- 21 -iodo- 11 -methylene- 18, 19 -dinor- 17 alpha-pre gna- 4, 20 -diene- 3 -one; E- and Z-IPG 2) and one norprogesterone analogue derived from ORG 2058 (21 -[4 -iodophenoxy]- 16 alpha-ethyl- 19 -norpregn- 4 -ene- 3, 20 -dione; IPG 3). The E-iodovinyl nortestosterone compounds {{were obtained by}} a new route of synthesis. Competitive binding studies were performed to determine their binding affinities for the PR in three types of tissue (human MCF- 7 breast tumour cells and rat uterine and mammary tumour tissue) and for the androgen receptor (AR) in human MCF- 7 breast tumour cells, {{as well as for}} the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) in human plasma. All four 17 alpha-iodovinyl nortestosterone derivatives displayed high binding affinity for the human PR, that of Z-IPG 1 and E- and Z-IPG 2 being even higher than that of ORG 2058. Their affinities for the rat PR were somewhat lower, especially those of both E-isomers. The affinity of IPG 3 was lower for both the human and rat PR. The nortestosterone derivatives also showed AR binding, the relative binding affinities ranging from 4. 3 to 17. 0 % as compared with 5 alphaDHT. Additionally, neither of these steroids displayed any significant binding to either SHBG or CBG in human plasma. We conclude that the in vitro binding properties of all four 17 alpha-iodovinyl nortestosterone derivatives warrant evaluation of the distribution characteristics of their 123 I-labelled analogues to determine their usefulness as <b>PR</b> imaging <b>agent...</b>|$|R
