Elevated CSF protein levels supported this hypothesis. Postoperative chemical meningitis has been rarely reported for intracranial enterogenous cysts (Wang et al. 2011). To prevent postoperative chemical meningitis, several authors recommend puncture of the cysts using a syringe and aspiration of the contents before incision (Wang et al. 2011). Although complete surgical excision improved the prognosis, based on previous studies suggesting recurrence between 4  months and 14  years (<b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2006), this case warranted long-term clinical and radiological follow-up.|$|E
30|$|For example, on Aboriginal lands, fire {{probability}} {{rises in}} July and remains relatively constant until October (Figure 5). Fire probability on Aboriginal lands and elsewhere declines sharply with distance from road {{early in the}} dry season, reflecting management in inhabited areas (Bowman <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004). Late-season fires, which often travel tens of kilometres, reduce the effect of proximity to roads as the late season progresses. However, overall, the probability of fire on Aboriginal lands remains relatively constant throughout the dry season, {{and the number of}} return fires to the same area is lower. This is consistent with the contemporary and historical Aboriginal practice of multiple small, patchy burns throughout the dry season, starting on the upland areas and hills and moving towards lower lying (and hence wetter) areas as grass cures (Yibarbuk <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001, Vigilante 2001, <b>Preece</b> 2002, Bowman <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007 b).|$|R

Moving from “system-centred ” to “user-centred ” design has enabled great improvements {{to be made in}} the effectiveness of user interfaces (Wood, 1998). However, the UCD approach presents a challenge for people who use AAC. They are often observed as end-users and are sometimes asked for their opinion during the prototyping phase; but they are seldom asked for their opinion of what they would like their communication system to do for them at the very earliest stages of development. Background Issues surrounding the role of assisted communicators as domain experts (people who are expert users of current systems) arose during new research exploring possible interfaces to a novel word play system [...] The system is designed to facilitate the use of humour as a means to help allow assisted communicators to project their personalities, learn the rules of conversatio...|$|R
40|$|Genomewide linkage {{analysis}} {{has been extremely}} successful at identification of the genetic variation underlying single-gene disorders. However, {{linkage analysis}} has been less successful for common human diseases and other complex traits in which multiple genetic and environmental factors interact to influence disease risk. We hypothesized that a highly heritable complex trait, in which the contribution of environmental factors was relatively limited, might be more amenable to linkage analysis. We therefore chose to study stature (adult height), for which heritability is ∼ 75 %– 90 % (Phillips and Matheny 1990; Carmichael and McGue 1995; <b>Preece</b> 1996; Silventoinen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2000). We reanalyzed genomewide scans from four populations for which genotype and height data were available, using a variance-components method implemented in GENEHUNTER 2. 0 (Pratt <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2000). The populations consisted of 408 individuals in 58 families from the Botnia region of Finland, 753 individuals in 183 families {{from other parts of}} Finland, 746 individuals in 179 families from Southern Sweden, and 420 individuals in 63 families from the Saguenay-Lac-St. -Jean region of Quebec. Four regions showed evidence of linkage to stature: 6 q 24 - 25, multipoint LOD score 3. 85 at marker D 6 S 1007 in Botnia (genomewide P<. 06), 7 q 31. 3 - 36 (LOD 3. 40 at marker D 7 S 2195 in Sweden, P<. 02), 12 p 11. 2 -q 14 (LOD 3. 35 at markers D 12 S 10990 -D 12 S 398 in Finland, P<. 05) and 13 q 32 - 33 (LOD 3. 56 at markers D 13 S 779 -D 13 S 797 in Finland, P<. 05). In a companion article (Perola <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001 [in this issue]), strong supporting evidence is obtained for linkage to the region on chromosome 7. These studies suggest that highly heritable complex traits such as stature may be genetically tractable and provide insight into the genetic architecture of complex traits...|$|R
30|$|Enterogenous cysts are rare, benign, {{congenital}} lesions, {{which account}} for approximately 0.01 % of CNS tumors, and commonly locate in the spinal canal, especially at the cervical or upper thoracic level (Gauden et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2011). Intracranial enterogenous cysts are rare and mainly occur in the posterior fossa. These cysts are usually extra-axial, midline, anterior to the brainstem, or at the cerebellopontine angle (Matsumoto et al. 2016). Because the lesion has no characteristic features on radiology, the diagnosis of enterogenous cyst is mainly based on histologic findings (<b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2006). More rarely the chemical meningitis caused by rupture of a enterogenous cyst in prepontine cistern has been reported. Here, we describe a rare case of an intracranial enterogenous cyst complicated with postoperative chemical meningitis, in which diagnosis was difficult because the lesion showed atypical pathologic results.|$|E
30|$|Traditionally HCI {{focused on}} {{enhancing}} {{the efficiency and}} effectiveness of the system (<b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1994). The major concern was to prevent negative emotions (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky 2006). With the paradigm shift from instrumental to non-functional qualities (cf. Section “Usability and user experience”) concepts of positive or hedonic psychology were adapted and transferred to HCI. Hedonic Psychology focuses on concepts like enjoyment, pleasantness, but also unpleasantness rather than on attention and memory (Kahneman 2003 a) – two key topics {{that have been the}} focus of psychological research. Analogous to this development, HCI research also moved away from the “classical” cognitive information processing paradigm (Kaptelinin et al. 2003) towards concepts like Affective Computing (Picard 1997) and Emotional Design (Norman 2004). Nowadays the aim is not only to prevent rage attacks {{as a result of a}} crashing computer, but to facilitate positive emotions while interacting with an interactive system (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky 2006).|$|E
40|$|Introduction The aim of HCI is {{to achieve}} a harmony between four components; users, work, {{environment}} and computer systems (<b>Preece,</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1994). That is to say, users {{should be able to}} learn and use computer systems safely, efficiently, effectively, and with a positive attitude, (Shackel, 1990) in order to do some 'work' in some environment. Work is concerned with bringing about some intended change in an (application) domain (Dowell and Long, 1989). The problem with this view is that it obscures a central feature of HCI: variety. Each of the four components of HCI identified above demonstrates this variety. Users vary greatly in their knowledge, experience, social and cultural background. They exhibit a wide variety of cognitive characteristics, affective traits and reasons for using computers. These characteristics are interrelated and shaped by context. The work which people are trying to do varies. Sometimes speed is the most important criteria, sometime...|$|E

In management terms, the contribution of this study intends to alert TBCs entrepreneurs, as well as their investors, that in a post-incubation stage a change of competencies is essential to ensure business evolution. If the technical experience was the main resource in the beginning being supplemented by the business planning capability, then the ability to build and manage networks in the post-incubation stage is essential for the development of TBCs’ technological capabilities.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS Serum calcium, {{phosphate}} and alkaline phosphatase, and urinary calcium excretion {{were examined}} {{during the second}} trimester of uncomplicated normal pregnancy in Asian immigrants to Britain and in local Caucasians. The mean serum calcium was significantly lower in Asians than in Caucasians, and the mean serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher in Asians. The geometric mean of the urinary calcium excretion was highly significantly lower in Asians than in Caucasians. The variances of the serum calcium, serum alkaline phosphatase, and urine calcium excretion {{did not differ significantly}} in the two populations. This indicates that there is a shift in values of immigrant Asians as a group compared with Caucasians. A comparison with figures obtained on normal nonpregnant persons of both groups suggests that the shift is not an inherent feature of the Asian population. A high prevalence of osteomalacia exists among children of Asian immigrants. <b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al</b> (1973) estimated its frequency at about 10 % and thought that biochemically the disorder may be even more common, perhaps about 25 % if all ages were con...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{project was}} {{a continuation of}} our work on the spectral evolution of gamma-ray bursts begun when the Co-I on this proposal. Lyle Ford, was my graduate student. In the proposal we discussed two projects. The first was finishing and publishing the last chapter of Professor Ford's thesis. In this research effort we looked for correlations in the energies of pairs of counts recorded by the BATSE Spectroscopy Detectors {{within a short time}} of each other. A greater correlation within a short time would indicate that the observed broadband spectrum is really composed of narrowband spectral components which last for a short time and which rapidly sum to the observed spectrum. We did not find any evidence for such narrowband emission, and are setting limits on its presence. Professor Ford is revising the last chapter of his thesis for publication with my participation. The second project was a continuation of my study of the cross-correlations between the gamma-ray burst lightcurves in different energy bands. I published a first study with this technique (1997. Ap. J., 486, 928) which showed that "hard-to-soft" spectral evolution is prevalent both within and between the bursts' intensity spikes. I proposed to continue developing this technique. However, I have been somewhat disillusioned about using this methodology quantitatively since it averages the spectral evolution on a given timescale over the entire burst. Nonetheless, I have been applying the technique to new bursts which are scientifically interesting for other reasons. Attached I include the cross-correlations for the burst GRB 990123, the burst during which ROTSE discovered an optical transient. The solid curve is the autocorrelatl'on of BATSE's channel 3 (100 - 300 keV), while the dashed, dot-dashed and 3 dots-dashed curves are the crosscorrelations of channel 3 with channels 1 (25 - 50 keV), 2 (50 - 100 keV), and 4 (300 - 2000 keV). The order of, and separation between, the curves on the positive lag side indicate "hard-to-soft" evolution on all timescales, while the FWHM of the crosscorrelations shows that the intensity spikes are narrower at high energy than at low energy. I have also been participating with my colleague on the BATSE team on other spectral evolution studies. Note that while I continue {{as a member of the}} BATSE team, I no longer receive funding from the team. For example, <b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1998, Ap.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 2408 time–resolved spectra for 91 BATSE GRBs {{presented}} by <b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> we show that {{the relation between the}} isotropic–equivalent luminosity (Liso) and the peak energy (E ′ p) of the νFν spectrum in the cosmological rest frame, Liso ∝ E ′ 2 p, holds within these bursts, and also holds among these GRBs, assuming that the burst rate as a function of redshift is proportional to the star formation rate. The possible implications of this relation for the fireball models are discussed by defining a parameter ω ≡ (Liso/ 10 52 erg s − 1) 0. 5 /(E ′ p/ 200 keV). It is found that ω is narrowly clustered in 0. 1 − 1. We constrain some parameters for both the internal shock and external shock models from the requirement of ω ∼ 0. 1 − 1, assuming that these model parameters are uncorrelated. The distributions of the parameters suggest that if the prompt gamma–rays are produced from kinetic–energy–dominated internal shocks, they may be radiated from a region around R ∼ 10 12 − 10 13 cm (or Lorentz factor ∼ 130 − 410) with a combined internal shock parameter ζi ∼ 0. 1 − 1 during the prompt gamma–ra...|$|E
40|$|Second, {{for most}} GRB events (19 of 21) {{and three of}} the XRF events a single PL model can be {{rejected}} with good confidence. This is typical of GRBs, which usually have strongly curved (i. e., non power-law) spectra. Finally, the change in chi-squared from a power law to a COMP or Band model is statistically significant for most of the GRB and XRF events. This is an important indication that curved spectra are favored for XRFs just as they are for traditional GRBs. XRFs vs. Bright GRBs To compare the spectral properties of XRFs to those of bright GRBs we use the 21 WFC-selected GRBs and the <b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2000) catalog of 156 bright BATSE GRBs [BBG; 4].

40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{computer program}} named DMC_BLAST (Distinct Motion Code) {{has been under}} development since 1987 for modeling rock blasting (Preece & Taylor, 1989). This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in two dimensions. DMC_BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual bench blasts (<b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al,</b> 1993). Coal seam chilling refers to the shattering of {{a significant portion of}} the coal leaving unusable fines. It is also refereed to as coal damage. Chilling is caused during a blast by a combination of explosive shock energy and movement of the adjacent rock. Chilling can be minimized by leaving a buffer zone between the bottom of the blastholes and the coal seam or by changing the blast design to decrease the powder factor or by a combination of both. Blast design in coal mine cast blasting is usually a compromise between coal damage and rock fragmentation and movement (heave). In this paper the damage to coal seams from rock movement is examined using the discrete element computer code DMC_BLAST. A rock material strength option has been incorporated into DMC_BLAST by placing bonds/links between the spherical particles used to model the rock. These bonds tie the particles together but can be broken when the tensile, compressive or shear stress in the bond exceeds the defined strength. This capability has been applied to predict coal seam damage, particularly at the toe of a cast blast where drag forces exerted by movement of the overlying rock can adversely effect the top of the coal at the bench face. A simulation of coal mine cast blasting has been performed with special attention being paid to the strength of the coal and its behavior at t he bench face during movement of the overlying material...|$|E
40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{computer program}} named DMC{underscore}BLAST (Distinct Motion Code) {{has been under}} development since 1987 for modeling rock blasting (Preece {ampersand} Taylor, 1989). This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in two dimensions (2 -D). DMC{underscore}BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual bench blasts (<b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al,</b> 1993). Buffer Choke blasting is commonly used in surface gold mines to break the rock and dilate it sufficiently for ease of digging, with the assumption of insignificant horizontal movement. The blast designs usually call for relatively shallow holes benches ({lt} 11 m) with small blastholes (approx. 165 mm), small burdens and spacings ({lt} 5 m), often with 50 % {{or more of the}} hole stemmed. Control of blast-induced horizontal movement is desired because the ore is assayed in place from the blasthole drill cuttings and digging polygons of ore and waste are laid out before the blast. Horizontal movement at the ore waste boundary can result in dilution of the ore or loss of ore with the waste. The discrete element computer program DMC{underscore}BLAST has been employed to study spatial variation of horizontal rock motion during buffer choke blasting. Patterns of rock motion can be recognized from the discrete element simulations that would be difficult or impossible to recognize in the field (Preece, Tidman and Chung, 1997). Techniques have been developed to calculate ore waste and dilution from the horizontal movement predicted by DMC{underscore}BLAST. Four DMC{underscore}BLAST simulations of buffer blasting have been performed. The blasts are identical except that the burden and spacing are systematically varied which also changes the powder factor. Predictions of ore waste or dilution are made for each burden in the blast, assuming no horizontal movement, to illustrate the spatial variation observed...|$|E
40|$|Glacigenic {{deposits}} at Happisburgh, NE Norfolk, {{record the}} earliest known expansion of glaciers into lowland eastern England during the Quaternary. The sequence comprises two regionally extensive till units, the Happisburgh Till and Corton Diamicton members of the Happisburgh Glacigenic Formation, deposited during separate ice advances, and intervening glacilacustrine and outwash deposits laid down during ice-marginal retreat. During 2012, a new diamicton unit was discovered within the intervening sorted sediments and its significance is outlined here. Sedimentological and structural evidence suggests, tentatively, that the diamicton forms a small debris fan generated subaerially {{by a series of}} water-saturated hyperconcentrated or debris flows. The precise trigger mechanism for these flow deposits remains unclear, but may relate to seasonal melting of surface or buried ice followed by mass-movement, or to more abrupt geological events including periods of intense rainfall, moraine dam failure or a glacier outburst flood. Middle Pleistocene glacigenic sequences in NE Norfolk offer a detailed insight into the dynamics of lowland glaciation in eastern England, with evidence for multiple ice advances (Bowen et al. 1986; Banham 1988; Hart & Boulton 1991; Lunkka 1994; Lee et al. 2004 a; Pawley et al. 2004; Pawley 2006). Traditionally, these ice advances have been attributed to glaciation of the region by coeval British (Pennine) and Fennoscandian ice sheets (Perrin et al. 1979; Bowen et al. 1986; Ehlers & Gibbard 1991). However, recent provenancing of apparent Scandinavian till units instead suggest derivation from bedrock strata in eastern England and southern Scotland, indicating a British (North Sea) ice source (Lee et al. 2002, 2004 a; Hoare & Connell 2005). Further debate also surrounds the number and ages of glaciations represented by the sequence in NE Norfolk (Banham et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2004 b; Hamblin et al. 2005; <b>Preece</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Rose 2009; Preece & Parfitt 2012) ...|$|E
