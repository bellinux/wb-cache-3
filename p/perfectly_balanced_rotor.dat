30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Figure  4 {{that there is only one}} mode of {{instability}} nearly at low speeds and two modes of instability at higher speeds. The threshold of instability is about 30000  r/min. In fact, the threshold of instability is only defined in connection with a linearization of the <b>perfectly</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>rotor</b> around a stable equilibrium position and corresponding eigenvalue analysis. For the stability analysis with nonlinear bifurcation analyses of high-speed TC rotor with FRB, bifurcation from a stable equilibrium position (more generally unbalance vibrations around a stable equilibrium position) to the fully developed oil whirl/whip region with bearing eccentricities close to 1 may be rather sophisticated and depends on various system parameters, initial conditions, etc.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} {{a class of}} periodic patterns in musical scales or meters that are <b>perfectly</b> <b>balanced.</b> Such patterns have elements that are distributed around the periodic circle such that their 'centre of gravity' is precisely at the circle's centre. Perfect balance is implied by the well established concept of perfect evenness (e. g., equal step scales or isochronous meters). However, we {{identify a}} less trivial class of <b>perfectly</b> <b>balanced</b> patterns that have no repetitions within the period. Such patterns can be distinctly uneven. We explore some heuristics for generating and parameterizing these patterns. We also introduce a theorem that any <b>perfectly</b> <b>balanced</b> pattern in a discrete universe can be expressed as a combination of regular polygons. We hope this framework may be useful for understanding our perception and production of aesthetically interesting and novel (microtonal) scales and meters, and help to disambiguate between balance and evenness; two properties that are easily confused. 12 page(s...|$|R

For a base graph H define a random graph G(H,p) by turning every non-edge of H into an edge and every edge of H into a nonedge independently with probability p. We show that for any constant ǫ there is a constant α, such that for any even n and a graph H on n vertices that satisfies ∆(H) −δ(H) ≤ αn, a graph G distributed according to G(H,p), with ǫ n admits a <b>perfectly</b> <b>balanced</b> partition with probability exponentially close to 1.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the following very simple load-balancing algorithm on the N-cycle (N even) {{which we call}} Odd-Even Transposition Balancing (OETB). The edges of the cycle are partitioned into two matchings canonically. A matching defines a single step, the two matchings form a single round. Processors connected by an edge of the matching <b>perfectly</b> <b>balance</b> their loads, and, {{if there is an}} excess token, it is sent to the lower-numbered processor. The difference between the real process where the tokens are assumed integral and the idealized process where the tokens are assumed divisible can be expressed in terms of the local divergence [1]. We show that Odd-Even Transposition Balancing has a local divergence of N/ 2 − 1. Combining this with previous results, this shows that after O(N 2 log(KN)) rounds, any input sequence with initial imbalance K is <b>perfectly</b> <b>balanced.</b> Experiments are presented that show that the number of rounds necessary to <b>perfectly</b> <b>balance</b> a load sequence with imbalance K that has been obtained by pre-balancing a random sequence with much larger imbalance is significally larger than the average number of rounds necessary for balancing random sequences with imbalance K. ...|$|R
