50|$|As is {{the case}} with level 1 of the <b>plesiochronous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>hierarchy</b> (2 Mbit/s), the higher levels of {{multiplexing}} are carried out bit by bit (unlike the multiplexing of 64 kbit/s channels in a 2 Mbit/s signal, which is byte by byte), thus making it impossible to identify the lower level frames inside a higher level frame.

50|$|The <b>plesiochronous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>hierarchy</b> (PDH) is a {{technology}} used in telecommunications networks to transport {{large quantities of}} data over digital transport equipment such as fibre optic and microwave radio systems.

50|$|A widely adopted {{specification}} {{to emerge}} from the ATM Forum was the Circuit Emulation Service specification (CES). This specification defined a method of creating a service out of mapping TDM DS0 and DS1/E1 <b>Plesiochronous</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Hierarchy</b> (PDH) signals into Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells.

50|$|Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are {{standardized}} protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams synchronously over {{optical fiber}} using lasers or highly coherent light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

The method was developed to replace the <b>plesiochronous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>hierarchy</b> (PDH) system for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over the same fiber without synchronization problems. SONET generic criteria are detailed in Telcordia Technologies Generic Requirements document GR-253-CORE.

50|$|An Ethernet {{interface}} is {{much cheaper}} than a {{synchronous digital hierarchy}} (SONET/SDH) or <b>plesiochronous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>hierarchy</b> (PDH) interface of the same bandwidth. Another distinct advantage of an Ethernet-based access network {{is that it can}} be easily connected to the customer network, due to the prevalent use of Ethernet in corporate and, more recently, residential networks.A typical service provider's network is a collection of switches and routers connected through optical fiber. The topology could be a ring, hub-and-spoke (star), or full or partial mesh. The network will also have a hierarchy: core, distribution (aggregation), and access. The core in most cases is an existing IP/MPLS backbone but may migrate to newer forms of Ethernet transport in the form of 10Gbit/s, 40Gbit/s, or 100Gbit/s speeds or even possibly 400Gbit/s to Terabit Ethernet network in the future.|$|E
50|$|SDH {{differs from}} <b>Plesiochronous</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Hierarchy</b> (PDH) {{in that the}} exact rates {{that are used to}} {{transport}} the data on SONET/SDH are tightly synchronized across the entire network, using atomic clocks. This synchronization system allows entire inter-country networks to operate synchronously, greatly reducing the amount of buffering required between elements in the network.Both SONET and SDH can be used to encapsulate earlier digital transmission standards, such as the PDH standard, or they can be used to directly support either Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or so-called packet over SONET/SDH (POS) networking. Therefore, it is inaccurate to think of SDH or SONET as communications protocols in and of themselves; they are generic, all-purpose transport containers for moving both voice and data. The basic format of a SONET/SDH signal allows it to carry many different services in its virtual container (VC), because it is bandwidth-flexible.|$|E
5000|$|The other {{technical}} issues to resolve was {{what type of}} optical transmission equipment to use. A few years before a new standard for optical transmission systems called Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) had been developed and ratified as a global standard {{as a replacement for}} existing <b>Plesiochronous</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Hierarchy</b> (PDH) equipment. As the Telecom Electric Project started manufacturers had started releasing SDH products onto the market and Russ Taylor, the SDH specialist in the TE team, after researching the UK SDH suppliers, recommended the project implement an all SDH network. This was a bold step at the time, but his research showed that with the right combination of suppliers, it was not only feasible, but would lead to a more efficient network with lower operating costs than the previous PDH products widely used and much more effective than starting with PDH and migrating to SDH over time.|$|E
