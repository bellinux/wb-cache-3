He {{attended}} and later graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, Arizona in 1969. During his high school years, he participated in football (earning all-state honors twice), basketball, wrestling, and track. He attributes his competitive nature to having an older brother, Chip Hochuli.

As a football player, he earned All-Western Athletic Conference academic honors in 1972. His father, Walter Hochuli, was involved with law as a wills and estate planner, which influenced Ed Hochuli to pursue a career in law. [...] He earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Arizona Law School in 1976.

Upon completion of his education, Hochuli was admitted to the State Bar of Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|Peralta {{reportedly}} {{served the}} United States with enthusiasm and patriotism: [...] "In his parents' home, on his bedroom walls hung only three items - {{a copy of}} the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights and his boot camp graduation certificate. Before he set out for Fallujah he wrote to his 14-year-old brother, 'Be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> bro...and be proud of being an American.'" ...|$|E

[...] A meeting was held in a large hall, and Captain Pratt spoke {{of the work of}} the school, and how all the Indian boys and girls were doing. [...] Then John Wanamaker had me come up on the stage. [...] He told the {{audience}} that I was working for him and that I was a Carlisle boy. [...] He stated that I had been promoted from one department to another, every month getting better work and better money, and {{in spite of the fact}} that he employed as many as one thousand people in his establishment, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as he had me. [...] That brought considerable applause, and Captain Pratt was very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{is strange}} is, {{that she is}} <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> than <b>of</b> mamma, who is so much handsomer and more accomplished,--more tractable, too, and making a figure and {{sensation}} that I never shall.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the powers, Terence!" [...] {{the colonel}} exclaimed, {{bringing}} {{his hand down}} on his shoulder, [...] "you are a credit to the ould country. I am <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> you, <b>me</b> boy, and it is little I thought when O'Flaherty and myself conspired to get ye into the regiment {{that you were going}} to be such a credit to it. Gentlemen, before Colonel O'Connor goes further, we will drink his health again." ...|$|R

60|$|I told Mr. Click {{that was}} about it, if we came to particulars; and I thought he {{appeared}} rather <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Beatrice has {{inherited}} {{everything that}} belonged to my mother. I am your own daughter, father. You ought to be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> But there, I gave you another commission. Is it true that Jerry is really here?" ...|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell you}} how gratified I have been by your letter, and what a splendid recompense it is for any {{pleasure}} I am giving you. Such generous and earnest sympathy from such a brother-artist gives me true delight. I am <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it, believe <b>me,</b> and moved by it {{to do all the}} better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isabel, your {{ignorance of}} all that an American woman should be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> distresses <b>me.</b> Have you really, then, {{never heard of the}} man who invented the saying, 'Some things can be done as well as others,' and proved it by jumping over Niagara Falls twice? Spurred on by this belief, he {{attempted}} the leap of the Genesee Falls. The leap was easy enough, but the coming up again was another matter. He failed in that. It was the one thing that could not be done as well as others." ...|$|R
6000|$|I condole {{with you}} {{from my heart}} on the loss[14] you have sustained, and I feel <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> your {{permitting}} <b>me</b> to sympathise with your affliction. It is a great satisfaction to me to have been addressed, under similar circumstances, by many of your countrymen since the [...] "Curiosity Shop" [...] came to a close. Some simple and honest hearts in the remote wilds of America have written me letters on the loss of children--so numbering my little book, or rather heroine, with their household gods; and so pouring out their trials and sources of comfort in them, before me as a friend, that I have been inexpressibly moved, and am whenever I think of them, I do assure you. You have already all the comfort, that I could lay before you; all, I hope, that the affectionate spirit of your brother, now in happiness, can shed into your soul.|$|R

6000|$|... "Who else? We-we don't {{know anybody}} in New York. And I {{wanted you to}} be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I've tried so hard and--and {{sometimes}} you don't even look at my gowns, and say whether you like them {{and they are all}} for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If our {{situations}} were reversed," [...] {{said the}} Millionaire, [...] "I am {{sure he would}} visit me. The old man has always been rather <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> Besides," [...] he added, softly, [...] "I had to have his signature; I am insuring his life." ...|$|E
40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} a student interview in a Writing Intensive course in Communicology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question '(How) did this course change you as a person, as a writer, as a scholar, if at all?'Brief excerpt from interview: [This course and the writing] makes me think that people actually do read my writing. I'm kind <b>of</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> that, makes <b>me</b> feel like my writing is going somewhere and it wasn't for nothing. It's not just some assignment. It definitely makes me think more about what I can do with my writing [...] . It does make me feel more connected to my major. I never did feel like I was close to graduating, but now that it's coming to an end, my writings are improving. I'm like okay, I have been in college for four years...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{beyond a}} demure inquiry <b>of</b> <b>me</b> {{when we were}} alone together, after {{the health of the}} General. Well, you know how well his reading succeeded; he took a double first class, and very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> him we were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear," [...] she said, [...] "for if I were {{a princess}} {{and you were}} a shopkeeper I would marry you, and be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> my husband. Don't think so meanly <b>of</b> <b>me</b> as that. There is another--a more {{powerful}} reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not wonder," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "that Doctor Harrison is <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> for a patient, {{but there are}} many times when I feel a dull pain in my heart, because I know that, {{whatever}} he or anybody else might say, I am not quite cured." ...|$|E
6000|$|Don't {{look for}} me. I am a failure and I am [...] going away to sea. Don't worry about me. I [...] am all right {{and able to}} take care of myself.

6000|$|... "He was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I was big-boned and fair, like my mother. And when I {{came home}} at the end of a Semester I can see him now, as he would hobble to the door, wearing the red and black and gold of the Burschenschaft. And he would keep me up half the night-telling him of our 'Schlager' fights with the aristocrats. My father had been a noted swordsman in his day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nearly all, my dear," [...] was the reply, {{accompanied}} by a cheerful smile, for Anko was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his great length. [...] "But not quite all.

60|$|But for the {{occupation}} which the foregoing narrative {{has given to}} my mind; but for the relief which my heart can derive from its thoughts of Clara, I must have sunk under the torment of suspense and suspicion in which my life is now passed. My sister! Even in this self-imposed absence from her, I have still found a means of connecting myself remotely with something that she loves. I have taken, as the assumed name under which I live, and shall continue to live until my father has given me back his confidence and his affection, {{the name of a}} little estate that once belonged to my mother, and that now belongs to her daughter. Even the most wretched have their caprice, their last favourite fancy. I possess no memorial of Clara, not even a letter. The name that I have taken from the place which she was always fondest and <b>proudest</b> <b>of,</b> is, to <b>me,</b> what a lock of hair, a ring, any little loveable keepsake, is to others happier than I am.|$|R
3000|$|So I {{like looking}} muscular, so I like {{to train and}} I like being <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> like my accomplishments of getting {{stronger}}. And, if the side effect <b>of</b> <b>me</b> getting stronger is me getting more muscular, then that’s my ideal of what I want to look like. (Penny, 31  years) [...]...|$|R
60|$|You {{would have}} been <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> my friends, {{if you could have}} seen and heard me, for I clashed my sabre as I spoke, and swung my dolman as though my {{regiment}} was picketed outside in the courtyard. They listened to me in silence, but the back of the Prince bowed more and more as though the burden which weighed upon it was greater than his strength. He looked round with haggard eyes.|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her hand}} in mine, and {{told me she was}} <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and of what I said; {{although}} I praised her very far beyond her worth. Then she went on softly playing, but without removing her eyes from me. 'Do you know, what I have heard tonight, Agnes,' said I, strangely seems {{to be a part of}} the feeling with which I regarded you when I saw you first--with which I sat beside you in my rough school-days?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never forget}} you, papa; but I {{do want to}} do {{something}} beautiful that you may be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> by and by. Mamma often tells me to stop; but when we get in here we forget there is any world outside, we are so busy and so happy. Now I'll go and run and sing, and be a girl to please you.' And throwing away the apron, Bess vanished from the room, seeming to take all the light with her.|$|E
6000|$|To {{which her}} reply: [...] "You have {{taught me to}} do it, and now I expect others to be like you." [...] Sometimes she would even say: [...] "When I see you so fond <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and taking such care <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> I am ashamed. You think me {{so much better than}} I am. You {{consider}} me so pure and good, while I know that I am often mean, and even have wicked thoughts. It makes me ashamed, but so <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> you, for I see that you are judging me by yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not blame}} you," [...] said the Scarecrow. [...] "Education {{is a thing}} to be <b>proud</b> <b>of.</b> I'm educated myself. The mess <b>of</b> brains given <b>me</b> by the Great ...|$|R
6000|$|PHOEBE (bravely). Nay, do not {{distress}} yourself about <b>me.</b> Tell <b>me</b> <b>of</b> yourself. We are so <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the way {{in which}} you won your commission. Will you leave the army now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And didn't he bore my {{head off}} on the home passage!" [...] began Bunter again in a weary voice. [...] "He loved me. He was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I was converted. I had had a manifestation. Do {{you know what he}} was after? He wanted me and him 'to make a seance,' in his own words, and to try to call up that ghost (the one that had turned my hair white--the ghost of my {{supposed}} victim), and, as he said, talk it over with him--the ghost--in a friendly way.|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Don't put it like that, mother. Of course I {{am sorry}} to leave you. Why, you are the best mother in the whole world. But after all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is {{impossible}} to live in such a place as Wrockley. You don't mind it. But I'm ambitions; I want something more than that. I want to have a career. I want to do something that will make you <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and Lord Illingworth is going to help me. He is going to do everything for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Learning {{does not}} {{compensate}} for nine-inch shoulders and spindle legs," [...] he answered. [...] "But I'm {{going to get}} well. Knowing you has given me renewed {{desire to be a}} man. I'm going to ride and rough it, and sleep out of doors till I can follow you anywhere. You'll be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> before the month is out. But I'm going to cut the Meeker outfit. I won't subject myself to their vulgarities another day. Why should I? It's false pride in me to hang on up there any longer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Fuller {{expected}} Zachariah {{to die in}} {{the fifth}} season, he felt that the character's death in the hundredth episode came [...] "a little early". Fuller was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the role, admitting, [...] "I was actually very upset that Zachariah was dying, because it honestly was a part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> that died." [...] Despite Zachariah's demise, the actor expressed interest in returning to the role if ever asked to.|$|R
6000|$|The girl showed {{as little}} sign of resentment {{as she did}} of passion. [...] "If I meet you; but that must come by chance," [...] she said.

6000|$|Charles looked {{straight}} before him, and answered--'The kindness was all on your part. I {{had nothing to}} give in return but ill-temper and exactions. But, Guy, you must not think I have not felt all you have done for me.

I hope you are <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it.' ...|$|R
