40|$|In recent years, spur dikes are {{expected}} to demonstrate various functions. <b>Permeating</b> flow through the spur dike can control the flow field, structures of separation vortex and bed configuration around the spur dikes. In this study, velocity fields behind the solid, straightly <b>permeating</b> and inclined <b>permeating</b> spur dikes are measured and compared. The resistance and scour depth {{at the head of}} the spur dike are reduced by the <b>permeating</b> flow through the dike. Spur dikes with inclined <b>permeating</b> flow were proved to have several advantages. The inclined <b>permeating</b> flow reduces the strength of the separation vortex, keeping almost similar deceleration effect and reattachment length. Furthermore, it decreases the turbulence intensities behind the spur dike and maintains relatively lower velocity over a long distance behind the spur dike, even in the case of movable bed...|$|R

5|$|Since a {{partially}} filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to <b>permeate</b> gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt <b>permeate</b> the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E

40|$|The soluble {{phase of}} milk was {{separated}} at 20 and 80 °C using ultrafiltration. The resulting <b>permeates</b> were then subjected to further ultrafiltration and dialysis {{at close to}} these two temperatures. It was found that pH, Ca 2 + and soluble Ca decreased as the separation temperature increased both in original UF <b>permeates</b> and in dialysates obtained from these <b>permeates,</b> but P decreased only slightly. The major reason for these changes {{was due to the}} precipitation of calcium phosphate/citrate complexes onto the casein micelle with concomitant release of H+. The pH of both <b>permeates</b> and dialysates from milk at 20 °C were slightly higher than for milk. When UF <b>permeates</b> collected at 20 and 80 °C, were each dialysed at both these temperatures, the dialysate collected at 80 °C showed much less temperature dependence for pH and ionic calcium compared with that collected at 20 °C. This is in contrast to milk, which shows considerable temperature dependence for pH and ionic calcium. Further experiments revealed that the pH and Ca 2 + concentration of <b>permeates</b> showed high temperature dependence above the temperature at which they were separated, but a much lower temperature dependence below that temperature. These findings suggest that dialysis and UF of milk at high temperature provide the best means yet for estimating the pH and ionic calcium of milk at that temperature...|$|R
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that <b>permeate</b> many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{predominantly}} populated by humans, Spira features {{a variety of}} races. The people of Spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like Bevelle and Luca.

With the collapse of the teachings of Yevon and the wider acceptance of machina at the end of Final Fantasy X, prejudice against the Al Bhed seems to have eased significantly by the time of Final Fantasy X-2, though it is still present.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus <b>permeate</b> {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on to the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can <b>permeate</b> the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Norwegian black metal scene were {{motivated}} to take violent action against this influence – for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and Jørn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands or individuals did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to <b>permeate</b> parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked {{to the past and}} took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic– it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of non-destructive techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not <b>permeate</b> the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study to elucidate the mechanisms of the flame spread over a filter paper <b>permeated</b> with an adhesive. For this study, two typical adhesives used for general purposes are adopted. One is polyvinyl acetate resin, and the other is urea resin. The flame spread rates and temperature profiles near leading flame edges were measured. Also, thermogravimetric analyses of the samples were performed. It was found that flame spread depends strongly on the pyrolysis reaction of the <b>permeated</b> adhesive. The highest pyrolysis temperature is of the pure filter paper, and the pyrolysis temperature decreases with the increase of either of <b>permeated</b> adhesives. Also, the flame spread rate decreases with the increase of the <b>permeated</b> adhesive. The decrease of the heat flux from the gas phase to the sample surface is inferred to be a main cause to decrease the flame spread rate with the increase of the amount of the <b>permeated</b> polyvinyl resin. For urea resin, establishment of a residual carbon layer is inferred to be a main cause of the flame spread rate reduction. Carbon-dioxide ejection during pyrolysis reaction, which is inferred through the thermogravimetric analyses, is supposed to enhance the flame spread rate reduction...|$|R
