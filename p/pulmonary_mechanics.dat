The static and dynamic elastance values were increased significantly after 3 It of venom inoculation, but were reduced at control values in the other periods studied. The Delta P 1 values that correspond to the resistive properties of lung tissue presented a significant increase after 6 h of CdtV injection, reducing to basal levels 12 h after the venom injection. In Delta P 2 analysis, correspondent to viscoelastic components, an increase occurred 12 h after the venom injection, returning to control values at 24 h. CdtV also caused an increase of leukocytes recruitment (3 - 24 h) to the airways wall {{as well as to}} the lung parenchyma.

40|$|AbstractObjective: In {{the setting}} of acute {{pulmonary}} artery hypertension, techniques to reduce right ventricular energy requirements may ameliorate cardiac failure and reduce morbidity and mortality. Inhaled nitric oxide, a selective pulmonary vasodilator, may be effective {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary artery hypertension, but its effects on cardiopulmonary interactions are poorly understood. Methods: We therefore developed a model of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction that mimics the clinical syndrome of acute pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled nitric oxide was administered in concentrations of 20, 40, and 80 ppm. Results: During hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, the administration of nitric oxide resulted in a significant improvement in <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>mechanics</b> and a reduction in right ventricular afterload. These improvements were a result of selective vasodilation of small pulmonary vessels and more efficient blood flow through the pulmonary vascular bed (improved transpulmonary vascular efficiency). The right ventricular total power output diminished during the inhalation of nitric oxide, indicating a reduction in right ventricular energy requirements. The net result of nitric oxide administration was an increase in right ventricular efficiency.

However, whether altered passive arterial wall mechanics contribute to this endotoxin-induced pulmonary vascular dysfunction is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether endotoxin affects the passive arterial mechanics and compliance of isolated rat pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary arteries of pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats (n = 55) were isolated and exposed to Escherichia coli endotoxin (50 microg/ml) for 20 h. Endotoxin increased pulmonary artery diameter and compliance (transmural pressure = 13 mmHg) in an endothelium-, Ca 2 +-, or NOSII-induced NO release-independent manner. Interestingly, the endotoxin-induced alterations in the passive arterial mechanics were accompanied by disassembly of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) F-actin cytoskeleton. Disassembly of F-actin by incubation of control arteries with the cytoskeleton-disrupting agent cytochalasin B or the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y- 27632 induced a similar increase in passive arterial diameter and compliance. In contrast, RhoA activation by lysophosphatidic acid prevented the endotoxin-induced alterations in the pulmonary SMC F-actin cytoskeleton and passive mechanics. In conclusion, these findings indicate that disassembly of the SMC F-actin cytoskeleton and RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling act as mediators of endotoxin-induced changes in the <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>mechanics.</b> They imply the involvement of F-actin rearrangement and RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling in endotoxemia-induced vascular lung injury...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In an {{experimental}} model of feline asthma, computed tomography (CT) and ventilator-acquired <b>pulmonary</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{were used in}} the assessment of various conditions. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to induce airflow limitation. First, it was hypothesized that the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 2 cmH₂O or inspired oxygen concentration of 30 % would improve <b>pulmonary</b> <b>mechanics</b> and decrease evidence of atelectasis compared with no PEEP or 100 % O₂ in cats undergoing BAL. Secondly, it was hypothesized that heliox-driven nebulization of albuterol (heliox/albuterol) would lead superior reduction in airflow limitation and CT documented anatomic changes compared with heliox/saline, nitrox/albuterol or nitrox/saline 24 hrs post-allergen challenge and 5 minutes post-BAL. In the first study, the use of 30 % inspired oxygen concentration failed to show any significant improvement in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>mechanics</b> but did diminish atelectasis. It was also associated with further desaturation of hemoglobin in some cats. The modest levels of PEEP employed were without effect on any of our outcome parameters.

40|$|The {{pulmonary}} circulation {{is a high}} flow and low pressure circuit, with an average resistance of 1 mmHg. min. L(- 1) in young adults, increasing to 2. 5 mmHg. min. L(- 1) over 4 - 6 decades of life. <b>Pulmonary</b> vascular <b>mechanics</b> at exercise are best described by distensible models. Exercise {{does not appear to}} affect the time constant of the {{pulmonary circulation}} or the longitudinal distribution of resistances. Very high flows are associated with high capillary pressures, up to a 20 - 25 mmHg threshold associated with interstitial lung edema and altered ventilation/perfusion relationships. Pulmonary artery pressures of 40 - 50 mmHg, which can be achieved at maximal exercise, may correspond to the extreme of tolerable right ventricular afterload. Distension of capillaries that decrease resistance may be of adaptative value during exercise, but this is limited by hypoxemia from altered diffusion/perfusion relationships. Exercise in hypoxia is associated with higher pulmonary vascular pressures and lower maximal cardiac output, with increased likelihood of right ventricular function limitation and altered gas exchange by interstitial lung edema. Pharmacological interventions aimed at the reduction of pulmonary vascular tone have little effect on pulmonary vascular pressure-flow relationships in normoxia, but may decrease resistance in hypoxia, unloading the right ventricle and thereby improving exercise capacity. Exercise in patients with pulmonary hypertension is associated with sharp increases in pulmonary artery pressure and a right ventricular limitation of aerobic capacity. Exercise stress testing to determine multipoint pulmonary vascular pressures-flow relationships may uncover early stage pulmonary vascular disease.

Three neonates required ECMO for a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), two for hyaline membrane disease (HMO), two for meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), and one for pneumonia. All neonates with MAS, HMD, and pneumonia were successfully weaned from ECMO when their Cdyn was 0. 3 mL/cmH 2 O/kg or greater [mean 0. 34 +/- 0. 06 (SEM) ]. All three neonates with CDH died and their highest Cdyn was 0. 21, 0. 19, and 0. 09 mL/cmH 2 O/kg respectively (mean, 0. 16 +/- 0. 037).

We evaluate the impact of exercise training on <b>pulmonary</b> <b>mechanics,</b> physical {{functional status}}, and hospitalization outcomes in PMV patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven subjects with PMV in our respiratory care center (RCC) were divided randomly into an exercise training group (n 12) and a control group (n 15). The exercise program comprised 10 sessions of exercise training. The measurement of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>mechanics</b> and physical functional status (Functional Independence Measurement and Barthel index) were per-formed pre-study and post-study. The hospitalization outcomes included: days of mechanical ven-tilation, hospitalization days, and weaning and mortality rates during RCC stay. RESULTS: The training group had significant improvement in tidal volume (143. 6 mL vs 192. 5 mL, P. 02) and rapid shallow breathing index after training (162. 2 vs 110. 6, P. 009). No significant change {{was found in the}} control group except respiratory rate. Both groups had significant improvement in functional status during the study. However, the training group had greater changes in FIM score than the control group (44. 6 vs 34. 2, P. 024).
