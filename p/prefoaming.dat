40|$|The rate of {{swelling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters of hydrogel polymeric networks; therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a new method to synthesize superporous poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) hydrogels to improve swelling rate. The hydrogel was prepared in the presence of a foaming agent (comprising azodicarbonamide and zinc oxide), using 2, 2 &# 39;-Azobis[2 -(2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl) propane] dihydrochloride as the initiator. The N 2 released during the polymerization led to the formation of a slightly foamed gel; we refer to the process as a <b>prefoaming</b> process. The obtained gel underwent a further foaming process to form a superporous hydrogel. Unlike in existing methods, the consistent time control of the foaming agent addition and the onset of gelling were not necessary in this simplified gel preparation procedure. The water absorbent behavior of the superporous hydrogels suggested that the polymers obtained from the <b>prefoaming</b> process reached the swelling equilibrium more rapidly than those with little <b>prefoaming,</b> and their absorbent capacity was greater. Scanning electron microscope images show that interconnected pores inside these superporous gels formed capillary channels, which are critical for the fast swelling rate.

40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{method for}} the production of amorphous metallic foam is introduced. This method utilizes the thermodynamic stability and thermoplastic formability of the supercooled liquid state to produce low-density amorphous metallic foams in dimensions that are not limited to the critical casting thickness. The method consists of three stages: the <b>prefoaming</b> stage, in which a large number of small bubbles are created in the equilibrium liquid under pressure; the quenching stage, in which the liquid prefoam is quenched to its amorphous state; the foam expansion stage, in which the amorphous prefoam is reheated to the supercooled liquid region and is processed under pressures substantially lower than those applied in the <b>prefoaming</b> step. Results from a dynamic model suggest that the foam expansion process is feasible, as the kinetics of bubble expansion in the supercooled liquid region are faster than the kinetics of crystallization. Within the proposed synthesis method, bulk amorphous foam products characterized by bubble volume fractions of as high as 85 % are successfully produced...|$|E
40|$|DE 10036185 A UPAB: 20010425 NOVELTY - A {{particulate}} foam of polyalkyleneterephthalate, or a {{blend of}} this with a low crystalline content in a chiefly amorphous phase, is heated and pressed to form a component. During the pressing stage the foam is joined with another layer (3) and/or is tempered at a temperature which converts more of the amorphous phase into a crystalline phase. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for: a) a composite material comprising particulate foam (2) and another layer produced by the claimed process; b) a component (5 a) molded from the composite material; c) use of the component in vehicles, garden furniture, surf boards, boat bodies, packaging, insulating containers or housings; d) various process for producing the component in which: i) <b>prefoamed</b> polyalkyleneterephthalate particles are heated and pressed into a component, tempered during a cooling stage and a cover layer (3) is laminated on; ii) densely packed foamed particles are heated in a mold and foamed onto the rear of a cover layer in a mold and then cooled during which time the foam is tempered; iii) <b>prefoamed</b> polyalkyleneterephthalate particles are placed in a mold cavity with an intermediate layer (4) comprising PET (polyethyleneterephthalate) fibers and further reinforcing fibers, heated to fuse with the PET fibers, a fluid, solidifiable or curable polymer applied and during a cooling stage the molding is tempered. USE - For the production of lightweight composite materials used {{in the manufacture of}} garden furniture, sports equipment, e. g. surfboards, boat bodies, packaging, insulating containers and housings (all claimed) and also for the internal lining components for vehicles. ADVANTAGE - An environmentally friendly composite is produced which achieves a good bond between the foam and outer layer as well as increased temperature resistance and ability to withstand varying temperatures...|$|R
