40|$|Global {{awareness}} that packaging {{has to be}} fully adequate and of high quality, is gradually increasing. That is why printing inks and substrates, which have no detrimental effect on <b>packed</b> <b>products,</b> {{should be considered a}} compulsory precondition for food and tobacco packaging. Printing inks that have been developed in the recent years, especially for food and tobacco packaging, have low-odour and low migration into the printing substrate during the drying process. Their migration into the printing substrate is within the acceptable limits and has no detrimental effect in terms of food safety. Another extremely important element of prints in high quality food and tobacco packaging is their stability, as they have to be resistant to liquids and chemicals, which are a part of <b>packed</b> <b>product.</b> The selection of an appropriate printing substrate is also extremely relevant, since the interaction of substrate with printing inks should have zero effect on the <b>packed</b> <b>product</b> and should not change the physical appearance of packaging. This paper presents the results of analysing the stability of laboratory samples printed with low-migration inks, observed immediately after the printing (unaged) and two treatments of accelerated aging. The accelerated aging of prints was conducted in order to simulate conditions in which food and tobacco packaging can be found due to the prolonged indoors storage. The stability of prints was analysed based on optical characteristics by observing the prints’ relative reflectance curves...|$|R

50|$|In February 2009, Smart Supermarket, a well {{established}} local supermarket based in Birkirkara, Malta, was ordered {{by a judge}} not to sell, manufacture or <b>pack</b> <b>products</b> bearing the trademark Green Dot without the necessary licenses. Green Dot Malta Limited had argued in court that the supermarket was not only blatantly infringing the trademark and contravening the Trademarks Act but was also taking unfair advantage of Green Dot's reputation and goodwill without having its authorisation. The First Hall of the Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Abigail Lofaro, upheld Green Dot Malta Limited's request and issued a warrant of prohibitory injunction. Lawyers Antoine Naudi and Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Following this injunction, the two parties reached an agreement whereby Smart Supermarket entered into a royalty license agreement with Green Dot Malta Limited and registered all its own branded food items such as confectionery and freshly <b>packed</b> <b>products.</b> they agreed to cooperate. The two companies also agreed to cooperate in ensuring that the intellectual property rights relating to the Green Dot mark in Malta will be further protected from any unlawful use by third parties including suppliers of the various goods to the supermarket.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on the {{epidemiologic}} investigation in a Swiss powdered infant formula production facility after a batch of Powdered Infant Formula (PIF) was found to be contaminated with Cronobacter (C.) sakazakii during a routine testing of <b>packed</b> <b>products</b> of a Swiss PIF brand ready for distribution. Epidemiological investigation on isolates originating from PIF batches from the production unit by macro restriction typing quickly (PFGE) identified an isolate showing a pattern identical to the ones originating from the <b>packed</b> <b>product,</b> suggesting this strain being the source of contamination. To obtain an overview on the heterogeneity of strains isolated within this production unit 115 C. sakazakii isolates, which were routinely collected between August 2015 and September 2016, were characterized by PFGE and serotyping. In addition, Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) was performed on 11 selected isolates. Macro restriction analysis revealed the presence of two main clusters (C 1,C 2) containing multiple isolates from various sources and time points with the oldest isolates dating back to October and August 2015 respectively. Of interest, within both clusters isolates were identified showing identical PFGE patterns but different serotypes. Moreover, MLST analysis on selected isolates revealed that isolates showing identical PFGE types may exhibit different MLSTs and/or serotypes. Our data suggest that application of one of the latter two typing methods bears the risk that strains may incorrectly be considered “epidemiologically unrelated”. Based on these results the application of PFGE using the primary (and the secondary) restriction enzyme is recommended for trace back studies...|$|R
