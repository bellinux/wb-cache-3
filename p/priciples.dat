500|$|Scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus {{argued that}} the only moral {{obligations}} that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing[...] Scotus {{argued that the}} natural law, in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the Ten Commandments. The last seven of the Ten Commandments {{do not belong to}} the natural law in the strictest sense. Whilst our duties to God are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments [...] "are highly consonant with , though they do not follow necessarily from first practical <b>priciples</b> that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect ...|$|E
