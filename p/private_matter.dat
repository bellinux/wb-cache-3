5|$|Eriksson's {{private life}} came under scrutiny, with an number of well-publicised accusations of trysts with women {{including}} Ulrika Jonsson, and FA secretary Faria Alam, despite his on-going relationship with Nancy Dell'Olio. Though Eriksson maintained in press conferences that {{his personal life}} was a <b>private</b> <b>matter,</b> his relationships with Jonsson in 2002 and Alam in 2004 were subject to tabloid headlines for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated {{for the removal of}} any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{public schools}} have a sex {{education}} program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect {{at the onset of}} menarche (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, menstruation was a <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> and a girl's menarche was not a community phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The New Encyclopedia of Islam {{states that}} after the early period, with some notable exceptions, the {{practice}} in Islam regarding atheism or various forms of heresy, grew more tolerant {{as long as it}} was a <b>private</b> <b>matter.</b> However heresy and atheism expressed in public may well be considered a scandal and a menace to a society; in some societies they are punishable, at least to the extent the perpetrator is silenced.

25|$|In {{response}} to the statements relating to prosecutions of persons because of their sexual orientation, {{the head of the}} delegation said that homosexuality is a purely <b>private</b> <b>matter,</b> with a long history in Senegal, and is not in itself a cause for prosecution. The prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public and were of an obtrusive nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and religion. Concerning decriminalization, it is necessary to take account of the culture, and avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives.|$|E
25|$|Adultery is a {{crime in}} Taiwan and the Philippines. It was a crime in Japan until 1947 and until 2015, in South Korea. In 2015, South Korea's Constitutional Court {{overturned}} the country's law against adultery. Previously, adultery was criminalized in 1953, and violators were subject to 2 years in prison, {{with the aim of}} protecting women from divorce. The law was overturned because the court found that adultery is a <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> which the state should not intervened in.

Many assemblies see tithing (the giving of 10 percent of one's income) as a commandment for Israel from the Old Testament law and not binding on Christians, although some assemblies do encourage tithing. Instead, the amount given is normally left to the giver and is a <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> {{between the individual and}} the Lord.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Egyptian Islam was {{a complex and}} diverse religion.

The literate theologians of Al-Azhar University generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was a <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.|$|E

Catherine occupied herself with her faith. Her piety was widely known and was a characteristic in his wife that the King greatly admired; in his letters to his sister, Catherine's devoutness is described almost with awe. Her household contained between four and six priests, and in 1665, Catherine decided to build a religious house east of St James's to be occupied by thirteen Portuguese Franciscans {{of the order of}} St Peter of Alcantara. It was completed by 1667 and would become known as The Friary.|$|E
