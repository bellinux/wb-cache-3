5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Ceolwulf; a post-Conquest legend claims {{that his son}} Cynehelm was murdered to gain the succession. Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed, and the kingship passed {{permanently}} out of Coenwulf's family. Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Within a decade of his death, the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert, and Mercia never recovered its former <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E

50|$|Discrimination {{also plays}} out with {{networking}} and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> {{are more likely}} to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.|$|R
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

25|$|De la Gardie was {{the most}} renowned and {{influential}} among the regency members, although he was often challenged.

25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} a <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client.

25|$|The {{main reason}} for wealth {{disparity}} is unequal land distribution.

They enlist the services of their serfs to perform the labour of the land. 51% of poor tenants owe money to the landlords.

During the years 1450–51 he was involved in attempts by the Duke of Norfolk, John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and Sir John Fastolf to remove Suffolk's servants from positions of local power. These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and by the spring of 1451 Suffolk's widow, Alice (d.1475), and Thomas Scales, 7th Baron Scales, had assumed Suffolk's former <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in East Anglia.|$|E
