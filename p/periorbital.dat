25|$|<b>Periorbital</b> and conjunctival edema (accumulation {{of fluid}} {{beneath the skin}} around the eyes).|$|E
25|$|Classic presentations are abrupt {{onset of}} {{unilateral}} <b>periorbital</b> edema, headache, photophobia, and bulging {{of the eye}} (proptosis).|$|E
25|$|Hypertrophy of the extraocular muscles, adipogenesis, and {{deposition}} of nonsulfated glycoaminoglycans and hyaluronate, causes {{expansion of the}} orbital fat and muscle compartments, which {{within the confines of}} the bony orbit may lead to dysthyroid optic neuropathy, increased intraocular pressures, proptosis, venous congestion leading to chemosis and <b>periorbital</b> edema, and progressive remodeling of the orbital walls. Other distinctive features of TAO include lid retraction, restrictive myopathy, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, and exposure keratopathy.|$|E
25|$|Ptosis, chemosis, {{cranial nerve}} palsies (III, IV, V, VI). Sixth nerve palsy {{is the most}} common. Sensory deficits of the {{ophthalmic}} and maxillary branch of the fifth nerve are common. <b>Periorbital</b> sensory loss and impaired corneal reflex may be noted. Papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, and decreased visual acuity and blindness may occur from venous congestion within the retina. Fever, tachycardia and sepsis may be present. Headache with nuchal rigidity may occur. Pupil may be dilated and sluggishly reactive. Infection can spread to contralateral cavernous sinus within 24–48 hours of initial presentation.|$|E
25|$|A contusion, {{commonly}} known as a bruise, {{is a type of}} hematoma of tissue in which capillaries and sometimes venules are damaged by trauma, allowing blood to seep, hemorrhage, or extravasate into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Bruises, which do not blanch under pressure, can involve capillaries at the level of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone. Bruises are {{not to be confused with}} other similar-looking lesions primarily distinguished by their diameter or causation. These lesions include petechia (< 3nbsp&mm result from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus), purpura (3nbsp&mm to 1nbsp&cm, classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicates various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia), and ecchymosis (>1nbsp&cm caused by blood dissecting through tissue planes and settled in an area remote from the site of trauma or pathology such as <b>periorbital</b> ecchymosis, e.g.,"raccoon eyes", arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma).|$|E

2500|$|The {{rhinoplasty}} patient {{returns home}} after surgery, to rest, {{and allow the}} nasal cartilage and bone tissues to heal the effects of having been forcefully cut. Assisted with prescribed medications—antibiotics, analgesics, steroids—to alleviate pain and aid wound healing, the patient convalesces for about 1-week, and can go outdoors. Post-operatively, external sutures are removed at 4–5 days; the external cast is removed at 1-week; the stents are removed within 4–14 days; and the [...] "panda eyes" [...] <b>periorbital</b> bruising heal at 2-weeks. If an alar base reduction is performed conjunctively within the Rhinoplasty, these sutures need to be removed within 7–10 days post operatively. Throughout the first year post-operative, {{in the course of}} the rhinoplastic wounds healing, the tissues will shift moderately as they settle into being a new nose.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{relatively}} non-specific symptoms of initial hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is often misdiagnosed as depression, cyclothymia, PMS, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and, less frequently, as erectile dysfunction [...] or [...] an anxiety disorder. On gross examination, {{there is often}} presentation of a hard goiter that is not painful to the touch; other symptoms seen with hypothyroidism, such as <b>periorbital</b> myxedema, depend on {{the current state of}} progression of the response, especially given the usually gradual development of clinically relevant hypothyroidism. Testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, free T4, and the anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO, or TPOAb) and anti-microsomal antibodies can help obtain an accurate diagnosis. Earlier assessment of the person may present with elevated levels of thyroglobulin owing to transient thyrotoxicosis, as inflammation within the thyroid causes damage to the integrity of thyroid follicle storage of thyroglobulin; TSH is increased as the pituitary tries to increase production of T4 by the thyroid gland.|$|E
2500|$|Sinus {{infection}} {{can spread}} through anastomosing veins or by direct extension to close structures. Orbital complications were categorized by Chandler et al. into five stages {{according to their}} severity (see table). Contiguous spread to the orbit may result in <b>periorbital</b> cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital cellulitis, and abscess. Orbital cellulitis can complicate acute ethmoiditis if anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins thrombophlebitis enables {{the spread of the}} infection to the lateral or orbital side of the ethmoid labyrinth. Sinusitis may extend to the central nervous system, where it may cause cavernous sinus thrombosis, retrograde meningitis, and epidural, subdural, and brain abscesses. Orbital symptoms frequently precede intracranial spread of the infection [...] Other complications include sinobronchitis, maxillary osteomyelitis, and frontal bone osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone often originates from a spreading thrombo-phlebitis. A periostitis of the frontal sinus causes an osteitis and a periostitis of the outer membrane, which produces a tender, puffy swelling of the forehead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Periorbital</b> {{dark circles}} (also known as dark circles , infraorbital venous stasis or <b>periorbital</b> hyperpigmentation) are dark {{blemishes}} around the eyes. There are many causes of this symptom, including heredity and bruising.|$|E
5000|$|Edema {{surrounding}} the eyes is called <b>periorbital</b> edema or eye puffiness. The <b>periorbital</b> tissues are most noticeably swollen immediately after waking, {{perhaps as a}} result of the gravitational redistribution of fluid in the horizontal position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Periorbital</b> {{hyperpigmentation}} {{is characterized}} by dark circles around the eyes, which are common, often familial, and frequently found in individuals with dark pigmentation or Mediterranean ancestry. Atopic dermatitis patients may also exhibit <b>periorbital</b> pigmentation (allergic shiners) due to lower eyelid venous stasis, and treatment is ineffective.|$|E
