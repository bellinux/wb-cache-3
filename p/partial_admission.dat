The popularity of the crossflow fan in the HVAC industry comes from its compactness, shape, quiet operation, and ability to provide high pressure coefficient.

We aimed to define the time course, predictors, and clinical significance of PHE measured by serial magnetic resonance imaging. Methods—Patients with primary supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage 5 cm 3 underwent serial MRIs at prespecified intervals during the first month. Hematoma (Hv) and PHE (Ev) volumes were measured on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Relative PHE was defined as Ev/Hv. Neurologic assessments were performed at admission and with each MRI. Barthel Index, modified Rankin scale, and extended Glasgow Outcome scale scores were assigned at 3 months. Results—Twenty-seven patients with 88 MRIs were prospectively included. Median Hv and Ev on the first MRI were 39 and 46 cm 3, respectively. Median peak absolute Ev was 88 cm 3. Larger hematomas produced a larger absolute Ev (r 20. 6) and a smaller relative PHE (r 20. 7). Edema volume growth was fastest in the first 2 days but continued until 123 days.

40|$|AbstractTo {{obtain a}} high {{specific}} work output, the large pressure ratios across the turbine are required. This {{can be achieved}} using a supersonic turbine. When the fluid mass flow is low, the impulse kind {{of one or two}} stages supersonic turbine is employed. To prevent losses due to low blade aspect ratio and issues related to manufacturing and industrial problems, the turbine is used in <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> conditions. Studies show that the turbine efficiency is highly dependent on the amount of <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> coefficient. The turbine efficiency in full admission is high, but the use of <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> lowers the additional losses. Therefore, there will be a degree of <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> in which the turbine will have the highest efficiency. The aim of this work is to achieve the optimum <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> for a special impulse turbine as a case study. Therefore, in the beginning, an appropriate model of losses is presented. Then, using a nonlinear design optimization code, the <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> of an impulse supersonic turbine is optimized. This code is written using a genetic algorithm. Then, using three-dimensional numerical analysis, the optimal model will be selected. In the optimization problem, the turbine efficiency is the objective function. The amount of design parameters and constraints used in this process are ten and eight, respectively. After the optimization process, prototypes of designed and modified turbines are made and tested.

Geometrical details {{of an existing}} two stage turbine facility with low reaction blades is used for this purpose. For validation of the numerical results, experimental measurements of one <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> configuration at design point was used. The <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbine with single blockage had unsymmetrical shape; therefore the full annulus of the turbine had to be modeled numerically. The numerical grid included the full annulus geometry together with the disc gaps and rotor shrouds. Importance of various parameters in accurate modeling of the unsteady flow field of <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbines was assessed. Two simpler models were selected to study the effect of accurate modeling of radial distribution of flow parameters. In the first numerical model, the computational grid was two dimensional and the radial distribution of flow parameters was neglected. The second case was three-dimensional and full blades’ span height was modeled but the leakage flows at disc cavity and rotor shroud were neglected. Detailed validation of the results from various computational models with the experimental data showed that modeling of the leakage flow at disc cavities and rotor shroud of <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbines has substantial importance in accuracy of numerical computations. Comparison of the results from two computational models with varying inlet extension showed that modeling of the inlet cone has considerable importance in accuracy of results but with increased computational cost. <b>Partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbine with admission degree of  ε = 0. 524 in one blocked arc and two opposing blocked arcs were tested. Results showed that blocking the inlet annulus in one single arc produce better overall efficiency compared to the two blocked arc model. Effect of varying axial gap distance between the first stage stator and rotor rows was also tested numerically for the <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbine with admission degree of  ε = 0. 726. Results showed higher efficiency for the reduced axial gap model. Computations showed that the main flow leave the blade path down to the disc cavity and re-enter into the flow channel downstream the blockage, this flow would pass the rotor with very low efficiency. First stage rotor blades are subject to large unsteady forces due to the non-uniform inlet flow. Plotting the unsteady forces of first stage rotor blades for <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbine with single blockage showed that the blades experience large changes in magnitude and direction while traveling along the circumference. Unsteady forces of first stage rotor blades were plotted in frequency domain using Fourier transform. The largest amplitudes caused by <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> were at first and second multiples of rotational frequency due {{to the existence of}} single blockage and change in the force direction. Results obtained from the numerical computations showed that the discs have nonuniform pressure distribution especially in the first stage of <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbines. The axial force of the first rotor wheel was considerably higher when the axial gap distance was reduced between the first stage stator and rotor rows.

Recent {{developments}} in rotor dynamics technology are providing {{significant improvements in}} the correlation between theoretical analyses and actual rotor vibration response for mechanical drive steam turbines. These {{developments in}}volve analytical and experimental studies of tilting pad bearings, bearing supports, and steam force reactions. The bearing analysis has been modified to include oil temperature, thermal gradient, and pressure loading effects which exist during normal operation. Pad pivot deflections, hot preload, and oil viscosity effects cause variations in the dynamic characteristics of the bearing. The resulting changes in the stiffness and damping coefficients are evaluated for the tilting pad bearings of a high speed turbine. Bearing support structures, including special foundations, have been tested to determine their mechanical impedance {{as a function of}} frequency. The test results have been converted into analytical representations for use in the rotor dynamics analyses. The theoretical effects of dynamic support systems on the rotor vibration response are presented and compared. Examples of typical steam turbine designs of different sizes and speeds have been analyzed, using the new concepts. In each case, special response tests were conducted in which unbalance weights were installed in the rotor and the resultant changes in orbital vibration vectors were determined.

In the extreme case one limb will be flowing whilst the other is stagnant, this is the <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> condition. Even under steady state inlet conditions, unequal admission is an important effect to study on the way to fully understanding pulsed operation of adouble entry device.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) is a devastating {{neurological}} injury, resulting {{in varying degrees}} of paralysis, sensory loss and sphincter disturbance which are permanent and irreversible in cases. The major cause of spinal cord injuries (SCI) is motor vehicular crashes (MVC). Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the pattern, causes and early surgical outcome of spine injury, as seen at Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital, in Johannesburg, South Africa. Materials and methods: Age, sex, cause of spine injury, pattern of SCI, neurologic status on admission to hospital and eventual outcome of patients treated surgically for SCI from January 2008 to November 2010, were retrospectively studied from case notes. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16. 0. Results: A total of 80 patients who sustained spine injury, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were studied. The mean age of the patient was 36. 09 years, age ranging from 4 years to 87 years. Males were affected more than females, with a male to female ratio of 3 : 1. The most affected individuals were young adults in the age group 21 - 40 years (58. 75 %), followed by middle aged persons i. e. age group 41 - 60 years (31. 25 %). The elderly represented the minority (3. 75 %). Motor Vehicle crashes (MVC) was the most common cause of injury, constituting 52. 5 % of all spine injuries. The cervical spine was the most affected segment of the spine 47. 5 % and MVC was the commonest cause of these injuries (25 %). viii On admission to hospital, most patients presented with complete neurological deficit, i. e. ASIA A. (48. 75 %) ASIA A on admission had poor neurological recovery and only 3 (3. 75 %) patients had improvement on discharge. Both anterior and posterior approaches were used for surgical stabilization. Patients who showed neurological recovery were those with <b>partial</b> deficit on <b>admission.</b> The mean duration of hospital stay was 40 days, with a minimum of 2 days and maximum of 343 days. Six (7. 5 %) patients died as a result of spine injury, all death belonged to cervical spine injury category. Conclusion: SCI has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa and the developing world at large. The patients are mostly male adult, sustaining injury following MVC. The cervical spine was the most common level of injury. Neurologic outcome was satisfactory in a high number of the patients with incomplete injury. Recommendations: · Training of spine and neurosurgeons and enforcement of road traffic rules as MVC is major cause of spine injury. · Public awareness of how to assist a spine injured patient at the scene, would help reduce conversion of incomplete to complete spine injury · Early referral of patients and early surgery may improve outcome of patientsPublished in 2011.

40|$|Turbochargers {{are widely}} used in both {{passenger}} and commercial vehicle applications to increase power density, improved fuel economy leading to significant emissions reductions. In recent years, car manufacturers have introduced turbochargers widely in the diesel market {{in response to the}} stricter regulations in exhaust emissions. Although investment in turbocharger technology has made it possible to overcome issues related to reliability and cost, research is much needed in the area of design, testing methodologies and model development. This is particularly the case when considering unsteady flow effects. Computational codes are used by engine manufacturers to predict its performance and size components; prediction accuracy is crucial in this process. This thesis contributes to this process in several ways: steady modelling and heat transfer predictions. Furthermore, most aero-thermal design and analysis codes need data for validation; often the data available falls outside the range of conditions the engine experiences in reality leading to the need to interpolate and extrapolate excessively. The current work also contributes to this area by providing extensive experimental data in a large range of conditions. A further contribution of this work is the understanding of the turbine performance under pulsating flow; it shows that this performance deviates from the commonly used quasi-steady assumption in turbocharger/engine matching. A turbocharger is subjected to high temperature conditions; heat transfer within the turbine and the compressor severely affects the compressor performance at low rotational speeds and mass flow rates. Compressor maps provided by turbocharger manufacturers do not usually take into account the effects of heat transfer; this causes a mismatch when fitting the maps into engine codes which is detrimental to the overall engine performance prediction. The experimental investigation was conducted on three different turbine designs for an automotive turbocharger. The design progression was based on a commercial nozzleless unit modified into a variable geometry single as well as a twin-entry turbine configuration. The main geometrical parameters of these turbines were kept constant to allow equivalent performance assessment. The mixed-flow rotor used in this study consists of 12 blades with a constant inlet blade angle of + 20 °, a cone angle of 50 ° and a tip diameter of 95. 2 mm. The variable geometry stator consists of 15 vanes fitted into a ring mechanism, capable of pivoting in the range of 40 ° and 80 ° (with reference to the radial direction). The design progression into twin-entry turbine was completed by fitting a divider (accounting for only ≈ 6 % of the overall internal volume) within volute. The turbine response for different vane angles (40 ° to 70 °) and mass flow ratios between the two entries of the turbine was assessed. The turbine was tested under steady and pulsating flow conditions for two rotational speeds, 27. 9 rev/s·√K and 43. 0 rev/s·√K, a velocity ratio (U 2 /Cis) of 0. 3 - 1. 1 and a pulse frequency of 40 - 80 Hz under both in-phase and out-of-phase conditions. A meanline aerodynamic model capable of predicting the performance parameters was developed for the nozzleless and the variable geometry single-entry turbine. The former was validated against experimental results spanning an equivalent speed range of 27. 9 rev/s·√K and 53. 8 rev/s·√K while the latter validated against one single speed (43. 0 rev/s·√K) and three different vane angle settings (40 °, 60 ° and 70 °). The wide range of tests data from the Imperial College High Speed Dynamometer enabled the evaluation of the model in areas of the maps where currently no data exists. Based on the model prediction, a breakdown aerodynamic loss analysis was performed. As for the twin-entry turbine, the interaction between the two entries was investigated. Based on experimental evidence, a map-based method was developed to uniquely correlate the flow capacity within the entries for both <b>partial</b> and unequal <b>admission.</b> An investigation into the effects of heat transfer on a turbocharger was performed using a commercial turbocharger mounted on a 2. 0 litre diesel engine. The global objective of these tests was to improve the understanding of heat transfer in turbochargers under realistic engine conditions. Measurements were obtained for engine speeds between 1000 and 3000 rpm at a step of 500 rpm – for each engine speed the load applied was varied from 16 to 250 Nm. In addition to the standard set of measurements needed to define the turbo operating point, the turbocharger was equipped with 17 thermocouples positioned in different locations in order to quantify the temperatures of the components constituting the turbocharger. A simplified 1 -D heat transfer model was also developed and compared with experimental measurements. The algorithms calculate the heat transferred through the turbocharger, from the hot to the cold end by means of lump capacitances. The compressor performance deterioration from the adiabatic map was then predicted and based on the data generated by the model a multiple regression analysis was developed in order to assess the main parameters affecting the compressor non-adiabatic performance.

The <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbines are under different unsteady {{loading and unloading}} process, as well as flow parameters, respectively. The loss coefficient and static pressure distributions at the key position are presented in detail to analyze the nonuniformity originated from <b>partial</b> <b>admission.</b> The {{results show that the}} nonuniformity decreases along flow direction and the efficiency of control stage also decreases but with the uniformity improved downstream of the rotors with increasing admitting numbers in equal <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> degree. The reasons for efficiency decreasing are reasonably explained with windage and sector end losses presented by static entropy distributions. The periodic changes of unsteady forces in amplitude and direction are also compared and transformed in the frequency domain by FFT method. The largest circumferential exciting force factor which is remarkably larger than the corresponding axial exciting force factor decreases by 13. 2 % with the increase of admitting arc number. Compared with the common distribution of two symmetric admitting arcs, the maximum exciting force factor of triangle admitting arc distribution drops 11. 3 % with the mere efficiency decrease of 1. 32 %. The multiple admitting arc turbines are more conducive to be applied to submarines which concerns more about exciting force other than efficiency. Efficiency and unsteady forces are both worth being taken into consideration in the practical applications...|$|E
40|$|Rotating Micro Machines and Micro Gas Turbines (MGT) must spin at high {{rotating}} speed to achieve high power density. MGT requires a starter to rotate {{to a certain}} speed from which it starts operating on its own. A <b>Partial</b> <b>Admission</b> Turbine Drive (PATD) is one such a starter used to accelerate MGT upto self sustain mode of operation. <b>Partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbine is required to be designed and fabricated for a MGT. In this report the aerodynamic design of <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbine by optimizing various design parameters like specific speed, specific diameter, blade chord etc is presented. The turbine geometry has been optimized by design analysis. The turbine blade geometrical coordinates have been generated and used for machining the blades using three-axis milling machine. The complete assembly has been modeled using Solid Works software tool. A special rig was fabricated and the PATD was run up to 45000 rpm. The rig design such as rotor bearing arrangement and its critical speed analysis were carried out. Thus {{the scope of the}} present work involving the complete design, fabrication and testing of the PATD starting system in a special rig were successfully carried out. ...|$|E
40|$|The boundary-layer losses {{associated}} with the flow process in the blade channel are discussed. To determine the overall design point efficiency of a turbine, other losses must also be considered; these include tip clearance loss and disk friction loss. The sum of these losses normally comprises all the losses that are considered {{in the design of}} a full admission axial flow turbine. If, however, a <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> turbine is being considered, there are additional losses that must be included. The <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> losses usually considered are the pumping loss in the inactive blade channels and the filling-and-emptying loss in the blade passages as they pass through the admission arc. Finally, a loss that occurs at off-design operation of any turbine is the incidence loss...|$|E
40|$|Small and midsize {{turbines}} {{are widely}} used in various sectors of economics for electricity generation or as mechanical drivers. The small volume flow rate of these machines at the inlet requires a small minimal passage area for the first or some upstream stages. This leads to short blade heights and small gauging angles that together compose the passage area and result in significant effi-ciency reduction. A well-known approach to avoid this is to admit steam to {{the part of the}} arc. The <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> is widely used in the first (control) stage and sometimes even for the group of stages in small turbines. In general, the efficiency of the first partial stage and downstream located stages depends on many parameters. Some major parameters are as follows: total level of admission partiality, number and tangential location of admission arcs, and geometry of mixing chambers between first and downstream located stages. Proper combination of the above mentioned parameters may lead to improvements in turbine performance. In this article, the interaction of the control stage with <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> and one downstream stage without <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> for a high-speed mechanical drive turbine is considered. The compar-ison of 1 D, 2 D and CFD calculation results will be performed to reveal full 3 D flow structure influence on the performance of both stages...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we intend}} {{to solve the problem}} of maximum-revenue {{multicast}} routing with a <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> control mechanism for multirate multimedia distribution. Specifically, for a given network topology, a given link capacity, the destinations of a multicast group, and the bandwidth requirement of each destination, we attempt to find a feasible routing solution to maximize the revenue of the multicast trees. The <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> control mechanism means that the admission policy of the multicast group will not be based on a traditional “all or none ” strategy. Instead it considers accepting of partial portions of destinations for the requested multicast group. Firstly, we model this problem as an optimization problem. Then, we propose a simple heuristic algorithm and an optimization based heuristic to solve this problem. The methodology taken for solving the problem is Lagrangean relaxation. Computational experiments have been performed on regular networks, random networks, and scale-free networks. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{rotating}} measurements {{has been designed}} and commissioned for a two-stage axial turbine of impulse design. Relative total pressure and strain gauge measurements in the rotating frame of reference have been performed during <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> tests in this turbine. The overall project objectives are to determine unsteady aerodynamic losses related to admission sector-ends and rotor forcing functions. Some outcomes are presented and discussed herein. The unsteadiness in the measured relative total pressure is observed to be largest downstream of the suction side of the <b>partial</b> <b>admission</b> blockage where the high momentum fluid vividly interacts with the rotor. Strain gauge results show a high strain peak downstream of the suction side of the blockage. When reducing the shaft speed at constant pressure ratio, the dip in relative total pressure and the peak in tensile strain, that occur when a blade enters the blocked region, are shifted in the counter rotational direction. This is believed to reflect earlier emptying of the rotor blade channel. Furthermore, an increase of the flow capacity coefficient with a decrease of admission degree has been observed.
