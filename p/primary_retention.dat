40|$|Interstitial inflammation, sodium retention, and the {{pathogenesis}} of nephrotic edema: A unifying hypothesis. BackgroundThe pathophysiology of edema in the nephrotic syndrome is controversial. Some investigators believe that sodium retention may result from a primary renal defect that causes an “overfilled” blood volume. In contrast, other authors believe that fluid escapes the vascular compartment due a low oncotic pressure, and sodium retention is a compensatory physiological response to an “underfilled” blood volume. The patients that best fit the “underfilled” hypothesis are children with minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). MethodsWe analyzed critically the available evidence for and against each proposed pathogenic mechanism {{in the light of}} recent evidence indicating that the inflammatory infiltrate {{may play a role in}} <b>primary</b> renal sodium <b>retention.</b> ResultsInflammatory infiltrate in the kidney is a constant characteristic in nephrotic syndrome associated with <b>primary</b> sodium <b>retention</b> and it is absent in most cases of MCNS in childrenConclusionsWe propose that <b>primary</b> sodium <b>retention</b> in the nephrotic syndrome depends on the existence and the intensity of renal inflammatory infiltrate, conspicuously absent in most cases of MCNS in children and present in other conditions associated with massive proteinuria.

Sodium retention could be secondary to activation of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis or due to an intrinsic activation of Na+K+ ATPase in the cortical collecting duct. Urine potassium/urine potassium + urine sodium (UK+/UK+ + UNa+) is a surrogate marker for aldosterone activity and can be useful in differentiating <b>primary</b> sodium <b>retention</b> from secondary sodium retention in children with INS. This was a cross-sectional study of children with INS, presenting to our center from June 2007 to June 2008. Children were categorized into those with steroid responsive and steroid nonresponsive nephrotic syndrome. One hundred and thirty-four children with nephrotic syndrome were analyzed. The FeNa+ was significantly lower during relapse than in remission but no such difference was observed with UK+/UK+ + UNa+. The values of FeNa+ and UK+/UK+ + UNa+ across various categories of nephrotic syndrome were similar. Correlating FeNa+ and UK+/UK+ + UNa+ with cut-off of 0. 5 and 60 %, respectively, we found 50 % of steroid responsive children and 36 % of steroid nonresponders having a corresponding UK+/UK+ + UNa+ of < 60 % along with low FeNa+ of < 0. 5 %, favoring <b>primary</b> sodium <b>retention.</b> Urinary indices did not vary with the type of steroid response.

40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} phases in the propagation of a hydrocarbon spill into the subsurface occur in the vadose or unsaturated zone, between the land surface and the water table, and in the groundwater flow zone at its contact with the free oil phase. The last determines the dissolution and spreading of contaminants through the most mobile flow zone. The first determines the spill geometry, the amount of free phase oil that reaches the groundwater body and the total retention of spilled oil. Oil retention studies carried out for this project show whether the volume of soil within a spill site is sufficient to retain the oil without it escaping into the groundwater and also gives a rough approximation of how' long it takes for the oil phase to reach pendular saturation. Grain size and sorting distribution and are useful factors governing retention, and are useful parameters in evaluating the potential damage of an oil spill and the immediate danger of groundwater contamination. Centrifuge air-oil-water displacement provides a quick and first order approximate means to measure site-specific oil and water retention within the unsaturated zone of a porous media. Results show a semi log relationship between total <b>primary</b> <b>retention</b> and grain size (in phi units) of laboratory samples with oil-water-air systems run under 38 g in the centrifuge. A correction factor adjusts retentions to gravity drainage column pack saturations after gravity drainage used as a standard of comparison.

30|$|Anionic {{emulsion}} sizes {{consisting of}} rosin triglyceride esters and partly fortified rosin acids (i.e., rosin-ester sizes), {{have recently been}} used as internal sizes for alkaline papermaking. In this study, handsheets were prepared from pulp suspensions with alum and a rosin-ester size under various conditions, and sizing degree and size and aluminum contents of the handsheets were determined. Aluminum compounds originating from alum added to the pulp suspensions behave as retention aids of the rosin-ester size even in alkaline papermaking under limited conditions. Carboxyl groups in pulp are the <b>primary</b> <b>retention</b> sites of aluminum compounds in pulp suspensions. They form cationic sites on pulp fibers, and thus the anionic size emulsion particles are adsorbed on pulp fibers by electrostatic interactions. However, the cationic charges of aluminum compounds on pulp fibers decrease and finally disappear completely with the lapse of time after the alum addition by forming ionic bonds between the cationic sites and OH− ions. Thus, pH values of the pulp suspensions and timing of the size addition strongly influence the retention values of the rosin-ester size and the resultant sizing features.|$|E

30|$|Bone mineral density {{has been}} {{also used to}} {{establish}} a treatment plan to ensure thestability of implants in dentistry. During early stages, bone density {{appears to be the}} key determinant for stationary anchorage of mini-implants in the sites with inadequate cortical bone thickness because <b>primary</b> <b>retention</b> of mini-implants is achieved by mechanical means rather than through osseointegration [15]. The mechanical distribution of stress occurs primarily where the bone is in contact with the implant [18]. The smaller the area of the bone contacting the implant body, the greater is the overall stress, when all other factors are equal. The bone density influences the amount of bone in contact with the implant surface. Since less dense bone is found in the posterior maxilla, it will offer less area of contact with the body of the implant. Consequently, a greater implant surface area is required to obtain a similar amount of bone-implant contact in soft bone compared with denser bone quality. In the present study, the bone density at the maxillary tuberosity was approximately 950 HU and comparatively weak. Therefore, when placing microscrew implants in the maxillary tuberosity, longer implants should be used.|$|E
40|$|Maximum {{orthodontic}} anchorage {{is useful}} in numerous clinical situations. Although traditional osteointegrated implants provide good anchorage (Ödman et al., 1988; Roberts et al., 1989; Wehrbein and Merz, 1998), they are too bulky for some applications, and therefore, miniscrews [microscrews or temporary anchorage devices (TADs) ] are often preferred (Kanomi, 1997; Ohmae et al., 2001; Miyawaki et al., 2003). Besides their smaller sizes, other advantages of the miniscrews are smooth surface, lower costs, reduced chair-side times, {{and the possibility of}} immediate loading (Fritz et al., 2004). Unlike dental implants, which acquire their stability via osteointegration, miniscrews obtain maximum stability mechanically via <b>primary</b> <b>retention</b> (Melsen and Verna 1999; Brettin et al., 2008).

40|$|In gas {{chromatography}} (GC) reproducible retention times {{are in many}} cases highly favorable {{or in some cases}} even required. In one-dimensional GC, retention time shifts can be eliminated or minimized using a procedure called retention time locking (RTL). This procedure is based on adjusting the (constant) column head pressure. Unfortunately, this RTL procedure cannot be used in comprehensive two-dimensional {{gas chromatography}} (GC × GC) given the fact that peaks will shift in both dimensions.

In this paper, a fast and easy to perform, two-step retention time locking procedure for two-dimensional gas chromatography (2 D-RTL) is proposed and its feasibility is demonstrated. This 2 D-RTL procedure involves adjustment of the column head pressure or constant column flow, followed by the adjustment of the so-called effective secondary column length. The secondary column length is increased or decreased, simply by moving it stepwise through the modulator. It is demonstrated that retention time shifts in both the primary- and secondary-dimension, which may occur after e. g. replacing the column set, can be minimized to less than half peak base width.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} {{the prevalence of}} ectopic eruption, impaction, and primary and secondary retention as well as agenesis of the permanent second molar (M 2) among adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a sample size calculation, dental records, including radiographs, of 1543 patients (722 girls and 821 boys), from three clinics {{in the city of}} Malmoe, Sweden, were retrospectively analyzed. Series of annual records and radiographs were examined for all patients from 10 to 16 years of age and were carried out during 2004 - 2006. The prevalence of ectopic eruption, impaction, and primary and secondary retention as well as agenesis of M 2 s was registered in a standardized manner and according to preset definitions. In addition, the times of emergence of the M 2 s were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of ectopic eruption of M 2 was 1. 5 %, the prevalence of <b>primary</b> <b>retention</b> was 0. 6 %, and the prevalence of impaction was 0. 2 %. This means that the overall prevalence of eruption disturbances was 2. 3 %. In addition, the prevalence of agenesis was 0. 8 %.

The Newcastle 85 + study successfully recruited a cohort of 854 85 -year-olds to detailed health assessment at baseline and followed them up over 3 phases spanning 5 years. This paper describes the effectiveness of its retention strategies. Methods: <b>Primary</b> <b>retention</b> strategies involved meticulous management of contact information and active maintenance of contact with participants between research visits and between phases of the study. For statistical analysis, data on post-inclusion attrition over the 3 follow-up phases was separated into ‘death ’ and ‘withdrawal ’ categories, with sub-categories ‘health ’ and ‘non-health ’ reasons created for ‘withdrawal’. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine if particular socio-demographic and health characteristics were associated with post-inclusion attrition due to withdrawal at each of the 3 phase-to-phase transition points. Results: For both sexes, at successive follow-up phases there was a decrease in attrition due to withdrawal and an increase due to death. Withdrawal was most prevalent between baseline and phase 2.

40|$|This study {{illustrates}} the complimentary nature of selected techniques for characterizing kaolinite. For the {{particular type of}} kaolinte studied, scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of crystallites and mostly larger than clay-sized particles. These findings were {{in agreement with the}} low cation exchange capacity, low specific surface area, low zero point of charge and high purity that were determined for the kaolinite. Batch equilibrium tests were conducted on kaolinite suspensions that had been adjusted to pH 4 and pH 6. These suspensions were spiked with varying concentrations of Pb (as PbCl 2) and Cd (as CdCl 2). At equilibrium, the metal uptake was greater for the pH 6 suspensions than for the pH 4 suspensions, the metal uptake was generally greater when greater concentrations of metal had been used to spike the suspensions, and there was a reduction in suspension pH that accompanied the metal uptake. A comparison of the equilibrium curves of both metal retention and suspension pH, {{as a function of the}} initial metal concentration, combined with an analysis of metal speciation, provided evidence for the adsorption of both divalent (Pb 2 + and Cd 2 +) and monovalent (PbCl + and CdCl +) species by the kaolinite. Cation exchange was a <b>primary</b> <b>retention</b> mechanism and the order of selectivity for the pH 4 and pH 6 suspensions of kaolinite appeared to be Pb 2 +>H +>Cd 2 +. At higher pH and higher metal concentrations, there was an increase in Cd uptake relative to Pb uptake. This may have been a result of less competition between H + ions and metal ions for adsorption sites, and because CdCl + forms at a lower salt concentration than PbCl +, and so a greater proportion of monovalent Cd was adsorbed...|$|E

A topical bimatoprost ocular insert was compared with twice-daily timolol eye drops {{in patients with}} open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) treated for 6 months. DesignParallel-arm, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled trial. ParticipantsOne hundred thirty adult OAG or OHT patients. MethodsEligible patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive a bimatoprost insert plus artificial tears twice daily or a placebo insert plus timolol (0. 5 % solution) twice daily for 6 months after a screening washout period. Diurnal IOP measurements (at 0, 2, and 8 hours) were obtained at baseline; weeks 2, 6, and 12; and months 4, 5, and 6. Key eligibility included washout IOP of 23 mmHg or more at time 0, IOP of 20 mmHg or more at 2 and 8 hours, and IOP of 34 mmHg or less at all time points; no prior incisional surgery for OAG or OHT; and no known nonresponders to prostaglandins. Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary efficacy end point examined the difference in mean change from baseline in diurnal IOPs (point estimate, 95 % confidence interval) across 9 coprimary end points at weeks 2, 6, and 12 comparing the bimatoprost arm with the timolol arm using a noninferiority margin of 1. 5 mmHg. Secondary end points were diurnal IOP measurements at months 4, 5, and 6 and adverse events (AEs). ResultsA mean reduction from baseline IOP of − 3. 2 to − 6. 4 mmHg was observed for the bimatoprost group compared with − 4. 2 to − 6. 4 mmHg for the timolol group over 6 months. The study met the noninferiority definition at 2 of 9 time points but was underpowered for the observed treatment effect. Adverse events were consistent with bimatoprost or timolol exposure; no unexpected ocular AEs were observed. <b>Primary</b> <b>retention</b> rate of the insert was 88. 5 % of patients at 6 months. ConclusionsClinically relevant reduction in mean IOP was observed over 6 months with a bimatoprost ocular insert {{and seems to be}} safe and well tolerated. The topically applied bimatoprost insert may provide an alternative to daily eye drops to improve adherence, consistency of delivery, and reduction of elevated IOP...|$|E
40|$|In {{continuation}} of {{investigations of the}} chemical fate of (n, ?) and (?, n) produced Re recoil atoms in K 2 ReBr 6 -K 2 SnCl 6 [1, 2] and K 2 ReBr 6 -K 2 OsCl 6 [3] mixed crystals and IT and (n, ?) produced Br recoil atoms in K 2 ReBr 6 -K 2 SnCl 6 [4] and K 2 ReBr 6 -K 2 ReCl 6 [5] mixed crystals we have investigated recently the chemical effects of 77 Br recoil atoms in the K 2 ReBr 6 - K 2 ReCl 6 system activated by the nuclear reaction 79 Br (?, 2 n) 77 Br. By using ion exchange column chromatography as a new method of separation of the mixed Re 77 BrBr 5 -nCl 2 -n species larger amounts of the irradiated material could be separated following the dissolution. The yield of Re 77 BrBr 2 - 5 increases, the yield of Re 77 BrCl 2 - 5 decreases significantly with increasing K 2 ReBr 6 concentration, all the other mixed hexabromochlororhenates and the free bromide-(77 Br) are only little dependent of the mixed crystal composition at least at concentrations below 50 mol-% K 2 ReBr 6. For zero K 2 ReBr 6 content we obtained by extrapolation : 77 Br- 16 % Re 77 BrBr 2 - 5 3 % Re 77 BrBr 4 Cl 2 - 5 % Re 77 BrBr 3 Cl 2 - 2 5 % Re 77 BrBr 2 Cl 2 - 3 6 % Re 77 BrBrCl 2 - 4 16 % Re 77 BrCl 2 - 5 49 % The total bromine content (active 77 Br and inactive 79, 81 Br) of the recoil labelled species amounts to 31 % at zero K 2 ReBr 6 concentration clearly indicating that on the average two bromide ligands (one of them being 77 Br, the other inactive) of the original six survive the nuclear process and are still bonded to their original Re central atom. Especially {{the appearance of the}} more intimately mixed species cannot be explained by models discussed hitherto in the literature [6] (billiard ball impact, ligand vacancy exchange followed by combination [7], hot spot reaction). We propose here a new mechanism which we want to call the Inverse Cage Effect. Following this model Br recoil atoms that are directed towards the central atom transfer their kinetic energy via the central atom to {{all or part of the}} other ligands which are driven in the surrounding lattice. The newly formed vacancies are then filled by halide ions from the environment including the ligands just pushed away. The experimental results may be summarized as follows : Besides a very small yield of <b>primary</b> <b>retention</b> (Re 77 BrBr 2 - 5) one third of the recoil bromine atoms react following the inverse cage effect, two third are caught as interstitials (77 Br-) or undergo simple displacements (Re 77 BrCl 2 - 5). The recoil energy of the 77 Br is estimated to be not larger than ca. 1 keV. This suggests that the nuclear reaction 79 Br(γ, 2 n) 77 Br is far from a compound nuclear mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Background: Botswana has a {{shortage}} of health care workers, especially in <b>primary</b> healthcare. <b>Retention</b> and high performance of employees are closely linked to job satisfaction and motivation, which are both highest where employees’ personal values and goals are realised. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate employees’ personal values, and the current and desired organisational culture of the district health services as experienced by the primary health care workers. Setting: The study was conducted in the Ngamiland and Mahalapye health districts. Method: This was a cross sectional survey. The participants were asked to select 10 values that best described their personal, current organisational and desired organisational values from a predetermined list. Results: Sixty and 67 health care workers completed the survey in Mahalapye and Ngamiland districts, respectively. The top 10 prevalent organisational values experienced in both districts were: teamwork, patient satisfaction, blame, confusion, job insecurity, not sharing information and manipulation. When all the current values were assessed, 32 % (Mahalapye) and 36 % (Ngamiland) selected by health care workers were potentially limiting organisational effectiveness. The organisational values desired by health care workers in both districts were: transparency, professional growth, staff recognition, shared decision-making, accountability, productivity, leadership development and teamwork. Conclusions: The experience of the primary health care workers in the two health districts were overwhelmingly negative, which is likely to contribute to low levels of motivation, job satisfaction, productivity and high attrition rates. There is therefore urgent need for organisational transformation with a focus on staff experience and leadership development. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Soil {{can have}} a {{significant}} impact on the potential quality of wine. While geologist and viticulturist are not exactly sure what type of immutable or terroir based qualities that soil can impart on wine, there is near universal agreement that a soil's water retention and drainage abilities play a <b>primary</b> role. Water <b>retention</b> refers to the soil's ability to hold water. The term [...] "field capacity" [...] is used to describe the maximum amount of water that deeply moistened soil will retain after normal drainage. Drainage is the ability of water to move freely throughout the soil. The ideal circumstance is soil that can retain sufficient amount of water for the grapevine but drains well enough to where the soil doesn't become water-logged. Soil that doesn't retain water well encourages the vine to easily sleep into water stress while soil that doesn't drain well runs of the risk of water-logged roots being attacked by microbial agents that consume all the soil nutrients and end up starving the vine.|$|R
40|$|The gravity-driven {{transport}} of TiO 2, CeO 2, and Cu(OH) 2 engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) {{and their effects}} on soil pH and nutrient release were measured in three unsaturated soils. ENM transport {{was found to be}} highly limited in natural soils collected from farmland and grasslands, with the majority of particles being retained in the upper 0 - 3  cm of the soil profile, while greater transport depth was seen in a commercial potting soil. Physical straining appeared to be the <b>primary</b> mechanism of <b>retention</b> in natural soils as ENMs immediately formed micron-scale aggregates, which was exacerbated by coating particles with Suwannee River natural organic matter (NOM) which promote steric hindrance. Small changes in soil pH were observed in natural soils contaminated with ENMs that were largely independent of ENM type and concentration, but differed from controls. These changes may have been due to enhanced release of naturally present pH-altering ions (Mg(2 +), H(+)) in the soil via substitution processes. These results suggest ENMs introduced into soil will likely be highly retained near the source zone...|$|R
