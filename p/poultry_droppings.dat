40|$|Abstract: A {{total of}} 310 animal samples {{including}} 50 fecal (droppings of broiler chickens) and 260 intestinal content (105 broiler chicken, 50 cattle, 55 buffalo and 50 sheep) and 48 human fecal samples was {{collected from the}} investigated food animal contacts from El-Monieb and El-Warak abattoirs and different animal and poultry farms at Giza Governorate, Egypt. Bacteriological examination of samples revealed that 17 samples (10. 96 %) including 5 (10 %) and 12 (11. 42 %) from <b>poultry</b> fecal <b>droppings</b> and intestinal content samples, respectively and 8 (16. 66 %) out of the 48 human fecal samples were positive for Campylobacter. All the human and poultry Campylobacter isolates were biochemically identified to be C. jejuni. Results of the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated Campylobacter strains showed that poultry Campylobacter strains displayed resistance of 64. 71 % to ampicillin, streptomycin and chloramphenicol and 58. 82 % to erythromycin and tetracycline. While, human strains resistance pattern was 87. 5 % to ampicillin, 75 % to streptomycin and tetracycline, 62. 5 % to erythromycin and 50 % to chloramphenicol.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suitability of the Concentration McMaster technique in counting coccidia oocysts and to compare it with two others -McMaster method modified by Wetzel and Zajíček. A stock suspension containing Eimeria oocysts was prepared, from which five concentrations (20, 250, 500, 1, 000 and 1, 500) of oocysts were made. Each method was evaluated after the examination of 30 samples in five concentrations. Each sample was presented as a parasite negative fecal dropping into which a known number of oocysts were inoculated. When results of all three methods were compared, statistically significant differences (P< 0. 05) among them in each tested OPG concentration were found. The most diverse results (P< 0. 01) were provided by the Wetzel and Zajíček methods. The Wetzel method produced the least accurate results of all the evaluated methods and in all tested oocyst concentrations. This method was found inappropriate for counting coccidia oocysts in fecal droppings. The Zajíček and the Roepstorff and Nansen method produced oocyst counts similar to the true numbers. These two methods were then evaluated using <b>poultry</b> fecal <b>droppings</b> naturally infected by coccidial infection. Differences between these two methods were found in the repeatability of the obtained results rather than in the oocyst counts. Compared to the Zajíček method, the Roepstorff and Nansen method is faster, less laborious, and produces sensitive and reliable results with repeated measurements over time. For all these reasons the Concentration McMaster technique could be recommend for the detection and quantification of coccidia oocysts in bird droppings...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Four pseudomonad {{isolates}} {{which could}} use uric acid aerobically as a sole C, N and energy source were isolated from <b>poultry</b> house deep-litter, <b>droppings,</b> and nearby soil. Organisms harvested from media containing uric acid can degrade uric acid completely, with {{the formation of}} CO, and NH,. Allantoin, allantoic, glyoxylic and formic acids were completely oxidized. The existence of micro-organisms able to decompose uric acid aerobically has long been known (see Stapp, 1920), but relatively little work has been re-ported on the biochemical pathways of this decomposition. The excrement of chickens contains a relatively large amount of uric acid (c. 5 yo of the dry weight, depending somewhat on the diet; information kindly supplied by Dr. J. Tinsley). In the deep-litter method of poultry husbandry the uric acid of the droppings rapidly disappears from the litter and there is often a marked evolution of ammonia. It seemed likely therefore that established deep-litter beds in poultry houses might well be a habitat from which micro-organisms capable of decomposing uric acid could easily be obtained; this proved to b...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of animal wastes on crude oil degradation potential of strains of Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus subtilis isolated from animal wastes (<b>poultry</b> and pig <b>droppings)</b> and petroleum-polluted soil was compared in laboratory studies. Both bacterial strains {{were selected for}} high crude oil degradation ability after screening many isolates by the 2, 6 -dichlorophenol indophenol method. Analyses by gas chromatography (GC) showed that degradation of crude oil was markedly enhanced (88. 3 – 97. 3 % vs 72. 1 – 78. 8 %) in soil amended with animal wastes {{as indicated by the}} reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH). TPH reduction by animal waste bacterial strains in animal waste-amended soil was more than the reduction by strains from soil contaminated with petroleum (P < 0. 001). The greatest reduction of TPH (96. 6 – 97. 3 % vs 80. 4 – 95. 9 %) was by poultry waste strains and it occurred in soil amended with poultry waste. GC analyses of n-alkanes showed that although shorter chains were preferentially degraded [32. 0 – 78. 5 % (C 8 – 23) vs 6. 3 – 18. 5 % (C 24 – 36) ] in normal soil, biodegradation of longer chains increased to 38. 4 – 46. 3 % in animal waste-amended soil inoculated with the same animal wastes’ strains.

40|$|Effects {{of varying}} levels of Dried <b>Poultry</b> <b>Droppings</b> fed Clarias gariepinus were {{investigated}} for 84 days. The fish meal was partially and completely replaced by dried <b>poultry</b> <b>droppings</b> at 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % inclusions and was allotted T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5 respectively. Investigation conducted on the occurrence of microbes in the fish feeds revealed that T 5 varied significantly (p< 0. 05) in Total Viable Count (TVC) (13. 0 × 105 cfu/g) and Total Fungal Count (TFC) (0. 70 × 105 cfu/g) respectively. The microbial properties of the fish carcass showed that T 5 was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in TVC (2. 72 × 105 cfu/g), TCC (0. 33 × 105 cfu/g), while T 3 and T 5 were significantly higher in TFC (0. 20 × 103 cfu/g). The haematological parameters of Clarias gariepinus fed diet substituted with dried <b>poultry</b> <b>droppings</b> showed that Packed Cell Volume (PCV) (43. 00 g/l) and Haemoglobin (Hb) (11. 23 g/l) of T 1 were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than other treatments. The values of Red Blood Cell (RBC) revealed that T 2 (3. 77 × 106 mm 3) was significantly different (p< 0. 05) compared to other treatments. The growth performance showed that T 2 varied significantly (p< 0. 05) in Mean Weight Gain (MWG) (29. 33 g) and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) (0. 09). The findings {{of the current study}} imply that feed microbes affected the haematological parameters of the fish and equally suppressed the growth of the fish...|$|E
40|$|Eco-toilets (human {{urine and}} faecal matter {{collected}} separately) {{are one of}} the best ways to solve sanitation problem, and this practice also improves the environment and increases the food production. This study focuses on experimental demonstration of use of urine, wood ash and <b>poultry</b> <b>droppings</b> (PD) as a fertilizer in central Nepal and in Accra, Ghana. In Nepal, Fertilizer value of urine+ash was compared with animal manure and no-fertilization in the cultivation of radish, potato, broadleaf mustard, auliflower and cabbage. The urine + ash or manure fertilized plots received 54 kgN/ha for radish, 51 kgN/ha for potato, 81 kgN/ha for broadleaf mustard and 77 kgN/ha for cabbage and cauliflower. Similarly in Ghana, urine was compared no fertilization and urine + PD (poultry dropping) was compared with NPK (mineral ertilizer) +PD as a dose of 121 kgN/ha. In Nepal, the urine+ash fertilizer produced significantly (P 24 t/ha radish tuber, > 95 kg/ha potato tuber, > 19 t/ha cauliflower total biomass and > 15 t/ha cabbage total biomass. In Ghana, urine produced 1. 2 ton/ha more cabbage head biomass compared to no fertilization and urine+PD produced 0. 82 t/ha more cabbage head biomass compared to NPK+PD. Furthermore, in Nepal, N-fertilizer value of 4 litres urine is equal to the 1 kg of dry manure and in Ghana N-fertilizer value of 2 litres of urine is equal to 1 kg of <b>poultry</b> <b>droppings.</b> In conclusion, human urine can be used as fertilizer alone or combined with wood ash and <b>poultry</b> <b>droppings</b> and this can produce similar or even more vegetable biomass than can be achieved with no fertilization, manure fertilization or NPK+PD...|$|E
30|$|However, <b>poultry</b> <b>droppings</b> are in {{high demand}} for its other uses in {{agricultural}} and ecological domains, whereas sawdust contains lignin and is poor nutrient-wise, limiting its role in nursery media to aeration. Amidst these challenges, there is need to explore the use of apparently less nutrient-rich sources of organic manure and more nutrient-rich aerator as substitutes. For instance, cattle dung (dung) and pig slurry (slurry) are more available in larger amounts in the agro-industry but are rather poor compared to <b>poultry</b> <b>droppings</b> {{not in terms of}} nutrient reserve but mineralization rate (Uzoh et al. 2015). On the other hand, rice-husk dust (huskdust) is generated in large quantities daily, but mostly has low agronomic utility, often times {{to the detriment of the}} environment. It is a valuable organic input owing to its small size which allows excellent soil-litter contact as well as its low polyphenol content (Schulz et al. 2003). Besides being of high nutrient content and moisture retention capacity, rice-husk dust is a good aerator (Baiyeri and Mbah 2006).|$|E
