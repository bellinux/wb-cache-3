40|$|Lantana camara is an {{environmental}} weed {{in the northern}} North Island of New Zealand. It is an increasingly observed problem in forest margins, coastal scrublands, dunes, plantations and island habitats, and its rapid, uncontrolled growth can create dense impenetrable thickets, suppressing vegetation and bush regeneration.

40|$|Abstract Background World Health Organization (WHO) {{targets for}} acute flaccid {{paralysis}} (AFP) surveillance, including the notification of a minimum rate of AFP among children, are {{used to assess the}} adequacy of AFP surveillance for the detection of poliovirus infection. Sensitive surveillance for poliovirus infection in both developed and developing countries is essential to support global disease eradication efforts. We applied recently developed methods for the quantitative evaluation of disease surveillance systems to evaluate the sensitivity of AFP surveillance for poliovirus infection in Australia. Methods A scenario tree model which accounted for administrative region, age, population immunity, the likelihood of AFP, and the probability of notification and stool sampling was used to assess the sensitivity of AFP surveillance for wild poliovirus infection among children aged less than 15 years in Australia. The analysis was based on historical surveillance data collected between 2000 and 2005. We used a surveillance time period of one month, and evaluated the ability of the surveillance system to detect poliovirus infection at a prevalence of 1 case per 100 000 persons and 1 case per million persons. Results There was considerable variation in the sensitivity of AFP surveillance for poliovirus infection among Australian States and Territories. The estimated median sensitivity of AFP surveillance in Australia among children aged less than 15 years was 8. 2 % per month at a prevalence of 1 case per 100, 000 population, and 0. 9 % per month at a prevalence of 1 case per million population. The probability that Australia is free from poliovirus infection given negative surveillance findings following 5 years of continuous surveillance was 96. 9 % at a prevalence of 1 case per 100, 000 persons and 56. 5 % at a prevalence of 1 case per million persons. Conclusion Given the ongoing risk of poliovirus <b>importation</b> <b>prior</b> to global eradication, long term surveillance is required to provide a high degree of confidence in freedom from poliovirus infection in Australia, particularly if a low prevalence of infection is assumed. Adherence to the WHO surveillance targets would considerably improve the sensitivity of surveillance for poliovirus infection in Australia. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the dynamic}} ferment of American Transcendentalism {{a number of}} men and women arose who {{continue}} to claim thoughtful attention. Their influence upon American literary, philosophical, political, and social thought, however assessed, occupies a solid place {{in the history of the}} nineteenth century. ^ It is difficult if not impossible to mark the first stirrings of transcendental thought in America. There can hardly be any doubt that German idealism impinged markedly upon the thought of those who came to be designated Transcendentalists in America. Strains of European transcendentalism can be clearly traced in the writings of Americans like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Theodore Parker, and Margaret Fuller. At the same time, George Willis Cooke offers evidence to support the claim that there was much transcendental thought in America <b>prior</b> to the <b>importation</b> of Kantian idealism, directly or through Coleridge (1 - 39). ^ Whether American transcendentalism be viewed as a thought system or simply as a movement, it is the presupposition of these essays that epistemology was quite important to all the writers considered. The essays are also built upon the postulate that a consideration of the Transcendentalists 2 Ì† 7 epistemology is essential to an understanding of much if not all they were seriously concerned with. ^ These essays reveal the far-ranging effects of epistemological considerations upon the Transcendentalists 2 Ì† 7 view of education, their social theory, literary criticism, religious outlook, as well as their ontology. Epistemology in one way or another colors all their thought. Emerson openly espouses the philosophy of idealism. Few of the others even come close to this; for them 2 Ì† 2 idealism 2 Ì† 2 is more of an ethical or aesthetic outlook. Thoreau 2 Ì† 7 s epistemology is hard-headed and eminently practical. Fuller 2 Ì† 7 s epistemological concerns seem more aesthetically oriented. Parker has the background and the intellectual skill to engage eagerly in high-level debate with the followers of Locke. ^ Analysis of the epistemology of these representative Transcendentalists reveals that they combined empiricism with rational thought but especially felt closer to truth when moved by the 2 Ì† 2 velocities 2 Ì† 2 of intuition. ...|$|R
