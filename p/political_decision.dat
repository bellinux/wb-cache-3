However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated to manipulate the <b>political</b> <b>decision.</b> In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|The Courtier-Liberal {{alliance}} held near absolute {{sway over}} Brazilian politics for several years. By 1847, however, PedroII had carefully removed {{members of the}} Courtier Faction from key positions. Aureliano Coutinho's influence was destroyed after the Emperor implicitly banned him from participation in <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> making. The monarch then moved against the Liberals. From 1844 through 1848, the country saw several successive Liberal cabinets, all plagued by internal divisions. PedroII called upon the Party of Order {{to form a new}} cabinet in September 1848.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E

25|$|Permission {{for use of}} NOK135 {{million in}} {{subsidies}} was granted by the ministry in August. The <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> {{to carry out the}} project was led by Minister of Trade and Industry Finn Kristensen and his state secretary, Kari Blegen. Thus the <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> was made before a commission could investigate if the project could be profitable and meet market demands. This was carried out by a commission led by Blegen, which published its report in December 1987. It concluded that each center would have a revenue of between NOK6 and 8 million. This was in part based on that NTNF and NTA would purchase services for NOK40 to 50 million per year over a period of four years. Each center would need NOKnsbp;2.3 million in subsidies per year, which would be financed through supporting projects which would purchase services from them.|$|E

25|$|Several {{variants}} of democracy exist, {{but there are}} two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is direct democracy, in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly. In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a representative democracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was the baptism of Mieszko. There are {{different}} hypotheses concerning this event. Most often {{it is assumed that}} it was a <b>political</b> <b>decision,</b> intended to bring Mieszko's state closer to the Czechs and to facilitate his activities in the Polabian Slavs area. At the same time, the baptism decreased the likelihood of future attacks by German margraves and deprived them of the opportunity to attempt Roman Catholicization of Mieszko's lands by force. An additional reason could be Mieszko's desire to remove from power the influential pagan priest class, who may have been blocking his efforts to establish a more centralized rule.|$|E

25|$|The renewed industrialization, which based {{itself on}} both a dogmatic {{understanding}} of Marxian economics {{and a series}} of autarkic goals, brought major economic problems to Romania, beginning with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, and worsened by the 1979 energy crisis. The profound neglect of services and decline in quality of life, first manifested when much of the budget was diverted to support an over-sized industry, was made more drastic by the <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> to pay in full the country's external debt (in 1983, this was set at 10billion United States dollars, of which 4.5 was accumulated interest). By March 1989, the debt had been paid in full.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{widespread}} belief {{on all sides}} of the debate, confirmed by top Bush administration officials, that politics {{played a role in the}} decision to impose tariffs. Namely, the large and important Rust Belt swing states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia would benefit from the tariffs. The placement of the tariffs was an odd one for Bush, who has signed numerous free trade agreements during his term in office. This was widely believed to be a calculated <b>political</b> <b>decision,</b> insofar as the localities that stood to benefit were marginal ones. Both the George H. W. Bush administration and the Reagan administration also imposed import limits on steel.|$|E
25|$|Plans for {{an airport}} rail link {{from the central}} {{business}} district of Stockholm and the airport was launched in the early 1980s. The goal was to reduce road congestion and emissions while allowing Arlanda to keep increasing passenger numbers. The Swedish Rail Administration made a specific plan in the late 1980s which involved {{the construction of a}} branch from the existing East Coast Line. This resulted in a project plan which was launched in 1990, which specifically suggested Rosersberg and Odensala as the intersections with the existing line. The <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> to build the line was taken in 1993. Estimates at the time gave a ridership of 5.1 million passengers per year in 2005.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} drivers behind political decision-making {{and the policy}} outcomes resulting from <b>political</b> <b>decisions.</b> It is proposed that in policy processes where <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> are made at multiple levels or across multiple policy subsystems, policy outcomes can {{be understood in terms}} of the mechanisms (i. e. the processes or means) of interaction between multiple policy subsystems within which <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> are made,resulting in more or less policy alignment between <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> and policy outcomes. Policy network theory and policy subsystem theory are used separately as the basis forderiving two potential explanations for the mechanics of policy subsystem interactions. Because political decision-making authority in the wind power policy process in most Western democratic countries is spread across multiple policy subsystems, and because there has been significant variation between wind power policy outcomes between these countries, wind power policy processes in European Union countries are used as an empirical point-of-departure for exploring and illustrating the mechanics of policy subsystem interaction. A survey of the research on wind power development is used to illustrate and explore preliminary empirical indications of support for a framework derived from policy network theory. The case of <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> made in Sweden over the past twenty years related to wind power development and production is used to illustrate and explore preliminary empirical indications of support for an explanation of policy subsystem interactions derived from the Advocacy Coalition Framework proposed here, as well as to explore the drivers of <b>political</b> <b>decisions.</b> This dissertation therefore contributes to understanding how policy subsystems interact. The dissertation contributes theoretically to the literature on policy processes generally, as well as to network/network management theory, and to the Advocacy Coalition Framework/policy subsystem theory. It also contributes to understanding two strategically chosen, embedded cases within the broader case study of political decision-making in the wind power policy process in Sweden...|$|R

25|$|With minor rearrangements {{over the}} years, the 1935 reforms have ruled the Texas Rangers' {{organization}} until present day. Hiring new members, {{which had been}} largely a <b>political</b> <b>decision,</b> was achieved {{through a series of}} examinations and merit evaluations. Promotion relied on seniority and performance in the line of duty. More sophisticated means of crime fighting were put at their disposal, like automobiles, advanced weaponry and forensics. By the late 1930s, the Rangers had one of the best crime labs in the United States at the Headquarters Division in Austin. The appointment of Colonel Homer Garrison in September 1938 as director of the DPS proved decisive as well. Under his leadership, many respected captains such as Manuel T. Gonzaullas worked extensively to restore the good name of the force that had been compromised in the previous decades, keeping it in line with its traditions within a modern and civilized society and regaining its high status. The number of commissioned officers grew and the Rangers developed a clear detective function, while the Highway Patrol took charge of direct law enforcement duties.|$|E
25|$|It was a <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> {{to deprive}} local {{authorities}} {{of the resources}} needed to provide an adequate service. Local authority budgets have been cut by 40% {{as a result of}} the 2010 austerity budget of the Conservative Coalition Government, and the fire service cuts have resulted in 11,000 fewer firefighters. The building inspection regime is under pressure as mandatory competition between Local Authority Building Control and private approved inspectors was introduced to drive down costs. This impacts on quality. Local authority budget cuts have led to fewer building control inspectors and fewer planning inspectors and also the recommendations of a coroner’s report into the Lakanal House tower block fire in Southwark in 2009 has not been acted on nor have building regulations been overhauled. The responsibility for fire safety checks had been switched from the fire brigade onto building owners for similar cost cutting reasons, by the previous Blair government. Southwark council was fined £570,000 for fire safety offences following the 2009 Lakanal House fire, where six people died. Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn brought this to the attention of the House. He said these “terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners” stemmed from a “disregard for working-class communities”.|$|E
25|$|Football {{has been}} played in Magdeburg {{since the end}} of the 19th century. On 15 June 1896 SV Victoria 96 Magdeburg was founded, a club that had its best days before World War II, when it participated in the German {{championship}} finals on several occasions. Later the club participated in the Gauliga Mitte. After World War II, all sports clubs in the Soviet Occupation Zone were dissolved and a number of smaller clubs were created, which at first competed at a local and regional level. In 1945 players from the disbanded clubs Magdeburger SC Prussia 1899 and Cricket Viktoria Magdeburg formed Sportgruppe (SG) Sudenburg. This club and SG Lemsdorf came together as the sports club BSG Eintracht Sudenburg, which in turn merged with SAG Krupp Gruson in 1950. The next year the club was renamed BSG Stahl Magdeburg, and then in 1952, became BSG Motor Mitte Magdeburg in 1952. In 1957 the football department of Motor Mitte was moved to SC Aufbau Magdeburg, a <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> with the goal of achieving higher standards of performance. In 1965, the football department was again broken out of SC Aufbau and a football-only club was created, 1. FC Magdeburg. This was part of a general– again politically motivated– movement in East Germany towards football-only clubs with the goal of achieving higher standards. 1. FC Magdeburg is the oldest of the football clubs created in this period.|$|E
