5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton {{went on to}} say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> move around and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|The name Buttercross {{originates}} {{from their}} location in market <b>places,</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> from neighbouring villages would gather around the market cross to buy locally produced products. The fresh produce {{was laid out}} and displayed on the stepped bases of the cross. The market in Dunster attracted people from surrounding villages and towns {{as far away as}} Taunton and Bodmin. The Dunster Butter Cross was erected in the late 14th or early 15th century and originally stood in the High Street, possibly {{at the southern end of}} the high street, near the Yarn Market. A cross, which was later known as the high cross, was recorded in 1461; by 1689 it was known as the Butter Cross.|$|E

Moreover, the increasing number of procedures that were once only available in hospitals are now in physicians' offices.

25|$|Societal {{acceptance}} of non-heterosexual orientations such as homosexuality is lowest in Asian and African countries, and is highest in Europe, Australia, and the Americas. Western society {{has become increasingly}} accepting of homosexuality {{over the past few}} decades. In 2017, Professor Amy Adamczyk contended that these cross-national differences in acceptance can be largely explained by three factors: the relative strength of democratic institutions, the level of economic development, and the religious context of the <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> live.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from his}} mother, Al Saher's family were never {{supportive}} of his direction {{in becoming a}} musician.

Saher's brother once took him to different <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> usually sang, and told him it's your choice to sing a respectful way or you can choose to do it the bad way.

25|$|The Teatro Principal {{was built}} at the city’s height when {{the wealth of the}} mines {{attracted}} entertainers. It was the first theater in the city, built in Neoclassical style {{and one of the few}} <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> of different social strata could enter. The theater closed periodically during its early history due to sociopolitical upheavals. After the Mexican Revolution, it was converted into a movie theater. Shortly after this, it suffered a fire and closed for 30 years. Today, it is reconstructed and run by the University of Guanajuato as one of the main venues of the Festival Cervantino.|$|E
25|$|The University of Hertfordshire holds over 450 artworks in its art collection.

This reflects the University of Hertfordshire's determination to provide not only an attractive education setting but also one which will inform, enlighten and enhance the life of its students, staff and the local community. The UH Art Collection was established in 1952, as part of Hertfordshire Country Council's commitment to the post-war programme. The collection has a diverse portfolio including photography, textile, ceramics, sculpture, mixed media and works by Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Andy Goldsworthy, Alan Davie, and Diane MacLean.|$|E
25|$|Motion {{pictures}} {{have been}} {{an important aspect of}} urban culture since 1910. The <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> have watched films, from the nickelodeon to the multiplex, have changed in ways that reflect changes in the society generally. The cinema in Edmonton reflected the changing urban landscape. Because the movie houses themselves are part of the entertainment product, the cinema industry follows a cycle of construction, renovation, and demolition. The industry's face is constantly changing in an effort to draw people inside; Edmonton's cinemas have moved with the retail industry from the downtown core to the suburban shopping malls, and are now experimenting with new formats similar to retailers' big boxes. Just as Edmonton is known for massive amounts of retail space, it also {{has one of the highest}} numbers of movie screens in Canada in proportion to its population. Cinemas are thus a revealing aspect of trends in urban development.|$|E

25|$|Though often mistaken as such, {{underwater}} archaeology is {{not restricted to}} the study of shipwrecks. Changes in sea level because of local seismic events such as the earthquakes that devastated Port Royal and Alexandria or more widespread climatic changes on a continental scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged. At {{the end of the last}} ice age, the North Sea was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as mammoths, are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of crannogs, bridges and harbours) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater archaeological sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising sea levels; wells, cenotes, wrecks (shipwrecks; aircraft); the remains of structures created in water (such as crannogs, bridges or harbours); other port-related structures; refuse or debris sites where people disposed of their waste, garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by dumping into the water.|$|E

500|$|The team {{chose to}} centre {{the game on}} firefighters as they felt that fire was the most {{appropriate}} way to create fear and tension. In a retrospective interview, Ohshima said {{that many of the}} things done by firefighters—along with rescuing people—were [...] "the very essence of a Sonic Team game", and that they recognised that a firefighter was a hero with whom people could identify. The team wanted to make a game with a rescue theme as Naka thought there were few games based on that concept. According to Takeo Miyoshi, [...] "Our first inspiration came from the explosion and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." [...] The developers wanted to design a future that was [...] "clean and beautiful", with sustainable energy, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them.

Three {{of the four}} noble hostages that had remained in Asilah (separately from Ferdinand in Fez) – João Gomes de Avelar, Pedro de Ataíde and Aires da Cunha – died of the plague at this time. (In a curious note, when the Moroccans asked Ferdinand how Christians dealt with the plague, Ferdinand replied that [...] "they removed themselves from <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>people</b> were dying of it", a reply which was reportedly received with derisive laughter.)
