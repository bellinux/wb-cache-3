5000|$|About 14 {{months after}} the Geneva interim {{agreement}} was signed, Obama reiterated his assessment that the chances to [...] "get a diplomatic deal are probably less than 50/50." [...] Shortly afterwards, in his State of the Union presented to {{a joint session of}} the United States Congress, the President announced: [...] "Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, {{for the first time in}} a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material." [...] The accuracy of this statement has been challenged by some media sources. For example, based on experts' assessments Glenn Kessler from <b>The</b> Washington <b>Post</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to <b>the</b> conclusion that between 2013 and 2014 the amount of nuclear material, which could be converted by Iran to a bomb, has been increased. Olli Heinonen observed that the interim agreement [...] "is just a step to create negotiation space; nothing more. It is not a viable longer term situation." [...] Jeffrey Lewis observed that Obama's statement was an oversimplification, and that while Iran's stockpiles of the [...] "most dangerous" [...] nuclear materials had declined, overall stocks had increased.|$|R
