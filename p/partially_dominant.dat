5000|$|There is a mutant form of {{aldehyde}} dehydrogenase, termed ALDH2*2, wherein a lysine residue replaces a glutamate in {{the active}} site at position 487 of ALDH2. [...] Homozygous individuals with the mutant allele have almost no ALDH2 activity, and those heterozygous for the mutation have reduced activity. Thus, the mutation is <b>partially</b> <b>dominant.</b> The ineffective homozygous allele works {{at a rate of}} about 8% of the normal allele, for it shows a higher km for NAD+ and has a higher maximum velocity than the wild-type allele. [...] This mutation is common in Japan, where 41% of a non-alcoholic control group were ALDH2 deficient, where only 2-5% of an alcoholic group were ALDH2-deficient. In Taiwan, the numbers are similar, with 30% of the control group showing the deficiency and 6% of alcoholics displaying it. [...] The deficiency is manifested by slow acetaldehyde removal, with low alcohol tolerance perhaps leading to a lower frequency of alcoholism.|$|E

In particular, the bias toward the fixation of dominant or <b>partially</b> <b>dominant</b> beneficialmutations predicted under outcrossing (Haldane’s sieve) is expected to be reduced under self-fertilization. To test this prediction in plants, we considered domestication as an example of adaptation. We compiled data from studies reporting the degree of dominance of quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in the domestication syndrome. We found that adaptation to cultivation mostly proceeded through the selection of recessive and partially recessive genes in predominantly selfing species whereas a much larger fraction of domestication-related QTL were dominant or <b>partially</b> <b>dominant</b> in outcrossers, as expected under Haldane’s sieve. Our study also showed that levels of dominance in mixed mating crop species resemble those observed in selfers, suggesting that recessive alleles can contribute to adaptation even under moderate selfing rates.

40|$|Human and nonhuman {{primates}} exhibit flexible behavior. Functional, anatomical, and lesion {{studies indicate}} that the lateral fronta cortex (LFC) plays {{a pivotal role in}} such behavior. LFC consists of distinct subregions exhibiting distinct connectivity patterns that possibly relate to functional specializations. Inference about the border of each subregion in the human brain is performed with the aid of macroscopic landmarks and/or cytoarchitectonic parcellations extrapolated in a stereotaxic system. However, the high interindividual variability, the limited availability of cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps, and the absence of robust functional localizers render the in vivo delineation and examination of the LFC subregions challenging. In this study, we use resting state fMRI for the in vivo parcellation of the human LFC on a subjectwise and data-driven manner. This approach succeeds in uncovering neuroanatomically realistic subregions, with potential anatomical substrates including BA 46, 44, 45, 9 and related (sub) divisions. Ventral LFC subregions exhibit different functional connectivity (FC), which can account for different contributions in the language domain, while more dorsal adjacent subregions mark a transition to visuospatial/sensorimotor networks. Dorsal LFC subregions participate in known large-scale networks obeying an external/internal information processing dichotomy. Furthermore, we raced "families" of LFC subregions organized along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axis with distinct functional networks also encompassing specialized cingulate divisions. Similarities with the connectivity of macaque candidate homologs were observed, such as the premotor affiliation of presumed BA 46.

Bacteria (micrococci) and peptidoglycan (PGN) induced transcription of IL- 8 in HEK 293 cells expressing Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) and CD 14 but not in those expressing TLR 1 or TLR 4. A mutation within the NF-κB site in the IL- 8 promoter abrogated transcriptional induction of IL- 8 by the two stimulants. Dominant negative myeloid differentiation protein (MyD 88), IL- 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK), and IκB kinase (IKK) mutant forms completely inhibited micrococcus- and PGN-induced activation of NF-κB and expression of the gene for IL- 8.

40|$|Abstract—Amblyopia or “lazy ” eye is a {{disorder}} {{of the visual}} system that causes poor vision in an eye that is otherwise physically normal, and it affects 2 - 3 % of the population, which equates to conservatively around 10 million people {{under the age of}} 8 years worldwide. Amblyopia is a neurologically active process: the problem is caused by either no transmission or poor transmission of the visual stimulation through the optic nerve to the brain. With time, if no treatment is performed, the weak eye becomes even weaker and the other eye becomes dominant. Amblyopia is classically treated by clarifying the visual image with glasses, and patching (totally or <b>partially)</b> the <b>dominant</b> eye in order to force the use of the amblyopic eye. Patching suffers from several problems: it is unpopular, prolonged, and it can sometimes disrupts any residual fusion between the visions of the eyes. This results often in noncompliance with the therapy. Several alternatives have been introduced, including partial occlusion and vision rebalancing in which the image to the lazy eye is enhanced and the image to the good eye is penalized. We present how a 3 D technology can be used to realize a system for vision rebalancing of video clips which exploits the stereo vision of the 3 D system. This technology is relatively inexpensive, easy to use also in a domestic environment, with recreational activities enjoyable by the children, and easy to extend. We have implemented a prototype software system which processes a video and sends a penalized version to the good eye and an enhanced version to the lazy eye. We use a “framesever ” for runtime video processing and several image filters and meta-filters to obtain the final video to be viewed by the patient. We argue for the viability of the proposed method in the treatment of amblyopic children. Keywords-Amblyopia treatment, virtual rehabilitation, 3 D, video rebalancing, partial occlusion I...|$|R

40|$|Polyploidy {{has played}} an {{important}} role in higher plant evolution and applied plant breeding. Polyploids are commonly categorized as allopolyploids resulting from the increase of chromosome number through hybridization and subsequent chromosome doubling or autopolyploids due to chromosome doubling of the same genome. Allopolyploids undergo bivalent pairing at meiosis because only homologous chromosomes pair. For autopolyploids, however, all homologous chromosomes can pair at the same time so that multivalents and, therefore, double reductions are formed. In this article, we use a maximum-likelihood method to develop a general polyploid model for estimating gene segregation patterns from molecular markers in a full-sib family derived from an arbitrary polyploid combining meiotic behaviors of both bivalent and multivalent pairings. Two meiotic parameters, one describing the preference of homologous chromosome pairing (expressed as the preferential pairing factor) typical of allopolyploids and the other specifying the degree of double reduction of autopolyploids, are estimated. The type of molecular markers used can be fully informative vs. <b>partially</b> informative or <b>dominant</b> vs. codominant. Simulation studies show that our polyploid model is well suited to estimate the preferential pairing factor and the frequency of double reduction at meiosis, which should help to characterize gene segregation in the progeny of autopolyploids. The implications of this model for linkage mapping, population genetic studies, and polyploid classification are discussed...|$|R

Double reduction casts an impact on chromosome evolution in higher plants, but because of its confounded effect on the pattern of gene cosegregation, it complicates linkage analysis and map construction with polymorphic molecular markers. In this article, we have proposed a general statistical model for simultaneously estimating the frequencies of double reduction, the recombination fraction, and optimal parental linkage phases between any types of markers, both fully and <b>partially</b> informative, or <b>dominant</b> and codominant, for a tetraploid species that undergoes only multivalent pairing. This model provides an in-depth extension of our earlier linkage model that was built upon Fisher's classifications for different gamete formation modes during the polysomic inheritance of a multivalent polyploid. By implementing a two-stage hierarchical EM algorithm, we derived a closed-form solution for estimating the frequencies of double reduction through the estimation of gamete mode frequencies and the recombination fraction. We performed different settings of simulation studies to demonstrate the statistical properties of our model for estimating and testing double reduction and the linkage in multivalent tetraploids. As shown by a comparative analysis, our model provides a general framework that covers existing statistical approaches for linkage mapping in polyploids that are predominantly multivalent. The model will have great implications for understanding the genome structure and organization of polyploid species...|$|R

The analysis finds a negative linear relationship between temporary contracts and labor productivity and a predominantly positive concave downward curve between temporary contracts and gross operating margin. This curvilinear relationship is especially stronger when the proportion of indirect temporary contracts is low, and it is found that the use of temporary contracts has a positive effect on gross operating margin, but this effect becomes negative with overuse.

The results show that: (1) there are genes, other than Adh, that affect the levels of ADH activity; (2) at least some of these "regulatory" genes are located on the third chromosome, and thus are not adjacent to the Adh locus; (3) variation exists in natural populations for such regulatory genes; (4) the effect of these regulatory genes varies as they interact with different second chromosomes; (5) third chromosomes with high-activity genes are either <b>partially</b> or completely <b>dominant</b> over chromosomes with low-activity genes; (6) the effects of the regulatory genes are pervasive throughout development; and (7) the third chromosome genes regulate the levels of ADH activity by affecting the number of ADH molecules in the flies. The results are consistent with the view that the evolution of regulatory genes may play an important role in adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Nerve {{activity}} controls fiber {{size and}} fiber type in skeletal muscle, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We have previously shown that Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase and calcineurin control fiber type but not fiber size in regenerating rat skeletal muscle. Here {{we report that}} constitutively active protein kinase B (PKB), also known as Akt, increases fiber size and prevents denervation atrophy in regenerating and adult rat muscles but does not affect fiber type profile. The coexistence of hypertrophic muscle fibers overexpressing activated PKB with normal-size untransfected fibers within the same muscle points to a cell-autonomous control of muscle growth by PKB. The physiological role of this pathway is confirmed by the finding that PKB kinase activity and phosphorylation status are significantly increased in innervated compared with denervated regenerating muscles in parallel with muscle growth. Muscle fiber hypertrophy induced by activated PKB and by a Ras double mutant (RasV 12 C 40) that activates selectively the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase–PKB pathway is completely blocked by rapamycin, showing that the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase is the major downstream effector of this pathway in the control of muscle fiber size. On the other hand, nerve activity-dependent growth of regenerating muscle is only <b>partially</b> inhibited by <b>dominant</b> negative PKB and rapamycin, suggesting that other nerve-dependent signaling pathways are involved in muscle growth. The present results {{support the notion that}} fiber size and fiber type are regulated by nerve activity through different mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Background: Weak {{monitoring}} and evaluation (M&E) systems and limited supply of M&E human resources in Africa signal the need to strengthen M&E capacity. Objectives: This exploratory study evaluated the effect of short course training on professionals’ knowledge and skills {{in the areas of}} mixed methods research, systematic review and meta-analysis and general principles of M&E. Methods: A <b>partially</b> mixed concurrent <b>dominant</b> status design including quantitative (multilevel modelling and meta-analyses) and qualitative (thematic content analysis) components was employed to evaluate the impact of a 4 -day short course training focusing on these areas. Results: Thirty-five participants participated in the training. Participants experienced an increase in knowledge in the three areas; however, average change in knowledge did not differ across participants’ employment settings. Participants’ self-stated objectives considered as SMART and belonging to a higher level in Bloom’s taxonomy were associated with change in knowledge. Based on comments made by participants, majority intended to apply what they learned to their work; clarity of content delivery was the most liked aspect of the training, and the use of more practical sessions was recommended as a way to improve the training. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of potential of the use of short course training as an approach to strengthening capacity in M&E in less-developed countries such as Kenya. It underscores the importance of participants’ self-stated objective(s) as an element to be considered in the enhancement of knowledge, attitudes and skills needed for acceptable capacity building in M&E...|$|R
