50|$|Atari Punk console is an astable {{square wave}} {{oscillator}} driving a monostable oscillator {{that creates a}} single (square) pulse. There are two controls, one for {{the frequency of the}} oscillator and one to control the width of the pulse. The controls are usually potentiometers but the circuit can also be controlled by light, temperature, pressure etc. by replacing a potentiometer with a suitable sensor (e.g., <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> for light sensitivity). Most of the time there is also a power switch (often a toggle switch) and a volume knob. The circuit is a simple DIY noisemaker circuit that is relatively inexpensive and easy to build, easily adaptable and is configurable in many ways. It has been built into a wide variety of cases, from metal IKEA bowls to light bulbs, an old Atari mouse or joystick. Its flexibility has led to wide scale popularity among electronics enthusiasts. It is often suggested as a good circuit to build for beginners.|$|E

Grease deposition in kitchen exhaust ducts is an imminent fire hazard. There exists {{the need to}} quantize and measure the amount of grease deposition in a commercial kitchen exhaust duct in a cheap and efficient manner. Results from a real cooking emission study (ASHRAE 1375 -RP) were used to model grease deposition onto a cylinder. Simulated cooking experiments were performed using a 200 : 1 ratio of non volatiles: uranine using a Polydisperse Aerosol Generator (PAG). The use of a cylinder in cross flow with a strain gage arrangement and a LED-photo resistor arrangement on two opposite walls of a 0 : 254 m by 0 : 203 m (10 inches by 8 inches) duct at two exhaust velocities namely 2 : 54 m/s (500 ft/min) and 7 : 62 m/s (1500 ft/min) were investigated. The size distributions obtained by the simulated cooking experiments were similar to that obtained in the ASHRAE 1375 -RP study. The modeling results were within a factor of 1 : 5 of the simulated cooking results. This is reasonable considering the complexities of actual grease deposits. The <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> was very sensitive to minute changes of grease deposition layers. It would be beneficial to inspect the output signal of the <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> for greater thickness of grease deposits. The strain gage technique did not prove successful to measure grease deposition inside a duct due to the constant vibrations. Deposition results obtained flurometrically showed that deposition flux on to a cylinder placed in cross flow and all four walls of the duct increases with increasing exhaust velocity. Deposition flux on the windows for the LED and the <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> were {{in close proximity to}} the deposition flux on the two side walls. Correlations were developed for particle deposition on all four walls of the duct. Flow Reynolds number has a major impact on particle deposition in large exhaust ducts. A different approach is required in representing deposition results in terms of non dimensional parameters...|$|E

In this method, the sun angle tracking is utilized to track, and tracking solar panels reach the altitude angle azimuth tracking position. Then four voltage signals of <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> sensors is used to compare the north-south direction and east-west direction respectively, in order to micro adjust the solar panels to getting same point voltage, enabling to achieve accurate sunlight tracking and positioning.

40|$|We {{have started}} from a {{pedagogical}} research concerning {{the opportunity of}} the introduction of studying the photo devices like photovoltaic cells, <b>photo</b> <b>resistors,</b> photodiodes, phototransistors, etc, in the Romanian Curriculum for Physics in high school. So, we have started a group project, with students from the 10 -th grade, from Grigore Moisil High School, Bucharest, the teachers, {{the parents of the}} students and the local community. At the beginning we intended to familiarize the students with such devices and their applications in order to perform the theoretical study. During this stage of the research the students helped by the teachers and parents made some simple applications like solar house, solar lift, solar power station for toy car chargers. A new problem appears: the photovoltaic cells have to be moved under maximum solar illumination for reaching a great efficiency. How? By recycling some servomotors from the old printers of the school, then innovate a way of coupling them with the PV cell. The next step is to use some sensors of light (<b>photo</b> <b>resistors</b> coupled with a data acquisition board and a computer) for decide when to change the incline of the PV cells and then to develop the software for analyzing the sensors indications, make the decision and move the servomotor. The great challenge will be to construct a solar gusher fountain which will be held in the yard of the school. The aspects from the activities o...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{describe}} {{the architecture of}} a heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to be deployed on coastal sand dunes: {{the aim is to}} provide real time measurements of physical parameters to better define sediment transport in connection with aeolian processes. The WSN integrates different typologies of sensors and is provided with both local and remote connection. In particular, three different typologies of sensors are integrated in the network: a multilayer anemometric station, a sensor developed ad-hoc to measure the sand dune level and a sand collector capable of measuring the weight of trapped sand and its quantity. Each sensor node is composed at least by an XBee Series 2 transmission module that is able to transmit the data collected by the sensor at a distance of about 100 meters: while the sand level sensor and the sand collector are provided only with this transmission module, the anemometric station also integrates an Arduino Uno board in charge of data processing. A Gateway node composed by an Arduino Uno Board integrated with a GMS Shield for remote data transmission and an XBee transmission module for Local Area communication has also been developed: this node is in charge of collecting all the data packets sent by the Sensor Nodes and transmit them to a remote server through GPRS connection. A Glassfish server has been set up to collect these packets and store them in a MySQL database. The anemometric station is composed by three anemometer/anemoscope couples positioned 40 cm, 120 cm and 200 cm from the ground. During the tests, the station data were sampled every 20 minutes, wind speed and direction was calculated directly on the Arduino Uno Board and then a packet composed by the six data (three speeds and three directions) was sent to the Gateway. The sand level sensor is composed by an array of 24 <b>photo</b> <b>resistors</b> (LDRs) mounted on a plastic tube 5 cm apart from each other (reaching a total length of 120 cm). Sunk LDRs do not sense sun light and send a 0 value. Surfacing LDRs detect sunlight and send a higher value. By counting sunk LDRs it is possible to measure the current level of the dune. During the tests, the sensor was sampled once per hour, three data packets were sent every time, each packet with the reading of 8 LDRs; the level value was calculated on the Gateway before being transmitted to the remote server. The sand collector is mainly a plastic cylinder about one meter high, able to orientate according to the wind direction. The wind-blown sand flows inside the cylinder and is collected on its bottom, where the load cell can measure weight variations. During the tests, the sensor was sampled once per hour, the value of the Load Cell was transmitted to the Gateway that calculated the sand weight before transmitting this value to the remote server. The proposed WSN can provide both a static and a dynamic framework of sand transport processes acting on coastal dunes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Biosensors are {{analytical}} {{tools for}} the analysis of bio-material samples to gain an understanding of their biocomposition, structure and function by converting a biological response into an electrical signal. Wearable Biosensors (WBS) are the biosensors which can be worn on the body. Recent advancements in miniature devices have fostered a dramatic growth of interest of wearable technology. Wearable Biosensors such as Ring Sensor will permit continuous cardiovascular (CV) monitoring in a number of novel settings. Thus Real-time, continuous monitoring would allow not only for emergency detection but also for long-term assessment to establish the right dose and timing of medication. One type of WBS called the Smart Shirt typically relies on the information provided by the wireless, miniature sensors enclosed in shirt. The vital signals and information gathered by the various sensors on the body travels through the smart shirt controller for processing, from these, the computed vital signals are wirelessly transmitted to the monitoring station. WBS could {{play an important role in}} the wireless surveillance of people during hazardous operations such as military, firefighting, etc or such sensors could be dispensed during a mass civilian casualty occurrence. WBS’s take advantage of handheld units to temporarily store physiological data and then periodically upload that data to a database server via wireless LAN that allow internet connection and used for clinical diagnosis.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} thesis, {{industrial}} product design PPU 304, {{is to develop a}} new product that will reduce food waste of dairy products in households. The main objective is that the product will be able to measure and signal when the milk has expired. The thesis is a start to find the solution to some of the food waste in households which is a major environmental issue in today's society. The goal is to develop a flexible expiration date that can reduce food wastage. With today's sensor technology bacterial levels can be calculated from the milk and that can increase the time a pack of milk can be used. The greater knowledge and awareness humanity have for environmental issues the better world we will live in. To understand the question, “what is it that makes the milk unfit for consumption?” A part of the work has gone into researching the technological aspect. In consumer ready milk there is different bacteria that will grow over time and eventually spoil the milk, how this process works varies depending on what or which bacteria manage to grow the most. Therefore, the most appropriate technique is to measure bacteria in the milk and identify at which level the milk passes its actual expiration date. The design of the product has been guided by two major factors, the predetermined dimensions of the circuit board and the adaptation {{to the size of the}} milk carton. The shape of the product is an oblong rear part with a spherical body at the front. The edges are rounded to give a pleasantand smooth feeling to the hand using the product. The thesis in {{industrial product}} design resulted in a final concept. The product analyses the amount of bacteria in the milk through sensors that measure bacterial metabolism. The data gets interpreted and displayed through the use of LEDs. To save energy the concept is equipped with a <b>photo</b> <b>resistor</b> that deactivates the LEDs when the fridge is closed and dark. The conclusion of the thesis, performed at Millcroft AB is at a conceptual level. To go from idea to product, is a process that takes a long time to complete and often involves many different moments. The timeframe during this study is considered too short to cover all parts of the product and therefore the boundaries set and the focus has been on constructing a design that fits the estimated technology as well as consumer needs. Some suggestions are that more research in the technical aspect of the product should be concluded. Further testing of dairy sustainability should be conducted on a larger scale and further development of the technology to send data...|$|E
