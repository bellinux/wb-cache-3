A ride across this island is a constant succession of pictures, whose wild and solitary beauty entirely distances all power of description. The magnificence of the evergreen forests,--their peculiar air of sombre stillness,--the rich intermingling ever and anon of groves of birch, beech, and oak, in picturesque <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> <b>tufts,</b> as if set for effect by some skillful landscape-gardener,--produce a sort of strange dreamy wonder; while the sea, breaking forth both on the right hand and the left of the road into the most romantic glimpses, seems to flash and glitter like some strange gem which every moment shows itself through the framework of a new setting. Here and there little secluded coves push in from the sea, around which lie soft tracts of green meadow-land, hemmed in and guarded by rocky pine-crowned ridges. In such sheltered spots may be seen neat white houses, nestling like sheltered doves in the beautiful solitude.|$|R

Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to make clear the relation of three-dimensional grain orientation surrounding <b>knots</b> to machinability <b>and</b> surface properties. However, {{it is very difficult to}} measure three dimensional grain angle of knots, machinability of <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> the area having the grain deviation around <b>knots,</b> <b>and</b> surface properties. And thus the major objective of this study is to obtain several basic information on machinability of knots. In this paper, cutting types of knots based on the cutting surface of <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> the cutting direction of the knife is classified. And using its classification, the effects of the grain orientation of knots upon the cutting characteristics of knots are discussed...|$|R

We show that such a knot or link is a 2 -bridge or a Montesinos knot or link or the connected sum of the Hopf link and a 2 -bridge knot. C. C. Adams [1] and M. Sakuma and J.

We present here several known and new randomized models of <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> links. We review the main known results on the knot distribution in each model. We discuss the nature of these models and the properties of the knots they produce. Of particular interest to us are finite type invariants of random <b>knots,</b> <b>and</b> the recently studied Petaluma model. We report on rigorous results and numerical experiments concerning the asymptotic distribution of such knot invariants.
