40|$|As DIS {{exercises}} are scaled up, {{it has been}} estimated that a large portion of entity state traffic will be due to the transmit timeout, also known as the "heartbeat" or "keep alive". These updates that are sent because a <b>protocol</b> <b>timer</b> has expired, not because there is new information to communicate. This redundant traffic wastes processing and communication resources and is one factor that limits the scaleability of the DIS protocol. This paper explores three approaches to eliminating these redundant transmissions and has significant implications for the DIS protocols as well as the distributed simulation architecture. 1. INTRODUCTION Simulations participating in a distributed simulation exercise must share a consistent view of the simulated world state. The shared state must be consistent across simulations, within some tolerance, despite data lost in transmission.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} use of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol for use within the future Airborne Network. OSPF is one of the standards-based routing {{protocols}} that could be used within the Airborne Network. However, given the fading characteristics of airborne line-of-sight (LOS) channels, OSPF may not be as effective {{as it is in the}} commercial terrestrial Internet. Therefore, some modification of OSPF timer settings, most notably the “Hello ” <b>protocol</b> <b>timers,</b> may be necessary to enable OSPF to be useful for airborne networking. Our experiments, which examined the effects of OSPF settings in an Airborne Network environment, demonstrate that configuring the settings to provide faster convergence can reduce the traffic loss by up to 80 %. Average packet latency and average packet jitter were not significantly affected by the changes to the OSPF timers. It will be important for the Airborne Network to consider connectivity interruptions when configuring a routing protocol to limit data losses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Opportunistic {{selection}} in multi-node wireless sys-tems improves system performance by selecting the “best ” node and by {{using it for}} data transmission. In these systems, each node has a real-valued local metric, which {{is a measure of}} its ability to improve system performance. Our goal is to identify the best node, which has the largest metric. We propose, analyze, and optimize a new distributed, yet simple, node selection scheme that combines the timer scheme with power control. In it, each node sets a timer and transmit power level as a function of its metric. The power control is designed such that the best node is captured even if η other nodes simultaneously transmit with it. We develop several structural properties about the optimal metric-to-timer-and-power mapping, which maximizes the prob-ability of selecting the best node. These significantly reduce the computational complexity of finding the optimal mapping and yield valuable insights about it. We show that the proposed scheme is scalable and significantly outperforms the conventional timer scheme. We investigate the effect of η and the number of receive power levels. Furthermore, we find that the practical peak power constraint has a negligible impact on the performance of the scheme.

40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} {{form of the}} ARQ selective repeat <b>protocol</b> with <b>timer</b> control is studied. Transmissions on both the forward and the reverse channels are assumed to experience Markovian errors and therefore the feedback is unreliable. Feedback error recovery is made possible {{through the use of}} time diversity. Using results from renewal theory, exact results for the throughput of the protocol are evaluated. In order to overcome the complexity of the exact analytical technique, lower and upper bounds are developed. Simulation results, that confirm the analysis and document the tightness of the bounds are also shown, and a number of implementation issues are discussed. An application to mobile radio is also presented.

40|$|Internet is {{emerging}} as the main platform for communications infrastructure, because several communication services are totally dependent on it. Communications services such as VoIP, video conferencing, etc. require real time assurance on reliability and availability. However, due to limitations in the inter domain routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP- 4), the performance of Internet is adversely affected. Significant {{research has been done}} by researchers to overcome these limitations and to control the BGP path exploration. But ISPs are cautious about introducing these new mechanisms under the assumption of extensive changes to deployment. Therefore, enhancements and extensions to well known existing routing protocols are desirable rather than introducing new routing protocols. In this paper, we have aimed at reviewing the routing protocol parameters to enhance their behavior which in turn enables increased performance of Internet by decreasing the convergence period. Based on simulation results, we have proposed some mechanisms to improve BGP convergence duration. Our simulation results show that careful tuning of routing protocol attributes namely (a) Interior Gateway <b>Protocol</b> (IGP) <b>timers</b> (b) BGP timers, can improve the convergence duration without affecting stability.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{reduction}} congruence, {{a popular}} notion of process equality, for the asynchronous π-calculus with timers, and derive several alternative characterisations, {{one of them}} being a labelled asynchronous bisimilarity.

The π-calculus has been used to good effect as a tool for modelling and reasoning about computation [6, 7, 18, 23, 26]. Unfortunately, it appears incomplete for compositional representation and verification of distributed systems.

40|$|Abstract — The {{error prone}} nature of {{wireless}} links often necessitates {{the use of}} a link layer protocol to ensure acceptable application performance. While traditional link layers assume that they fully control the link, in most emerging wireless networks many sessions may dynamically share the link due to the presence of multiple contending users and/or applications. Such networks require link layers that can automatically adapt to bandwidth variations, offering good performance regardless of contention. To this end, we discuss two adaptive protocols, an Adaptive Selective Repeat (ASR) protocol that dynamically modifies its retransmission timeouts, and the Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol used by UMTS, an advanced <b>protocol</b> without retransmission <b>timers.</b> To assess the applicability of each approach, we measure the throughput achieved by File Transfer and Web Browsing over both protocols, with or without contention from a Media Distribution application, as well as the delay induced by these protocols to the contending application. Our results indicate that the complexity of RLC is not justified by its performance, as ASR nearly always outperforms it. I...|$|R

SIP (session initiation protocol) {{that is an}} application layer control induces management and terminates this kind of sessions.

Mechanism of Retransmission that is embedded in SIP could compensate for the missing packet loss, in case of need. This mechanism is applied when SIP messages are transmitted on an unreliable transmission layer protocol like UDP. Also, while facing SIP proxy with overload, it could cause excessive filling of proxy queue, postpone increase of other contacts, and add to the amount of the proxy overload. In the present work, while using UDP as transport layer <b>protocol,</b> invite retransmission <b>timer</b> (T 1) was appropriately regulated and SIP functionality was improved.
