All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.|$|E
25|$|Dioxins (most {{notably the}} polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) are {{chemicals}} that are produced when chlorinated products are burned, such as <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> (<b>PVC).</b> This occurs when chlorinated products {{are used in}} certain manufacturing industries. Dioxins are also added to the air when gasoline and diesel fuels break down. Dioxins are able to bioaccumulate, meaning that they settle and stay in human and animal fat {{for long periods of}} time. There are many different types of dioxins and only a few of them have been labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as definite human carcinogens and endocrine hormone disruptors. Although dioxins are floating in the air, they eventually settle on plants and other vegetation surfaces. These plants and vegetation are them eaten by cows and other animals. Humans end up eating the produce, milk, eggs, and meat produced by these animals that have consumed dioxin covered vegetation. Dioxins are more harmful when ingested this way. Multiple studies have led to the idea that increased dioxin levels can increase one's risk for breast cancer. A study done in 1976 after a chemical plant explosion in Seveso, Italy concluded that high dioxin level exposure in a woman's body correlated with a more than double chance of developing breast cancer.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{concentrates}} on <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride)</b> - <b>PVC</b> - {{from the point}} of view of structural characterisation of PVC/clay nanocomposites through X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic rheometric analysis. PVC plasticizer was mixed with clay, natural and organophilic, and the suspension was then compounded with other components. Two factors were followed: effect of shearing alone, and in combination with temperature. The type of filler and the method of composite preparation affect the mechanical and thermal properties of the composite, through delamination and exfoliation levels. The results showed that the thermal degradation is shifted towards higher temperatures for organophilic clays, compared to chemically untreated natural clay. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A fire {{detector}} {{is the most}} important component in a fire alarm system. Herein, we present the feasibility of a highly sensitive and rapid response gas sensor based on metal oxides as a high performance {{fire detector}}. The glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique is used to make the highly porous structure such as nanocolumns (NCs) of various metal oxides for enhancing the gas-sensing performance. To measure the fire detection, the interface circuitry for our sensors (NiO, SnO 2, WO 3 and In 2 O 3 NCs) is designed. When all the sensors with various metal-oxide NCs are exposed to fire environment, they entirely react with the target gases emitted from <b>Poly(vinyl</b> <b>chlorides)</b> (<b>PVC)</b> decomposed at high temperature. Before the emission of smoke from the PVC (a hot-plate temperature of 200 °C), the resistances of the metal-oxide NCs are abruptly changed and SnO 2 NCs show the highest response of 2. 1. However, a commercial smoke detector did not inform any warning. Interestingly, although the NiO NCs are a p-type semiconductor, they show the highest response of 577. 1 after the emission of smoke from the PVC (a hot-plate temperature of 350 °C). The response time of SnO 2 NCs is much faster than that of a commercial smoke detector at the hot-plate temperature of 350 °C. In addition, we investigated the selectivity of our sensors by analyzing the responses of all sensors. Our results show the high potential of a gas sensor based on metal-oxide NCs for early fire detection...|$|R
