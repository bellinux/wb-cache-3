As one of the few American physicists with a deep understanding of the new field of quantum mechanics, he was hired by the University of California in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Bohr died {{of heart}} failure {{at his home in}} Carlsberg on 18 November 1962. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there. On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical <b>Physics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{founded the}} Institute of Theoretical <b>Physics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Copenhagen, {{now known as}} the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with {{physicists}} including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element bohrium was named after him.|$|E
5|$|Brode {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor of <b>physics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Berkeley, in 1927, and a full professor in 1932. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which enabled him to return to England and study at Cambridge University and Birkbeck College, University of London, in 1934 and 1935. While there, he became friends with the British physicist P.M.S. Blackett. He was impressed by Blackett's cloud chambers, and set his graduate students to work on projects using them, starting with Dale R. Corson.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{became a}} full {{professor}} at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, {{he returned to his}} alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical <b>physics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, in 1947, Anderson left Los Alamos and {{returned}} to teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, but her involvement in atomic physics led to {{an interest in the}} health effects of radiation. In 1949, she left teaching to begin a career in health <b>physics.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Health Physics Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which was only five years old when she joined, she became the first chief of education and training. She spent her career helping to establish the new training program in health physics, teaching and advising graduate fellows in health physics from 1949.|$|E
5|$|Franck {{became the}} Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became {{professor}} ordinarius of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental <b>Physics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Göttingen. While there {{he worked on}} quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.|$|E

5|$|He {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical <b>physics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> California Institute of Technology.|$|E
5|$|He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of <b>Physics</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E
