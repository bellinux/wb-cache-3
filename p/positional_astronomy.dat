40|$|The {{purpose of}} IAU Colloquium 180 was {{to prepare a}} series of resolutions re-garding the specication of the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) for {{consideration}} by Joint Discussion 2 at the XXIV IAU General Assembly. These resolutions provide denitions, standard algorithms, and parameters to link observable quantities with reference coordinates within the ICRS. Speci-cally recommended were denitions of the celestial intermediate pole and celes-tial ephemeris origin, an improved precession/nutation theory, and {{a new set of}} standard values for astronomical constants. These resolutions have far-reaching eects on <b>positional</b> and dynamical <b>astronomy.</b> IAU Colloquium 180, attended by 96 participants, was organized with 32 in-vited speakers and 44 poster papers.

50|$|Spherical {{astronomy}} or <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> is {{the branch}} of astronomy {{that is used to}} determine the location of objects on the celestial sphere, as seen at a particular date, time, and location on Earth. It relies on the mathematical methods of spherical geometry and the measurements of astrometry.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Harold Spencer Jones KBE FRS FRSE PRAS (29 March 1890 Kensington, London [...] - [...] 3 November 1960) was an English astronomer. He became renowned as an {{authority}} on <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> and served as Astronomer Royal for 23 years. Although born [...] "Jones", his surname became [...] "Spencer Jones".|$|E
50|$|He {{joined the}} Department of Meridian Astrometry of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1908, {{working as a}} {{secretary}} until 1912 when he became acting director. In 1915, he became director of the department. He also served as director of Dudley Observatory from 1912-1956. His primary work was in <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy,</b> particularly in the positions and motions of the stars.|$|E
50|$|Spencer Jones's astronomical work {{extended}} over {{a range of}} subjects. He specialised in <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy,</b> particularly the motion and orientation of the Earth in space. He also studied the motions of stars. He travelled to Minsk in Eastern Europe in 1914 to observe a total solar eclipse, departing during peacetime but returning {{after the start of}} the First World War.|$|E
5000|$|While δ {{is given}} in degrees (from +90° at the {{celestial}} north pole to −90° at the south pole), α is usually given in hours (0 ... 24h). This {{is due to the}} observation technique of star transits, which cross the field of view of telescope eyepieces because of Earth's rotation. The observation techniques are topics of <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> and of astrogeodesy.|$|E
5000|$|Abetti mainly {{worked in}} <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> and made many {{observations}} of minor planets, comets, and star occultations. In 1874 {{he was part}} of an expedition led by Pietro Tacchini to observe a transit of Venus with a spectroscope. [...] Later he became director of the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri and a professor at the University of Florence. He refurbished the observatory at Arcetri by installing a new telescope.|$|E
50|$|The Gill Medal {{is awarded}} by the Council of the Society for {{services}} to astronomy with special consideration to services in southern Africa. It {{was established in}} 1955 April and was first awarded in 1956 to Harold Knox Shaw.The Medal commemorates Sir David Gill, HM Astronomer at the Cape (1879-1907), renowned for his numerous researches, especially in <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> and geodesy, and {{for his part in}} consolidating astronomical science in Southern Africa.|$|E
5000|$|This {{minor planet}} {{was named after}} of South American {{astronomer}} Reinaldo Augusto Carestia (1932-1993), professor of <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> at UNSJ's School of Topography, publisher of 5 star catalogs, {{and member of the}} National Committee of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile. For decades, he worked with the Repsold Meridian Circle at the discovering Felix Aguilar Observatory. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 19 October 1994 (...)

5000|$|The {{claim was}} {{reported}} in Time and the CBS Evening News. It was included in Rod Serling's 1975 TV documentary In Search of Ancient Mysteries and, many years later, on George Noory's Coast to Coast AM radio show. The alleged message has been refuted [...] and in 1976 Lunan withdrew the theory, presenting proofs against it and clarifying what had led him to formulate it. However, in 1998 he re-interpreted part of it, claiming support from <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal of Jaipur, the {{monument}} features masonry, stone and brass instruments that were built using astronomy and instrument design principles of ancient Hindu Sanskrit texts. The instruments allow {{the observation of}} astronomical positions with the naked eye. The monument expresses architectural innovations, {{as well as the}} coming together of ideas from different religious and social beliefs in 18th-century India. The observatory {{is an example of the}} Ptolemaic <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> which was shared by many civilizations.|$|E
5000|$|This {{minor planet}} was named {{in honour of}} American {{astronomer}} Chester Burleigh Watts (1889-1971), a graduate of Indiana University. He worked at the United States Naval Observatory for 44 years, making distinguished contributions {{in the field of}} <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> and pioneered in the field of automation of transit circle observations, which led to results of the highest systematic accuracy. From the late 1940 until 1963 he meticulously mapped every feature on the marginal zone of the Moon. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center before November 1977 (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the driving}} force behind using the then-new Millstone radar at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory for the {{earliest}} work in radar astronomy. When it became operational in late 1957, Pettengill used this radar to [...] "skin track" [...] Sputnik I, the first such observation of a satellite. His earliest research, extending well beyond the Earth's orbit was with this same radar in 1961; he used it to make the first ranging measurements to another planet, Venus, to which he would return with more distinction later in his career. These first observations yielded a value for the astronomical unit in terrestrial units which has {{stood the test of time}} and has an accuracy some 3 orders of magnitude greater than had been possible with the armamentarium of classical <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy.</b> Such knowledge was critical for the successful navigation of Mariner 2 to Venus.|$|E
50|$|NOFS science {{supports}} {{every aspect}} of <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> to some level, providing national support and beyond. Work at NOFS covers the gamut of astrometry and astrophysics {{in order to facilitate}} its production of accurate/precise astronomical catalogs. Also, owing to the celestial dynamics (and relativistic effects) of the huge number of such moving objects across their own treks through space, the time expanse required to pin down each set of celestial locations and motions for a perhaps billion-star catalog, can be quite long. Multiple observations of each object may themselves take weeks, months or years, by themselves. This, multiplied by the large number of cataloged objects that must then be reduced for use, and which must be analyzed after observation for a very careful statistical understanding of all catalog errors, forces the rigorous production of most extremely precise and faint astrometric catalogs to take many years, sometimes decades, to complete.|$|E
5000|$|In 1929, Atkinson {{collaborated with}} Fritz Houtermans to apply Gamow's quantum {{tunnelling}} theory {{to the process}} of nuclear fusion in stars. They showed that fusing light nuclei could create energy in accordance with Einstein's formula of mass-energy equivalence, and that heavy nuclei could be built up by a successive series of fusions. Their models were similar to the later CNO cycle. This theory was not accepted at the time as it depended on the idea that stars were mostly hydrogen. Atkinson wrote about this theory again in the 1930s, predicting that the most luminous stars should have a short lifetime. He also proposed that the elements found in the Universe could be built up by fusion in stars, and that white dwarf stars did not need a nuclear source of energy in order to shine. [...] After World War II, he worked on astronomical instrumentation and <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|These early discoveries by Oort {{about the}} Milky Way overthrew the Kapteyn system, named after his mentor, which had envisioned a galaxy that was {{symmetrical}} around the Sun. As Oort later noted, “Kapteyn {{and his co-workers}} had not realized that the absorption in the galactic plane was {{as bad as it}} turned out to be.” Until Oort began his work, he later recalled, “the Leiden Observatory had been concentrating entirely on <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy,</b> meridian circle work and some proper motion work. But no astrophysics or anything that looked like that. No structure of the galaxy, no dynamics of the galaxy. There was no one else in Leiden who was interested in these problems in which I was principally interested, so the first years I worked more or less by myself in these projects. De Sitter was interested, but his main line of research was celestial mechanics; at that time the expanding universe had moved away from his direct interest.” As the European Space Agency states, Oort “shook the scientific world by demonstrating that the Milky Way rotates like a giant ‘Catherine Wheel.’” He showed that all the stars in the galaxy were “travelling independently through space, with those nearer the center rotating much faster than those further away.” ...|$|E
50|$|Ptolemy's Almagest, {{although}} a brilliant treatise on theoretical astronomy {{combined with a}} practical handbook for computation, nevertheless includes many compromises to reconcile discordant observations. Theoretical astronomy is usually assumed to have begun with Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), and Kepler's laws. It is co-equal with observation. The general history of astronomy deals {{with the history of}} the descriptive and theoretical astronomy of the Solar System, from the late sixteenth century {{to the end of the}} nineteenth century. The major categories of works on the history of modern astronomy include general histories, national and institutional histories, instrumentation, descriptive astronomy, theoretical astronomy, <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy,</b> and astrophysics. Astronomy was early to adopt computational techniques to model stellar and galactic formation and celestial mechanics. From the point of view of theoretical astronomy, not only must the mathematical expression be reasonably accurate but it should preferably exist in a form which is amenable to further mathematical analysis when used in specific problems. Most of theoretical astronomy uses Newtonian theory of gravitation, considering that the effects of general relativity are weak for most celestial objects. The obvious fact is that theoretical astronomy cannot (and does not try) to predict the position, size and temperature of every star in the heavens. Theoretical astronomy by and large has concentrated upon analyzing the apparently complex but periodic motions of celestial objects.|$|E
40|$|More than 30 {{different}} catalogues of <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> {{have been}} compiled at the Nikolaev Observatory since its foundation to present.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{high-order}} {{methods have}} {{shown to be}} very useful in many practical applications, in which nonlinear systems arise. In this case, a classical method of <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> have been modified in order to hold a nonlinear system in its establishments (that in the classical method is reduced to a single equation). At this point, high-order methods have been introduced in order to estimate the solutions of this system and, then, determine the orbit of the celestial body. We also have implemented a user friendly application, which {{will allow us to}} make a numerical and graphical comparison of the different methods with reference orbits, or user defined orbits...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Astronomical Almanac 2006, {{published}} in January 2005, {{was the first}} edition to introduce the concepts {{set out in the}} IAU 2000 resolutions on <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy.</b> Not only was the IAU 2000 A precession-nutation theory used, but the quantities and concepts relating to the Celestial Intermediate Reference System were tabulated and explained. With the preparation of the the almanac for the year 2007 (2007 edition), improvements have been made, which include the recommendations of the IAU Working Group on Nomenclature for Fundamental Astronomy. This paper focuses on Section B of the 2007 edition of the almanac—Time-Scales and Co-ordinate Systems—and highlights some of the changes. A summary is also given of the checks made between SOFA and NOVAS, the software libraries that are the basis of the numbers in the almanac...|$|E
40|$|The total {{solar eclipse}} of 28 May 1900 {{was a turning}} point for {{astronomy}} in Spain. The visit of foreign astronomical expeditions to Spain encouraged Spanish astronomers to move from observational activities, mainly devoted to <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy,</b> into the application of new astrophysical techniques. In opposition to what happened in the late nineteenth century, and as the study of the total solar eclipse expeditions of 1900 shows, {{an important part of the}} research programmes pursued and astronomical instruments employed by Spanish astronomers were similar to those of countries such as Great Britain and France. As a consequence, this total solar eclipse not only raised interest in astronomy and astrophysics in Spain, but also led to the inclusion of Spanish scholars into an international astronomical and astrophysical community immersed itself in a process of re-organisatio...|$|E
40|$|Robert Innes was a Scot with {{a passion}} for {{mathematical}} astronomy who emigrated to Sydney in 1890, at the age of 28. There he was inspired by Australia's foremost astronomer, John Tebbutt, and quickly developed a taste for observational astronomy, and particularly the search for new double stars. Innes soon became known for his success in this field, and with Tebbutt's patronage managed to obtain a clerical post at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope. There he continued his double star work, and with strong support from Sir David Gill was appointed founding director of the Transvaal Observatory in 1903. An interesting case of a successful 'amateur-turned-professional', by the time he died in 1931 Innes had received an honorary D.

40|$|This book acts as {{a manual}} for the ancient methods of {{navigating}} by the stars, which continue to provide the sailor or pilot with a timeless means of determining location.  Despite the prevalence of GPS, a comprehensive set of formulae that can be evaluated on any inexpensive scientific calculator {{in the event of}} a catastrophic software or systems failure is a vital failsafe. It also serves as a living link to centuries of explorers from centuries past. Beginning with the basics of <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy,</b> this guide moves on to the more complex math necessary to understand the ephemerides, tables showing the future positions of the stars and planets.  These astronomical almanacs were the satellite navigation of their day. The objective of this book is twofold: to provide the reader with a concise, comprehensible manual on <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> as it applies to astro-navigation and to furnish the concise algorithms for finding the position of the Sun and various navigational stars at any given instant. In a world where too many mariners and aeronauts rely solely on technology and are vulnerable to solar flares, electrical issues, and the like, this knowledge can be a life-saving backup, not to mention a fascinating study in its own rights. Included is an exact mathematical way to determine your position in the air or on the sea far more quickly and accurately than by using the old celestial navigational method, without even needing to know or understand the underlying mathematics.  There is even a section that teaches how to measure the azimuth of a star using an analog wrist watch so if a sextant gets damaged, locating position is still possible.  This book offers mathematicians and adventurers a way to determine position when the skies go dark. The U. S. Navy has recently realized that their electronic navigation systems are vulnerable to cyberattack, and as a result has instructed the Naval Academy to begin teaching celestial navigation again...|$|E
40|$|A total {{lunar eclipse}} {{occurred}} during the night preceding the decisive Battle of Gaugamela (20 th September 331 BCE), when the Macedonian army, led by Alexander the Great, finally defeated the Persian king Darius and his army. This astronomical event, well known to historians, had a relevant role on the battle outcome. The eclipse was described in detail by Babylonian astronomers, though, unfortunately, the text of their report has only partially been preserved. We have reconstructed {{the evolution of the}} phenomenon as it appeared to the observer in Babylonia, by using the <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> code "Planetario V 2. 0 ". On the base of this reconstruction we suggest a number of integrations to the lost part of the text, allowing a finer astrological interpretation of the eclipse and of its influence on the mood of the armies that set against each other on the following morning.

40|$|Combining a {{critical}} account of observational methods (telescopes and instrumentation) with a lucid {{description of the}} Universe, including stars, galaxies and cosmology, Smith provides a comprehensive introduction to the whole of modern astrophysics beyond the solar system. The first half describes the techniques used by astronomers to observe the Universe: optical telescopes and instruments are discussed in detail, but observations at all wavelengths are covered, from radio to gamma-rays. After a short interlude describing {{the appearance of the}} sky at all wavelengths, the role of <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> is highlighted. In the second half, a clear description is given of the contents of the Universe, including accounts of stellar evolution and cosmological models. Fully illustrated throughout, with exercises given in each chapter, this textbook provides a thorough introduction to astrophysics for all physics undergraduates, and a valuable background for physics graduates turning to research in astronomy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} amateur astronomy in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand during the critical period 1850 - 1935, when international astronomy witnessed the transition from <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> to astrophysics. In the positional era, amateur astronomers {{were able to make}} a major contribution, but this opportunity was increasingly denied them once astrophysics became the norm. Of greater interest to many amateur astronomers was the advent of Comet 1 P/Halley in 1910, which simply signposted the end in a succession of impressive naked eye comets, not to mention transits of Mercury and Venus and total solar eclipses (see Table I). All of these served to heighten public awareness of and interest in astronomy and convert increasing numbers of people to amature astronomy. For the purposes of this paper, an "amateur astronomer" is defined as: "Someone involved in astronomy for the love of it, who normally does not earn a primary income from astronomy"...|$|E
40|$|Conçu au début du XVIIIe siècle, le cercle méridien {{commence}} véritablement à équiper les observatoires astronomiques seulement vers 1850. Il devient alors rapidement un instrument indispensable à l’astronomie de position et son usage intensif durera plus d’un siècle. A l’occasion de l’opération d’inventaire du patrimoine astronomique entreprise récemment dans le cadre d’un protocole entre les ministères de la Culture et de la Recherche, nous avons étudié onze de ces instruments ainsi que l’architecture des abris techniques qui les protègent. Although it {{was first}} designed {{at the beginning of}} the eighteenth century, the meridian circle only really began to equip astronomical observatories around 1850. It rapidly became an essential instrument for <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> and its intense use lasted for more than a century.

40|$|The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac offers {{explanatory}} material, supplemental {{information and}} {{detailed descriptions of}} the computational models and algorithms used to produce The Astronomical Almanac, which is an annual publication prepared jointly by the US Naval Observatory and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the UK. Like The Astronomical Almanac, The Explanatory Supplement provides detailed coverage of modern <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy.</b> Chapters are devoted to the celestial and terrestrial reference frames, orbital ephemerides, precession, nutation, Earth rotation, and coordinate transformations. These topics have undergone substantial revisions since the last edition was published. Astronomical positions are intertwined with timescales and relativity in The Astronomical Almanac, so related chapters are provided in The Explanatory Supplement. The Astronomical Almanac also includes information on lunar and solar eclipses, physical ephemerides of solar system bodies, and calendars, so The Explanatory Supplement expounds upon each of these topics as well. The book is written at a technical, but non-expert level. As such, it provides an important reference for {{a full range of}} users including astronomers, engineers, navigators, surveyors, space scientists, and educators...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 18 th {{century and}} at the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century, observatory buildings underwent a change, because astronomical tools of observation had transformed from light portable equipment into permanently mounted accurate instruments. For <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy,</b> observations were mainly carried out in the meridian or in the prime vertical. A new type of telescope, the equatorially mounted refractor was adopted for the observation of objects such as planets, comets and double stars. The new instruments and methods of observation also required new approaches to observatory design. The new research needs began to determine the exterior, structure and functions of the observatory building. At the beginning of the 19 th century, new standards of observatory planning were developed for the construction of the new observatories of Tartu, Helsinki and Pulkovo. Over many decades, the adopted design principles guided the construction and architecture of avant-garde observatories around the world. They also provided for the archetype of the observatory as a universal emblem for science well into the 20 th century. The article discusses the development stages of these design principles and their global impacts...|$|E
40|$|To {{those not}} engaged in the {{practice}} of scientific observation, or telling the story of this enterprise, the image of scientific research may conjure up images of boredom more than anything else. Yet surprisingly, the profoundly uninteresting nature of scientific research to the majority of historical readers has received little attention. This paper seeks to examine one moment of encroaching boredom: nineteenth-century <b>positional</b> <b>astronomy</b> as practiced at large observatories. Observatory workers, who had once been in charge of manipulating complex equipment, were reduced to clerks, {{while at the same time}} observatory directors ignored elements of astronomy that had previously kindled public interest. Eclectic and colorful almanacs were replaced with dry ephemerides, and when popular authors like Richard Proctor tried to fill the void, their efforts were mocked by the professionals. On the whole the effort to popularize scientific observation of the skies must be seen as a failure; science and drudgery became synonymous in the public mind and attention was directed elsewhere. Though possibly a coincidence, this new form of astronomical observation was coeval with the introduction of a word very familiar today, but for which the OED has no record of prior the mid-nineteenth century: boredom...|$|E
