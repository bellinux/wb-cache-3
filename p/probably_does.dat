5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall prey to the blue shark (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E

5|$|The massive-star model <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> {{not explain}} {{all types of}} gamma-ray burst. There is strong {{evidence}} that some short-duration gamma-ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and no massive stars, such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy halos. The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars. According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other because gravitational radiation releases energy until tidal forces suddenly rip the neutron stars apart and they collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma-ray bursts, including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star, or the evaporation of primordial black holes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{individuals}} with A-T develop deformities {{of the feet}} that compound the difficulty they have with walking due to impaired coordination.

25|$|The three known {{flavours}} of neutrinos are the electron, muon, and tau. Their masses {{are slightly}} different. Neutrinos oscillate among the flavours as they move. It {{is hard to}} determine an exact upper bound on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (or {{for any of the}} three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were over 50 eV/c2 (less than 10−5 of the mass of an electron), the universe would collapse. CMB data and other methods indicate that their average mass <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not exceed 0.3 eV/c2. Thus, observed neutrinos cannot explain dark matter.|$|E

25|$|The {{interaction}} between Saturn's magnetosphere and {{the solar wind}} generates bright oval aurorae around the planet's poles observed in visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. The aurorae {{are related to the}} powerful saturnian kilometric radiation (SKR), which spans the frequency interval between 100nbsp&kHz to 1300nbsp&kHz and was once thought to modulate with a period equal to the planet's rotation. However, later measurements showed that the periodicity of the SKR's modulation varies by as much as 1%, and so <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not exactly coincide with Saturn’s true rotational period, which as of 2010 remains unknown. Inside the magnetosphere there are radiation belts, which house particles with energy as high as tens of megaelectronvolts. The energetic particles have significant influence on the surfaces of inner icy moons of Saturn.|$|E
25|$|Pieces {{which take}} {{multiple}} steps per move {{are probably not}} allowed to promote by crossing into the promotion zone and back out again: this is not explicitly stated in the rules, and chu shogi does not offer guidance here because such pieces do not promote in chu shogi, but it would contravene the usual stipulation that the move start outside and end inside the promotion zone. Another small piece of evidence is that the fire demon's burn is only calculated {{at the end of}} a turn, like promotion, and it does not apply to intermediate steps in the move. For similar reasons, igui or capturing <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not allow promotion if the move begins and ends outside the promotion zone, even if it passes in and back out along the way.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{have two}} kinds of eyes: the lateral and median ocelli. The lateral ocelli evolved from {{compound}} eyes and may have a tapetum, which enhances the ability to collect light. With the exception of scorpions, which can have up to five pairs of lateral ocelli, there are never more than three pairs present. The median ocelli develop from a transverse fold of the ectoderm. The ancestors of modern arachnids probably had both types, but modern ones often lack one type or the other. The cornea of the eye also acts as a lens, and is continuous with the cuticle of the body. Beneath this is a transparent vitreous body, and then the retina and, if present, the tapetum. In most arachnids, the retina <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not have enough light sensitive cells to allow the eyes to form a proper image.|$|E

25|$|Castrati first {{appeared}} in Italy in the mid-16th century, though at first the terms describing them were not always clear. The phrase soprano maschio (male soprano), which could also mean falsettist, occurs in the Due Dialoghi della Musica of Luigi Dentice, an Oratorian priest, published in Rome in 1553. On 9 November 1555 Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este (famed as the builder of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli), wrote to Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua (1538–1587), that he has heard that His Grace is interested in his cantoretti and offered to send him two, {{so that he could}} choose one for his own service. This is a rare term but <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> equate to castrato. The Cardinal's brother, Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, was another early enthusiast, enquiring about castrati in 1556. There were certainly castrati in the Sistine Chapel choir in 1558, although not described as such: on 27 April of that year, Hernando Bustamante, a Spaniard from Palencia, was admitted (the first castrati so termed who joined the Sistine choir were Pietro Paolo Folignato and Girolamo Rossini, admitted in 1599). Surprisingly, considering the later French distaste for castrati they certainly existed in France at this time also, being known of in Paris, Orléans, Picardy and Normandy, though they were not abundant: the King of France himself had difficulty in obtaining them. By 1574 there were castrati in the Ducal court chapel at Munich, where the Kapellmeister (music director) was the famous Orlando di Lasso. In 1589, by the bull Cum pro nostro pastorali munere, Pope Sixtus V re-organised the choir of St Peter's, Rome specifically to include castrati. Thus the castrati came to supplant both boys (whose voices broke after only a few years) and falsettists (whose voices were weaker and less reliable) from the top line in such choirs. Women were banned by the Pauline dictum mulieres in ecclesiis taceant ("let women keep silent in church"; see I Corinthians, ch. 14, v. 34).|$|E

500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University at {{the time}} of her Beatrix Potter (1986) argues that the theme of The Pie is the very proper social {{relations}} between neighbours in a small town. She points to the overly formal quality of the letters exchanged between the heroines as one example of the theme, and another, she indicates, is the manner in which the two pass each other on the street without a word to one another because [...] "they were going to have a party". Though Duchess <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not speak to Ribby for fear of revealing her plan to switch the two pies, Ribby <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not speak to Duchess out of an exaggerated sense of politeness or because she is rushed. [...] At the hour of the party, Duchess is anxious to arrive on time, yet not too early, and loiters outside Ribby's cottage before delivering her most [...] "genteel little tap-tappity" [...] and asking [...] "Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" [...] MacDonald notes that these instances not only underscore the elaborate codes of behaviour Potter's fictional animals observe but, by extension, the villagers of Sawrey. [...] For Potter, the result of such elaborate etiquette was nonsensical, distorted behaviour. Nevertheless, the cat and dog remain friends at the end of the story, and, in carefully avoiding any offence, their social pretenses and codes of etiquette are maintained.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} of Beorhtwulf's coins {{were issued}} in 841–842, {{and can be}} identified {{as the work of}} a Rochester die-cutter who also produced coins early in the reign of Æthelwulf of Wessex. [...] After ten years without any coinage, Beorhtwulf would have had to go outside Mercia to find skilled die-cutters, and Rochester was the closest mint. [...] Hence the link to Rochester <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not indicate that the coins were minted there; {{it is more likely that}} they were produced in London, which was under Mercian control. [...] Subsequent coins of Beorhtwulf's are very similar to Æthelwulf's. [...] One coin combines a portrait of Beorhtwulf on the reverse side with a design used by Æthelwulf on the obverse; this has been interpreted as indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms, but it is more likely to have been the work of a forger or an illiterate moneyer reusing the design of a coin of Æthelwulf's. [...] A different coinage appears later in the 840s, and was probably ended by the Viking attacks of 850–851. [...] There are also coins without portraits that are likely to have been produced at the very end of Beorhtwulf's reign.|$|E
