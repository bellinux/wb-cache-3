50|$|Raised-bed {{gardening}} {{is a form}} {{of gardening}} in which the soil is formed in three-to-four-foot-wide (1.0-1.2m) beds, which can be of any length or shape. The soil is raised above the surrounding soil (approximately six inches to waist-high), is sometimes enclosed by a frame generally made of wood, rock, or concrete blocks, and may be enriched with compost. The vegetable plants are spaced in geometric patterns, much closer together than in conventional row gardening. The spacing is such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a microclimate in which weed growth is suppressed and moisture is conserved. Raised beds produce a variety of benefits: they extend the planting season, they can reduce weeds if designed and planted properly, and they reduce the need to use poor native soil. Since the gardener does not walk on the raised beds, the soil is not compacted and the roots have an easier time growing. The close <b>plant</b> <b>spacing</b> and the use of compost generally result in higher yields with raised beds in comparison to conventional row gardening.

These papers were innovative with regard to breeding of cereals and other commodities, linking the roles of geneticists, plant breeders and field experimentalists.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{seedling}} age and <b>planting</b> <b>spaces</b> on yield and yield components of rice (Neda Variety) a field experiment was carried out in field of Ghaemshahr Azad University. Experimental design was arranged in split plot in basis of Randomized Completely Block design with four replication. Some agronomical traits such as total tiller number, fertile tiller number, panicle number per m 2, total spikelet per panicle, total strile spikelet per panicle, 1000 grains weight and grain yield were measured. Results showed that the effect of seedling age on total tiller number and panicle number per m 2 was significant at 0. 01 probability level. Also seedling age had a significant effect on fertile tiller number at 0. 05 probability levels. <b>Planting</b> <b>spaces</b> had a significant effect on total tiller, fertile tiller, panicle per m 2, total spikelet per panicle and grain yield. when the age of seedling is less than optimum, the tender seedlings may die in greater number due to high temperature and ultimately the plant population is reduced. For this variety transplanting in seedling age at 25 day and 15 x 15 cm <b>planting</b> <b>space</b> for the best performance of yield attributes were recommended...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{transplanting}} date, <b>planting</b> <b>spaces</b> and nitrogen fertilization on morphological characteristics of rice promising line a field experiment was carried out in the Rice Research Institute of Iran (Amol). Experimental design was arranged in a split plot factorial in basis of completely randomized block design with three replications. Some agronomical traits such as panicle length, grain number per panicle, filled grains percentage, 1000 grains weight, fertile tiller numbers, flag leaf area, flag leaf angle, grain yield and harvest index were measured. Results showed that the effect of transplanting date on grain number per panicle was significant at 0. 01 probability level. Also the effect of <b>planting</b> <b>spaces</b> on grain number per panicle and fertile tiller was significant at 0. 05 and 0. 01 probability level, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer levels had significant effect on, flag leaf area, flag leaf angle, panicle length, 1000 grains weight and grain yield. According to results, 1000 grains weight, harvest index and filled grains percentage had the most correlation with grain yield, respectively. For this line, transplanting date at May 12, <b>planting</b> <b>space</b> at 20 x 20 cm and 115 kg N ha - 1 for the best performance of yield attributes were recommended...|$|R
