5|$|A 2008 {{mitochondrial}} {{and nuclear}} DNA phylogenetic {{study of the}} <b>parrots,</b> cockatoos and related taxa by utilizing among others the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, provides confirmatory evidence for a Gondwanaland origin of the ancestral <b>parrots</b> in the Cretaceous period, and an Australasia divergence of the ancestral cockatoos from the <b>parrots</b> in either late Cretaceous (66 mya) or Paleogene (45 mya) periods depending on baseline assumptions.|$|E
5|$|Old, vague {{accounts}} of several different now-extinct Mascarene <b>parrots</b> have created much confusion for {{the scientists who}} subsequently examined them. In 1967, American ornithologist James Greenway speculated that 17th- and 18th-century reports of then-unidentified grey <b>parrots</b> on Mauritius referred to the broad-billed parrot. In 1987, English ecologist Anthony S. Cheke correlated the L. bensoni subfossils with the grey <b>parrots</b> reported from Mauritius and Réunion, which had previously been ignored, or considered references to broad-billed <b>parrots.</b> Further study of contemporary accounts indicates that the broad-billed parrot was not grey, but had multiple colours.|$|E

5|$|Pingré also {{reported}} that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation. Along with direct hunting of the <b>parrots,</b> this likely led {{to a reduction in}} the population of Rodrigues <b>parrots.</b> Pingré's 1761 account is the last known mention of the species, and it probably became extinct soon after.|$|E
5|$|The {{cockatoos}} {{were first}} {{defined as a}} subfamily Cacatuinae within the parrot family Psittacidae by the English naturalist George Robert Gray in 1840, with Cacatua the first listed and type genus. This group has alternately been considered as either a full or subfamily by different authorities. The American ornithologist James Lee Peters in his 1937 Check-list of Birds of the World, Sibley and Monroe in 1990 maintained it as a subfamily, while parrot expert Joseph Forshaw classified it as a family in 1973. Subsequent molecular studies indicate that the earliest offshoot from the original parrot ancestors were the New Zealand <b>parrots</b> of the superfamily Strigopoidea, and following this the cockatoos, now a well-defined group or clade, split off from the remaining <b>parrots,</b> which then radiated across the Southern Hemisphere and diversified into the many species of <b>parrots,</b> parakeets, macaws, lories, lorikeets, lovebirds and other true <b>parrots</b> of the superfamily Psittacoidea.|$|E
5|$|Both authors {{wrote that}} the macaws were the largest <b>parrots</b> of Guadeloupe, and {{stressed}} that the <b>parrots</b> of each Caribbean island were distinct, and could be differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations. According to Hume, {{this means that the}} birds described could not simply have been escaped South American macaws. Furthermore, the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tertre and Labat does not match the behavior of South American macaws.|$|E
50|$|The brown-necked <b>parrot</b> (Poicephalus fuscicollis), {{sometimes}} {{known in}} aviculture as the uncape <b>parrot,</b> {{is a large}} Poicephalus <b>parrot</b> species endemic to Africa consisting of the savanna-dwelling brown-necked <b>parrot</b> (P. fuscicollis fuscicollis) and grey-headed <b>parrot</b> (P. f. suahelicus) subspecies. It formerly included the Cape <b>parrot</b> (now Poicephalus robustus) as a subspecies before the Cape <b>parrot</b> was re-classified as a distinct species.|$|R

5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene <b>parrots</b> have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula <b>parrots</b> have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E
5|$|If {{the green}} <b>parrots</b> Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may {{explain some of the}} discrepancies. The green <b>parrots</b> mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of Psittacula species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{based on}} remains {{collected}} by Louis Etienne Thirioux {{in the early}} 20th century, the English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak placed a small subfossil Mauritian parrot in the same genus as the broad-billed parrot and named it Lophopsittacus bensoni. In 2007, {{on the basis of}} a comparison of subfossils, correlated with 17th and 18th century descriptions of small grey <b>parrots,</b> Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus Psittacula and called it Thirioux's grey parrot. In 1967, James Greenway had speculated that reports of grey Mauritian <b>parrots</b> referred to the broad-billed parrot.|$|E

5|$|In the {{footnotes}} to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil {{species with}} <b>parrots</b> mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified {{a description of}} the Rodrigues parrot therein. In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the <b>parrots</b> mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue <b>parrots</b> in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter.|$|E

5|$|Subfossil {{bones of}} the Mascarene grey parakeet found on Mauritius were first {{described}} in 1973 as belonging to a smaller relative of the broad-billed parrot in the genus Lophopsittacus. Apart from their size, the bones were {{very similar to those}} of other Mascarene <b>parrots.</b> The subfossils were later connected with 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of small grey <b>parrots</b> on Mauritius and Réunion, together with a single illustration published in a journal describing a voyage in 1602, and the species was instead reassigned to the genus Psittacula.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet also {{mentioned}} that the <b>parrots</b> ate {{the seeds of the}} Fernelia buxifolia shrub ("bois de buis"), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit.

5|$|The Mascarene parrot or Mascarin (Mascarinus mascarin) is an {{extinct species}} of parrot that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Réunion {{in the western}} Indian Ocean. The taxonomic {{relationships}} of this species {{have been subject to}} debate; it has historically been grouped with either the Psittaculini <b>parrots</b> or the vasa <b>parrots,</b> with the latest genetic study favouring the former group.|$|E

50|$|The rusty-faced <b>parrot,</b> red-faced <b>parrot</b> and Fuertes's <b>parrot</b> form a {{superspecies}} complex, {{and have}} at varioustimes. been considered conspecific.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of grey <b>parrots</b> described {{from the island}} of Réunion (referred to as Psittacula cf. bensoni by Hume) {{is thought to have}} been conspecific with that on Mauritius. Until subfossils of P. bensoni are found on Réunion, it cannot be confirmed whether the grey <b>parrots</b> of the two islands belonged to the same species. In the 1860s, French naturalists Charles Coquerel and Auguste Vinson suggested these could have been <b>parrots</b> of the genus Coracopsis, but fossils of neither that genus nor Psittacula have ever been found on Réunion. Whilst Coracopsis <b>parrots</b> are known to have been introduced to that island in the 1700s, a population did not become established. While no live or dead Mascarene grey parakeets are known with certainty to have been exported, Hume has suggested that a brown parrot specimen—once housed in Cabinet du Roi but now lost—may have been a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet, or perhaps a lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). This specimen was described by Comte de Buffon in 1779.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the kakapo differs from other <b>parrots</b> in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted <b>parrots,</b> the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other <b>parrots.</b> The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise <b>parrots</b> are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise <b>parrots</b> roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise <b>parrots</b> also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E
