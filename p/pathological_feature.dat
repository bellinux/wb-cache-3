Additionally, variations in the locational characteristics of β-amyloid precursor proteins seen in Alzheimer’s disease are connected to Hirano bodies. It was observed that Hirano bodies are a specific site of a C-terminal fragment of β-amyloid precursor proteins.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{explore the}} <b>pathological</b> <b>feature</b> and immunoprofile of immunoprofile {{accompanied}} with upper urinary tract obstruction and the immunoprofile in {{various types of}} glandular cystitis. Methods. Pathological sections from 31 cases of cystitis glandularis with upper urinary tract obstruction and 34 cases of cystitis glandularis without upper urinary tract obstruction were observed as <b>pathological</b> <b>feature</b> on microscopy. Meanwhile, an immunohistochemical analysis was employed to determine the expression of p 53, Ki 67, p 21, MMP- 9, MUC 1, MUC 2, and COX- 2. Results. In the two groups, main pathological type was transitional epithelial, followed by intestinal epithelial; other types were a few, {{and the difference between}} the two groups was not significant. All immunohistochemical expressions of p 53, Ki 67, p 21, MMP- 9, MUC 1, MUC 2, and COX- 2 were positive in varying degrees, and there was no significant difference between the groups. Transitional epithelial type was compared with mixed type; the difference of COX- 2 was significant, P< 0. 05. The differences of immunohistochemical expression among other different pathologic types were not significant. Conclusions. It is suggested that glandular cystitis accompanied with upper urinary tract obstruction shares the same <b>pathological</b> <b>feature</b> and immunoprofile as that without upper urinary tract obstruction.

We evaluated whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) grade from 3 -T diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is useful to exclude men with unfavorable <b>pathological</b> <b>features</b> from men meeting current AS eligibility criteria. MethodsAmong patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 117 potential AS candidates defined according to 2013 European Association of Urology guidelines who had undergone preoperative 3 -T DW-MRI were included. A blinded uro-radiologist graded the level of suspicion from the ADC map using the Likert scale from 1 to 5. The rate of unfavorable <b>pathological</b> <b>features</b> was evaluated according to ADC grade. Unfavorable <b>pathological</b> <b>features</b> were defined as non-organ-confined disease or pathological Gleason score ≥ 7 (4 + 3). The associations between unfavorable <b>pathological</b> <b>features</b> and clinical variables including ADC grade (> 3 vs. ≤ 3) were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. ResultsThe rates of unfavorable <b>pathological</b> <b>features</b> were 0. 0 % (0 / 14), 2. 9 % (1 / 34), 5. 4 % (2 / 37), 25. 0 % (6 / 24), and 37. 5 % (3 / 8) from grades 1 to 5 (P = 0. 002). The predictive accuracy was as high as 0. 804. The rates were significantly different between low (≤ 3, 3. 5 %) and high (> 3, 28. 1 %, P< 0. 001) grades. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 75. 0 %, 78. 1 %, 28. 1 %, and 96. 5 %.
