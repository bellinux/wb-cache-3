From magnetisation measurements, we show that the isothermal entropy change associated with the magnetostructural transition can be as high as 4. 5 J/(K kg) in a field of 1 Tesla. However, the large thermal hysteresis in this transition (~ 20 K) will limit its straightforward use in a magnetocaloric device. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{variation}} of ferromagnetic {{order in the}} <b>pseudo-ternary</b> <b>compounds</b> URh 1 -xCoxGe (0 <= x <= 1). Magnetization and transport data taken on polycrystalline samples show that the Curie temperature T-c gradually increases with increasing Co content from a value of 9. 5 K for URhGe to a maximum value of 20 K for x = 0. 6 and then steadily decreases to 3 K for UCoGe. The magnetic interaction strength varies smoothly across the series. For all samples the electrical resistivity for T < T-c follows the behaviour rho = rho(0) + AT(2). The A coefficient is dominated by scattering at spin waves and is strongly enhanced for x = 0 and 1...|$|R

As a result of local moments embedded in this highly polarizable Fermi liquid, remarkably high-temperature ferromagnetic ordering was found for RFe 20 Zn 20 (R = Gd - Tm). Furthermore, <b>pseudo-ternary</b> <b>compounds</b> GdxY 1 -xFe 2 Zn 20 manifest ferromagnetic ordering above 1. 8 K for Gd concentrations x 3 ̆e 0. 02.

40|$|Magnetization, {{resistivity}} {{and specific}} heat measurements {{were performed on}} the solution-grown, single crystals of six GdT_ 2 Zn_ 20 (T = Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh and Ir) compounds, {{as well as their}} Y analogues. For the Gd compounds, the Fe column members manifest a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state (with an enhanced Curie temperature, T_C, for T = Fe and Ru), whereas the Co column members manifest an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Thermodynamic measurements on the YT_ 2 Zn_ 20 revealed that the enhanced T_C for GdFe_ 2 Zn_ 20 and GdRu_ 2 Zn_ 20 can be understood within the framework of Heisenberg moments embedded in a nearly ferromagnetic Fermi liquid. Furthermore, electronic structure calculations indicate that this significant enhancement is due to large, close to the Stoner FM criterion, transition metal partial density of states at Fermi level, whereas the change of FM to AFM ordering is associated with filling of electronic states with two additional electrons per formula unit. The degree of this sensitivity is addressed by the studies of the <b>pseudo-ternary</b> <b>compounds</b> Gd(Fe_xCo_ 1 -x) _ 2 Zn_ 20 and Y(Fe_xCo_ 1 -x) _ 2 Zn_ 20 which clearly reveal the effect of 3 d band filling on their magnetic properties.

40|$|M. Sc. Aspects of electron-electron {{correlations}} {{have for}} the past few decades {{been at the forefront of}} research in Solid State Physics. More traditional concepts under this topic have been phenomena such as superconductivity, and magnetic ordering in its many forms including long-range ordering and spin-glass freezing. The class of so-called strongly correlated electron systems has been a particularly active field of study, as witnessed by for instance the series of annual international conferences held under this topic since 1992. Compounds and alloys of strong electronic correlations have proved a very rich field of new and anomalous physical behaviours in metallic and semiconducting compounds and alloys of especially 4 f- and 5 f-electron systems, together with ceramics characterized as the so-called ¡§high-TC¡¨ superconductors. The f-electron systems have revealed a variety of behaviours such as ~ 1000 -fold enhanced effective electron masses at low temperature, coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic ordering in systems where the magnetic interactions are far too strong to allow for Cooper-pair formation within the well-established BCS-interpretation, and electron transport and thermodynamic behaviour at low temperatures that completely defy our conventional Fermi-liquid paradigm of understanding the ground states of metals. The series of <b>pseudo-ternary</b> <b>compounds</b> Ce 1 -xLaxRu 4 Sn 6 that were synthesized and characterized in this work for the first time are formed by substituting La for Ce in CeRu 4 Sn 6, the parent compound. CeRu 4 Sn 6 exhibits a number of properties which have been associated with a special class, the Kondo semiconductors of strongly correlated electron systems. CeRu 4 Sn 6 has very recently been shown [A. M. Strydom et al. (2004) ] to comprise an intriguing combination of characteristics that are thus far unique among the Kondo semiconductors: At low temperature (T 10 K) the specific heat proves the development of very strong electronic correlation out of an already low density of charge carriers (as shown by Hall-effect, resistivity, and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat). Furthermore, the specific heat follows a logarithmic increase as temperature is decreased below ~ 2 K, in a range where thermal transport shows the presence of an energy gap in the electronic density of states. The aim of this work was to investigate the intermediate and higher temperature (4. 01 K „T T „T 300 K) behaviour of the electrical resistivity of the Ce 1 -xLaxRu 4 Sn 6 series of compounds in which the concentration of the 4 f-electron magnetic ion Ce is progressively being reduced. A steady but slow decrease of the energy gap with increasing La concentration was found in this work in contrast with what is usually the case in Kondo semiconductors. Both the presence of an energy gap and the low density of charge carriers are found to be connected to the presence of Ce in the unit cell, and are therefore not an artefact of the peculiar filledƒ{cageƒ{like tetragonal crystal structure of these compounds. An interesting strong anisotropy was found in the way in which the tetragonal unit cell expands preferentially within the aƒ{b plane, compared to the elongation along the cƒ{axis, upon moving from CeRu 4 Sn 6 to LaRu 4 Sn 6.
