C. 20360 The ability of standard commercial equipment cabinets {{to be used}} to provide a barrier to electromagnetic interference is explored. The internal to external, and external to internal, electromagnetic isolation provided by various configurations of cabinet-penetrating conductors was measured at frequencies from 20 HZ to 20 MHZ. Excellent isolation was obtained over the entire frequency range when penetrating conductors (coaxial cables, grounds buses, <b>power</b> <b>conductor</b> green-wires, and <b>power</b> <b>conductor</b> black and white wires) were installed in accord with barrier principles. Little or no isolation was obtained with the direct penetration of the cabinet by conductors.

5000|$|An {{overhead}} cable is a cable for {{the transmission of}} information, laid on utility poles. Overhead telephone and cable TV lines are common in North America.

Alternative B separates the data and the <b>power</b> <b>conductors,</b> making troubleshooting easier. It also makes full use of all four twisted pair, copper wires.

This is also why laptop computers usually have only 4-pin FireWire ports, as they cannot provide enough power to meet requirements for devices needing the power provided by 6-pin connections.|$|E
