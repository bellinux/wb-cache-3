In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to <b>private</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E

Vor dem Hintergrund des Gesetzes zur Stärkung des Wettbewerbes in der gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung (GKV-WSG) werden Möglichkeiten einer Privatisierung der GKV analysiert. Dabei steht eine genossenschaftliche Ausrichtung des Versicherungssystems im Vordergrund. Diese Entstaatlichung der GKV, die in Holland seit einiger Zeit verwirklicht ist, wird sorgfältig evaluiert.

Inequality aversion is introduced by postulating a strictly concave ex post social welfare function.

It is shown that the optimal public health care system allocates health care differently than would <b>private</b> <b>health</b> insurance; speci?cally, people who are relatively unhealthy with and without treatment receive more health care, and people who are relatively healthy with and without treatment receive less health care. The aggregate quantity of health care under the optimal public health care system might be either greater or less than under <b>private</b> <b>health</b> care <b>insurance.</b> If the public health care system is optimally designed, allowing agents to purchase supplementary <b>private</b> <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> cannot raise social welfare and is likely to decrease it. ...|$|R
