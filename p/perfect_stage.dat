60|$|I may here state, that I have {{examined}} the larvæ in this the final or <b>perfect</b> <b>stage</b> in four species of Lepas, in Conchodermavirgata, Ibla quadrivalvis, and, though rather less minutely, in Balanus balanoides, and I find all essential points of organisation similar.

60|$|What the gilt notes suggest, what {{imitative}} parallel may {{be found}} to them in that chaos that is termed Nature, {{is a matter of}} no importance. They may suggest, as they do sometimes to me, peacocks and pomegranates and splashing fountains of gold water, or, as they do to your critic, sponges and Indian clubs and chimney-pot hats. Such suggestions and evocations have nothing whatsoever to do with the aesthetic quality and value of the design. A thing in Nature becomes much lovelier if it reminds us of a thing in Art, but a thing in Art gains no real beauty through reminding us of a thing in Nature. The primary aesthetic impression of a work of art borrows nothing from recognition or resemblance. These belong to a later and less <b>perfect</b> <b>stage</b> of apprehension.|$|E

60|$|It {{would be}} a great mistake to suppose that the bird when {{fluttering}} on the ground to lead an enemy from the neighbourhood of its nest is in full possession of all its faculties, acting consciously, and itself in as little danger of capture as when on its perch or flying through the air. We have seen that the action has its root in the bird's passion for its young, and intense solicitude in the presence of any danger threatening them, which is so universal in this class of creatures, and which expresses itself so variously in different kinds. This must be in all cases a painful and debilitating emotion, and when the bird drops down to the earth its pain has caused it to fall as surely as if it had received a wound or had been suddenly attacked by some grievous malady; and when it flutters on the ground it is for the moment incapable of flight, and its efforts to recover flight and safety cause it to beat its wings, and tremble, and gasp with open mouth. The object of the action is to deceive an enemy, or, to speak more correctly, the result is to deceive, and there is nothing that will more inflame and carry away any rapacious mammal than the sight of a fluttering bird. But in thus drawing upon itself the attention of an enemy threatening the safety of its eggs or young, to what a terrible danger does the parent expose itself, and how often, in those moments of agitation and debility, must its own life fall a sacrifice! The sudden spring and rush of a feline enemy must have proved fatal in myriads of instances. From its inception to its most <b>perfect</b> <b>stage,</b> in the various species that possess it, this perilous instinct has been washed in blood and made bright.|$|E

Samples were moistened with sterile distilled water alone or with sterile distilled water containing penicillin, streptomycin a d varying concentrations of Actidione. Recovery of fungi was approximately doubled when the soils were moistened with water containing the antibiotics.

This technique has also been prominent in the discovery of several <b>perfect</b> <b>stages</b> of keratinophilic and dermatophytic fungi. A modification of this technique is reported here.

Differences in the properties of physiological characters of fungi isolated in both study seasons were observed. As indoor and outdoor air does not mix during the heating season, a specific substrate for prototrophic, non-fermenting yeastlike fungi forms. Acid production allows fungi to dissolve inorganic compounds in building structures and to release needed microcomponents. Abilities to produce carotenoid pigments are clearly promoted in yeast-like fungi living indoor.

40|$|Introduction: An {{increasing}} number of reports have been issued {{in the recent years}} on considerably increased frequency of yeast-like fungi and yeast in organ ontocenoses of man. This applies in particular the respiratory and digestive systems. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was the taxonomical analysis of yeast and yeast-like fungi from the respiratory system and gastrointestinal tract of human with particular emphasis on the number of taxa and attention to the dominant species and rare species in the different sections of studied ontocenosis. Material and methods: The experimental material were yeast-like fungi and yeasts isolated from the respiratory and the digestive system of human. The fungi were cultured and identified following standard principles of mycological diagnostics. Results: The fungi isolated from the respiratory system were classified to 37 species and from the gastrointestinal tract – to 23 species. The predominating species {{turned out to be the}} Candida albicans, constituting 19. 49 % in the respiratory system and 27. 87 % in the digestive system. Conclusions: Five species have been isolated for the first time in Poland. The abundance of the species detected and the presence of <b>perfect</b> <b>stages</b> in the material examined imply a successive increase in the expansiveness of fungi towards human tissues. Results obtained confirms that the respiratory systems affords the fungi better conditions for the survival and growth...|$|R

50|$|Simultaneously, ascospores are {{produced}} on the lesions of infected canes or berries {{left on the}} trellis system or on the vineyard floor {{to carry out the}} infection. These ascospores are formed in asci, which are in cavities within a stroma—the dense structural tissue that produces fruiting bodies in fungi—of pseudothecium. Pseudothecium of grape anthracnose, the sexual fruiting body of the fungus, has asci containing eight four-celled ascospores. The fungus also overwinters as pseudothecium, but the importance of ascospores in disease development is not clearly understood. The study done by Mirica (1998) validated that the ascospores do germinate and infect the tissue and produce the Sphaceloma phase which shows the existence of the <b>perfect</b> <b>stage</b> of Elsinoe Ampelina. Overall, conidia and ascospores overwinter on the ground and on infected tissue and become the source of primary inoculum.|$|E

[...] The LA Times describes the number as [...] "dazzling". Hi-Def Digest wrote [...] "arguably the show's most exuberant song, 'Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love,' is a clever, catchy celebration of adolescent agony". Florida Theatre On Stage wrote [...] "Another memorable stretch was the extended fever dream of internal monologues about adolescence “Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love.” Besides the <b>perfect</b> <b>staging</b> and performances, it highlighted the fluid lighting design by Paul Black (including considerable backlighting) and split-second calls of stage managers Brandy Demil and Michael J.

He hasn't opened up the play in any foolish way. There are even times when the camera successfully catches the tempo of the lunatic action without being overwhelmed by it. Yet too often the action and the dialogue are so fuzzily understood that the laughs are lost. The film's problem is more basic: the attempt to Americanize a fine English farce about provincial seediness. It can't be done." ...|$|E
