40|$|Even {{though the}} {{increase}} {{of the number of}} <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and registered <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> caused the balance of the Fund to be aggravated, there have been only a few studies to solve the problems of the Fund. Therefore, this study aims to understand the status of the financial resourses for the employment policy of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and to clarify the problems in South Korea by comparing and analyzing the current financial resources for the employment policies of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> between South Korea and Japan. As for the study method, literature review was employed to analyze the literatures and information related to financial resources of employment policy for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> mainly focusing on the revenue account among the accounts of budget to implement the employment policy for <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> The biggest difference between financial resources to perform the employment policy for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> of Japan and South Korea is from the total amount of budget and the distribution ratio of General Account, Social Insurance and the share. While in Japan the employment policies for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are financed by the General Account and Social Insurance much more than the Share, in South Korea, they are financed by the Share more than the General Account and Employment Insurance. Therefore, as the budget scale from General Account is significantly low, to stably implement the employment business for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> the budget scale from General Account and Social Insurance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{twenty million}} <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in India are {{increasingly}} being offered poverty alleviation strategies, including employment programs. This study employs a spatial analytic approach to identify correlates of employment among <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in India, considering sight, speech, hearing, movement, and mental disabilities. Methods Based on 2001 Census data, this study utilizes linear regression and spatial autoregressive models to identify factors associated with the proportion employed among <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> at the district level. Models stratified by rural and urban areas were also considered. Results Spatial autoregressive models revealed that different factors contribute to employment of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in rural and urban areas. In rural areas, having mental disability decreased the likelihood of employment, while being female and having movement, or sight impairment (compared to other disabilities) increased the likelihood of employment. In urban areas, being female and illiterate decreased the likelihood of employment but having sight, mental and movement impairment (compared to other disabilities) increased the likelihood of employment. Conclusions Poverty alleviation programs designed for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in India should account for differences in employment by disability types and should be spatially targeted. Since <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in rural and urban areas have different factors contributing to their employment, {{it is vital that}} government and service-planning organizations account for these differences when creating programs aimed at livelihood development...|$|R

In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{reasoning}} for income security and its redistributive {{effect for the}} disabled, and analyses the economic effects of the work support to the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> and barrier-free measures to employment of them. As a result of estimation of the marginal utility of income for the disabled with that of general household based on the demand system estimation, the income transfer to the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> has a economic basis. Furthermore, calculations of the relative poverty rates with and without income security for the disabled persons shows us the improvement in relative poverty rate by the income security for the disabled. By enhancing the economic growth model of Zon and Muysken 2005 {{so that it can}} include not only the contribution of the disabled but also that of the <b>persons</b> engaged <b>with</b> work support to production of the goods, we can find out the effects of work support for the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> on consumption growth rate. Furthermore, by making a regression analysis between the change in employment of the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> and barrier-free measures, those measures have positive influences on the employment of the disabled...|$|R
