5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry,</b> chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E

25|$|The {{color of}} {{red blood cells}} {{is due to the}} heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color {{depending}} {{on the state of the}} hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin. <b>Pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|While the {{surgical}} details {{will depend on}} the type of transplant, many steps are common to all these procedures. Before operating on the recipient, the transplant surgeon inspects the donor lung(s) for signs of damage or disease. If the lung or lungs are approved, then the recipient is connected to an IV line and various monitoring equipment, including <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry.</b> The patient will be given general anesthesia, and a machine will breathe for him or her.|$|E
25|$|When {{signs of}} {{pneumonia}} are discovered during evaluation, chest X-rays, are performed {{to support a}} diagnosis of CAP, and examination of the blood and sputum for infectious microorganisms and blood tests {{may be used to}} support a diagnosis of CAP. Diagnostic tools depend on the severity of illness, local practices and concern about complications of the infection. All patients with CAP should have their blood oxygen monitored with <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry.</b> In some cases, arterial blood gas analysis may be required to determine the amount of oxygen in the blood. A complete blood count (CBC) may reveal extra white blood cells, indicating infection.|$|E
25|$|AF {{can cause}} {{respiratory}} distress due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, {{the heart rate}} will be greater than 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) non-invasive blood pressure monitors. For this reason, when determining heart rate in AF, direct cardiac auscultation is recommended. Low blood pressure is most concerning and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation {{of congestive heart failure}} due to the reduced cardiac output. Respiratory rate will be increased in the presence of respiratory distress. <b>Pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> may confirm the presence of hypoxia related to any precipitating factors such as pneumonia. Examination of the jugular veins may reveal elevated pressure (jugular venous distention). Lung exam may reveal crackles, which are suggestive of pulmonary edema. Heart exam will reveal a rapid irregular rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation {{of the blood}} (<b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry),</b> and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E
500|$|No {{treatment}} {{is known to}} speed the healing of a pulmonary contusion; the main care is supportive. [...] Attempts are made to discover injuries accompanying the contusion, to prevent additional injury, and to provide supportive care {{while waiting for the}} contusion to heal. [...] Monitoring, including keeping track of fluid balance, respiratory function, and oxygen saturation using <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> is also required as the patient's condition may progressively worsen. Monitoring for complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome is of critical importance. Treatment aims to prevent respiratory failure and to ensure adequate blood oxygenation. [...] Supplemental oxygen can be given and it may be warmed and humidified. [...] When the contusion does not respond to other treatments, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation may be used, pumping blood from the body into a machine that oxygenates it and removes carbon dioxide prior to pumping it back in.|$|E
500|$|Lung AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} the abnormal appearance of the lungs on a chest X-ray, or hypoxia (low oxygen levels) on <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> or arterial blood gas determination. Bubble contrast echocardiography (bubble echo) {{may be used as}} a screening tool to identify abnormal connections between the lung arteries and veins. This involves the injection of agitated saline into a vein, followed by ultrasound-based imaging of the heart. Normally, the lungs remove small air bubbles from the circulation, and they are therefore only seen in the right atrium and the right ventricle. If an AVM is present, bubbles appear in the left atrium and left ventricle, usually 3–10 cardiac cycles after the right side; this is slower than in heart defects, in which there are direct connections between the right and left side of the heart. A larger number of bubbles is more likely to indicate the presence of an AVM. Bubble echo is not a perfect screening tool as it can miss smaller AVMs and does not identify the site of AVMs. [...] Often contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT angiography) is used to identify lung lesions; this modality has a sensitivity of over 90%. It may be possible to omit contrast administration on modern CT scanners. Echocardiography is also used if there is a suspicion of pulmonary hypertension or high-output cardiac failure due to large liver lesions, sometimes followed by cardiac catheterization to measure the pressures inside the various chambers of the heart.|$|E

2500|$|Because newborn {{screening}} programs test {{for a number}} of different conditions, a number of different laboratorial methodologies are used, as well as bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials and congenital heart defects using <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry.</b> [...] Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder, starting with phenylketonuria in the early 1960s. [...] With this testing methodology, {{newborn screening}} required one test to detect one condition. [...] As mass spectrometry became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot. [...] This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening. [...] Enzyme assays are used to screen for galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency. [...] Immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. [...] Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scope of}} medical {{practice}} for EMTs is regulated by state law, and can vary significantly both among {{states as well}} as inside states. In general, EMTs provide what is considered basic life support and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, typical procedures provided by EMTs include CPR, Automated external defibrillation, mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of air way adjuncts such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry,</b> glucose testing using a glucometer, splinting (including spinal immobilization and traction splints), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of certain prescribed medications, including nitroglycerin, Metered-dose inhaler such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the EpiPen. EMT-Bs can typically also administer certain non-preprescribed drugs including oxygen, oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction). In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, states are rapidly changing protocols to permit EMT-Bs to administer naloxone as well.|$|E
2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} is {{a public}} health program of screening in infants shortly after birth {{for a list of}} conditions that are treatable, but not clinically evident in the newborn period. [...] Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done; in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease. Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction. [...] The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. [...] Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper, however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using [...] automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry.</b> [...] Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. [...] Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant's pediatrician or primary care physician.|$|E

5000|$|By 1987, the {{standard}} of care for the administration of a general anesthetic in the U.S. included <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry.</b> From the operating room, the use of <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> rapidly spread throughout the hospital, first to the recovery room, {{and then into the}} various intensive care units. <b>Pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> was of particular value in the neonatal unit where the patients do not thrive with inadequate oxygenation, but too much oxygen and fluctuations in oxygen concentration can lead to vision impairment or blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Furthermore, obtaining an arterial blood gas from a neonatal patient is painful to the patient and a major cause of neonatal anemia. [...] Motion artifact can be a significant limitation to <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> monitoring resulting in frequent false alarms and loss of data. The {{reason for this is that}} during motion and low peripheral perfusion, many pulse oximeters cannot distinguish between pulsating arterial blood and moving venous blood, leading to underestimation of oxygen saturation. Early studies of <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> performance during subject motion made clear the vulnerabilities of conventional <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> technologies to motion artifact.In 1995, Masimo introduced Signal Extraction Technology (SET) that could measure accurately during patient motion and low perfusion by separating the arterial signal from the venous and other signals. Since then, <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> manufacturers have developed new algorithms to reduce some false alarms during motion such as extending averaging times or freezing values on the screen, but they do not claim to measure changing conditions during motion and low perfusion. So, there are still important differences in performance of pulse oximeters during challenging conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Published {{papers have}} {{compared}} signal extraction technology to other <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> technologies and have demonstrated consistently favorable results for signal extraction technology. [...] Signal extraction technology <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> performance {{has also been}} shown to translate into helping clinicians improve patient outcomes. In one study, retinopathy of prematurity (eye damage) was reduced by 58% in very low birth weight neonates at a center using signal extraction technology, while there was no decrease in retinopathy of prematurity at another center with the same clinicians using the same protocol but with non-signal extraction technology. [...] Other studies have shown that signal extraction technology <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> results in fewer arterial blood gas measurements, faster oxygen weaning time, lower sensor utilization, and lower length of stay. [...] The measure-through motion and low perfusion capabilities it has also allow it to be used in previously unmonitored areas such as the general floor, where false alarms have plagued conventional <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry.</b> As evidence of this, a landmark study was published in 2010 showing clinicians using signal extraction technology <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> on the general floor were able to decrease rapid response team activations, ICU transfers, and ICU days.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> uses two light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Conventional <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the venous blood also moves, which can cause conventional <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> to under-read SpO2 levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood. SET identifies the venous blood signal (which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO2 and pulse rate. In addition, SET <b>pulse</b> <b>oximetry</b> provides perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI).
