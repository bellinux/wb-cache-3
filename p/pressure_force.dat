25|$|In the cross-stream {{momentum}} equation, non-negligible Coriolis {{force is}} {{balanced by the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>force,</b> {{in a way that}} the parcel does not experience any bending action.|$|E
25|$|For regular {{cyclones}} (air circulation around pressure lows), the <b>pressure</b> <b>force</b> is inward (positive term) and the Coriolis force outward (negative term) {{irrespective of}} the hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|However, the <b>pressure</b> <b>force</b> must exactly {{counterbalance}} the Coriolis force anyway, so the {{parcel of}} air needs to travel with the Coriolis force contrary to the decreasing sideways slope of pressure.|$|E
40|$|In {{statistically}} homogeneous turbulent flows, <b>pressure</b> <b>forces</b> {{provide the}} main mechanism to redistribute kinetic energy among fluid elements, without net {{contribution to the}} overall energy budget. This holds true in both two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) flows, which show fundamentally different physics. As we demonstrate here, <b>pressure</b> <b>forces</b> act on fluid elements very differently in these two cases. We find in numerical simulations that in 3 D <b>pressure</b> <b>forces</b> strongly accelerate the fastest fluid elements, and that in 2 D this effect is absent. In 3 D turbulence, our findings put forward a mechanism for a possibly singular buildup of energy, and thus may shed {{new light on the}} smoothness problem of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in 3 D...|$|R

25|$|In the fictitious {{situation}} {{drawn in}} the figure, the <b>pressure</b> <b>force</b> pushes the parcel forward along the trajectory and inward {{with respect to}} the bend; the Coriolis force pushes inwards (outwards) of the bend in the northern (southern) hemisphere; and friction pulls (necessarily) rearwards.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>force.</b> This is {{the action}} on the parcel arising from the spatial {{differences}} of atmospheric pressure p around it. (Temporal changes are of no interest here.) The spatial change of pressure is visualised through isobars, that are contours joining the locations where the pressure has a same value. In the figure this is simplistically shown by equally spaced straight lines. The <b>pressure</b> <b>force</b> acting on the parcel is minus the gradient vector of p (in symbols: grad p) - drawn in the figure as a blue arrow. At all points, the pressure gradient points to the direction of maximum increase of p and is always normal to the isobar at that point. Since the flow packet feels a push from the higher to the lower pressures, the effective pressure vector force {{is contrary to the}} pressure gradient, whence the minus sign before the gradient vector.|$|E

25|$|In theory, a {{controller}} {{can be used}} {{to control}} any process which has a measurable output (PV), a known ideal value for that output (SP) and an input to the process (MV) that will affect the relevant PV. Controllers are used in industry to regulate temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>force,</b> feed rate, flow rate, chemical composition (component concentrations), weight, position, speed, and practically every other variable for which a measurement exists.|$|E
25|$|In a {{barotropic}} atmosphere, where {{density is}} a function only of pressure, a horizontal pressure gradient will drive a geostrophic wind that is constant with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along isobars, the isobars will be thicker. This causes {{the slope of the}} isobars to increase with height. This is illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because isobars are steeper at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there. However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting geostrophic wind at higher elevations must be greater {{in the direction of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot about what is going on just by the <b>pressure,</b> <b>force</b> and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E

40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} are today struggling {{to develop more}} energy efficient vehicles that will meet future emissions targets of CO 2 (Carbon Dioxide). To do so {{it is essential to}} improve both efficiency of driveline and reduce resistance forces of all kind. The aerodynamic drag force is the single biggest resistance force for a passenger car to overcome at highway speeds and it is {{a significant part of the}} total resistance forces that the vehicle has to overcome in average use, city and highway driving. Since a reduction in fuel consumption directly will lead to a reduction of CO 2 the best way is to reduce the energy required for propulsion of the system. Aerodynamic drag force can be divided into two parts, pressure and friction. <b>Pressure</b> <b>forces</b> on the exterior body of a passenger car dominate the total drag force. A rule of thumb says that 80 - 90 % of the aerodynamics drag forces of a passenger car are <b>pressure</b> <b>forces</b> and the rest is friction. For a finite wing for instance we will have the opposite, about 95 % friction and 5 % <b>pressure</b> <b>forces.</b> When the <b>pressure</b> <b>forces</b> are the dominating part of the aerodynamic drag we use to call the body bluff, and if the friction forces are dominating we call it a streamlined body. This then, classifies a passenger car aerodynamically as a bluff body. The biggest <b>pressure</b> <b>forces</b> are associated to wake formations at the rear end of a bluff body...|$|R

25|$|Due to the fragmentary remains {{generally}} {{known for}} this family, its possible only describe some general {{aspects of the}} appearance and biology of Langstonia. As mentioned above, the fossil type of the species is larger than Sebecus icaeorhinus with jaws and teeth even more flattened, although its general proportions are reminiscent of this species, which suggests that their skull would be higher and laterally flattened, in contrast to modern crocodilians, which generally have a horizontally flattened skull with conical teeth. Teeth are of the zyphodont kind, with very flattened sides, slightly curved back and with serrated edges with small denticles (between 5-6 denticles per millimeter {{in the teeth of}} this genus) and also without any grooves on its surface. This type of teeth appears in the close relatives of sebecids, the peirosaurids and baurusuchids of the Cretaceous and some crocodilians of the Cenozoic as the pristichampsids and some mekosuchines. These forms were land animals that used their teeth to cut and tear their prey, because the traditional method of capture of the crocodiles, using its <b>pressure</b> <b>force</b> to retain and drown his victims is not viable on land; these crocodylomorphs also had more elongated limbs, stiff back, ideal to hold the weight and give strength to run. Langston had already suggested that these teeth were indicative that this animal had more terrestrial habits than those of existing species and the Miocene contemporary crocodylians, and in the modern world only could be vaguely compared with the less aquatic habits of the caimans of the genus Paleosuchus, which have a higher muzzle and a higher degree of ossification around the eye socket, so that they partially resemble sebecids. Busbey suggested the fact that his skull was high implied that these animals seek not to make pressure during the bite indefinitely, but to produce cuts then back quickly so that the bleeding weakens their prey slowly up to devour, similar to the current Komodo dragon, thereby adopting a strategy of stalking in areas where prey transit frequently.|$|E
