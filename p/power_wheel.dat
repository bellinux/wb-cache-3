50|$|Power Racing {{series is}} a racing {{competition}} where teams build a $500 <b>Power</b> <b>Wheel</b> (Or any electric kids’ ride on vehicle.) and modify {{it to go}} {{as fast as it}} can.|$|E
50|$|The {{most famous}} {{competition}} is the World <b>Power</b> <b>Wheel</b> Standing Championships held at Byron Dragway, {{which has been}} televised in SPEED TV's Lucas Oil On the Edge. This competitions attract drivers from Canada and United States of America.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of a player's turn, they draw a card from their deck and gain three Faeria (mana points). If they have control of any of the mana wells, by having a {{creature}} next to it, they gain an extra Faeria point. They may then perform one action from their <b>Power</b> <b>Wheel,</b> play any number of cards limited by how, and/or move any creatures they have on the map, in any order. The <b>Power</b> <b>Wheel</b> allows the player to either gain one Faeria, draw one card, or to place land tiles onto the game board; this can be either two Neutral land tiles, or one tile representing Mountain, Forest, Desert, or Lake. New tiles can only be placed next to tiles the player previously placed, or adjacent to tiles one of their creatures occupy.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, <b>Power</b> <b>Wheels</b> was {{purchased}} by Mattel.

50|$|Byron Dragway is a ¼ mile (402 meter) {{dragstrip}} {{located in}} Byron, Illinois, about 1.5 hours from Chicago (84 miles, 134 km straight-line distance). The dragway was {{opened in the}} 1960s, and at first it ran cars four abreast. However, that practice was discontinued. For that reason, Byron is a comparatively wide track. It is currently {{best known as the}} site of the World <b>Power</b> <b>Wheel</b> Standing Championships.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, Fisher-Price {{undertook}} a monumental recall {{of up to}} 10 million Power Wheels 12 volt and Super 6 volt vehicles manufactured since 1986. The recall and repair program was conducted to replace battery fuses and strengthen battery connectors {{in order to prevent}} the units from overheating. The main difference of a post recall <b>Power</b> <b>Wheel</b> is that the original [...] "H" [...] (or on very early Power Wheels, [...] "S") connectors are removed and replaced with the larger, black [...] "A" [...] connectors. If a Power Wheels ride-on was built in or before 1998 and has the Black [...] "A" [...] connectors, then the recall work has probably been performed.|$|E
50|$|The gearbox {{has shown}} to hold {{more power than}} the factory stated quite reliably. That being said a lower geared final drive helps {{eliminate}} excessive stress on the gears, thus the 3.82 FD (final drive) is weaker than the 4.05 and the now hard to source 4.45 gearset is the strongest. That being said it's not unbreakable in any configuration, especially with a fast spooling turbo to create a low end boost spike. The most common gear to break is third and commonly a boost ramp is tuned in to help save the stock transmission. The later the boost comes in generally the transmission will hold up better as it's not a sudden surge of <b>power.</b> <b>Wheel</b> hop is a killer of transmissions and axles creating excessive stress as the wheels load and unload.|$|E

40|$|Runtime: 05 : 15 minutesMid-drive <b>power</b> <b>wheel</b> chairs (PWC) {{have become}} more popular in recent years. However, due to the {{placement}} of the front casters, the traditional side-mounted footrests have been replaced by a single center-mounted footrest. Unfortunately, center-mounted footrests do not have a lift/lower mechanism that is easily operable by certain PWC users who transfer independently. Many PWC users have limited trunk strength, limited range of motion, decreased sensitivity in their lower body, and lack of fine motor function. This causes difficulty reaching the footrest to raise it. There is a need for a design solution that allows PWC users to independently lift and lower the footrest...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) {{are free}} scale’s {{enabling}} technology for acceleration and pressure sensors. MEMS based sensor products provide an interface that can sense, process and/or control the surrounding environment. Free scale’s MEMS-based sensors are {{a class of}} devices that builds very small electrical and mechanical components on a single chip. MEMS-based sensors are a crucial component in automotive electronics, medical equipment, hard disk drives, computer peripherals, wireless devices and smart portable electronics such as cell phones and PDAs. For automotive safety, acceleration sensors provide crash detection for efficient deployment of forward and side airbags {{as well as other}} automotive safety devices. Accelerometers are also used in electronic stability control (ESC) to measure the lateral acceleration of the vehicle to help drivers maintain control of their vehicles during potentially unstable driving conditions. Acceleration sensors are also part of free scale’s tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) to detect whether the car is moving to save <b>power,</b> <b>wheel</b> speed and/or direction of rotation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMonitoring the ambience's {{condition}} {{is emerging as}} one of the most important issues in mobile robots. While we need to detect and process the condition quickly and efficiently using sensors, they (sensors) introduce extra complexity to the systems. Therefore this paper aims to develop a new method to simplify the sensing process. It describes an experimental process for monitoring path conditions of a <b>power</b> <b>wheel</b> chair inside and outside of the lab. The monitoring method triggers impedance via transduction matrix of the DC motors which run the wheelchair. The matrix is based on the relationship between electrical and mechanical impedance of the motors. A voltage probe and a current probe are used to monitor the changes of voltage and current supplied to the two DC motors of the system while the wheel chair is moving and the signals are recorded by a Digital Signal Analyzer (DSA). The recorded data are processed by MATLAB and the graphs representing various conditions are plotted. The relationship between the conditions of the path and the changes of voltage, current, and impedance of the motors are listed. The use of the method is justified but miniaturization of the voltage and current probes is necessary for real-life implementation of the system...|$|E
30|$|The thermo-alkali {{and metal}} ions stable amylase {{obtained}} from the isolate was further evaluated for its stability towards various organic solvents, surfactants, inhibitors, and detergents. The enzyme solution was initially filtered using nitrocellulose membrane (0.2  µm), and then incubated with 40 % (v/v) of varied polar and non-polar organic solvents viz. n-hexane, n-butanol, benzene, toluene, ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform, acetone, and propanol for 7  days in screw crapped tubes. After required period of incubation, the residual activity of amylase was estimated against the control (enzyme solution without addition of organic solvents) according to the methodology as described earlier. In addition to this, the stability of amylase was determined {{in the presence of}} various surfactants (1 %; Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 60, Tween 80, and SDS), inhibitors (1  mM; EDTA, hydrogen peroxide, and mercaptoethanol), and detergents (1 %; Tide, ARIEL, Surf excel, <b>POWER,</b> <b>Wheel,</b> Nirma, and RIN). The detergent solution was initially boiled for 15 – 20  min to denature or inactivate the existing enzymes that could be incorporated during their formulation. The amylase was then incubated with these detergent solutions, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 24  h. The residual activities of amylase were estimated against the control (enzyme solution devoid of surfactants, inhibitors, and detergents) under standard assay conditions as described earlier.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, Double Axle {{was known}} as [...] "Power Wheels" [...] and the name for export release was ostensibly changed due to Kransco and their line of <b>Power</b> <b>Wheels</b> {{motorized}} toys for children. In this version, all the races ran on a 90-second countdown similar to most racing games at the time, and 60 seconds for the Car Crushing Contest. The objective in <b>Power</b> <b>Wheels</b> is to complete three laps around the selected course before time runs out. After every lap, extra time {{will be added to}} the clock. The game also pits you against a rival driver who will taunt you before the race begins, and vice versa if you pass him during the race. <b>Power</b> <b>Wheels</b> also gives the player three nitro boosters before every race, excluding the Car Crushing Contest, in which the player only gets one.|$|R

40|$|This study unites {{researchers}} from the fields of psychology, occupational therapy, and engineering to improve the holistic physical and psychological well-being of persons {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) by using assistive devices (i. e., wheelchairs) and mobile technology (i. e., cell phone and network). These technologies are used to bring persons with SCI through the difficult period of rehabilitation and to return them to their daily life in school or the working environment. First, a SpinoAid Application (APP) is developed to motivate persons with SCI to participate in the community after their injury. Second, we integrate mobile technology with a mobility assistive device to design a smart wheelchair, which is innovated by transforming the pushrim of a manually driven wheelchair into a rim motor. After the rim motor is combined with a battery, a brake, and a controller to become a <b>power</b> <b>wheel,</b> two power wheels are installed {{on both sides of the}} wheelchair to become a powered wheelchair. Third, a SmartChair APP is developed with the main functions of reminding persons with SCI to perform exercises, recording the physical condition and the wheelchair using status, and building up a social network for information sharing to increase their exercise habit, prevent cumulative injuries or discomfort of the upper extremities, and enhance their health and quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Gross {{efficiency}} {{is a measure}} of the ability to convert stored energy into power and is included as an important element in the majority of performance models. Currently, gross efficiency measured in a laboratory is assumed to be representative of outdoor cycling, despite limited empirical research in the field. PURPOSE: To investigate gross efficiency in an outdoor environment and explore the relationship between laboratory testing at an absolute, relative and Time-Trial (TT) performance intensity. METHODS: 18 trained male cyclists (age 40. 6 ± 9. 4 yrs, mass 82. 7 ± 13. 7 kg, maximum minute power MMP 370. 4 ± 43. 8 W. min- 1, VO 2 max 45. 3 ± 24. 1 ml. kg- 1. min- 1) completed a VO 2 max test inthe laboratory prior to efficiency measurement. Participants cycled at 150 W, 60 %MMP and completed a 16. 109 km TT both in a laboratory and at a closed road circuit. Laboratory (L) and field (F) based tests were randomised and the same portable gas analysis device used for both conditions. Laboratory testing was performed on a stationary ergometer and field testing on the participants’ road bicycle fitted with a <b>power</b> <b>wheel</b> device. RESULTS: Gross efficiency was significantly lower in the field compared to laboratory testing; 150 W (L: 20. 4 %, F: 18. 4 %), 60 % MMP (L: 23. 2 %,F: 21. 3 %) and during TT performance (L: 24. 5 %, F: 21. 7 %), (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence to support the measurement of gross efficiency at performance intensities in the laboratory. These results demonstrate that the measurement of gross efficiency in a field based environment is significantly lower than laboratory measures. These novel findings could be used to optimise outdoor training intensities which otherwise would not have accounted for the observed reductions in gross efficiency. Furthermore these results show the possibility for the underestimation of energy expenditure whilst cycling outside as opposed to a laboratory environment...|$|E
