For multiple myeloma, the SMRs were 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 3 to 2. 5) in the non-exposed group, 1. 4 (95 % CI 0. 2 to 5. 1) in the 6 ppm-years group.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relation}} between exposure and sensitization or {{the appearance of}} symptoms of the eyes and airways was investigated in a cross-sectional study on 32 workers from a plant using epoxy resin {{with a mixture of}} hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) and methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) as a hardener. The main component in the hardener was HHPA, and the geometric mean concentrations of HHPA in the workplaces were extremely low (< 40 µg/m 3) in recent years, compared to the Occupational Exposure Limit-Ceiling for phthalic anhydride (2 mg/m 3). However, specific IgE antibody to HHPA was detected in serum from 8 (25 %) out of the workers: of those, 5 workers experienced symptoms of the eyes and nose during work (group sensitized symptomatic (SS)) and 3 workers did not (group sensitized nonsymptomatic (SN)). The other 24 workers had no signs of sensitization and did not complain of work-related symptoms. Based on occupational history and anamnestic data, it was concluded that one subject in the SS group and all the subjects in the SN group had been sensitized by higher exposures in the past. The symptoms of 4 subjects in the SS group occurred only when carrying out short-time, particular tasks (15 – 30 min) a few times a day, such as the resin mixing procedures, manual application of the resin, or opening of ovens. High <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> were estimated to have occurred during the particular tasks. Our results suggest that short-time <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> may have a great impact on the development of specific IgE or work-related symptoms. Therefore, to minimize the risk of sensitization and work-related symptoms, a reduction of exposure during particular tasks with high <b>peak</b> <b>exposures,</b> along with a decrease in mean 8 -h time-weighted average exposure, should be achieved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} whether chronic airflow limitation and rapid decline in pulmonary function {{were associated with}} <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> to ozone and other irritant gases in pulp mills. Bleachery workers potentially exposed to irritant gassings (n 5178) from three Swedish pulp mills, and a comparison group of workers not exposed to irritant gassings (n 554) from two paper mills, were studied. Baseline surveys occurred in 1995 – 1996, with follow-up surveys in 1998 – 1999. Participants performed spirometry and answered questions regarding ozone, chlorine dioxide (ClO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) gassings. From regression models controlling for potential confounders, declines in both the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (- 24 mL?yr- 1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) (- 19 mL?yr- 1) were associated with ClO 2 /SO 2 gassings. At follow-up, the prevalence of chronic airflow limitation (i. e. FEV 1 /FVC less than the lower limit of normal) was elevated for participants with only pre-baseline ozone gassings and with both pre-baseline and interval ozone gassings, after controlling for potential confounders. These findings suggest that obstructive effects among bleachery workers are associated with ozone gassings, and that adverse effects on spirometry might also accompany chlorine dioxide/ sulphur dioxide gassings. <b>Peak</b> <b>exposures</b> to irritant gases in pulp mills should be prevented...|$|R

In this study we used occupant exposure to pollutants integrated over time (referred to as 'dose') as the metric to evaluate the effectiveness and air quality implications of demand controlled ventilation in residences.

The second is to look at <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> that are associated with time variations in ventilation rates and pollutant generation. The pollutant generation had two components: a background rate associated with the building materials and furnishings and a second component related to occupants.

Methods A prospective cohort study among 1951 office workers was carried out for two years, with periodical questionnaires and continuous measurements of computer input use. To define <b>peak</b> <b>exposure,</b> a distinction was made between peak days and weeks. Peak days were defined as days with a long duration of computer (ie, ≥ 4 hours) or mouse use (ie, ≥ 2. 5 hours) or days with high frequency of mouse (ie, ≥ 20 clicks per minute) or keyboard use (ie, ≥ 160 keystrokes per minute).

40|$|Objectives: To {{effectively}} decrease {{occupational exposure}} to flour dust and related allergens, {{detailed information on}} exposure determinants and effectiveness of control measures is essential. In this paper, we use personal real-time exposure measurements to get more insight into the relationship between specific work characteristics, {{including the use of}} control measures, and (<b>peak)</b> <b>exposure</b> to flour dust. The study has three objectives: (i) identify tasks and activities related to <b>peak</b> <b>exposure,</b> (ii) identify control measures and other important exposure determinants and (iii) assess the potential impact of these control measures on the (<b>peak)</b> <b>exposure</b> to flour dust. Methods: A data set containing 82 real-time exposure measurements in combination with information from detailed observations was used to study the association between peak exposures and different tasks, activities and other determinants such as control measures. Descriptive statistics of <b>peak</b> <b>exposure</b> on job level were generated as well as information on contribution of task-specific peak exposures to time-weighted average (TWA) exposure levels. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of a variety of control measures on task exposure by comparing exposure levels of groups of workers with and without controls. Results: In workers included in this study, > 75 % of TWA exposure is directly associated with peak exposures during a limited set of well-defined tasks/activities. The impact of a single task on population TWA exposure is generally limited (< 40 %). Worker behavior seems an important determinant in effective exposure control for many tasks. Conclusions: Data from real-time measurements provide important detailed information with respect to exposure determinants and control measures, not obtainable from conventional measurement studies focusing at TWA exposure.

40|$|Exposure {{to traffic}} {{pollution}} {{has become an}} increasing concern to public health. A {{number of studies have}} demonstrated that the air people breathe in while in transportation is particularly unsafe due to the high concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), suspended particles (PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1) and ultrafine particles (UFPs). Some studies have suggested that <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> of approximately one hour- a typical time spent in a transport micro-environment- may have more damaging health effects than the 24 - hour sampling times current standards apply to Despite the widespread interest in health effects from exposure to traffic pollutants, there is a distinct lack of research of this kind in New Zealand. The research presented in this thesis was designed to assess the effect of traffic emissions on personal exposure. More specifically, this project intended to examine how exposures differed on different modes of transport and also to investigate the extent to which transport micro-environments such as car parks, bus stops and metro stations contributed to personal exposure levels. This study is the first of its type in New Zealand, which simultaneously monitored CO, PM and UFP concentrations in the transport micro-environment. Vehicular traffic emissions were shown to be a significant source of air pollution in populated urban areas, especially in the transport microenvironment. This results of this study showed that the mode of transport is a significant determinant of personal exposure to pollutants. The information gathered indicated slightly different results for Christchurch and Auckland, possibly due to variations in background levels, traffic counts and meteorological conditions at the time of monitoring. Results from the research also showed that built transport microenvironments could experience extremely high levels of pollutant exposures. Although commuters spend a relatively short time in such environments, such short-term <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> could contribute significantly to adverse health effects. The results presented here have relevance for both public health and for policies aimed at reducing human exposures to traffic-related air pollution.

Distribution of exposure concentration is described as log-normal, which is expressed by two parameters: geometric mean (mg) and geometric stan-dard deviation (sg). mg and sg represent exposure intensity and magnitude of exposure variability, respectively. Autocorrelation is expressed by the autocorrelation coefficient (r). r is the correlation coefficient between two exposure concentrations at different times, and relates to the speed of exposure variability. It is helpful to consider the relationships between these three parameters and Preller et al. ’s four measures of <b>peak</b> <b>exposure.</b> My interpretation is as follows. It was demonstrated that the diurnal distribution of exposure concentration with an average time of 7. 5 – 60 min is log-normal (Kumagai et al., 1995). Although it was not demonstrated that the within-task distribution of exposure concentration with an average time of 5 s to 1 min is log-normal, I assume log-normal distribution in the following discussion. For a log-normal distribution, mean (arithmetic mean, m) is related to mg and sg by the following equation: lnm lnmg þ 0 : 5 ln 2 sg ð 1 Þ Here, the maximum value of exposure concentration is assumed to be the 99 th percentile of the exposure distribution (Cmax) : ln Cmax lnmg þ 2 : 327 ln sg ð 2 Þ Because no correlation between mg and sg was observed among various industries (Kumagai et al., 1999), the effects of variations of mg and sg on m and Cmax can be evaluated separately. According to equations (1) and (2), as mg increases, both m and Cmax increase. Similarly, as sg increases, both m and Cmax increase. Consequently, m and Cmax are positively correlated with each other. The average peak concentration is as follows...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This nested {{case-control study}} {{was based on}} data in a cohort {{study of more than}} 18, 000 {{petroleum}} distribution workers exposed to gasoline, which contains about 2 %- 3 % benzene. Risks of leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and kidney cancer were examined relative to exposure to gasoline. METHODS: For each case, up to five individually matched controls were selected. Analyses based on the Mantel-Haenszel procedure as well as univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression were performed for each disease category. Jobs with similar exposures were grouped into homogeneous categories for analysis. Several quantitative indices of exposure to gasoline were used in the analyses: duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, frequency of <b>peak</b> <b>exposure,</b> and time of first exposure. RESULTS: No increased risks for the four cancers were found for any job category. Analyses with logistic regression models based on duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, and frequency of <b>peak</b> <b>exposure</b> did not show any increased risk or exposure-effect relation. Time of first exposure to gasoline was also found to be unrelated to the four diseases under investigation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to gasoline or benzene at the concentrations experienced by this cohort of distribution workers is not a risk factor for leukaemia (all cell types), acute myeloid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, or kidney cancer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractField {{monitoring}} {{was conducted}} in Bangkok to investigate the situation of traffic emission exposure of roadside pedestrians. From a viewpoint of actual exposure of pedestrians, short-term variations of air pollutant levels are significant, however, such data have been limited until recently. Hence, time-series data of traffic flows, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons monitored by real-time photoelectric aerosol sensors and vehicle exhaust detected as uncomfortable odor to pedestrians were obtained at very fine time resolution and their short-term peak patterns were analyzed by spectral analysis. Furthermore, conditions of the <b>peak</b> <b>exposure</b> occurrences and interrelations of those temporal variations were discusse...|$|E
40|$|Acid {{anhydrides}} are reactive {{organic chemicals}} of {{low molecular weight}} which cause occupational asthma. No previous research {{on the relationship between}} exposure to these chemicals and respiratory sensitization and development of occupational asthma has been reported. A retrospective cohort study was carried out in four factories (three alkyd resin factories and one cushioned flooring factory) to investigate the nature of exposure-response relationships for sensitization to phthalic anhydride (PA), trimellitic anhydride (TMA) and maleic anhydride (MA). This paper describes the results of full-shift and task-specific exposure measurements. Exposure to PA was low in relation to the Occupational Exposure Standard (OES). The highest full-shift PA exposures occurred among resin operators in the resin factory that used solid PA as compared to other resin factories where liquid PA was used. Arithmetic mean exposure levels to TMA and MA in the resin factories were well below their respective OESs. Short-term high exposures occurred during loading of acid anhydrides into the reactors and sampling and testing of the resin. Relatively high full-shift exposure to TMA occurred in the cushioned flooring factory, although no high <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> were detected...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} portable {{local exhaust}} ventilation system was installed in three dental operatories where nitrous oxide was used routinely. Standard methods of exhaust ventilation design used in industry to control exposures to toxic airborne substances were applied to the dental operatory setting. The concentration of nitrous oxide in the dentists' breathing zones was measured before and after installation to determine {{the efficiency of the}} system in reducing occupational exposures. Results indicate that placement of the exhaust opening and exhaust air flow rate are important in determining the degree of control achieved. After the system had been installed in one operatory, <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> declined from over 600 parts per million (ppm) to less than 70 ppm: the time-weighted average exposure was below the NIOSH recommended level of 25 ppm. A permanently installed {{local exhaust ventilation}} system modeled after the portable one used in this pilot study may be feasible for most operatories and should not interfere with dental procedures. The results suggest that nitrous oxide exposures can be greatly reduced if dental operatories are equipped with local exhaust ventilation...|$|R
40|$|During the 1990 s, several {{large-scale}} {{studies of}} benzene concentrations in air, food, and blood {{have added to}} our knowledge of its environmental occurrence. In general, the new studies have confirmed the earlier findings of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies and other large-scale studies in Germany and the Netherlands concerning the levels of exposure and major sources. For example, the new studies found that personal exposures exceeded indoor concentrations of benzene, which in turn exceeded outdoor concentrations. The new studies of food concentrations have confirmed earlier indications that food is not an important pathway for benzene exposure. The results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on blood levels in a nationwide sample of 883 persons are in good agreement with the concentrations in exhaled breath measured in about 800 persons a decade earlier in the TEAM studies. Major sources of exposure continue to be active and passive smoking, auto exhaust, and driving or riding in automobiles. New methods in breath and blood sampling and analysis offer opportunities to investigate short-term <b>peak</b> <b>exposures</b> and resulting body burden under almost any conceivable field conditions...|$|R
