Background Paediatric nurses’ knowledge deficits and negative or inconsistent attitudes toward evidence-based fever management continue to be reported. Limited research explores educational interventions in this area. Method A quasi-experiment was conducted. Data were collected August 2002 to March 2003 inclusive. The PEP was based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Peer support and education were promoted as mechanisms for educating those unable to attend the four one hour sessions. Attendance at two sessions was considered sufficient to precipitate increases in knowledge and positive attitudes. Seventy-seven nurses were eligible to attend the PEP; 74. 0...|$|E
40|$|One {{primary goal}} of cartographic {{research}} is to improve cartographic communication. Psychophysical and cognitive research has assisted {{our understanding of the}} map use process. The present study is from a perspective of maps as a visual language. This study hypothesizes that (1) the map symbol system constitutes a visual ideographic language and (2) cartographic communication may be improved by applying the methods of teaching visual ideographic languages as a second language. Chinese script originated in primitive drawings of concrete things [...] pictographs [...] and ideographs. These became stylized and combined, and were expanded greatly in number. Although the characters came to include phonetic symbols, the script {{can be used as a}} completely visual language and is not structured as a parallel to the phonetic language as are alphabetic languages. Furthermore, written Chinese is processed mentally much more holistically and requires more reader-origin organization than alphabetic languages. maps have all the fundamental attributes of Chinese writing. maps with their many non-phonetic symbols are essentially visual. Both cartographic symbols and early Chinese characters are often mimetic. To understand maps, symbols must be put into relation with other symbols that are not arranged linearly. Similarly, to understand Chinese, each. character must be put into relation with other characters that can be sequenced vertically or horizontally and left to right or right to left. Studies of teaching Chinese as a Second Language stress that a variety of approaches are necessary in teaching such a complex, high-level cognitive process. The basics of lexicon and syntax need rote learning, substitution exercises and much experience. All these components and approaches could be applied to a map use teaching <b>programme.</b> (<b>Abstract</b> shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Good Foundations: An Analysis of the Configurations of Factors Affecting Success in Non-Traditional Students on a Foundation <b>Programme</b> <b>Abstract</b> In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a strong focus on {{educational}} policies to improve social mobility with universities required to demonstrate through their Fair Access Agreements what action they are taking with regard to making Higher Education available to underrepresented groups. The literature review presented here used the ideas of Bourdieu to examine which groups are underrepresented in Higher Education and to explore to what extent this underrepresentation may be attributed to poor initial education, recruitment bias on the part of institutions or an alienation on behalf of the learner with the dominant culture found in Higher Education. Some of the different approaches to widening participation were considered, focusing on the role of Foundation Programmes in order to site the programme analysed in this thesis in the range of widening participation activity generally and the national Foundation Programme sector specifically. The literature on graduateness and academic thinking skills was explored as a way of articulating a desirable outcome for degree preparation in a research intensive university. This then led to an examination of the issues around teaching and learning for non-traditional students. The research described in this thesis was conducted on the factors affecting successful outcomes for students studying on the Foundation Programme at Durham University using both available audit-style demographic and academic outcome data for seven cohorts of Foundation students and a more in-depth analysis of one cohort. The data were analysed using the relatively novel approach of Qualitative Comparative analysis as this case-led approach retains the nuances within the data and allows for the variety of different combinations of factors within individual students. The results show that there were a range of combinations of factors leading to a successful outcome for students, that previous qualifications were not necessary for success, but that attitudinal factors, as measured using a Conscientiousness Index, were important. A link was established between an ability to use concepts of evidence, a high average score on the Foundation Programme and achievement of a good honours degree. The implications of the results were then considered in respect of taking a deficit approach to remedy gaps in initial education, aspects of recruitment policy for non-traditional students and managing diversity of learner identity. ...|$|E

A sinusoidal external electric field is applied during the molecular dynamics simulation of an electrolyte, the ionic current response varies in magnitude and phase shift depending on the frequency and magnitude applied. The frequency dependent current response reveals the relaxation dynamics of the electrolyte. The electrolytes studied include aqueous electrolyte confined in a cylindrical nanopore with a smooth wall and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The aqueous electrolyte was modeled by both a primitive model and a solvent primitive model. The YSZ electrolyte was modeled by a Born-Meyer-Buckingham (BMB) model. While the two cases are very different in geometry and molecular details, both show similar features in the AC-NEMD current response with a maximum conductivity at an optimum frequency and resistance-capacitance-inductance (RLC) circuit behavior. For ions confined in a cylindrical channel, the capacitance behavior {{can be explained by}} confinement effect and single-file motion of ions. On the other hand, the barriers along the passage between oxygen vacancy sites in YSZ may provide a similar effect of “confinement”. In the AC-NEMD, the generated ohmic heat is effectively removed, and a constant temperature is maintained by either an Anderson thermostat or a Nose-Hoover thermostat.

It considers the implications for public policy of these ‘twin imperatives for action’. The first chapter describes and explains the changing age structure of the Caribbean population. Important features of the ageing dynamic, such as differential regional and national trends and the growing number of ‘older old’ persons, are also analysed. The study then describes the progress that has been made in advancing and clarifying the human rights of older persons in international law. The core of the study then consists of an assessment of the current situation of older persons in the Caribbean {{and the extent to which}} their human rights are realised in practice. The thematic areas of economic security, health, and enabling environments – which roughly correspond to the three priority areas of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing – are each addressed in individual chapters. These chapters evaluate national policies and programmes for older persons and make public policy recommendations intended to protect and fulfil the human rights of older persons.

COSCH is a forum open to organisations, institutions and companies interested in collaboration within the emerging field of precise spectral and spatial imaging techniques, in physical and chemical sciences applied to cultural heritage objects, {{as well as in}} research and applications to conservation and art-historical analysis of such objects. COSCH started in November 2012. Funded by COST, an intergovernmental framework for European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COSCH networking activities enable knowledge exchange and coordination of nationally-funded research on a European level with occasional contribution of experts from other countries. Funding has been made available for four years (2012 – 2016). Participation is open to researchers across a wide range of disciplines, including computer scientists and museum professionals, art historians and academics in heritage-related fields. COSCH is a trans-domain Action (TD 1201) of the COST Domain Materials, Physics and Nanosciences (MPNS) which facilitates and promotes innovation in material science. The work of COSCH is defined in the Memorandum of Understanding between the COST Office and the Chairman of COSCH. The Memorandum is available from [URL] alongside the latest progress report and other documents.

40|$|Almost {{two decades}} after the {{proclamation}} of {{the goal of a}} "drug-free world", the global illicit drug trade is flourishing. The markets and routes, however, are constantly changing, confronting countries and regions with an array of new challenges. West African countries in particular are no longer merely transit zones for cocaine or heroin. Yet they played virtually no role in the preparations for the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS) in late April 2016. Nonetheless, the UNGASS process has injected fresh momentum into the drug policy debate within the region. This offers starting points for new partnerships, particularly with Europe, since various West African countries and organizations have moved closer to the EU's comparatively progressive drug policy position.

However, reports have shown a gap between professional education and professional practice. Data used in this study are taken from surveys among students, college teachers and placement supervisors. The results of this study do not corroborate with the notion of clashing epistemological beliefs between the educational field and the field of practice. However, the results do indicate that the way theories are taught and how students study may influence student views of the importance of theoretical knowledge for professional practice. The general teacher-training programme, more than the other programmes, faces challenges in linking theory to practice. The nursing programme also encounters difficulties in college teachers being able to relate some of the nursing-specific theories to practice in the classroom setting. Moreover, the findings imply that not only programme coherence, but also students’ study efforts might be essential aspects in explaining why some students do not perceive theoretical knowledge as important for professional practic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Self-Organized Symposium: Research and Policies on ECEC-Systems and Programmes do {{commonly}} ask for {{the effects}} of such adult strategies for children, but merely forget to highlight children’s active participation in it. On the contrary, the symposium focuses ECEC systems and programmes from the ‘vantage point of children’. Three papers from two respective ethnographic research projects are presented. The first two papers presenting the ongoing Luxembourgian research project “CHILD”. It ask how the heterogeneous Luxembourgian field of ECEC unfolds in a plurality of individual care arrangements which are shaped through an interplay of policies, familial and ECEC-institutional practices and children’s daily participation on both. The third paper is asking how children are constructing the daily practices of German kindergartens as an educational setting. By that, the three papers show how a strong notion on children as actors of ECEC bring into light the collective and individuated ‘hidden curriculums’ of ECEC Systems and <b>Programmes.</b> <b>Abstract</b> Presentation: The heterogeneous Luxembourgian field of ECEC unfolds in a plurality of individual care arrangements which are commonly shaped by several horizontal transitions {{during the course of a}} child’s day and, therefore, create distinct spaces of practice and actor ship. The Luxembourgian CHILD-Study focuses those daily border crossings of 2 - 4 year olds as their own unique tasks in the daily accomplishment of their 'day-care-childhoods'. The analyses transforms Dencik’s research on children’s ‘dual socialisation’ into a practice-theoretical frame on both, children’s active contribution to their daily care arrangements and the multiple processes of positioning they are involved i. Practice-Theory (Schatzki), children as actors and their interpretive reproduction of institutional orders (Corsaro), transitions as practices (Brooker) and Work-Border-Theory (Campbell Clark). Actor-centred childhood sociology (Corsaro), Practice-analytical ethnography (Lofland), field research, mainly participant (camera-) observation of contrastive daily schedules, settings and practices of 12 - 15 children and their care-arrangements, here focusing on departing/arriving-scenes. Ethnographic research is dialogical in principle, based on an ongoing establishment of trustful partnerships with all participants and an awareness of symbolic power in adult-child-relationships. The paper focuses the border crossing practices of children in ECEC as the localised interconnections (Schatzki) of the ECEC-Policies, familial care strategies and organisational routines. Border-Work-Theory is used as a heuristic to highlight how children are actively involved in socio-material practices of setting up and crossing borders and therefore are active participants of several individual and collective ‘borderlands’ in ECEC. The research findings inform ECEC policy and practice about ‘collective’ and ‘individualised’ informal learning processes of children in ECEC...|$|R
