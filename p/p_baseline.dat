40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x 3 B 1;) on intestinal permeability (IP) in mice with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), and the expression of tight junction proteins. METHODS: We selected D-lactate as an index of IP, induced FHF using D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide and D-galactosamine/TNF-&#x 3 B 1;, assessed the results using an enzymatic-spectrophotometric method, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effect of the administration of anti-TNF-&#x 3 B 1; immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, before the administration of D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide, on TNF-&#x 3 B 1; was also assessed. RESULTS: IP was significantly increased in the mouse model of FHF 6 h after injection (13. 57 1; 1. 70 mg/L, 13. 02 1; 1. 97 mg/L vs 3. 76 1; 0. 67 mg/L, P = 0. 001). Electron microscopic analysis revealed tight junction (TJ) disruptions, epithelial cell swelling, and atrophy of intestinal villi. Expression of occludin and claudin- 1 mRNA was significantly decreased in both FHF models (occludin: 0. 57 1; 0. 159 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 000; claudin- 1 : 0. 3067 1; 0. 1291 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 003), as were the distribution density of proteins in the intestinal mucosa and the levels of occludin and claudin- 1 protein (occludin: 0. 61 1; 0. 0473 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 000; claudin- 1 : 0. 6633 1; 0. 0328 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 000). Prophylactic treatment with anti-TNF-&#x 3 B 1; IgG antibody prevented changes in IP (4. 50 1; 0. 97 mg/L vs 3. 76 1; 0. 67 mg/L, P = 0. 791), intestinal tissue ultrastructure, and the mRNA levels of occludin and claudin- 1 expression (occludin: 0. 8865 1; 0. 0274 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 505; claudin- 1 : 0. 85 1; 0. 1437 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 1), and in the protein levels (occludin: 0. 9467 1; 0. 0285 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> > 0. 05; claudin- 1 : 0. 9533 1; 0. 0186 fold vs <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 148). CONCLUSION: Increased in IP stemmed from the downregulation of the TJ proteins occludin and claudin- 1, and destruction of the TJ in the colon, which were induced by TNF-&#x 3 B 1; in FHF mice...|$|R
40|$|Background: Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} {{is associated}} with vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the frequency of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and cardiovascular function before and after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Methods: We compared predialytic and intradialytic blood pressure, left and right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF), and cardiothoracic ratio 1 month before PTX, and 6 and 12 months after PTX. IDH was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in mean arterial pressure ≥ 10 mmHg. Results: At the time of PTX, the mean age of the patients was 57. 4 ± 12. 0 years, and the mean dialysis vintage was 12. 2 ± 5. 8 years. At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after PTX, the average numbers of sessions disturbed by IDH during 13 dialysis sessions (1 month) were 6. 4, 3. 9 (<b>p</b> vs. <b>baseline),</b> and 4. 0 sessions (<b>p</b> vs. <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 801 vs. 6 months), respectively. LVEF and RVEF were improved significantly after PTX. Furthermore, volume status was also improved, as evidenced by the significantly greater ultrafiltration volume and reduced cardiothoracic ratio.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the potential for allergen to modulate T cell expression of the CysLT 1 receptor and responsiveness to leukotrienes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from house dust mite-allergic or nonallergic individuals were incubated with D. pteronyssinus allergen (Der <b>p).</b> <b>Baseline</b> CysLT 1 expression was similar in both groups of donors, but Der p significantly enhanced CysLT 1 expression in CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells of only allergic individuals and induced enhanced responsiveness of CD 4 + T cells to LTD 4 in terms of calcium mobilisation. This effect was prevented by the CysLT 1 antagonist MK 571. Der p also induced IL- 4 and IL- 10 production, and neutralizing antibody to IL- 4 prevented both the enhanced CysLT 1 expression and the enhanced responsiveness of T cells to LTD 4 induced by Der p. In allergic individuals, Der p also induced T cell proliferation and a Th 2 -biased phenotype. Our data suggest that, in allergen-sensitized individuals, exposure to allergen can enhance T cell expression of CysLT 1 receptors through a mechanism involving IL- 4 production. This, in turn, would induce CD 4 + T cell responsiveness to cysteinyl-leukotrienes and Th 2 cell activation...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptides such as neurokinin A (NKA) {{have been}} {{proposed}} as important mediators of bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma. Inhaled NKA causes bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma, but not in normal subjects. This is possibly due to the activity of an endogenous neuropeptide-degrading enzyme: neutral endopeptidase (NEP). We investigated whether a NEP-inhibitor, thiorphan, reveals bronchoconstriction to NKA or NKA-induced changes in airway responsiveness to methacholine in normal humans in vivo. Eight normal male subjects participated in a double-blind crossover study, using thiorphan as pretreatment to NKA challenge. Dose-response curves to inhaled NKA (8 to 1, 000 micrograms/ml, 0. 5 ml/dose) were recorded on 2 randomized days 1 wk apart, and methacholine tests were performed 48 h before and 24 h after the NKA challenge. Ten minutes prior to NKA challenge the subjects inhaled either thiorphan (2. 5 mg/ml, 0. 5 ml) or placebo. To detect a possible nonspecific effect of thiorphan, we investigated {{the effect of the}} same pretreatment with thiorphan or placebo on the dose-response curve to methacholine in a separate set of experiments. The response was measured by the flow from standardized partial expiratory flow-volume curves (V 40 p), expressed in percent fall from baseline. NKA log dose-response curves were analyzed using the area under the curve (AUC) and the response to the highest dose of 1, 000 micrograms/ml (V 40 p, 1000). The methacholine dose-response curves were characterized by their position (PC 40 V 40 p) and the maximal-response plateau (MV 40 <b>p).</b> <b>Baseline</b> V 40 p was not affected by either pretreatment (p greater than 0. 15).

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we have shown that inhibition of the endogenous neuropeptide-degrading enzyme, neutral endopeptidase (NEP), potentiates airway narrowing to neurokinin A (NKA) in normal humans in vivo. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that hyperresponsiveness to NKA in asthma {{is caused by a}} reduction in endogenous NEP activity. To that end, we used the NEP inhibitor, thiorphan, or placebo as inhaled pretreatment to NKA challenge in eight atopic asthmatic men, who were controlled by on-demand usage of beta 2 -agonists alone. The dose of thiorphan pretreatment was obtained from pilot experiments in which 0. 5 ml of a 2. 5 -mg/ml concentration appeared to be the maximally effective nebulized dose. Dose-response curves to inhaled NKA (1 to 125 micrograms/ml, 0. 5 ml/dose) were recorded on 2 randomized days 1 wk apart, in a cross-over study. To detect any effects of thiorphan on bronchoconstriction per se, we also investigated the effect of thiorphan or placebo on the dose-response curve to inhaled methacholine in a separate set of experiments. The response was measured by FEV 1 and by partial expiratory flow-volume curves (V 40 p). The position of the dose-response curves was expressed as the concentration causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 FEV 1) or a 40 % fall in V 40 p (PC 40 V 40 <b>p).</b> <b>Baseline</b> FEV 1 and V 40 p were not affected by either pretreatment (p > 0. 06).

40|$|Background—Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) is {{currently}} clinically performed {{with either a}} CO 2 or Ho:YAG laser {{for the treatment of}} severe angina. While both lasers provide symptomatic relief, there are significant differences in the laser–tissue interactions specific to each device that may impact their ability to enhance the perfusion of myocardium and thereby improve contractile function of the ischemic heart. Methods—A porcine model of chronic myocardial ischemia was employed. After collecting baseline functional data with cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dobutamine stress echo (DSE), 14 animals underwent TMR with either a CO 2 or Ho:YAG laser. Transmural channels were created with each laser in a distribution of 1 /cm 2 in the ischemic zone. Six weeks post-treatment repeat MRI as well as DSE were obtained after which the animals were sacrificed. Histology was preformed to characterize the laser–tissue interaction. Results—CO 2 TMR led to improvement in wall thickening in the ischemic area as seen with cine MRI (40. 3 % vs. <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05) and DSE (20. 2 % increase vs. <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05). Ho:YAG treated animals had no improvement in wall thickening by MRI (− 11. 6 % vs. <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> =. 67) and DSE (− 16. 7 % vs. <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 08). Correlative semi-quantitative histology revealed a significantly higher fibrosis index in Ho:YAG treated myocardium versus CO 2 (1. 81 vs. 0. 083, P < 0. 05). Conclusions—In a side-by-side comparison CO 2 TMR resulted in improved function of ischemic myocardium as assessed by MRI and echocardiography. Ho:YAG TMR led to no improvement in regional function likely due to concomitant increase in fibrosis in the lasered area...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveAntegrade {{cerebral}} perfusion {{is widely}} used in neonatal heart surgery, yet commonly used flow rates have never been standardized. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the antegrade cerebral perfusion flow rate that most closely matches standard cardiopulmonary bypass conditions. MethodsNine neonatal piglets underwent deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass at a total body flow of 100  mL/kg/min (baseline). Antegrade cerebral perfusion was conducted via innominate artery cannulation at perfusion rates of 10, 30, and 50 mL/kg/min in random order. Cerebral blood flow was measured using fluorescent microspheres. Regional oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen extraction were monitored. ResultsCerebral blood flow was as follows: baseline, 60 ± 17 mL/ 100 g/min; antegrade cerebral perfusion at 50  mL/kg/min, 56 ± 17 mL/ 100 g/min; antegrade cerebral perfusion at 30 mL/kg/min, 36 ± 9 mL/ 100 g/min; and antegrade cerebral perfusion at 10 mL/kg/min, 13 ± 6 mL/ 100 g/min. At an antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 50 mL/kg/min, cerebral blood flow matched <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> =. 87), as did regional oxygen saturation (P =. 13). Antegrade cerebral perfusion at 30 mL/kg/min provided approximately 60 % of baseline cerebral blood flow (P <. 002); however, regional oxygen saturation was equal to <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> =. 93). Antegrade cerebral perfusion at 10 mL/kg/min provided 20 % of baseline cerebral blood flow (P <. 001) and a lower regional oxygen saturation than <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> =. 011). Cerebral oxygen extraction at antegrade cerebral perfusion rates of 30 and 50 mL/kg/min was equal to <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> =. 53,. 48) but greater than <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> <. 0001) at an antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 10 mL/kg/min. The distributions of cerebral blood flow and regional oxygen saturation were equal in each brain hemisphere at all antegrade cerebral perfusion rates. ConclusionCerebral blood flow increased with antegrade cerebral perfusion rate. At an antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 50 mL/kg/min, cerebral blood flow was equal to baseline, but regional oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen extraction trends suggested more oxygenation than baseline. An antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 30 mL/kg/min provided only 60 % of baseline cerebral blood flow, but cerebral oxygen extraction and regional oxygen saturation were equal to baseline. An antegrade cerebral perfusion rate that closely matches standard cardiopulmonary bypass conditions is between 30 and 50 mL/kg/min...|$|R

BLPs are hydrolyzed by the enzyme CD 10 /neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (CD 10 /NEP) which {{is expressed in}} bronchial epithelium and functions to inhibit BLP-mediated growth of small cell lung carcinomas. To determine whether CD 10 /NEP regulates peptide-mediated lung development, we administered a specific CD 10 /NEP inhibitor, SCH 32615, to fetal mice in utero from gestational days e 15 - 17. Fetal lung tissues were evaluated on e 18 for: (a) growth using [3 H]thymidine incorporation into nuclear DNA; and (b) maturation using: [3 H]-choline incorporation into surfactant phospholipids, electron microscopy for type II pneumocytes, and Northern blot analyses for surfactant apoproteins A, B, and C. Inhibition of CD 10 /NEP stimulated [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (70 % above <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 005), [3 H]choline incorporation into surfactant phospholipids (38 % above <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 005), increased numbers of type II pneumocytes (36 % above <b>baseline,</b> <b>P</b> = 0. 07), and fivefold higher surfactant protein A transcripts (P < 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractPericardial {{effusion}} {{is associated}} with an abnormal increase in respiratory variation in mitral flow velocity. However, {{the relation of the}} changes in flow velocity to pericardial pressure, hemodynamics and two-dimensional echocardiographic findings is not established. Therefore, 11 sedated dogs with extensive hemodynamic instrumentation were studied with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during four stages of progressively larger pericardial effusion. During all stages of effusion, respiratory variation in peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole and left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time was increased compared with <b>baseline</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). This increase was seen at the earliest stage of effusion (mean pericardial pressure 4. 2 ± 1. 4 versus − 0. 8 ± 0. 9 mm Hg at <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 05), and preceded the appearance of unequivocal diastolic right heart collapse in every dog. Maximal respiratory variation coincided with the appearance of right atrial collapse (mean pericardial pressure 7. 1 ± 2. 4 mm Hg; mean inspiratory decrease in aortic pressure 9. 5 ± 2. 6 mm Hg; mean aortic pressure 88. 2 ± 15. 2 versus 102. 2 ± 11. 2 mm Hg at <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 05; and cardiac output 3. 8 ± 1. 2 versus 5. 5 ± 1, 3 liters/min at <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 05), but did not increase at stages associated with more severe hemodynamk compromise. In addition, the respiratory changes in peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole were associated with simultaneous changes in the diastolic transmitral pressure gradient. It is concluded that in this model of acute pericardial effusion 1) increased respiratory variation in early diastolic mitral flow velocity, peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole and left ventricular isovolumaetric relaxation time occurs almost immediately as pericardial pressure increases and persists at all stages of increasing pericardial effusion; 2) the abnormal respiratory variation occurs before equalization of intracardiac pressures and before the onset of unequivocal right heart collapse; 3) the respiratory variation occurs as a result of changes in the diastolk transmitral pressure gradient; and 4) the magnitude of the respiratory change is not necessarily predictive of pericardial pressure or severity of hemodynamic compromise, especially at the more severe stages of pericardial effusion...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Objective of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} prognostic indicators for the outcome of resective peri-implantitis treatment, by an analysis of the pooled data of two previously conducted randomized controlled trials. Material and methods: Data of 74 patients with peri-implantitis (187 implants) who had received resective surgical treatment were available. Primary outcome variable was failure of peri-implantitis treatment after 12 months. Multilevel univariable and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of various potentially prognostic indicators on the primary outcome. Results: Peri-implantitis treatment was unsuccessful in 106 implants (57 %) and 48 patients (67 %) after 12 months. In the multiple regression analysis, the variables "order of inclusion" (P = 0. 016) and mean bone loss at <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 030) were significant prognostic indicators for treatment failure. To eliminate the effect of " order of inclusion," post hoc analyses were carried out in a subgroup of patients. The univariable post hoc analysis showed a significant association for smoking (P = 0. 015), maximum pocket depth at <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 073), mean bone loss at <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 003), and presence of plaque (P = 0. 100). In the multiple regression post hoc analysis, only the variables smoking (P = 0. 044) and mean bone loss (P = 0. 043) remained statistically significant. Conclusions: The outcome of surgical peri-implantitis treatment is influenced by the experience of the surgical team with the surgical procedure. The observed learning effect has consequences for clinical practice and for conducting and interpreting clinical trials on peri-implantitis treatment. Other prognostic indicators are amount of peri-implant bone loss at baseline and smoking, and to a lesser extent, probing pocket depth at baseline and presence of plaque during follow-up. Early diagnosis of peri-implantitis and control of behavioral factors are crucial in achieving periimplantitis treatment success...|$|R

40|$|Administration of timolol to one eye is {{associated}} with a decrease in intraocular pressure in both eyes. To further investigate this effect the contralateral decrease in intraocular pressure was measured in a three arm crossover study using a 0. 1 mg dose of timolol given topically to an eye, a 0. 1 mg dose of timolol given lingually, and a placebo given topically. Two hours after topical timolol administration the mean intraocular pressure reduction in the fellow eye was 3. 1 mm Hg compared with <b>baseline</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 0007). Two hours after lingual timolol administration the mean intraocular pressure reduction was 3. 9 mm Hg compared with <b>baseline</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 0004). Two hours after topical administration of placebo the mean intraocular pressure reduction in the fellow eye was only 0. 33 mm Hg (p = 0. 6). These findings suggest the contralateral reduction in intraocular pressure from timolol is caused by systemic absorption. The significant intraocular pressure reduction obtained from lingual timolol raises the possibility that this route of drug administration may be useful in selected patients who cannot use eye drops...|$|R

40|$|Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) {{is a rare}} {{hereditary}} disorder {{characterized by}} dermal accumulation of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. Following sunlight exposure, the resulting photosensitivity is manifested first as pain, later as erythema, edema and dermal lesions. Afamelanotide (Nle(4) -D-Phe(7) -alpha-MSH), a synthetic analog of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and agonist of the melanocortin- 1 -receptor, promotes melanin synthesis, increasing skin pigmentation. This study examines the efficacy of afamelanotide in preventing symptoms in patients with EPP. A sustained-release subcutaneous implant of 20 mg afamelanotide was administered twice, with a 60 -day interval to five EPP patients. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by a photoprovocation test using standardized white light irradiation, melanin density (MD) determination and daily recording of sunlight exposure and symptoms. From Day 30 to Day 120 tolerance to photoprovocation significantly increased compared with <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 007) and skin MD {{was significantly higher than}} that recorded at <b>baseline</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 004).

We carried out a randomized controlled trial, studying 106 veterans with SCI from three Veterans Affairs rehabilitation centers. Each participant received either five one-on-one WSTP or EC sessions 30 - 45 minutes in duration. The main outcome measures were the total and subtotal percentage capacity scores from the Wheelchair Skills Test 4. 1 (WST) and Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) scores. Participants in the WSTP group improved their total and Advanced-level WST scores by 7. 1 % and 30. 1 % relative to <b>baseline</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001) and retained their scores at one year follow-up.

40|$|Introduction The {{trend of}} the past few years shows that the {{proportion}} of overweight or obese people rises and in future will keep rising. Recently lots about the endocrine and metabolic effects of adipose tissue got known. It alters the myocardial metabolism indirectly via inflammatory processes and reduction of insulin sensitivity as well as directly by releasing free fatty acids. In combination with higher volume load due to greater body mass the heart of overweight or obese people is exposed to a higher risk of myocardial remodelling. In the later course this results in eccentric hypertrophy and heart failure whereas at earlier stages the intrinsic mechanical features of the myocardium is altered by hypertrophy and fibrosis. First the energy dependent active Relaxation in early diastole is impaired, later the myocardial compliance sinks. All this leads to diastolic dysfunction. To detect and prevent these developments at a reversible stage is of great medical and economic interest. Aim The goal of this study was to characterise the cardiac structure and function of obviously healthy overweight or obese women and men in the context of their metabolic milieus and to investigate the effects of a carbohydrate reduced, fat liberalised (low-carb) versus a fat reduced, carbohydrate liberalised (low-fat) diet using magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. Methods 240 overweight or obese subjects were randomised to an either six-month low-carb or low-fat diet. Additionally a third study group was intended in the setting of a phase IV-study taking Rimonabant 20 mg/d. After negative risk-benefit analysis considering this drug the investigation had to be cancelled prematurely. As consequence the evaluation of the follow up data considering this subgroup was not possible. Besides laboratory studies, 24 h-blood pressure measurements and spiroergometry at baseline and after six month MR tomography and spectroscopy were performed at a 1. 5 T MR scanner. Using a 12 channel cardiac coil cine images of the heart in the 2, 3 and 4 chamber view were shot by a balanced steady state free precession sequence. T 1 weighted turbo spin and gradient echo sequences were used to acquire thoracal and abdominal axial slices. Under involvement of a 1 H single voxel spectroscopy sequence the relative myocardial triglyceride content (MTG) in a 6 - 8 x 20 x 25 mm 3 voxel of the interventricular septum was assessed. Results Follow up data of 93 out of 190 included subjects (body mass index (BMI) 33. 50 ± 4. 07 kg/m 2, 26. 1 - 45. 4 kg/m 2) were recorded. At baseline 48 % of participants had insulin resistance. 10 subjects had a hypertensive 24 h blood pressure. The left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was 0. 60 ± 0. 05, the cardiac index (CI) 3. 20 ± 0. 52 l/min/m 2, LV mass (LVM) 89. 77 g (25 % 78. 64 g, 75 % 105. 77 g) and peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) 22. 04 ± 5. 44 ml/min/kg. Peak early diastolic filling rate (PFRe) was 555. 28 ± 140. 51 ml/s, PFRe/PFRa 1. 42 ± 0. 47, early diastolic longitudinal lengthening velocity (E’) 11. 26 ± 3. 02 cm/s and E/E’ 7. 12 ± 2. 42. An association between the diastolic function and glucose metabolism, VO 2 max and left atrial (LA) volume was found. The diastolic function correlated negatively to age. MTG was dependent on VO 2 max. After the six-month intervention period no significant difference in diet efficacy could be regarded. Overall subjects lost 7. 76 ± 4. 63 % (p < 0. 0005 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = not significant (ns) between groups) of body weight. The systolic 24 h blood pressure sank (p < 0. 01 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = ns between groups). EF changed to none of the diets significantly. LVM decreased by 5. 86 ± 5. 63 % (p < 0. 0005 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = ns between groups). CI got 6. 47 ± 16. 04 % (p < 0. 0005 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = ns between groups) minor. VO 2 max rose significantly (p < 0. 0005 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = ns between groups). The diets’ effect on parameters of diastolic function was inconsistent. PFRe, E’ and E/E’ sank (each p < 0, 005 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = ns between groups). PFRe/PFRa remained unchanged. MTG decreased in response to both diets by 22. 93 ± 36. 21 % (p < 0. 05 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = ns between groups). The insulin sensitivity grew (p < 0, 0005 compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = ns between groups). As independent variables of the intervention caused changes of the diastolic function the differences of the heart rate (PFRe, E’, E/E’) and glucose metabolism (E’, E/E’) were identified. Discussion The identified cases of occult insulin resistance and arterial hypertension show the frequent comorbidity of overweight or obese people. The parameters of cardiac structure and function were in the normal range. Additionally it was shown that both low-carb and low-fat diets effectively reduce body weight, LVM and MTG. The sunk CI in combination with the lowered systolic 24 h blood pressure allows to claim for an minor neurohumoral activation. For assessment of the diastolic function an innovative volumetry based MR method was employed. In the application however it emerged that due to the laborious post processing it is not yet suitable for clinical routine. As validation is still lacking, the results about the diastolic function have experimental character. The constellation of values indicates an improvement in consequence to both diets. A continuous optimization of methods and a confirmation of results in large multi centre trials should be performed. Both low-carb and low-fat diets effectively reduce body weight and have beneficiary effects on the cardiometabolic milieu, myocardial metabolism as well as cardiac structure and function...|$|R

Conflicting evidence on sample {{stability and handling}} procedures continue to limit the widespread clinical use of these tests. We assessed the factors that altered the stability of insulin and C-peptide in blood. METHODS: We investigated the impact of preservative type, time to centrifugation, storage conditions and duration of storage on the stability of C-peptide and insulin on three different analytical platforms. RESULTS: C-peptide was stable for at least 24 hours at room temperature in both centrifuged and whole blood collected in K(+) -EDTA and serum gel tubes, {{with the exception of}} whole blood serum gel, which decreased to 78 % of baseline at 24 hours, (p = 0. 008). Insulin was stable at room temperature for 24 hours in both centrifuged and whole blood collected in K(+) -EDTA tubes. In contrast insulin levels decreased in serum gel tubes both centrifuged and whole blood (66 % of <b>baseline,</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 01 and 76 % of <b>baseline</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 01, by 24 hours respectively). C-peptide and insulin remained stable after 6 freeze-thaw cycles.

Twenty KPDM patients and twelve type 1 diabetic patients (T 1 DM), evaluated at baseline, 12 and 24 months with/without insulin maintenance underwent a standardized mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) for 2 h. At baseline, triglyceride and C 3 were higher during MMTT in KPDM vs. T 1 DM (p< 0. 0001) with {{no differences in}} non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) while Acylation Stimulating Protein (ASP) tended to be higher.
