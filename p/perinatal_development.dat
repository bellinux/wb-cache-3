Special attention was paid to uncoupling proteins UCP 1 and UCP 2 in the inner mitochondrial membrane, with the intention to describe tissue-specific changes of UCP 1 and UCP 2 gene expression during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development,</b> to characterise the molecular control of brown fat-specific expression of UCP 1 gene and verify the hypothesis whether uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in white adipose tissue may reduce adiposity. The most significant results were: finding of significant differences in the timing of UCP 1 gene recruitment in brown fat during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development</b> in different species of mammals; discovery of the vast changes in the UCP 2 gene expression in the liver during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development,</b> the changes associated with unique synthesis of UCP 2 in monocyte/macrophages cells in liver; identification of two key hormones that induce UCP 1 gene in brown adipocytes, catecholamines and triiodothyronine, and the regulatory sequences in the UCP 1 gene promoter involved in the induction; development of the first in vitro model of differentiation of brown adipocytes; finding that lower efficiency of mitochondrial energy conversion in white adipocytes may reduce adiposity and prevent development of obesity and finding that adiposity reduction due to mitochondrial uncoupling results mainly from the depression of in situ fatty acids synthesis in white adipose tissue.

40|$|The {{process of}} the sexual {{differentiation}} of the brain represents a valuable model system {{for the study of}} the chemical modification of the mammalian brain. Although there are numerous functional and structural sex differences in the adult brain, these are imposed on an essentially feminine or bipotential brain by testicular hormones during a critical phase of <b>perinatal</b> <b>development</b> in the rat. It is suggested that a relatively marked structural sex difference in the rat brain, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA), is a morphological signature of the permanent or organizational action of estradiol derived from the aromatization of testicular testosterone. The SDN-POA of the male rat is severalfold larger in volume and is composed of more neurons than that of the female. The observation that the mitotic formation of the neurons of the SDN-POA is specifically prolonged has enabled us to identify the time course and pathway of neuronal migration into the nucleus. Study of the development of the SDN-POA suggests that estradiol in the male increases the number of neurons which survive a phase of neuronal death by exerting a neurite growth promoting action and/or a direct neuronotrophic action. It may not be possible to extrapolate this trophic effect of estradiol to all other structural sex differences since in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, steroid exposure reduces the number of immunohistochemically defined dopaminergic neurons. Finally, although it is clear that gonadal hormones have dramatic permanent effects on the brain during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development,</b> even after puberty and in adulthood gonadal steroids can alter neuronal structure and, perhaps as a corollary to this, have permanent effects on reproductive function. For example, in the lightly androgenized rat which exhibits the delayed anovulation syndrome, exposure to estrogen prepubertally delays the onset of ovulatory failure, whereas estrogen exposure peri- or post-pubertally has an inhibitory effect on ovulation. Although the brain may be most sensitive to gonadal hormones or exogenous chemical factors during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development,</b> such sensitivity does not appear limited to this period...|$|E

The relative rates of UDP glucuronyltransferase and beta-glucuronidase were studied during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development</b> in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues to determine the net balance of glucuronidation or deglucuronidation at different developmental stages. In general, deglucuronidation predominated over glucuronidation in fetal tissues whereas the converse was evident in adults. 2, 3, 7, 8 -Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an extremely toxic contaminant of some organochlorine compounds, was {{shown to be a}} potent inducer of some hepatic and extrahepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. TCDD, administered during gestation, induced the postnatal activities of p-nitrophenol glucuronyltransferase and benzpyrene hydroxylase in rats. Foster mother experiments revealed that the postnatal induction was caused primarily by newborn exposure to TCDD in the mother's milk. Tissue distribution experiments with TCDD- 14 C confirmed these findings. Although TCDD induced non-steroid glucuronidation, no significant effects were evident on the postnatal development of steroid glucuronidation. The synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation. The postnatal development of DES glucuronidation, like the steroid pathway, was not affected by gestational TCDD treatment.

40|$|During {{transitional}} circulation, the pulmonary {{vascular bed}} undergoes a rapid and profound reduction in both tone and vascular smooth-muscle (VSM) content. 3 �, 5 �-Guanylate cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) {{is a crucial}} mediator in the regulation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and VSM proliferation. Hydrolysis of cGMP is achieved predominately by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Among the cGMP-specific PDEs, PDE 5 is quantitatively prevalent in lung tissue. We have investigated the levels of pulmonary PDE 5 enzymatic activity, protein, and messenger RNA (mRNA) in ovine and mouse lung during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development.</b> We report that within 1 h following birth, PDE 5 activity, protein, and mRNA levels decrease in both species, {{in a manner that}} correlates with known decreases in PVR in early transition. However, from 4 to 7 d following birth, a secondary increase in PDE 5 activity, protein, and mRNA occurs in both ovine and mouse lung, suggesting a complex regulation of PVR and VSM proliferation in late <b>perinatal</b> <b>development.</b> Our data imply that PDE 5 may be an important mediator in the regulation of PVR in normal and possibly in pathologic states, and may ultimately provide a basis for PDE 5 inhibitors as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is among the}} brain regions showing the highest expression levels of G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK/Kir 3) channels. Despite their critical contribution in modulating neuronal excitability during development and adult, the spatiotemporal expression of specific GIRK subunits in identified cerebellar neuron populations is unresolved. To characterize this onset of expression, we examined the GIRK 2 protein expression in mouse cerebellum by western blot, light microscopy immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development.</b> Using western blots, GIRK 2 expression was low at birth but reach its maximum at P 5 before decreasing gradually to adult levels. Immunohistochemical localization indicated that GIRK 2 is expressed in granule cells from early stages of development. At the embryonic stage, immunofluorescence techniques for the transcription factor Pax 6 allowed to demonstrate that GIRK 2 is expressed in granule cell precursors. This GIRK 2 expression in granule cells continued throughout postnatal development and adulthood. In addition, the expression of Pax 2 -GFP allowed selective visualization of Golgi cells during pre- and postnatal development. We could not detect co-expression of Pax 2 -GFP and GIRK 2 during prenatal and early postnatal development, but only at post-migratory stages of Golgi cells, once they are morphologically differentiated and located at the granule cell layer. In the adult cerebellum, we performed a detailed characterization on the expression of GIRK 2 in different subpopulations of Golgi cells, using metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu(2)) and neurogranin as markers, in GlyT 2 -GFP and GAD 67 -GFP mice, and showed that GIRK 2 is present in at least four morphological and neurochemical non-overlapping populations of Golgi cells. Altogether, these findings shed {{new light on the}} developmental regulation of GIRK channels in the cerebellum, and the main expression in granule cells during <b>perinatal</b> <b>development</b> support the idea that GIRK 2 may provide a significant route for modulating different aspects of cerebellar development...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundSpinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) {{is the most}} common genetic {{neurological}} disease leading to infant death. It is caused by loss of survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene and subsequent reduction of SMN protein in motor neurons. Because SMN is ubiquitously expressed and functionally linked to general RNA metabolism pathway, fibroblasts (FBs) are most widely used for the assessment of SMN expression in SMA patients but usually isolated from skin biopsy samples after the onset of overt symptoms. Although recent translational studies of SMN-targeted therapies have revealed the very limited time window for effective SMA therapies during perinatal period, the exact time point when SMN shortage became evident is unknown in human samples. In this study, we analyzed SMN mRNA and protein expression during perinatal period by using umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) obtained from preterm and term infants. MethodsUC-MSCs were isolated from 16 control infants delivered at 22 – 40 [*]weeks of gestation and SMA fetus aborted at 19 [*]weeks of gestation (UC-MSC-Control and UC-MSC-SMA). FBs were isolated from control volunteer and SMA patient (FB-Control and FB-SMA). SMN mRNA and protein expression in UC-MSCs and FBs was determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot. ResultsUC-MSC-Control and UC-MSC-SMA expressed the comparable level of MSC markers on their cell surface and were able to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. At steady state, SMN mRNA and protein expression was decreased in UC-MSC-SMA compared to UC-MSC-Control, as observed in FB-SMA and FB-Control. In response to histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid, SMN mRNA and protein expression in UC-MSC-SMA and FB-SMA was increased.

40|$|Cadherins are a {{superfamily}} of Ca 2 +-dependent {{cell adhesion}} molecules {{with more than}} 100 members (Redies et al., 2005). They are multifunctional transmembrane glycoproteins found in several kinds of cell-cell contact, including adherens junctions. They regulate {{a wide variety of}} crucial developmental mechanisms, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell-cell recognition, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and angiogenesis. In this study, I cloned eighteen novel members of the classic cadherin and delta-protocadherin subgroups and investigated their expression patterns by in situ hybridization from the brain of ferret, an animal model suitable for visual cortical and cerebrovascular research. I also showed seven members of the cadherin superfamily and an intracellular binding partner of delta-protocadherins, protein phosphatase 1 alpha as novel markers for developing blood vessels in the ferret brain. Some of the cadherin molecules are restricted to specific brain regions or a subset of blood vessels. The expression levels show a peak during <b>perinatal</b> vascular <b>development.</b> My results suggest that multiple cadherins, which are also involved in neurogenesis, are regulators of angiogenesis in developing vertebrate brain, supporting the idea of a common mechanism behind "neuroangiogenesis"...|$|R
40|$|In {{perinatal}} mice, the ovary undergoes drastic　morphological changes, as {{clusters of}} oocytes called nests break into smaller cysts and subsequently form individual follicles. We studied <b>perinatal</b> oocyte <b>development</b> in MRL/MpJ mice, and {{compared it to}} that observed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice between embryonic day 18. 5 and postnatal day 4. Throughout the observation period, compared to C 57 BL/ 6 mice, MRL/MpJ mice displayed significantly fewer oocytes in their ovaries. 　Morphologically, there were no clear differences　between the strains at embryonic day 18. 5. However, the beginning of folliculogenesis, {{as evidenced by the}} expression of NOBOX oogenesis homeobox (Nobox) 　transcript and protein, was more enhanced in MRL/MpJ mice than in C 57 BL/ 6 mice at embryonic day 18. 5 and postnatal day 0. In addition, developed follicles were more frequently observed in MRL/MpJ mice than in　C 57 BL/ 6 mice between postnatal days 0 and 4. In　conclusion, the oocyte development during nest　breakdown and folliculogenesis was accelerated in MRL/MpJ mice when compared to that observed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice...|$|R
