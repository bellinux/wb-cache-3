5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been <b>privileged</b> <b>to</b> hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Newcastle United were linked with a £6 million bid for Brown, as a {{replacement}} for their outgoing captain Kevin Nolan. Brown stated {{that he did not want}} to leave Celtic and that he felt <b>privileged</b> <b>to</b> be the captain. He also said that he wanted to sign a new contract as his current deal was to expire at the end of the season. Internazionale and Juventus were also reportedly looking to sign him on a free transfer if he did not sign a new contract. After protracted talks, Brown announced on 29 August that he was to sign a new contract in the next few weeks. Due to his SPL suspension incurred at the end of the 2010–11 season, Brown's first match of the new campaign was Scotland's 2–1 win over Denmark on 10 August. He suffered an ankle injury in this match, but played in the next five games for Celtic and the next international match. He missed Celtic's 4–0 win over Motherwell, on 10 September, due to the injury and then the 2–0 loss to Atlético Madrid five days later.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} action (pour or twist?) and contextual/semantic (found in kitchen?) {{decisions made}} to pictures of objects, nonobjects, and words. Although {{there was no}} advantage for objects over words in contextual/semantic decisions, there was an advantage for objects over words and nonobjects in action decisions. For objects, both action and contextual/semantic decisions were faster than naming; for words, the opposite occurred. These results extend the early results of Potter and Faulconer (1975) that there is <b>privileged</b> access <b>to</b> semantic memory for objects relative to that for words and <b>privileged</b> access <b>to</b> phonology for words. Our data suggest that, for objects, there is <b>privileged</b> access <b>to</b> action knowledge rather than to all forms of semantic knowledge {{and that this is}} contingent on learned associations between objects and actions...|$|R

25|$|Raja Rao's {{first and}} best-known novel, Kanthapura (1938), {{is the story}} of a south Indian village named Kanthapura. The novel is narrated in the form of a purana by an old woman of the village, Achakka. Dominant castes like Brahmins are <b>privileged</b> <b>to</b> get the best region of the village, while lower casts such as Pariahs are marginalized. Despite this classist system, the village retains its long-cherished traditions of festivals in which all castes {{interact}} and the villagers are united. The village is believed to be protected by a local deity named Kenchamma.|$|E
25|$|William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was an English poet, often considered, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, to have inaugurated the Romantic {{movement}} in English poetry {{with the publication}} in 1798 of their Lyrical Ballads. Hazlitt was introduced to Wordsworth by Coleridge, and both had a shaping influence on him, who was <b>privileged</b> <b>to</b> have read Lyrical Ballads in manuscript. Though Hazlitt was never close with Wordsworth, their relationship was cordial for many years. As between Coleridge and Hazlitt, as well as Southey and Hazlitt, differences between Wordsworth and Hazlitt over politics were {{a major cause of}} the breakdown of their friendship.|$|E
25|$|The goddess {{also had}} a Winter festival, {{thoroughly}} documented but attested on only two occasions (63 and 62 BC). It was held in December, {{at the home of}} the current senior annual Roman magistrate cum imperio, whether consul or praetor. It was hosted by the magistrate's wife and attended by respectable matrons of the Roman elite. This winter festival is not marked on any known religious calendar but was dedicated to the public interest and supervised by the Vestals, and therefore must be considered official. Shortly after 62 BC, Cicero presents it as one of very few lawful nocturnal festivals allowed to women, <b>privileged</b> <b>to</b> those of aristocratic class, and coeval with Rome's earliest history.|$|E

This and the Hasty Pudding Club, an organization for performing amateur theatricals, are the two lions of Harvard. The Porcellian Club is hardly a place of resort for those who cultivate the intellect {{at the expense of the}} body. The list of active members is small, owing in part to the largeness of the annual subscription. The great desire of every student is to become a member of it... the doings of the club are shrouded in secrecy... All that can be said by a stranger who has been <b>privileged</b> <b>to</b> step behind the scenes is that the mysteries are rites which can be practised without much labor and yield a pleasure which is fraught with no unpleasant consequences.|$|E
25|$|Riazuddin {{was born}} in Ludhiana in British Punjab of British Indian Empire in 1930 to a {{respected}} middle-class family. After the partition, the family migrated to Pakistan in 1947 and settled in Lahore, West-Pakistan. At age 17, Riazuddin attended Punjab University, and took his B.Sc.(Hons) in Mathematics under the contemporary supervision of Abdus Salam in 1951. Riazuddin is the only student who has <b>privileged</b> <b>to</b> study Physics and Mathematics {{under the supervision of}} Abdus Salam at the Undergraduate level in Punjab University and at the Postgraduate level at the Cambridge University. As student of mathematics, he learned the advanced course on quantum mechanics under Abdus Salam, as he had made the course of quantum mechanics outside the regular curriculum. In 1951, Salam funded his scholarship, and helped him admitted at the graduate school of the Punjab University. In 1953, Abdus Salam supervised his M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics where his master's dissertation dealt with fundamental concepts of Mathematical physics. By the time, he published his thesis in 1953, it had gained him a national reputation and received a Gold medal from the Punjab University for the post-graduate contributions to physics and mathematics.|$|E
