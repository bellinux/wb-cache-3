The OTPG is composed of a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>thread.</b> The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an <b>internal</b> <b>thread.</b> Keywords <b>Internal</b> <b>thread.</b> Rigid industrial endoscope.

Preface In practical production process, machining of <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> for large diameter can be realized by using lathe tool for <b>internal</b> <b>thread,</b> but this method is difficult to machine <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> of parts with small diameter, which is usually done by first drilling of base hole of the thread after machining process, and then using tapper to obtain the <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> manually or with machine. By this traditional method for <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> processing, the processes are distracted that increases time for handling, loading and unloading. It also lead to low efficiency, low accuracy of the perpendicularity error of thread. What’s more, tapper are always likely to break during tapping process, especially for parts with small diameter, and the depth of the thread is hard to control. To solve the problems mentioned above, a new type of tapping tool for machine use is developed. The tool bar could be inserted into the tapper hole on the lathe tailstock or installed o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMetallic {{lightweight}} materials {{are used for}} enhancing dynamic range, resource optimization and emission reduction in many fields of traffic engineering, whereby aluminium and magnesium components are manufactured by means of welded, adhesive and screw joints. Friction drilling, as forming process with subsequent manufacturing of threads, offers the opportunity to produce an <b>internal</b> <b>thread</b> in lightweight profiles with a usable thread depth larger than the profile thickness, making use of local material expansion. Moreover, the direct manufacturing offers a huge potential for time and cost saving in comparison to conventional thread machining. Microscopic-based characterization of mechanical properties of aluminium AlSi 10 Mg and magnesium AZ 31 <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> in thin-walled profile specimens was carried out using tensile tests and fatigue tests in tensile loading range. The <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> were chipless manufactured by means of thread forming. Variations in the geometric process parameter wall thickness were compared. Differences between the AlSi 10 Mg chill casting alloy and the AZ 31 continuous casting alloy in maximum tolerable loads and fatigue limits were correlated with the production-related profile qualities of the profile specimens. The maximum tolerable loads increase linearly with increasing wall thickness of the specimens, whereby AlSi 10 Mg specimens were about 20 - 24 % lower in the quasi-static range and about 37 - 47 % lower in the cyclic range in comparison to AZ 31 specimens due to oval forms of the core holes caused by the friction drilling process. Plastic strain behavior and deformation-induced changes in temperature in load increase tests were evaluated to reliably estimate the fatigue limit of magnesium AZ 31 <b>internal</b> <b>threads...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} mean Nusselt number, friction factor and thermal enhancement factor characteristics in a circular tube with different types of <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> of 120 mm pitch under uniform wall heat flux boundary conditions. In the experiments, measured data are taken at Reynolds number in range of 7, 000 to 14, 000 with air as the test fluid. The experiments were conducted on circular tube with three different types of <b>internal</b> <b>threads</b> viz. acme, buttress and knuckle threads of constant pitch. The heat transfer and friction factor data obtained is compared with the data obtained from a plain circular tube under similar geometric and flow conditions. The variations of heat transfer and pressure loss {{in the form of}} Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f) respectively is determined and depicted graphically. It is observed that at all Reynolds number, the Nusselt number and thermal performance increases for a circular tube with buttress threads as compared with a circular tube with acme and knuckle threads. These are because of increase in strength and intensity of vortices ejected from the buttress threads. Subsequently an empirical correlation is also formulated to match with experimental results with ± 8 % and ± 9 %, variation respectively for Nusselt number and friction factor.
