They were interested in his work and wanted to publish some books. Vandersteen presented them with the first designs for a daily comic strip, but they <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> hold and first ordered four juvenile books from Vandersteen. These were published in 1945 and 1946 in Dutch and French (by Casterman).|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, MTV Unplugged {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, praising Katy for being a hard working music act and [...] "seeming more likeable here than she did on her debut", though he noted that her flaws were [...] "amplified" [...] during the performance. Sahar from Blogcritics was more positive about the set, writing that although Perry was not the [...] "best singer out there", she made up for it [...] "in catchiness and..... adorableness". The contributor was more negative of the acoustic version of [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] {{and the fact that}} MTV cut out parts from the video recording: [...] "What I'd like to have seen is for MTV to make Katy Perry enter into an unscripted dialog with the fans that are there, film the whole thing and <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> a DVD – then you will really have something unplugged. For how can you truly know an artist if we don't see such interactions?" [...] Becky Bain from website Idolator favored Perry's live voice and her natural presentation, though she was ambivalent towards the decision of giving the songs an acoustic treatment. She {{went on to say that}} the MTV Unplugged versions of Perry's songs were not able to substitute the [...] "glossy originals". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a D, opining that [...] "the stripped-down treatment of MTV Unplugged does Perry's yowling voice no favors", and that [...] " [...] songs just aren't solid enough to stand on their own without loads of glossy production". Catherine Lewis of The Washington Post praised Perry's [...] "translate her more rambunctious numbers into an acoustic format" [...] and wrote album was [...] "definitely a step in a good — and unexpected — direction".|$|E

2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Daniel Weidenfeld {{stated in}} an interview with The Huffington Post that before they knew Super Deluxe would be folded into Adult Swim Video, he talked to senior executive vice president of Adult Swim, Mike Lazzo, about translating the online series to a television special. The special, entitled [...] "China, IL: The Funeral" [...] combined the four-part series into an 11-minute television special, which aired on May 25, 2008. Weidenfeld explained the special [...] "was great, and it was insane that they would have ever <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> TV, but that itself never would have worked as a show." [...] Weidenfeld explained the plot outline for the short, consisting of three stories involving the four main characters; he explained in the interview that having to do [...] "four beginning, middle and ends with one larger beginning, middle and end is the craziest sort of storytelling imaginable." [...] Weidenfeld had previously stated {{in an interview}} with MovieWeb that the combination of the shorts [...] "isn't representative of what we've turned this show into.
