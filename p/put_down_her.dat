500|$|She {{continued}} to work {{in spite of her}} illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of The Elliots, she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began The Brothers (titled Sanditon when published in 1925), and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes Sanditons heroine, Diana Parker, as an [...] "energetic invalid". In the novel, Austen mocked hypochondriacs and though she describes the heroine as [...] "bilious", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning [...] "every wrong colour" [...] and living [...] "chiefly on the sofa". She <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> pen on 18 March 1817, making a note of it.|$|E

500|$|Roughly a {{week before}} the {{supposed}} arrival of PlanetX in May 2003, Lieder appeared on KROQ-FM radio in Los Angeles, and advised listeners to euthanize their pets in anticipation of the event as she had done. This led the Fortean Times to conclude that she had <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> dog(s) to save them from further suffering during the Pole Shift. Later, in a 2004 interview she said that she had euthanized her dog because it was acting aggressively. After the 2003 date passed without incident, Lieder said that it was merely a [...] "white lie... to fool the establishment." [...] She refused to disclose the true date, saying that to do so would give those in power enough time to declare martial law and trap people in cities during the shift, leading to their deaths.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Patti {{turns off}} the baby monitor and removes William from his crib. Scully awakens when she gets {{a phone call from}} Doggett warning her that the tipster they were {{following}} had just gone into her building. [...] Scully then hears William cry and confronts Patti with her gun, telling her to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> baby. Just then, Patti's husband attempts to pick Scully's lock, but is stopped by Doggett and Reyes. The husband informs Scully, Doggett, and Reyes that they are being watched, and signals to Scully to close the window. He then reveals to Scully that he works for the NSA and has no name. [...] He says he was not there to take William, but was there to retrieve his wife, as he knew she was upset. [...] Patti says their daughter is just like William, and they only want to keep both children safe. [...] The husband reveals that his supervisor has discovered the government's “Super Soldier” project and alludes to crimes against innocent people. He begs Scully to call Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) out of hiding in order to give him this information.|$|E

[...] The king's grandmother, Tipto, who is so old that she is gaining [...] "full {{possession}} of all her faculties" [...] appears, and the king asks her to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> childish science books, or he shall have to commit her to a [...] "sane house". Tipto sings, [...] "I always forget that I mustn't remember, But never remember I ought to forget." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Dormer played Moira Nicholson in Agatha Christie's Marple: [...] "Why Didn't They Ask Evans?" [...] and {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films such as Fence Walker and City of Life. Dormer's Marple appearance aired in the US in the summer of 2009 as part of the PBS Masterpiece Mystery anthology series. Also in that year, she appeared in Incendiary, but her scenes were cut from the final film. In March 2010, she made her stage debut at the Young Vic theatre in London as Mizi in the play Sweet Nothings. In The Observer, theatre critic Susannah Clapp praised the performances of the cast and wrote: [...] "Natalie Dormer is lissome as a dirty, delightful gadabout, pushing aside an entire chess game in order to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> hat".|$|E
6000|$|She had inevitably, poor woman, her {{hesitation}} for this, but she <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> answer as, for {{the purchase}} of some absolutely indispensable article, she would have <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> last shilling. [...] "No." ...|$|E

60|$|She <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cup and her glance was soft. He saw {{she was not}} acting.|$|E
60|$|She <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> {{knife and}} fork. Tears sprang into her eyes,--tears of anger, he thought.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Horton {{thought he}} would know the lady again. He <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> age at about twenty-six, {{describing}} her--to use his own piquant expression--as [...] "a bit of all right." [...] She had brown eyes and a taking way with her.|$|R

60|$|If the {{doctrine}} be true, that in wedlock contraries attract, by how cogent a fatality must I {{have been drawn}} to my wife! While spicily impatient of present and past, like a glass of ginger-beer she overflows with her schemes; and, with like energy as she <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> foot, <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> preserves and her pickles, and lives with them in a continual future; or ever full of expectations both from time and space, is ever restless for newspapers, and ravenous for letters. Content with the years that are gone, taking no thought for the morrow, and looking for no new thing from any person or quarter whatever, I have not a single scheme or expectation on earth, save in unequal resistance of the undue encroachment of hers.|$|R
