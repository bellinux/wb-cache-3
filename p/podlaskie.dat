5|$|During the ages, {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} {{the town of}} Suwałki had been variously part of Lithuanian, Polish, and German borderlands. Since 1569, during {{the era of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the territory belonged to the <b>Podlaskie</b> Voivodeship and was part of the Kingdom of Poland rather than the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, Sejny was a property of Dominican friars from Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} liberated by the Red Army on 27 July 1944 and on 20 September 1944 {{transferred}} to Poland. After the war, the city became {{capital of the}} initial Białystok Voivodeship (1945–1975) of the People's Republic of Poland. After the 1975 administrative reorganization, the city was {{the capital of the}} smaller Białystok Voivodeship (1975–1998). Since 1999 it has been the capital of the <b>Podlaskie</b> Voivodeship, Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{demarcation}} line drawn through the Suwałki Region {{for the most}} part remains the border between Poland and Lithuania in modern times; notably the towns of Sejny, Suwałki and Augustów remained on the Polish side. In the 21st century, the Suwałki Region (the present-day <b>Podlaskie</b> Voivodeship) remains home to the Lithuanian minority in Poland.|$|E
5|$|The city is, and {{has been}} for centuries, the main hub of {{transportation}} for the <b>Podlaskie</b> Voivodeship and the entire northeastern section of Poland. It is a major city on the European Union roadways (Via Baltica) and railways (Rail Baltica) to the Baltic Republics and Finland. It is also a main gateway of trade with Belarus due to its proximity to the border and its current and longstanding relationship with Hrodno, Belarus.|$|E
5|$|During World War I the Bialystok-Grodno District was the {{administrative}} division of German-controlled territory of Ober-Ost. It comprised the city, as the capital, {{and the surrounding}} <b>Podlaskie</b> region, roughly corresponding to {{the territory of the}} earlier Belostok Oblast. At the end of World War I the city became part of the newly independent Second Polish Republic, as the capital of the Białystok Voivodeship (1919–1939). During the 1919–1920 Polish-Soviet War, possession of the city by the Red Army and the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee occurred during the lead up to the Battle of Warsaw. During the resultant counteroffensive, the city returned to Polish control after the Battle of Białystok.|$|E
5|$|In May, a {{delegation}} of 31 Samogitian nobles arrived in Königsberg and promised loyalty to Vytautas by signing the Treaty of Königsberg. The joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights consisted largely of volunteers and mercenaries from western Europe, notably from France, the German states, and England. Henry, Earl of Derby, the future King Henry IV of England and Marshal of France Jean Le Maingre were among the participants. The English crusaders left detailed records of their actions in Prussia and Lithuania, and their exploits were mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales, possibly as a compliment to the English knights and the future king. In the meantime, Jogaila achieved some military successes; his forces captured several castles in <b>Podlaskie,</b> leaving them to be guarded by Polish garrisons, and took Hrodna in April 1390 after a six-week siege.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Białystok Uplands of the <b>Podlaskie</b> Plain on {{the banks}} of the Biała River, Białystok ranks second in terms of {{population}} density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area, of the cities of Poland. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe. This is facilitated by the fact that the nearby border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok. The city has a , characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests are an important part of Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most forested city in Poland.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animals that}} have since died out {{in other parts}} of Europe still survive in Poland, such as the wisent in the ancient {{woodland}} of the Białowieża Forest and in <b>Podlaskie.</b> Other such species include the brown bear in Białowieża, in the Tatras, and in the Beskids, the gray wolf and the Eurasian lynx in various forests, the moose in northern Poland, and the beaver in Masuria, Pomerania, and <b>Podlaskie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to {{significant}} territorial losses, the Sejm adjusted the administrative {{division of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and created 18 new voivodeships: brasławskie, brzeskie, chełmskie, ciechanowskie, grodzieńskie, krakowskie, lubelskie, mazowieckie, mereckie, nowogrodzkie, <b>podlaskie,</b> sandomierskie, trockie, warszawskie, wileńskie, włodzimierskie, wołyńskie, and żmudzkie (see map).|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} {{afternoon}} hours two tornadoes struck eastern Poland. One of them hit the small villages of Chodorówka Stara and Kopciówka near Suchowola in <b>Podlaskie</b> (north-eastern Poland). The F1 tornado caused serious damage to roofs of houses and barns.|$|E
25|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, {{the village}} of Wąsosz (<b>Podlaskie</b> Voivodeship) {{was taken by the}} Germans in the second week of the war. At the end of September, in {{accordance}} with the German–Soviet Boundary Treaty, the area was transferred by the Nazis to the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the lake districts in the north (in Masuria, Pomerania, Kashubia, Lubuskie, and Greater Poland), {{there is also a}} large number of mountain lakes in the Tatras, of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area.

25|$|The Swedes {{failed to}} take {{advantage}} of the local support and treated the Commonwealth as a conquered country, subjecting it to widespread violence, predatory contributions, ruthlessness and pillage. Spontaneous popular resistance arose first among the peasants, beginning with a skirmish they fought near Myślenice. Partisan groups included also townspeople and szlachta, who disillusioned with Charles Gustav often switched sides and took the lead of the fighting. Krzysztof Żegocki led the uprising in Greater Poland. Carpathian foothills region units were highly successful, liberating Nowy Sącz and many other towns. Lwów (Lviv) and Zamość resisted both the Cossack and the Swedish assaults, similarly Danzig (Gdańsk) and Marienburg in case of the Swedes. Some of the Lithuanian forces, under Paweł Jan Sapieha, had remained faithful to John Casimir. They fought in <b>Podlaskie</b> against the Radziwiłłs and took Tykocin. John Casimir himself still in Silesia, issued a universal calling for national resistance against the Swedes, and then on December 18 embarked on a return trip to Poland. The Commonwealth's remaining ally, Crimean Khan Mehmed IV Giray, who had just defeated Khmelnytsky, was offering help and support.|$|E
25|$|Vytautas {{returned}} to Lithuania {{without a clear}} written agreement with Jogaila. He received Hrodna, Brest, <b>Podlaskie,</b> Vawkavysk. In order to receive Volhynia {{after the death of}} his uncle Liubartas, Vytautas was baptized in the Orthodox rite. Skirgaila continued to rule Trakai. Vytautas pledged loyalty to Jogaila and became one of the many regional dukes. Jogaila was considering different baptism proposals. He had already refused the Treaty of Dubysa with the Teutonic Knights. He negotiated with Moscow, but it was a dangerous ally and Orthodoxy would not save Lithuania from attacks by the Teutonic Knights. Furthermore, Muscovy lost some of its power and influence after the siege of Moscow in 1382 by the Mongols. A third option was presented by Poland: it was looking for a suitable groom for Jadwiga of Poland and a worthy candidate to become King of Poland. In August 1385, Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo, promising to Christianize Lithuania, marry Jadwiga, and form a personal union between Lithuania and Poland. In 1386, he was baptized and crowned King. Skirgaila was left as his regent in Lithuania. Taking advantage of Jogaila's absence, Andrei of Polotsk renewed his bid for the throne of Lithuania. During this time Vytautas remained loyal and helped Jogaila and Skirgaila to defeat Andrei.|$|E

There might have been some Hussites on his side as he enlisted his nephew Sigismund Korybut, a distinguished military leader during the Hussite Wars.
