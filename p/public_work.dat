5|$|Leoš Janáček's {{literary}} legacy {{represents an}} important illustration of his life, <b>public</b> <b>work</b> and art between 1875 and 1928. He contributed {{not only to}} music journals, but wrote essays, reports, reviews, feuilletons, articles and books. His {{work in this area}} comprises around 380 individual items. His writing changed over time, and appeared in many genres. Nevertheless, the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main area of interest.|$|E
50|$|During the Philippine Revolution, <b>public</b> <b>works</b> duties were {{assumed by}} a new {{department}} known as the Department of War and <b>Public</b> <b>Works</b> (DWPW).

50|$|This {{allowed the}} <b>Public</b> <b>Works</b> Department {{to grow to}} nearly 600 men by July 1917. They were {{organized}} into the Twelfth Regiment (<b>Public</b> <b>Works),</b> which was essentially the <b>Public</b> <b>Works</b> Department because staff officers could not exercise military command. Lieutenant William C. Davis was appointed commanding officer of the regiment, he exercised military control, but the <b>Public</b> <b>Works</b> Officers exercised technical control.|$|R
5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In <b>public</b> <b>work</b> projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} treasurer only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his <b>public</b> <b>work</b> after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in {{the operations of the}} Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, have felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than as a religious figure.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} {{public works projects}} in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from <b>public</b> <b>work</b> projects enacted during the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death. He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death. Constantine {{initially}} presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311AD, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a eunuch in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted. Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a damnatio memoriae on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any <b>public</b> <b>work</b> bearing his image.|$|E
5|$|The Hanzhong {{state was}} divided into 24 regions which were led by an official. Each {{district}} had a civil register which recorded people's names and ranks. Three times a year, the registers were updated {{at the same time}} as an important feast. While a child's rank rose automatically, adults had to raise their own rank through religious achievement or marriage. Higher ranked people had more divine generals at their command, which could be used to fight demons that caused bad luck or disease. The state had a system of law that encouraged confession and benevolence rather than strict punishment. Criminals were asked to confess their crimes and meditate, and were given <b>public</b> <b>work</b> to do as a sentence. Few texts written by the Hanzhong Celestial Masters survive, with the most important being the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. While the Hanzhong state lasted for only twenty-five years, their beliefs influenced all subsequent Daoist movements.|$|E
5|$|At the {{vernal equinox}} of 1930, Fortune {{declared}} that—with the 'Lesser Mysteries' and three degree system now properly established—she {{wanted to turn}} away from <b>public</b> <b>work</b> and focus on personal spiritual development. At the vernal equinox of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place. During the 1930s, Fortune's emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, {{while at the same time}} other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters. In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the Great Depression was able to raise sufficient funds. The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move from the morning to the evening seeing no effect. One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was Christine Campbell Thomson, who had been Fortune's literary agent since 1926. Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband, after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937. Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained, and during the Second World War he left London and settled in Liverpool, terminating his involvement with Fortune's Bayswater temple.|$|E
