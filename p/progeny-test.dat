40|$|A {{project of}} QTL {{detection}} {{was carried out}} in the French Holstein, Normande, and Montbéliarde dairy cattle breeds. This granddaughter design included 1 548 artificial insemination bulls distributed in 14 sire families and evaluated after a <b>progeny-test</b> for 24 traits (production, milk composition, persistency, type, fertility, mastitis resistance, and milking ease). These bulls were also genotyped for 169 genetic markers, mostly microsatellites. The QTL were analysed by within-sire linear regression of daughter yield deviations or deregressed proofs on the probability that the son receives one or the other paternal QTL allele, given the marker information. QTL were detected for all traits, including those with a low heritability. One hundred and twenty QTL with a chromosome-wise significance lower than 3 % were tabulated. This threshold corresponded to a 15 % false discovery rate. Amongst them, 32 were genome-wise significant. Estimates of their contribution to genetic variance ranged from 6 to 40 %. Most substitution effects ranged from 0. 6 to 1. 0 genetic standard deviation. For a given QTL, only 1 to 5 families out of 14 were informative. The confidence intervals of the QTL locations were large and always greater than 20 cM. This experiment confirmed several already published QTL but most of them were original, particularly for non-production traits...|$|E

Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s method 3 was {{used with a}} model that included fixed herd-years, fixed age-month of freshening, and random sire and residual effects. Heritabilities for milk yields were. 21,. 21, and. 13 for the first, second, and third 90 days in lactation and for fat yields were. 19,. 16, and. 10. Heritabilities for milk and fat yields over the entire 270 days postpartum were. 22 and. 22. Genetic correlations among partial yields were high and ranged from. 74 to. 99 for milk and. 86 to. 99 for fat. Genotypic and phenotypic variances were used to predict breeding values for trimester milk yield by multiple trait, mixed model procedures for 3, 797 Holstein artificial insemination sires from 283, 900 first-lactation milk records of their daughters during the first 90, second 90, and third 90 days in lactation. Correlations among proofs for the three trimesters ranged from. 85 to. 94. Correlation between the sum of three trimester multiple trait proofs and proof for milk yield for 270 days of lactation from single trait analysis was. 99. Correlations among proofs indicate sires may rank differently for milk yield in the three periods...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{developing}} dairy sectors, {{genetic improvement}} programs have limited resources and recording of herds is minimal. This study evaluated different methods to estimate lactation yield and sampling schedules with fewer test-day records per lactation to determine recording regimes that (1) estimate lactation yield with a minimal {{impact on the}} accuracy of selection and (2) optimise the available resources. Methods Using Sahiwal cattle as a tropical dairy breed example, weekly milk records from 464 cows were used in a simulation study to generate different shaped lactation curves. The daily milk yields from these simulated lactation curves were subset to equally spaced (weekly, monthly and quarterly) and unequally spaced (with four, five or six records per lactation) test-day intervals. Lactation yield estimates were calculated from these subsets using two methods: the test-interval method and Wood’s (Nature 216 : 164 - 165, 1967) lactation curve model. Using the resulting lactation yields, breeding values were predicted and comparisons were made between the sampling regimes and estimation methods. Results The results show that, based on the mean square error of prediction, use of Wood’s lactation curve model to estimate total yield was more accurate than use of the test-interval method. However, {{the differences in the}} ranking of animals were small, i. e. a 1 to 5 % difference in accuracy. Comparisons between the different test-day sampling regimes showed that, with the same number of records per lactation (for example, quarterly and four test-days), strategically timed test-days can result in more accurate estimates of lactation yield than test-days at equal intervals. Conclusions An important outcome of these results is that combining Wood’s model for lactation yield estimation and as few as four, five or six strategically placed test-day records can produce estimates of lactation yield that are comparable with estimates based on monthly test-day records using the test-interval method. Furthermore, calculations show that although using fewer test-days results in a decrease in the accuracy of selection, it does provide an opportunity to <b>progeny-test</b> more sires. Thus, using strategically timed test-days and Wood’s model to estimate lactation yield, can lead to a more efficient use of the allocated resources...|$|E
40|$|Pedigrees of 440, 702 {{males and}} 526, 956 females born during 1960 through 1979 and {{registered}} in the herdbook of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America were examined. Annual trends in genetic merit of sires, dams, maternal grandsires, and maternal granddams were determined from estimated transmitting estimates (ETA) contained in the pedigrees. The increase {{in the rate of}} change in genetic merit of parents was associated with the introduction of more accurate procedures for estimating transmitting ability of males and females in 1967. Annual genetic change (g) in the male and female populations was estimated as the sum of annual change in average ETA of sires plus the annual change in average ETA of dams. From 1971 to 1979, g 2 ̆ 7 s for females were 120. 5 lb milk, 3. 31 lb fat, and -. 0072 milk fat percent. Corresponding g 2 ̆ 7 s for males were 152. 2 lb milk, 4. 38 lb milk fat, and -. 0076 milk fat percent. Additional genetic gain in milk yield was possible but not attained due to excessive selection pressure put on other traits such as body conformation;Bulls in artificial insemination (AI) organizations were superior to bulls in non-AI use. Approximately one-third of the females in the study were sired by non-AI bulls. The number of young bulls progeny-tested in AI steadily increased across birth years. Breeder-proven bulls that entered AI were genetically equal, on the average, to AI <b>progeny-test</b> bulls returned to active AI service. Approximately 40 breeder-proven bulls entered AI organizations each year;Pedigree information was used to investigate its effectiveness in predicting ETA 2 ̆ 7 s of males (sons). Regression of coefficients for ETA 2 ̆ 7 s of ancestors were computed within birth year of sons. When ETA 2 ̆ 7 s for milk yield of sires, dams, maternal grandsires and maternal granddams were used individually to predict ETA for milk yield of sons, no significant differences were observed among regression coefficients within birth years. Significant differences between regression coefficients were obtained among birth years in similar prediction equations for ETA of milk fat percent of sons. ETA 2 ̆ 7 s of sire, dam and MGS were the best combination of information for son ETA prediction equations. Addition of MGD information did not appreciably increase the accuracy of prediction. ETA 2 ̆ 7 s of sires and dams also could be used to predict ETA of milk and milk fat percent of sons with little loss in accuracy...|$|E
