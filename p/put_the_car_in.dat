25|$|Midway {{through the}} second week of practice, Roger Penske consummated a deal with Al Sr. to drive the third car. Penske promised Unser a well-funded effort, and a brand new Cosworth engine, the same chassis/engine {{combination}} that had won the previous four Indy 500s. The year-old March was removed from a Penske Racing display at a Sheraton hotel in the team's hometown of Reading, Pennsylvania, and hurriedly prepared for a return to active competition. Unser easily <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> the field on the third day of time trials.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing. The gearshift lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> neutral regardless of what gear {{it had been in}} before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|E

2500|$|Nissan Kohki (Nissan's {{power train}} {{engineering}} and manufacturing facility) originally tested a twin turbocharged 2350cc bored and stroked {{version of the}} RB25 engine. This set up produced [...] and used a RWD drivetrain. Under Group A regulations, a turbocharged engine must multiply its engine displacement by 1.7, putting the new Skyline in the 4000 cc class, and requiring the use of 10-inch-wide tyres. Knowing {{that they would be}} required to use 10-inch-wide tyres, Nissan decided to make the car all wheel drive. Nissan developed a special motorsport-oriented AWD system for this purpose called the ATTESA E-TS. Although this assisted with traction, it made the car [...] heavier; the added weight put the GT-R at a disadvantage to other cars in the 4000 cc class. Nissan then made the decision to increase the displacement to 2600 cc, and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> the 4500 cc class, with the car's weight near-equal to competing cars. The 4500 cc class also allowed for 11-inch-wide tyres. New engine block and heads were then developed to better match the increased displacement. The result was a 600 horsepower car. [...] Later REINIK (Racing & Rally Engineering Division Incorporated Nissan Kohi) produced Group A racing engines between [...] depending on track conditions.|$|E

50|$|However, {{even with}} these {{electronic}} protection systems, a car is not prevented from redlining through inadvertent gear engagement. If a driver accidentally selects a lower gear when trying to shift up or selects a lower gear than intended while shifting down (as in a motorbike sequential manual transmission), the engine {{will be forced to}} rapidly rev-up to match the speed of the drivetrain. If this happens while the engine is at high rpms, it may dramatically exceed the redline. For example, if the operator is driving close to redline in 3rd gear and attempts to shift to 4th gear but unintentionally <b>puts</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> 2nd by mistake, the transmission will be spinning much faster than the engine, and when the clutch is released the engine’s rpm will increase rapidly. It will lead to a rough and very noticeable engine braking, and likely engine damage. This is often known as a 'money shift' because of the likelihood of engine damage and the expense of fixing the engine.|$|R

50|$|As the {{attention}} on the track was focusing on Cale Yarborough, Jim Hurtubise wheeled his Miller-sponsored Mallard in the qualifying line shortly before the closing deadline of 6 p.m. Hurtubise's sponsor was actually a Hamburg, New York beer distributor named Richard Hammond, with Miller High Life chosen as the brand to promote. Since Hurtubise had already qualified himself, when asked why he was <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> line, he claimed he 'might put someone else in it,' a practice that was commonplace at the time. Hurtubise had become known for last-minute (unsuccessful) qualifying efforts in his obsolete front-engined roadster, usually {{to the delight of}} fans, but sometimes drawing the ire of others. The time expired before he got anywhere near the front of the line. In fact, he purposely timed his queuing so he would not make it to the front. He then removed the engine cover to reveal that <b>the</b> <b>car</b> had no engine at all. Instead it had a plastic-lined trough filled with ice and five chilled cases of his sponsor's product, which he shared with the other pit crews and race officials. Most in attendance found the gesture to be humorous, however, some officials were not amused. It would be the first of several run-ins Hurtubise would have with USAC officials.|$|R
