50|$|Based on the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Miranda v. Arizona, after making an arrest, the police must inform the detainee of their Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights {{in order for}} {{statements}} made during questioning to be admissible as evidence against the detainee in court. A Miranda warning is required only when a person has been taken into custody (i.e. is not free to leave) and is being interrogated, {{and the results of}} this interrogation are to be used in court. An officer is not required to inform a person of their Miranda rights if they will not be questioning them any further after their arrest. An officer is also not necessarily required to provide a Miranda warning if the person they are questioning has not been arrested or if a person they have arrested speaks spontaneously without being questioned. There is also an exception that <b>permits</b> <b>questioning</b> without providing the warning under circumstances involving urgent matters of public safety.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{university}} education in prison. Using {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods, it examines the Italian experience of Prison University Campuses. Focusing attention on university education in prison {{takes the form of}} a particularly useful analytical and critical exercise because it <b>permits</b> <b>questioning</b> the distance between prison and society, stereotypes of the prisoner and stereotypes of prison, for example. Furthermore, it allows capturing the transformative effects of “knowledge practices” on the individual and on the system, beyond any rhetoric of treatment...|$|E

However, the low number of entrepreneurs who apply and receive, after three years, a permanent residence <b>permit,</b> calls for <b>questioning</b> the overall welcoming nature of this policy.|$|R
25|$|The trial {{initially}} was concluded in June 2006, but in April 2007, U.S. Department of Labor Judge Pamela Lakes Wood ordered the case reopened after the Home Depot's law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld {{revealed that the}} retail giant's in-house counsel had told them that two Home Depot employees who testified at the trial had lied. Akin Gump sent Wood a letter on September 29, 2006, in which the law firm requested that the testimony be stricken. In response to Akin Gump's revelation, Davis' attorney Mark D. Schwartz asked for the case to be reopened to <b>permit</b> further <b>questioning</b> of the witnesses. On April 6, 2007, Wood ordered the case to be reopened.|$|R
6000|$|The next day--the day, the week, the {{fortnight}} after--this new and peculiar shadow {{lingered on}} the countenance, {{in the manner}} of Miss Keeldar. A strange quietude settled over her look, her movements, her very voice. The alteration was not so marked as to court or <b>permit</b> frequent <b>questioning,</b> yet it was there, and it would not pass away. It hung over her like a cloud which no breeze could stir or disperse. Soon it became evident that to notice this change was to annoy her. First she shrank from remark; and, if persisted in, she, with her own peculiar hauteur, repelled it. [...] "Was she ill?" [...] The reply came with decision.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{determination}} of schoolchildren’s and students’ motivation for {{different kinds of}} health related tourism. Material: In the research 50 pupils of 5 - 9 forms and 50 first and forth year students participated. They were offered to attentively read 15 motives and assess their significance by 10 -points scale. Results: <b>questioning</b> <b>permitted</b> to study schoolchildren’s and students’ motivation for tourism. It was found that with age priority of motivation for health related tourism changes. For example, motives of health {{as well as social}} ones are to larger extent intrinsic to students. At the same time emotional motives (enjoyment with trainings) are important for schoolchildren. Conclusions: the highest motivation was found in wish to develop physical qualities (1217 points), pleasant spending of time (1135 points) and enjoying with trainings (1240 points) ...|$|R
40|$|Cross-examination <b>permits</b> {{styles of}} <b>questioning</b> that {{increase}} eyewitness error (e. g. leading questions). Previous {{research has shown}} that under cross-examination children change many of their initially accurate answers. An experiment is reported in which the effect of cross-examination on accuracy of adult eyewitness testimony was investigated. Twenty-two student witnesses watched a video of a staged theft, either in pairs, or individually. Paired witnesses discussed the video with their cowitnesses, but did not know they had seen slightly different versions. Participants in the co-witness condition demonstrated memory conformity and recalled less accurately than witnesses in the control condition. After approximately 4 weeks all participants were cross-examined by a trainee barrister. Following cross-examination {{there was no difference in}} accuracy between the two experimental groups. Witnesses in both conditions made many changes to their previous reports by altering both initially correct and incorrect answers. The results demonstrate negative effects of cross-examination on the accuracy of adult eyewitness testimony...|$|R
40|$|A {{paradox of}} {{simultaneous}} sincerity and humor, Making Sense of Nonsense attempts to identify deficient systems upon which we rely daily. Systems of logic, text, and visual language are all rife with flaws solely because their source [...] humankind [...] is irrevocably bound to error. This {{is not to}} say that these systems cannot be improved; on the contrary, a rigorous investigation of these systems allows one insight into their mechanics to the end that one endlessly questions the very foundation of the mode of communication being used. Materials and discarded objects such as vintage tools, automotive parts, spray paint, string, furniture, plastic, S 2 ̆ 6 M ephemera, and glitter merge into unsteady structures that hint at new narratives of their functionality, or lack thereof. Questioning realms of visual and verbal language, aesthetics, and functionality are fundamental to this exhibition as they are constantly discussed, edited, and revised by theorists, critics, artists, and the audience. This line of <b>questioning</b> <b>permits</b> my practice to be endless; allowing me to constantly shift and adjust to accommodate contemporaneity. Making Sense of Nonsense recognizes the process of attempting to solve a puzzle that cannot be solved, despite the illusion of resolution, which indicates that the answer is never absolute. Rather, it endlessly evolves...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis examines memory and its transmission through {{a case study of}} the Algerian war of national independence in terminale history classes in France. It argues that while these classes may, in relative terms, be an important vector of "memory" for the young, in absolute terms very little information is transmitted. Indeed, as currently taught, the history of the Algerian war is increasingly partial, fragmentary and selective. This is clearly shown through a study of both written and oral sources, including particularly textbooks and extensive interviews with pupils, teachers and historians. Various theories of memory are referred to in order to explain this position, as are a number of practical considerations. It is argued that, at the national/collective level, the past still to a large extent determines the present desire to live together. History classes continue {{to play an important role}} in this process (despite significant changes in social formations). More specifically, the complex relationship between individual and collective constructions of the past is examined by discussing the experiences of both teachers and pupils. Particular attention is given here to the way in which a collective "French" memory is transmitted to children of immigrant origin. The way the war is taught serves both to reflect and to determine its wider social commemoration, and history lessons thus contribute to the generational transformation of this memory that may now be observed. The thesis concludes that it is more accurate to talk now of an almost total French "ignorance" of the Algerian war, rather than of the psychological "repression" conventionally associated with the conflict. Moreover, the continued existence of competing accounts of the war on the part of mutually hostile interest groups serves further to limit its discussion, as does the weakness of other vectors of memory. The stakes of the Algerian "memory-war'? are still high, as selective comparisons with the Vichy experience reveal. It seems ultimately that the Algerian war is examined sufficiently to avoid the emergence of significant resentment from any quarter, but not adequately to <b>permit</b> any genuine <b>questioning</b> of what remains a little known period of the French past...|$|R
