5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> the majority of Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E
5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E

Pioneers of this field include Andrey Kolmogorov and his student Per Martin-Löf, Ray Solomonoff, and Gregory Chaitin.

25|$|On August 15, {{under orders}} from Monckton, Captain Thomas Lewis, Abijah Willard and 250 troops began to destroy two villages in Cobequid: Tatamagouche and Remsheg (present-day Wallace, Nova Scotia). The British chose to destroy these villages {{first in the}} {{expulsion}} {{because they were the}} gateway Acadians used to provide cattle and produce to Louisbourg. Toward this end, Willard assembled the men of Tatamagouche in an Acadian home. He ensured that all the guns in the village were confiscated, and then notified the Acadian men that they were being taken prisoner. Willard immediately began to destroy the shipments of Acadian cattle and <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> were on vessels to be sent to Louisbourg. On August 16, Lewis burned twelve homes and the chapel. Willard continued to burn four houses and several barns in the early morning of August 17.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{difference}} between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca tar sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.|$|E

Difficulties in registering the land delayed construction until 1919. The first residents were needy families who were given small plots to grow fresh <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> was marketed in Jerusalem. These families, mainly Yemenite Jews, were joined by others from Meah Shearim and the Old City. The Ashkenazim built the first public building, Beit Knesset HaPerushim. In 1912, an embroidery and sewing workshop was opened {{with the help of}} a Jewish philanthropist, Rabbi Slutzkin. Other industries established in Givat Shaul were the Froumine biscuit factory, a factory for kerosene heaters that manufactured arms for the British army during the British Mandate of Palestine, and a matza factory. In 1927, the Diskin Orphanage moved to Givat Shaul from the Old City. This building, designed by a local architect named Tabachnik, was home to 500 orphan boys.|$|E
25|$|Revenue was accrued {{through a}} {{combination}} of taxes on land and trade. It is unclear as to the share of the agricultural <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> was accrued by the state. Taxes were imposed on internal trade as well articles for exports and imports and this brought in a lot of revenue. Smuggling was heavily cracked down upon and elaborate arrangements were made for security in the kingdom. Roads were patrolled at night by watchmen with torches. The Cheras had a well-equipped army which consisted of infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots. They were also in possession of an impressive navy fleet which was {{regarded as one of the}} most powerful in the Sangam era.

500|$|Observing that naturalists {{in other}} European {{countries}} were producing volumes describing the animals {{found in their}} territories, Pennant started, in 1761, a similar work about Britain, to be called British Zoology. This was a comprehensive book with 132 folio plates in colour. It was published in 1766 and 1767 in four volumes as quarto editions, and further small editions followed. The illustrations [...] were so expensive to <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> he made little money from the publication, and {{when there was a}} profit, he gave it to charity. For example, the bookseller Benjamin White, brother of the naturalist Gilbert White, received permission, on payment of £100, to publish an octavo edition, and the money thus raised was donated to the Welsh Charity School. Further appendix volumes were added later and the text, largely written from personal observations, was translated into Latin and German.|$|E

The third film would also be the birthplace {{of one of the most}} recognizable images in popular culture, that of Jason's hockey mask.

500|$|The Church was {{responsible}} for the system of tithes, a levy of 10% on [...] "all agrarian produce... other natural products gained via labour... wages received by servants and labourers, and to the profits of rural merchants". Tithes gathered in the form of produce could be either consumed by the recipient, or sold on and bartered for other resources. The tithe was relatively onerous for the typical peasant, although in many instances the actual levy fell below the desired 10%. Many clergy moved to the towns as part of the urban growth of the period, and by 1300 around one in twenty city dwellers was a clergyman. One effect of the tithe was to transfer a considerable amount of agriculture wealth into the cities, where it was then spent by these urban clergy. The need to sell tithe <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> could not be consumed by the local clergy also spurred the growth of trade.|$|E

This design was never approved, as Brooks waited for {{the real estate market}} in the south Loop, still mostly warehouses, to improve. Where Root was known for the detailed ornamentation of his designs (as seen in the Rookery Building), Brooks was known for his stinginess and preference for simplicity. For the Monadnock, Brooks insisted that the architects refrain from elaborate ornamentation and produce instead [...] "the effect of solidity and strength, or a design that will <b>produce</b> <b>that</b> effect, rather than ornament for a notable appearance." [...] In an 1884 letter to Aldis, he wrote: [...] While Root was on vacation, Burnham had a draftsman create a [...] "straight up-and-down, uncompromising, unornamented facade."

Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, and they say it well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness".
