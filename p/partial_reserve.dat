50|$|Approximately 15% of {{the country}} has forest cover while wooded land {{constitutes}} approximately 34% of the area. Very little closed forest can be found and this is mainly of the gallery forest type along waterways. The open forests include savanna of four types, namely Sahelian, Sahelian-Sudanian, Sudanian, and Sudanian-Guinean. Though much {{of the country}} is dry and sparse, vegetation can vary considerably. Northern Burkina Faso consists mainly of savanna, acacia woodland, and during the wet season, prickly shrubs and stunted trees flourish. Herbaceous plants include broadleaf deciduous, shrub, desert shrub, semi-desert savanna and thorny scrub. Crops include Banana, Cassava, Bougainvillea, Cotton, Guava, Maize, Spinach, Malabar Spinach, Millet, Onions, Papaya, Sorghum, Tomatoes, and Yams. Most of the country consists of sparse savanna grasslands, with the occasional shrub or acacia. Although the country only has about 15% forest cover overall, there are many forests in the south, growing denser {{along the banks of the}} perennial rivers. These include Diéfoula Forest, Logoniégué Forest, Laba Forest, Dida Forest, Koulbi National Forest, Bontioli Reserve Forest, Nabere <b>Partial</b> <b>Reserve</b> Forest, Koflandé Forest, Maro Forest, Tui Forest, Deux Balés Forest, Kalio Forest, Tisse Forest, Dibon Forest, Pâ Forest, Mou Forest, Boulon Forest, Tigo Forest, Nakambe Forest and Niangoloko Forest, of which about 16% have official protection.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the evolving role of reserve requirements {{as a policy}} tool in China. Since 2007, the Chinese central bank (PBC) has relied more on this tool to withdraw domestic liquidity surpluses, as a cheaper substitute for open-market operation instruments in this period of rapid FX accumulation. China’s reserve requirement system has also become more complex and been used to address a range of other policy objectives, not least being macroeconomic management, financial stability and credit policy. The preference for using reserve requirements reflects the size of China’s FX sterilisation task and the associated cost considerations, a quantity-oriented monetary policy framework challenged to reconcile policy dilemmas and tactical considerations. The PBC often finds it easier to reach consensus over reserve requirement decisions than interest rate decisions and enjoys greater discretion in applying this tool. The monetary effects of reserve requirements need to be explored {{in conjunction with other}} policy actions and not in isolation. Depending on the policy mix, higher reserve requirements tend to signal a tightening bias, to squeeze excess reserves of banks, to push market interest rates higher, and to help widen net interest spreads, thus tightening domestic monetary conditions. There are, however, costs to using this policy tool, as it imposes a tax burden on Chinese banks that in turn appear to have passed a significant portion of this cost onto their customers, mostly depositors and SMEs. However, the pass-through onto bank customers appears to be <b>partial.</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements; sterilisation tools; monetary policy; net interest margin and spread; tax incidence; Chinese economy...|$|E

40|$|With recent {{estimates}} {{in excess}} of 151, 000 elephants in northern Botswana, there is growing concern about the management of this large elephant population. Despite several telemetry studies of elephant movements, there is limited information on the seasonal home ranges and transboundary movements of elephants in northern Botswana. Our home range measures of 19 elephants with satellite collars were highly variable by age, sex, season and availability of water. One of our collared bulls had the largest home range (24, 828 km 2) recorded for African elephants. Their extensive transboundary movements indicate that the elephants of northern Botswana {{are part of a}} larger contiguous elephant population encompassing western Zimbabwe, the Caprivi Strip in Namibia, southeast Angola and southwest Zambia. Elephant populations in the Caprivi Strip, southeast Angola and southwest Zambia have been affected by civil war, poaching, human settlements, landmines, and veterinary fences. Based upon our dry season aerial survey of the Caprivi Strip in November 2005, elephant numbers (5, 242) increased by only 15 % since 1998. The recent dispersal of elephants into Angola from the Caprivi Strip may account for this small increase. In contrast, our three aerial surveys of Luiana <b>Partial</b> <b>Reserve,</b> Angola indicate that elephant numbers are increasing rapidly and expanding their range in the Reserve, from 329 in January 2004 to 1, 827 in November 2005. The end of 25 years of civil conflict in Angola probably provided the requisite security for elephants to return to southeast Angola and southwest Zambia. Our wet season (January 2004) and one of our dry season (August 2004) aerial surveys of elephants in Sioma Ngwezi National Park, Zambia indicate that elephant numbers (1, 099 and 899, respectively) were similar to those reported by an aerial survey in 1991. However, our second dry season aerial survey (October 2005) indicated that limited access to water and extensive fires can dramatically decrease elephant numbers in the park (385). Conservation of elephants in the Lower Kwando River Basin can be enhanced by: realigning veterinary fences, de-mining, improved land use management, and development of anti-poaching and community conservation programs. ...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{are aimed at}} managing and protecting marine environments. Their design, however, often disregards both a thorough knowledge {{of the distribution of}} habitats and assemblages and the use of proper experimental evaluations of the efficacy of MPAs by comparing protected vs. unprotected zones. About 200 MPAs have been recently instituted in the Mediterranean area, but the evidence of their efficacy is scant. The MPA of Torre Guaceto (Southern Adriatic Sea, Italy) is one of the rare cases of effective protection enforcement. The reserve was instituted more than 10 years ago, a period currently considered as sufficient to show responses by organisms to protection. The MPA is divided into a C zone, the general reserve, where many activities are permitted, a B zone, the <b>partial</b> <b>reserve</b> where restrictions increase and two A zones, the integral reserve where access is prohibited. The goals of the paper were to map the distribution of benthic assemblages to assess if they were properly represented in the differently protected zones, and to test the efficacy of protection by quantifying possible differences between the assemblages in two control areas and in the two A zones, where human impact is completely excluded. The analysis of habitat and assemblage distribution within the MPA showed that the zones with total protection do not include most valuable environmental types. Most of the considered variables (i. e. cover of substratum, number of taxa, and average abundance of the most common taxa) were not significantly different {{in and out of the}} A zones, at each time of sampling. Results, however, suggested a possible effect of protection in modifying patterns of abundance of sponges under Cystoseira canopy (more abundant in the fully protected zone). In the subtidal habitat, differences were found in the structure of the whole assemblage and in the abundance of encrusting coralline red algae (more abundant outside the fully protected area). Notwithstanding the correct general methodology employed in the study, a lack of statistical power could have a role in preventing the detection of ecologically relevant effects of protection. In some instances, data pooling allowed a discrimination between cases where there was clearly no effect of protection and cases where there might be. On this basis, the optimization of this experimental design should be considered in further studies. In any case, if the goals of MPAs have not been clearly stated, efficacy of protection might prove very difficult to test even with the use of sound experimental designs...|$|E
