40|$|This study {{investigated}} cold weather safety footwear {{and the possible}} thermal effects of steel <b>toe</b> <b>caps</b> in footwear. Two models of boots were used. Both models were manufactured in two variants - with and without steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap.</b> The boot insulation was measured with an artificial, heated foot (AHF). One model was used in experiment with subjects (n= 6). Cold exposure consisted of sitting for 60 minutes at - 10 °C. There were no differences between insulation levels of boots with and without steel cap for one boot model, but the differences were statistically significant for the second model showing slightly higher insulation values for the boot without steel cap. No significant differences due to insulation dissimilarities could be found from the measurements on subjects. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} for both models regarding the rate of change of heat loss from AHF when its location was changed from warm to cold and back to warm. The rise and decrease of heat loss from AHF depended on the rate of temperature change of the boots. The results showed that a faster change in heat loss from AHF occurred for boots without steel <b>toe</b> <b>caps.</b> Data from subjects seemed to confirm this by a somewhat faster, though not significant, rise in toe skin temperatures after cold exposure in boots without steel <b>toe</b> <b>caps.</b> The effect may be attributed to the higher mass and heat contents of the boots with steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap...</b>|$|R

50|$|Oxfords {{were derived}} from the Oxonian, a half-boot with side slits that gained {{popularity}} at Oxford University in 1800. Unlike early shoes, Oxfords were cut smaller than the foot. The side slit evolved into a side lace that eventually moved to the instep, as students rebelled against knee-high and ankle-high boots. The <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> can either be lined with two narrow rows of stitching, perforated holes along the end cap stitching (quarter-brogue), perforated holes along the end cap stitching and on the <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> (semi-brogue), or a semi-brogue with the classical wingtip design (full-brogue).|$|R
50|$|Shoes {{are usually}} made with many pieces of leather, and the seams can be {{decorated}} in various ways; most revolve around {{some type of}} brogueing. Brogues have rows of decorative punching in patterns: full brogues, or wingtips (the standard American name), have a <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> in a wavy shape, with punched patterns on various sections of the shoe; half brogues have a normal straight edged <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> and less punching; finally, other terms such as quarter-brogue etc. {{may be used to}} describe progressively less brogueing. All of the standard styles below may be brogued.|$|R

5000|$|While {{the duck}} {{siblings}} are still figuring {{a way to}} snatch the basket, one of them play inside an old boot with an opened <b>toe</b> <b>cap.</b> Inside the <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> are sharp nails, giving the ducklings {{an idea for a}} new modus operandi. As the duck inside the boot comes to Elmer, the curious dog decides to take a close look. When Elmer holds out his nose, the boot's <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> closes, biting the dog with the pointy nails. While the dog twitches in pain, the ducklings nab the basket and set sail with it. Elmer takes off the boot, but it's too late. [...] As the ducklings ride the basket at sea and eat the contents, little do they know that they are being spotted by an octopus. The octopus grabs the little mallards and takes them below the surface. Elmer at first thinks of coming to their rescue but immediately turns back, recalling the theft they committed. Nevertheless, the dog's conscience prevails, and Elmer swims in the water.|$|R

40|$|Footwear {{with various}} {{insulation}} levels was evaluated. Some footwear was manufactured both {{with and without}} steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap.</b> Comparative studies between various methods (thermal foot model, human subjects, EN 344) were carried out. Data from subjects and foot model were used in evaluation of thermal properties of footwear. The data was tested in Lotens’ model for foot skin temperature prediction. Field {{studies were carried out}} for evaluation of footwear and feet conditions in real wear situation. Heavy winter boots had lowest insulation in toe zone and thin boots had heel zone as the coldest region. Even low sweat rates (3 g/h) can reduce footwear insulation considerably (9 - 19 %). At higher sweat rates (10 g/h) the reduction could be up to about 36 %. Combined effects of sweating, walking and wind could reduce insulation up to about 45 %. Reduction was bigger in warm winter boots. Minimal amount of moisture evaporates from winter footwear during use. Insulation reduction levelled off over longer period of use. The reduction can be calculated by simple equations. The thermal foot model gave similar insulation values as measured on human subjects in thermal comfort. The results from thermal foot model give more useful information on footwear than does the present standard method. The influence of steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> could be related to the "after effect" that probably depends on the thermal inertia of steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap.</b> Recommendations for footwear choice and use are given.

40|$|Present {{standard}} on safety footwear (EN 344) checks the insulation only {{at one point}} in the shoes by means of measuring the temperature change. A method that uses thermal foot model allows to measure footwear insulation simultaneously at various locations and for whole footwear as well. In the present work the method of heated foot model was developed further. It is possible to simulate sweating and evaluate reduction of insulation of footwear due to wetting and evaporative heat loss. The conditions with various sweat rates, wear length and foot motion were tested. Footwear with various insulation levels (from thin rubber boots to thick winter boots) was evaluated. Some footwear was manufactured both with and without steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> and this allowed to study the thermal effect of steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> in different conditions. Comparative studies between various methods (thermal foot model, humans, EN 344) for evaluating footwear thermal properties/insulation were carried out. Field studies were carried out for evaluation of footwear and feet conditions in real wear situation. The insulation of footwear can vary depending on region and insulation level of the footwear. Heavy winter boots had lowest insulation in toe zone and thin boots had heel zone as the coldest region. Sweat rates of 3 g/h can reduce footwear insulation considerably (9 - 19 % depending on initial dry insulation). At higher sweat rates (10 g/h) the reduction could be up to 36 %. Combined effects of sweating, walking and wind could reduce insulation by about 45 %. Reduction was bigger in warm winter boots. Only small amount of moisture evaporates from winter footwear during use. Insulation reduction levelled off over longer periods of use. The reduction can be calculated by simple equations. The thermal foot model gave similar insulation values as measured on human subjects in thermal comfort. The insulation values were used for validation of a mathematical model for foot skin temperature prediction. The results obtained with a thermal foot model give more useful information on footwear than does the present standard for footwear thermal testing. Thus, the thermal foot method is recommended for use as a standard. A steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> in a footwear seems to have no influence on insulation, but may modify the heat losses from the foot. The influence could be related to the “after effect” that probably depends on the mass of steel <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> and its thermal inertia.
