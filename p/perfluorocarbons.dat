40|$|Introduction: Partial liquid {{ventilation}} {{may benefit}} the lung disease in preterm neonates but intratracheal instillation of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> increases {{cerebral blood flow}} and may cause brain injury. We aimed {{to determine if the}} effects of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> administration on cerebral blood flow vary by dose-volume, rate of administration, endotracheal tube portal of entry, or closely targeting PaCO 2 . Methods: Forty-two dosing events (in eleven rabbits) were randomised to different dosing strategies, including a sham (i. e. , placebo/control) dose of air over 20 min, 20 mL/kg of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> slowly over 20 min, 10 mL/kg of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> slowly over 20 min, 10 mL/kg of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> moderately fast over 10 min, 10 mL/kg of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> rapidly over 5 min, 10 mL/kg of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> slowly over 20 min via the endotracheal tube tip lumen (as opposed to the proximal end of the tube used in all other groups), or 10 mL/kg of <b>perfluorocarbon</b> slowly over 20 min whilst targeting a PaCO 2 of 45 - 50 mmHg. Blood gases, haemodynamics, cortical cerebral blood flow and carotid flow were recorded continuously for 30 minutes from the start of each dose. Results: Carotid flow increased with 20 mL/kg <b>perfluorocarbon</b> and cortical cerebral blood flow was significantly more variable. Carotid and cortical cerebral blood flow increased using 10 mL/kg or 20 mL/kg with no difference between the two dose-volumes. There was no difference in cerebral blood flow by rate of administration, but carotid blood flow was more variable during slow administration. There were no differences in the increase in cerebral blood flow by portal of entry. If PaCO 2 was maintained between 45 - 50 mmHg there was no increase in cerebral blood flow and there was less variable carotid flow. Conclusions: Cerebral blood flow increases with <b>perfluorocarbon</b> dosing.

40|$|International audienceControlling the {{formation}} of surface nanostructures is highly important for various applications, and in particular for superhydrophobic properties. Here, taking 3, 4 -propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) as a model molecule, we study {{the influence of the}} decrease in the <b>perfluorocarbon</b> chain length or the use of two shorter <b>perfluorocarbon</b> chains on {{the formation}} of surface nanostructures and superhydrophobic by electropolymerization. Moreover, perfluorinated compounds, especially those with long <b>perfluorocarbon</b> chains, are extremely used in industry but the discovery of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential and toxicity alternatives have to be found. Hopefully, it seems that their effect is dependent on the perfluorinated chain length and that alternatives with shorter perfluorinated chains can be envisaged. Here, we show in the fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces that the use of shorter <b>perfluorocarbon</b> chains can even, in certain conditions, lead to better properties. Superhydrophobic properties with extremely low hysteresis are obtained with long <b>perfluorocarbon</b> chains (C 8 F 17) but very close properties are also obtained with short perfluorobutyl (C 4 F 9) and even perfluoroethyl (C 2 F 5) chains. Superoleophilic properties are obtained with C 2 F 5 chains, whereas the highest oleophobic properties were elaborated with the C 4 F 9 chains. This is due to a change in the surface morphology from cauliflower structures to nanofibers as the <b>perfluorocarbon</b> chain decreases. By contrast, the use of two shorter <b>perfluorocarbon</b> chains induces very high steric hindrance during the electropolymerization and as a consequence smoother surfaces with lower surface hydrophobicity.
