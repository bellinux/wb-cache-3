50|$|The forest {{includes}} lakes, bogs and wetlands, low {{mountains and}} rocky cliffs. Most {{of the forest}} has been logged once or twice, but a notable grove of low-elevation old-growth forest remains. The upper story is dominated by <b>Pinaceae</b> (<b>Pine</b> <b>Family)</b> including Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Tsuga heterophylla (Western Hemlock), Pinus contorta (Shore Pine), and Abies grandis (Grand Fir), as well as Acer macrophyllum (Bigleaf Maple), Arbutus menziesii (Pacific Madrone), and Alnus rubra (Red Alder). Important understory species are Gaultheria shallon (Salal) and Acer circinatum (Vine Maple).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pinaceae</b> (<b>pine</b> <b>family)</b> are {{trees or}} shrubs, {{including}} {{many of the}} well-known conifers of commercial importance such as cedars, firs, hemlocks, larches, pines and spruces. The family {{is included in the}} order Pinales, formerly known as Coniferales. Pinaceae are supported as monophyletic by their protein-type sieve cell plastids, pattern of proembryogeny, and lack of bioflavonoids. They are the largest extant conifer family in species diversity, with between 220 and 250 species (depending on taxonomic opinion) in 11 genera, and the second-largest (after Cupressaceae) in geographical range, found in most of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority of the species in temperate climates, but ranging from subarctic to tropical. The family often forms the dominant component of boreal, coastal, and montane forests. One species, Pinus merkusii, grows just south of the equator in Southeast Asia. Major centres of diversity are found in the mountains of southwest China, Mexico, central Japan, and California.|$|E
40|$|Fossil resins {{from the}} Cretaceous sediments of Meghalaya, India and Kachin, Myanmar (Burma) were {{analysed}} using Curie point pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thermochemolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to help elucidate their botanical source. The major pyrolysis products and methyl-esterified thermochemolysis products {{of both the}} resins were abietane and labdane type diterpenoids with minor amount of sesquiterpenoids. The thermochemolysis products also included methyl- 16, 17 -dinor callitrisate, methyl- 16, 17 -dinor dehydroabietate and methyl- 8 -pimaren- 18 -oate-the latter two from just the Myanmarese resin. The exclusive presence of both labdane and abietane diterpenoids {{and the lack of}} phenolic terpenoids may suggest that the studied Cretaceous resins were derived from <b>Pinaceae</b> (<b>pine</b> <b>family)</b> conifers.

25|$|The {{division}} name Pinophyta {{conforms to}} the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), which state (Article 16.1) that the names of higher taxa in plants (above the rank of family) are either formed from the name of an included family (usually the most common and/or representative), in this case <b>Pinaceae</b> (the <b>pine</b> <b>family),</b> or are descriptive. A descriptive name in widespread use for the conifers (at whatever rank is chosen) is Coniferae (Art 16 Ex 2).|$|R
50|$|Zangia is a genus of bolete {{fungi in}} the family Boletaceae. The genus, {{circumscribed}} in 2011, contains six species found in China. Zangia species grow in forests dominated by Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) mixed with <b>Pinaceae</b> (<b>pines).</b>|$|R

50|$|Laccaria laccata {{is found}} in {{scattered}} troops in wooded areas, and on heathland often in poor soil.

L. laccata is mycorrhizal with several types of trees, including members of the <b>Pinaceae</b> (<b>Pines),</b> Fagaceae (Beech), and Betulaceae (Birch). It is found across Europe and North America, south into Mexico and Costa Rica. Laccaria species are mycorrhizal, and thought by some to be pioneer species.|$|R
50|$|Pinus virginiana is {{a species}} of Pine. Common names for the Pinus virginiana are the Virginia, Scrub and Jersey Pine. Pinus virginiana has the {{following}} synonyms, Pinus inops Pinus ruthenica and Pinus turbinate. Pinus virginiana is a species in the order Pinales and the <b>family</b> <b>Pinaceae.</b> <b>Pines</b> are an evergreen tree. In general, pine trees were thought to have arisen anywhere from 153.1 million years ago to 271 million years ago. Pinus virginiana is a perennial tree, which means that it lives for numerous years. They are also gymnosperms. Gymnosperms produce seeds, {{but they do not}} protect these seeds with an ovary or with fruit and they lack flowers.|$|R
5|$|The genus, {{with about}} 20 {{described}} species, has a distribution that includes to Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. About {{half of the}} species {{are found in the}} southeastern United States, including three species added to the genus in 2013–14. Several Phellodon species were placed on a preliminary Red List of threatened British fungi because of a general decline of the genus in Europe. Species grow in a symbiotic mycorrhizal association with trees from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and <b>Pinaceae</b> (<b>pines).</b> Accurate DNA-based methods have been developed to determine the presence of Phellodon species in the soil, even in the extended absence of visible fruitbodies. Although Phellodon fruitbodies are considered inedible due to their fibrous flesh, the type species, P.niger, is used in mushroom dyeing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Extensive genome {{resources}} {{have now been}} developed for both spruce and pine. However as other technologies develop and costs drop, other resources become feasible. One such resource, not yet available in conifers, is collecting complete cDNA sequences (full length messenger RNA transcripts). We describe our approach for obtaining such sequences {{and the importance of}} this resource. Second, existing resources and new technologies are allowing new approaches in functional and comparative genomics. In functional genomics, new technologies and the integration of mRNA, protein and metabolite expression profiling promises to improve the identification of gene function, interaction and regulation. In comparative genomics, an apparent slowdown of evolutionary rate in the <b>pine</b> <b>family</b> should allow genome information to be easily transferred between spruce and pine (and other members of the <b>pine</b> <b>family).</b> Ultimately, genomics research should impact practical problems and traits in breeding and management programs. In our own program, we target spruce resistance mechanisms to the spruce weevil, a serious pest in British Columbia. 1...|$|R
