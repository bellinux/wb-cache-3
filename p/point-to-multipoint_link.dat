Each splitter typically splits the signal from a single fiber into 16, 32, or up to 256 fibers, depending on the manufacturer, and several splitters can be aggregated in a single cabinet.A beam splitter cannot provide any switching or buffering capabilities and doesn't use any power supply; the resulting connection is called a <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>link.</b> For such a connection, the optical network terminals on the customer's end must perform some special functions which would not otherwise be required. For example, due {{to the absence of}} switching, each signal leaving the central office must be broadcast to all users served by that splitter (including to those for whom the signal is not intended). It is therefore up to the optical network terminal to filter out any signals intended for other customers. In addition, since splitters have no buffering, each individual optical network terminal must be coordinated in a multiplexing scheme to prevent signals sent by customers from colliding with each other. Two types of multiplexing are possible for achieving this: wavelength-division multiplexing and time-division multiplexing. With wavelength-division multiplexing, each customer transmits their signal using a unique wavelength. With time-division multiplexing (TDM), the customers [...] "take turns" [...] transmitting information. TDM equipment has been on the market longest. Because there is no single definition of [...] "WDM-PON" [...] equipment, various vendors claim to have released the 'first' WDM-PON equipment, but there is no consensus on which product was the 'first' WDM-PON product to market.|$|E

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract In {{this thesis}} the {{spectral}} {{efficiency of the}} next generation wireless system WINNER (Wireless World Initiative New Radio) is investigated. Many factors influence spectral efficiency. In this work the focus is on relay enhanced cell deployments as well as multicast and broadcast transmission, which use <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>links.</b> For realistic deployments constraints from the user and the operator side are considered. For the user the received quality of service (QoS) is important. Criteria to define this QoS depend on the used service. On the other hand deployment constraints are specified by the operators. They are mostly based on economic reasons and practical realization issues. Relaying and multihop are assumed to be key technologies of future wireless systems to achieve high data rates and large coverage ranges. In this thesis relay enhanced cell (REC) deployments are developed for cellular network layouts and the WINNER base coverage urban test scenario. The most promising deployment for capacity optimization is evaluated in detail. The usage of relays causes two major problems. One is the partitioning of resources between the base station and the relay node, and the other is the cell selection, i. e., the decision on the serving radio access point, which might be a base station or a relay node. Solutions for both problems are developed. The average SINR and the spectral efficiency of relay enhanced cells are discussed. Multicast and broadcast transmission will be integrated in future wireless systems to provide multimedia and information services. It uses <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>links</b> in opposite to unicast transmission which uses point-to-point <b>links.</b> For <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>links</b> a new and coordinated transmission scheme is presented, including link adaptation, spatial processing and retransmissions. Coordinated transmission of several sites obtains macro diversity gains and improves the spectral efficiency of multicast and broadcast transmission. For coordinated transmission sites have to be synchronized and the influence of synchronization errors on macro diversity gains is discussed. Ilmenau, Techn. Univ., Diplomarbeit, 200...|$|R

Under a set of physical layer assumptions, we show {{that the impact of}} physical and data-link layer configurations to the upper layers in a wireless network can be characterized using a configuration graph, which is similar to a wireline network topology graph. Network layer utility optimization can consequently be carried out via iterations that optimize network layer algorithms over the configuration graph and incrementally revise physical, data-link layer configurations to improve the configuration graph.

Physical layer cooperation serves as an enabling technology for such a change. In latest cellular networks, neighboring infrastructure stations, such as base stations (BSs) or relay stations (RSs), share their communication resources to create virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by means of distributed transmission and signal processing. Cooperative processing at the BSs promises to exceed the limits on spectral efficiency imposed by inter-cell interference, thereby allowing ever more aggressive frequency reuse patterns. On the other hand, cooperation between BSs and RSs, as well as among RSs, is expected to extend coverage and capacity of <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>links</b> between BSs and mobile stations in a highly economical fashion.

30|$|Local {{multipoint}} distribution systems (LMDS), {{which are}} operating worldwide {{in the frequency}} range of 26 to 43 GHz, have large bandwidths of 0.1 up to 2 GHz but a limited area coverage of a few kilometers only. This is due to line-of-sight (LOS) constraints for reliable <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>links</b> as well as due to large propagation losses. The size of the macrocells illuminated by the base stations, where LOS exists, is approximately 1 to 5 km. As suggested in the CRABS report (1999), the maximal spectral efficiency can be obtained with a dual frequency and polarization reuse plan. This frequency and polarization reuse leads to interference. In this paper, we report a new technique that uses trellis-coded modulation (TCM) for increasing the capacity of LMDS networks. Analytical expressions have been derived for pairwise error probability for both high and low SNR scenarios. Numerical simulations have shown that using the proposed TCM schemes in cochannel cells {{have resulted in a}} large decrease in interference, thereby allowing us to reduce the frequency reuse distance. In this paper, we present the strategy using two TCM schemes that allow the frequency reuse factor of unity, without compromising on the QoS caused by increased interference. Design rules for constructing TCM schemes are also proposed in this paper.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical study for fixed wireless links based on IEEE 802. 16 standard in a vegetated residential environment. Field measurements were conducted for suburban microcell channel by utilizing 5. 8 GHz of Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure. A set of comprehensive measurements that covered 10 <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>links</b> surrounding Universiti Teknologi Malaysia {{were selected to}} investigate the impact of vegetation on propagating radio waves. This suburban location was characterized by trees and terrain blockage. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop a path loss model that incorporates vegetation effect. Received signal strength and factors influencing the performance of the signal strength are highlighted here. The accuracy of the proposed prediction model is analyzed, which quantifies that path loss is proportional to the distance of the tree to the receiver, size, density, and number of trees within the vicinity of transmitting and receiving antennas. Observation found that external effect, such as wind significantly affect the signal performance too. The terrain was another factor, which needs to consider into account before deployment of wireless links. Depending on the dynamic characteristics of the presence of trees between the communication links, the measurement results show that the path loss is increased from 5. 69 to 33. 67 dB. The results obtained are compared to Free Space Loss model, Weissberger model, and ITU-R model.

The values of median lapse rate of refractivity in lowest 1 km of atmosphere, effective earth radius factor and surface refractivity significantly less than those used by ITU have been observed. Refractivity gradients indicative of super-refraction and ducting are observed between heights of 52 m and 84 m for considerable amounts of time. Different current propagation models have been used to predict the median propagation loss values, which do not always clearly point out the dominant propagation mechanisms.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{wireless}} multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, remarkable capacity enhancements may be achieved in certain environments relative to single-antenna systems. In a non-line of sight (NLOS) environment with rich multipath, the capacity potential is typically very good, but {{in a line of}} sight (LOS) environment with a high Rician K-factor, the capacity improvement may be severely limited or almost disappear. The objective of the research described in this dissertation has been to develop a more thorough understanding of the capacity limitations of MIMO in a LOS environment and explore methods to improve that capacity. It is known that for a LOS link with a given range, an optimal antenna configuration, which usually involves large antenna spacings, can be computed to maximize the capacity. A method is here proposed for achieving near-maximum MIMO capacity in LOS environments with suboptimal array configurations. Suboptimal arrays may include small antenna spacings and/or arrays rotated off normal. The method employs single-antenna full-duplex, amplify-and-forward relays, otherwise known as "wireless repeaters. " We have designated this concept repeater-assisted capacity enhancement (RACE) for MIMO. Potential applications include tower-mounted or building-top cellular backhaul and high-speed wireless bridge links (explored in Chapter 5) and ground-to-air sensor network backhaul links and base-to-mobile links in a cellular configuration (explored in Chapter 7). We have analyzed this concept in simulation for point-to-point and <b>point-to-multipoint</b> <b>links</b> and have found the following critical parameters for system design and deployment: orientation, antenna spacing, and antenna patterns of the transmit (TX) /receive (RX) MIMO arrays; and position, noise figure, TX/RX isolation, and antenna patterns associated with the repeater(s). Simulation results for an n[subscript R] xn[subscript T] MIMO link demonstrate nearly a factor of n=min{n[subscript R], n[subscript T] } improvement in capacity relative to a single-input single-output (SISO) link using n- 1 optimally placed wireless repeaters supporting the link. Other portions of analysis presented include the development of a determinant-based metric for capacity (D) and an exploration of upper and lower bounds of capacity as a function of D. The position of repeaters is analyzed theoretically and a metric introduced based on D intended to quickly and intuitively determine optimal positions for repeaters assisting a given MIMO link based on TX/RX node steering vectors.

Assigning network resources to virtual links and, more generally to virtual network topologies, efficiently and on-demand {{is one of the most}} challeng-ing components of any network virtualization solution. This paper addresses the problem of on-line resource allocation of multiple virtual links on a Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure. The application context that is targeted is primarily the on-line provisioning of virtual overlay networks even if it can be broadened to address more general virtual networks. Considering an SDN physical infrastructure allows a complete freedom in choosing the optimal physical paths and the associated resources that support the virtual links with no interference from any other network function (such as routing). However, for the time being, forwarding in an SDN network is resource consuming with a noticeable impact on the size of the flow tables. Hence, forwarding (i. e. switching) resources should be carefully considered by the network resource allocation algorithm. This paper proposes an Integer-Linear formulation of the above cited problem by con-sidering: (1) point-to-point as well as <b>point-to-multipoint</b> virtual <b>links,</b> each with an associated bandwidth requirement and a maximum transfer delay requirement, (2) two types of network resources, namely network links' bandwidth and nodes' switching resources, and (3) optionally, path splitting which allows a virtual link to be established on multiple physical paths.

Larger UA operating at altitudes above 3000 feet will require at least occasional access to non-segregated, that is, controlled airspace. In order for unmanned aircraft to be integrated into the airspace and operate with other commercial aircraft, a very reliable command and control (a. k. a. control and non-payload communications, (CNPC)) link is required. For operations covering large distances or over remote locations, a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) CNPC link implemented through a satellite will almost always be required. Protected aviation spectrum (aeronautical mobile satellite (route) service, or AMS(R) S) would normally be used for such a safety-critical link, however studies have shown that currently available aviation safety satellite spectrum is inadequate to support the projected BLOS CNPC link bandwidth requirements. To address this inadequacy, the 2015 World Radio communication Conference studied the possible use of the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) to provide CNPC, including possible allocations in Ku-Band and Ka-Band, under Agenda Item (AI) 1. 5. Although UA CNPC satellite links in these bands were shown to meet operational availability and continuity requirements, a serious complication exists in that there are also terrestrial service allocations in these bands, in particular, Fixed Service (FS) point-to-point and <b>point-to-multipoint</b> microwave digital <b>links.</b> During the WRC- 15 study cycle, much opposition to AI 1. 5 was generated based on fears that UA CNPC satellite transmitters in these bands would impose unacceptable levels of interference to the FS receivers. NASA analyzed the possible interference from the UA transmitters based on probable UA transmission and FS receiver characteristics, and UA traffic distributions and densities to determine conditions under which UA could operate without imposing unacceptable interference levels to the FS. Ultimately, UA power flux density transmission limits were proposed as a way to insure protection of FS receivers and further studies were prepared on the various proposals.
