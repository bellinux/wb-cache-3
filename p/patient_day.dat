40|$|Background: Patient {{days are}} widely used in nurse {{staffing}} research and for nursing quality measurement. Nursing hours per <b>patient</b> <b>day</b> (NHPPD) and fall rates incorporate patient days in the denominator and are endorsed by the US National Quality Forum (NQF) as nursing sensitive consensus measures. Measurement error introduced by patient days would affect the accuracy of these nursing quality indicators. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the reliability of five <b>patient</b> <b>day</b> reporting methods accepted by the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI). The specific aims were (1) to investigate the agreement of five <b>patient</b> <b>day</b> measurements with a defined quasi-gold standard, (2) to explore method bias by investigating the association of potential confounding variables with the differences between the routine measurements and the quasi-gold standard, and (3) to extrapolate the potential effect of bias of the <b>patient</b> <b>day</b> methods on nursing quality indicators. Design: A multiple census study with a national convenience sample of hospital units in the US was conducted. Setting: 260 out of 282 units (92 %) from 54 hospitals sent bi-hourly patient census data for seven randomly selected days in September 2008. Methods: The multiple census data comprised the quasi-gold standard and was compared with data routinely submitted to the database. Intraclass correlations were calculated for an agreement analysis. A Bayesian regression analysis was conducted to explore the impact of different data collection methods and the degree of short stay patients. Results: Overall agreement between routine data and the quasi-gold standard was excellent (ICC [95 % CI]: 0. 967 [0. 958 – 0. 974]).

Design: A cross sectional analysis using inpatient hospital discharge data and financial data from seventy short-term general hospitals, both for-profit and not-for-profit. Methods: Discharge data from year 2000 was obtained from Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). This data was used to calculate Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) related to after surgery complications in 840, 945 hospital discharge records from 70 short-term general hospitals across the state of Florida. The predictor variables include: payroll expenditures per admission, payroll expenditures per <b>patient</b> <b>day,</b> personnel (FTE) per admission, personnel (FTE) per <b>patient</b> <b>day</b> and payroll expense {{as a percent of}} total operating expenses. Main outcome measures: Nine patient safety indicators defined by AHQR and specific to after surgery complications: complications of anesthesia, foreign body left during procedure, postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma, postoperative physiologic and metabolic derangement, postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, postoperative respiratory failure, postoperative sepsis, postoperative wound dehiscence. Results: Patient safety indicator rate showed an inverse relationship with the percent of total operating expense represented by payroll, Personnel per <b>patient</b> <b>day</b> and personnel per admission.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{number of}} defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> {{is often used}} as an {{indicator}} for the selection pressure exerted by antibiotics in the hospital setting. However, this unit of measurement does not fully describe the selection pressure and is sensitive to changes in hospital resource indicators. Additional information is required to facilitate interpretation of this indicator. The number of DDD per 100 admissions could be a valuable additional tool. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the importance of units of measurement in quantifying antibiotic use data with regards to antibiotic resistance risks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Trends in antibiotic use in acute care Dutch hospitals between 1997 - 2001 were studied. Antibiotic use was expressed in DDD per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> and in DDD per 100 admissions. RESULTS: From 1997 to 2001, total systemic antibiotic use significantly increased from 47. 2 to 54. 7 DDD per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days,</b> whereas expressed in DDD per 100 admissions it remained constant. Some individual antibiotics increases in DDD per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> were not accompanied by increases in DDD per 100 admissions and vice versa.

The objective was to guide policy on size (economies of scale), ownership, certification status, and reimbursement. Economies of scale were not found important: skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) offered the only evidence of operation below optimal scale, and the savings attributable to achieving optimal scale (increasing average bed size from 108 to 143) amounted to only $ 0. 20 per <b>patient</b> <b>day.</b> Proprietary facilities were consistently less costly than voluntary or governmental facilities; however, quality measures were not available, and the largest cost differential was in direct cost where quality might be affected.

Several studies have investigated the relationship between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, but the results of these studies have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance at a private hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia, from 2008 - 2010. METHOD: This was an ecological study based on inpatient retrospective data froma private hospital in Surabaya 2008 - 2010. We examined the percentage of resistantbacterial isolates (using WHONET software) as the dependent variable and the amount of antibiotic use (expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days)</b> as the independent variable. Correlation and linear regression analyseswere used to analyse antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance among six most commonly isolated bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae ss. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus non-haemolytic (gamma). RESULT: Total antibiotic use was 80. 9 DDD per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days.</b> The most commonly used antibiotics were ceftriaxone (10. 7 DDD per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days),</b> levofloxacin (8. 6 DDD per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days)</b> and amoxicillin (8. 3 DDD per 100 <b>patient</b> <b>days).</b> Correlation between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance was weak and not statistically significant for the six bacteria (R = - 0. 04 – 0. 2; p = 0. 4 – 0. 9).

Utilizing industrial engineering techniques, time weights, or work units, were developed for 27 predefined pharmacy tasks. Workload data were applied to the work units per task and a productivity index was ascertained. The index was corrected for personal, fatigue and delay time and was then used to assess pharmacy staffing levels. In addition, an attitude survey was conducted to discover the staff's understanding of the methodology and their opinions as to its usefulness in determining productivity. Results of the six month trial yielded two months (October 1977 and January 1978) which were overstaffed. The overstaffing in October probably represented under reporting of workload as the staff became familiar with the workload reporting system. In January, pharmacy personnel hours were increased to implement a new service and the resulting overstaffing situation was reflective of the inefficiencies of implementing a new service. In addition, tabulation of the attitude survey indicated that pharmacy personnel felt that the work unit methodology was valuable in assessing productivity and should be an ongoing process. Application of linear regression analysis to data resulted in a statistically insignificant regression between <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> and the calculated productivity; thus, documenting that <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> were an incomplete and, therefore, inadequate indicator of pharmacy staffing requirements. It is important to realize that no one universal formula will be able to determine the productivity or predict the staffing requirements of every given hospital pharmacy. However, results of the study prove {{that it is possible to}} develop a methodology that is more accurate and more complete than gross indicators such as <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> and line items and that such a methodology is applicable to today's hospital pharmacy practice...|$|R

These included the use of VAP/CLABSI-related antibiotics, the presence of mechanical ventilation or an intravenous central line, and the presence of specific clinical symptoms. Triggers were automatically fired by the PDMS. Chest X-rays and microbiology culture results were checked only on <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> with a positive trigger signal from the ESS. In traditional screening, no triggers were used; therefore, chest X-rays and culture results had to be screened for all <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> of all included patients.

40|$|Maine {{implemented}} a hospital rate-setting program in 1984 at {{approximately the same}} time as Medicare started the Prospective Payment System (PPS). This study examines the effectiveness of the program in controlling cost over the period 1984 - 1989. Hospital costs in Maine are compared to costs in 36 non rate-setting states and 11 other rate-setting states. Changes in cost per equivalent admission, adjusted <b>patient</b> <b>day,</b> per capita, admissions, and length of stay are described and analyzed using multivariate techniques. A number of supply and demand variables which were expected to influence costs independently of rate-setting were controlled for in the study. Results indicate the program was effective in containing costs measured in terms of cost per adjusted <b>patient</b> <b>day.</b> However, this was not true for the other two cost variables. The average length of stay increased during the period in Maine hospitals indicating an association with rate-setting. Several supply variables, especially the number of beds per 1, 000 population were strongly associated with the cost and use of hospitals. ...|$|E

40|$|Background There is {{increasing}} recognition that lower nurse staffing levels {{are associated with}} higher morbidity and mortality among medical and surgical patients. The degree to which this applies to elderly patients with hip fractures is unclear. Questions/purposes We conducted a pilot study using administrative data as an initial step in investigating the relationship between nurse staffing levels and in-hospital mortality among elderly patients with hip fractures. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed administrative data for 13, 343 patients 65 years or older with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture admitted to 39 Michigan hospitals between 2003 and 2006. We used logistic regression to calculate the change in predicted probability of in-hospital death conferred by differences in the hospitals ’ overall number of full-time equivalent reg-istered nursing staff (FTE-RN) per <b>patient</b> <b>day.</b> Regression models controlled for patient age, gender, and comorbid conditions; hospital characteristics including teaching sta-tus, hip fracture volume, and income/racial composition of the hospital’s zip code; and seasonal influenza. Results We found an association between hospital-wide nurse staffing levels and in-hospital mortality among patients with hip fractures. The odds of in-hospital mor-tality decreased by 0. 16 for every additional FTE-RN added per <b>patient</b> <b>day,</b> even after controlling for covariates. This association suggests the absolute risk of mortality increases by 0. 35 percentage points for every one unit decrease of FTE-RN per <b>patient</b> <b>day,</b> a 16 % increase {{in the risk of}} death. Conclusions Decreased hospital-wide nurse staffing lev-els are associated with increased in-hospital mortality among patients admitted with hip fractures. These obser-vations indicate the need for further studies to characterize this relationship for staffing of units caring for patients with hip fractures.

40|$|Background. Medical {{emergency}} teams (METs) or {{rapid response}} teams (RRTs) facilitate early intervention for clinically deteriorating hospitalized patients. In healthcare systems where financial resources and intensivist availability are limited, {{the establishment of}} such teams can prove challenging. Objectives. A low-cost, ward-based response system was implemented on a medical clinical teaching unit in a Montreal tertiary care hospital. A prospective before/after study was undertaken to examine the system’s impact on time to intervention, code blue rates, and ICU transfer rates. Results. Ninety-five calls were placed for 82 patients. Median time from patient decompensation to intervention was 5 [*]min (IQR 1 – 10), compared to 3. 4 hours (IQR 0. 6 – 12. 4) before system implementation (p< 0. 001). Total number of ICU admissions from the CTU was reduced from 4. 8 / 1000 <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> (± 2. 2) before intervention to 3. 3 / 1000 <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> (± 1. 4) after intervention (IRR: 0. 82, p= 0. 04 (CI 95 %: 0. 69 – 0. 99)). CTU code blue rates decreased from 2. 2 / 1000 <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> (± 1. 6) before intervention to 1. 2 / 1000 <b>patient</b> <b>days</b> (± 1. 3) after intervention (IRR: 0. 51, p= 0. 02 (CI 95 %: 0. 30 – 0. 89)). Conclusion. Our local ward-based response system achieved {{a significant reduction in}} the time of patient decompensation to initial intervention, in CTU code blue rates, and in CTU to ICU transfers without necessitating additional usage of financial or human resources...|$|R
