50|$|The {{evolution}} of modern farming in Ireland in the 20th century is {{closely linked to}} the activities of Horace Plunkett, founder of the co-operative movement and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland in 1899.As the co-operative movement evolved largely to support dairy farming and butter production {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, it was natural that pig farming would continue to develop alongside it as the by-products of dairy (whey from cheese andcasein production, and skim milk) provided an excellent and cheap source of feed for pigs. Significant pork production facilities were established, for example, in the town of Mitchelstown, County Cork, which was also a major centre of dairy and cheese production.The modern pig industry began to take shape from the 1960s, when the first large <b>pig</b> <b>units</b> were developed and coincided with introduction of the Landrace breed, which had its origins in Denmark, from the 1950s onward. The Landrace and the Large White are, today, the dominant breed of pig in commercial production in Ireland. In the decades 1960 to 1990, a government breeding programme brought about rapid improvements in carcass leanness in both, a process further supported by importation of high-quality breeding stock.From the 1990s onward, a new breeding model has emerged reflecting the disappearance of traditional small breeders and the large-scale uptake of artificial insemination (AI) in the commercial sector. The majority of <b>pig</b> <b>units</b> now use almost 100 per cent AI.Internationally, there are three main models for pig production: vertical integration; co-operative ownership; and independent producer. The majority of <b>pig</b> production <b>units</b> in Ireland are of the third kind, independently operated and family owned.Today, there are approximately 440 commercial <b>pig</b> <b>units</b> in Ireland, of which some 290 are fully integrated breeding to finishing <b>units.</b> Areas where <b>pig</b> production is particularly concentrated include Cavan, Cork and South Tipperary. Though pig farming is, in the majority of cases, a farm-family operated business it is also predominantly a specialised undertaking, i.e., the sole or main enterprise on the farm.|$|R

Veterinary Record, 150, (10), 313 - 315 IN 1967, a <b>pig</b> <b>unit</b> was established at Wangchutaba, near Thimphu, the capital of the Royal Kingdom of Bhutan. The principal objective of the <b>pig</b> <b>unit</b> was to produce and distribute robust young breeding pigs to farmers in rural communities across the country. In 1977, the unit expanded and, in 1978, a National Pig Breeding Centre (NPBC) was established at Serbithang. Foundation stock included the saddleback and large white brought in from India and, later, the white Duroc and large black were introduced from Thailand and the UK (Halliwell 1994). The original Wangchutaba unit, with 40 breeding sows, also developed a fattening unit to supply pig meat to the population of Thimphu, and two other breeding units were established in other dzongkhags (regions) of the country (Sarbang and Limitang). Routine veterinary care for sows at all centres included vaccination against swine fever and the use of a benzimidazole or ivermectin (Ivomec; MSD AGVET) product for parasite control. At all breeding centres there was a wide variation in piglet size and rate of weight gain, leading to bullying and an uneven distribution of feed resources. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} spread of African swine fever (ASF) within a <b>pig</b> <b>unit</b> {{and the impact of}} unit size on ASF spread, a {{simulation}} model was created. In the model, an animal can be in one of the following stages: susceptible, latent, subclinical, clinical or recovered. Animals can be infectious during the subclinical stage and are fully infectious during the clinical stage. ASF virus (ASFV) infection through residues of dead animals in the slurries was also modeled in an exponentially fading-out pattern. Low and high transmission rates for ASFV were tested in the model. Robustness analysis was carried out in order to study the impact of uncertain parameters on model predictions. The results showed that the disease may fade out within the <b>pig</b> <b>unit</b> without a major outbreak. Furthermore, they showed that spread of ASFV is dependent on the infectiousness of subclinical animals and the residues of dead animals, the transmission rate of the virus and importantly the unit size. Moreover, increasing the duration of the latent or the subclinical stages resulted in longer time to disease fade out. The proposed model is a simple and robust tool simulating {{the spread of}} ASFV within a pig house taking into account dynamics of ASFV spread and the unit size. The tool can be implemented in simulation models of ASFV spread between herds...|$|E

40|$|End {{of project}} reportThe {{purpose of this}} study was to assess some {{environmental}} and management factors that affect growth performance on commercial <b>pig</b> <b>units.</b> In experiment 1, a survey was carried out on 22 <b>pig</b> <b>units</b> of known growth performance in south-west Ireland to compare management factors between those showing poor and good growth rates. Low growth rate appears to be due to the cumulative effect of a combination of factors. Experiment 2 was conducted to determine the effects of providing an additional feeder on performance of weaned piglets. No benefits were recorded. Feed consumed from the additional feeder was a replacement for feed that otherwise would have been consumed from the control hopper feeder. Experiment 3 was designed to determine if pig performance and efficiency of growth were affected by weight at birth and at weaning. Lightweight pigs showed inferior growth performance up to the finisher period. Although they compensated some of the inferior growth towards the time of slaughter, they never reached the weights of the heavy birth-weight animals. Males were either significantly heavier or tended to be heavier than females throughout. There was no significant difference between the sexes in the number of days to slaughter. Light and heavy pigs did not differ in the levels of IGF- 1 in their blood plasma; however lightweight pigs had significantly lower IgG preweaning. Experiment 4 aimed to determine whether piglet birth weight influenced growth performance, plasma IGF- 1 concentrations and muscle fibre characteristics at day 42 of life. At slaughter (Day 42) light birth weight pigs were significantly (P < 0. 001) lighter. Plasma IGF- 1 concentration was lower by 28 % (P= 0. 06) in light pigs.

Clinical signs, gross and histopathological examination, microbiology and toxicology, indicated that Pasteurella multocida infection was the cause of disease. Molecular and serotyping analyses showed that P. multocida isolates (obtained from live-caught birds with clinical respiratory disease) were all capsular type F with a mix of somatic serotypes 3, 4 and 7. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) increased the diagnostic sensitivity of the analysis and detected P. multocida within the pulmonary lesions of all affected live-caught birds and 10 of 12 birds found dead.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a history}} of the use of World War II-era American conscientious objectors as the subjects of medical research. Under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, conscientious objectors had two choices: provide noncombatant service within the military or provide work of national importance under civilian direction under the auspices of a program called Civilian Public Service (CPS). Conscientious objectors who chose assignment to CPS were placed in camps in which the men labored on a work project authorized by the U. S. Selective Service System, the government entity that administered the draft. At the outset of the CPS program, the camps were modeled after the work camps of the Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal jobs program. Over time, and largely due to protests that such Civilian Conservation Corps-type forestry and soil conservation work assignments were not the promised work of national importance, other types of CPS camps were developed, with work projects dealing with public health, custodial care for the mentally disabled, or scientific research. In the later, which became commonly known as the guinea <b>pig</b> <b>units,</b> over five hundred conscientious objectors voluntarily participated as research subjects for a diverse assortment of scientific studies, including projects that dealt with infectious diseases, diet, frostbite, psycho-acoustics, and the impacts of temperature extremes and of altitude.

At a site in the Austrian North-alpine foreland, direction-dependent separation distances for a 1000 head <b>pig</b> <b>unit</b> (calculated on the basis of a 2 -year time series of meteorological data) lie between 99 m for northerly winds and 362 m for westerly winds. For these direction-dependent separation distances we analysed when odour sensation can be expected in relation to meteorological parameters as well time of the day and year. For the main wind directions, West and East and odour sensation can be expected more often for higher wind velocities and...|$|E

To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} different levels of digestible lysine in diets with high energy density on productive performance and carcass characteristics of finishing pigs. Materials and Methods. Seventy crossbred barrows (initial body weight of 83. 36 kg) were used and allotted in a randomized block design with five treatments, seven replications and two <b>pigs</b> per experimental <b>unit.</b> <b>Pigs</b> were fed ad libitum with diets containing 3. 5 kcal/kg of ME and five levels of digestible lysine (0. 46, 0. 52, 0. 58, 0. 64 and 0. 70...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} four {{experiments}} {{was carried out}} to study the survival of Ascaris suum eggs: in a <b>pig</b> slurry <b>unit</b> on a farm, in the laboratory under anaerobic conditions and different relative humidities (rH), and under simulated field conditions. Survival of eggs in the <b>pig</b> slurry <b>unit</b> was 20 % after four weeks and 0 % after 16 weeks. Anaerobic conditions had only a minor influence on survival: after 12 weeks, more than 80 % of the eggs could still develop. At high relative humidities (100 % and 75 %), survival was respectively 96 % and 62 % after 12 weeks. At 47. 5 % rH, survival dropped to 0 % after 10 weeks and at 7. 5 % rH in 8 weeks. A. suum eggs kept in pig slurry under dry and sunny outdoor conditions survived for 2 - 4 weeks, whereas under wet and shady conditions, 90 % of the eggs were still viable after 8 weeks...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} fields calculated {{with three}} Gaussian models and one Lagrangian dispersion model are validated against {{a set of}} SF 6 concentration data provided by the German environmental programme BWPLUS. The source was a <b>pig</b> fattening <b>unit</b> in fairly flat terrain. The results reveal that, in flat terrain with steady undisturbed flow, the use of Gauss models is still justified, whereas Lagrangian models should be used whenever the flow is modified by obstacles or topography...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{industrialisation}} {{of livestock}} farming since the 1950 s {{has been accompanied}} by public and legislative concern directed towards a range of issues, including food safety and the negotiation of risk, and also the ethics attached to the care, slaughter and commodification of unprecedented numbers of animals in large scale production. Drawing on ethnographic data generated by long term fieldwork on intensive <b>pig</b> <b>units,</b> the thesis foregrounds the firsthand accounts of stockmen to explore in detail how pigs are produced now, and the reciprocal ways that pig production ‘makes’ people. Although these processes take place out of public view, pigs and people are nevertheless produced in response to external expectations, imaginations, and markets. The thesis shows how these influences, farmers’ attitudes, and the methods of pig production itself, are currently undergoing revision and change. By doing so, the thesis resists the idea that industrialisation and globalisation always and everywhere result in a flattening of space and time, arguing instead that what is produced is neither completely old or new, but rather an articulation between traditional forms of animal husbandry and new varieties of knowledge, technology and embodied practice.
