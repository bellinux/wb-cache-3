5|$|The Condor Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, {{particularly}} providing air dominance from 1937 onwards; 300 air-to-air victories were claimed, {{although this}} was dwarfed by some 900 claimed by Italian forces. Spain provided a proving ground for German tank tactics, {{as well as}} aircraft tactics, the latter being only moderately successful. The air superiority which allowed {{certain parts of the}} Legion to excel would be replicated {{in the first year of}} World War II, until ultimately failing to <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{lower half of the}} painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history {{to that point}} and the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E

25|$|Chariots of Fire is the {{inspirational}} true {{story of}} two great British athletes, outsiders who overcome prejudice and personal strife {{to compete in the}} 1924 Paris Olympics. Eric Liddell is a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God. Harold Abrahams is the son of an immigrant Lithuanian Jew who runs to overcome prejudice. The two young track athletes live for the purity and honour of running, and <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of enormous odds. The story begins in 1919, and climaxes in the heartbreaks and triumphs of the 1924 Paris Olympics.|$|E

In 1981 and 1985 he did not appear on the ballot, but dropped out after early moves to stage a campaign failed to generate broad enough support. In 2001 Badillo unsuccessfully sought the Republican mayoral nomination, losing badly to billionaire businessman and political neophyte Michael Bloomberg who would later <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election.|$|E

The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early {{in a series of}} battles, including a final decisive defeat at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the Shenandoah Valley, a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, {{questions}} of hygiene posed {{a problem in}} the camps, built in haste. The goal was to quickly build a maximum number of installations, which relegated sanitary considerations to the back burner. Camps in Germany featured only a simple faucet in the yard for thousands of people. Very often, latrines consisted of a simple board with a hole in the middle above a pit, which the prisoners were tasked with emptying at regular intervals. Because of their basic construction, the toilets often overflowed during powerful rains, making an unbreathable atmosphere <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> camps. Moreover, the clayey soil turned to muck from the first rains.|$|E
25|$|One year {{following}} his release, de Hory, by then a celebrity, returned to Ibiza. He told {{his story to}} Clifford Irving who wrote the biography: Fake! The Story of Elmyr de Hory the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time. De Hory appeared in several television interviews, and was featured with Irving in the Orson Welles documentary, F for Fake (1973). In Welles's film, de Hory questioned {{what it was that}} made his forgeries inferior to the actual paintings created by the artists he imitated, particularly since they had fooled so many experts, and were always appreciated when it was believed that they were genuine. In F for Fake, Welles also poses questions {{about the nature of the}} creative process, how trickery, illusion, and duplicity often <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art world, and thus, in some respects, downplays the culpability of the art forger de Hory and outliers like him.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} {{colonization}} of America, the Northwest Passage {{had always been}} of special interest since it was speculated that it could offer a shortcut to Asia. Many attempts at crossing were made but very few succeeded due to the very unforgiving conditions that <b>prevail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Arctic {{for most of the}} year. The British explorer Sir John Franklin actually found a passage between 1845 and 1847 but this achievement was not known until years later as he and his crew had perished on the journey. Robert McClure was the first explorer to survive the expedition in 1850 but he completed the journey on a sled. It is only in 1906 that the passage was navigated entirely on water by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. However, construction of the Panama Canal had already begun at that time and its completion in 1914 lessened the need for this route.|$|E
