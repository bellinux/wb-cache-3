5000|$|The {{research}} activities of Erspamer spanned more than 60 years {{and resulted in}} the isolation, identification, synthesis and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>study</b> of more than sixty new chemical compounds, especially polypeptides and biogenic amines, but also some alkaloids. Most of these compounds were isolated from animals, predominantly amphibians. In the late fifties his research shifted to peptides. In the laboratories of the Institute of Medical Pharmacology, University of Rome, he isolated from amphibians and mollusks more than fifty new bioactive peptides. These became the subjects of numerous studies in other laboratories in Europe and North America. In 1979, he focused on opioid peptides specific to Phyllomedusa, a genus of tree frog from Central and South America. These were used by the native Indians in initiation rites, to increase their prowess as [...] "hunters" [...] and make them feel [...] "invincible". They applied secretions from the skin of these frogs that resulted in euphoric and analgesic effects. The peptides studied by Erspamer have become essential to characterize the functional role of opioid receptors.|$|E
5000|$|From gene {{expression}} patterns obtained in microarray datasets, correlation between cellular physiology and diseases can be revealed. Divergence studies (e.g. Jensen-Shannon divergence computations which interprets difference in {{gene expression}} and probability of distribution patterns) reveals gene expression distribution difference between AD and normal aging brains. That is, expressed genes that are {{negatively correlated with}} normal aging brain but are positively correlated with AD brains are possible biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment. Combining KEGG and PATHWAY studio, ATP5C1, COX6A1, NDUFV2, PLCB1, and PPP3CA are metabolism and mitochondrial-related genes that {{have been shown to}} be reduced in AD samples. Furthermore, metabolic dysregulations such as calcium homeostasis [...] and insulin signaling have also been identified to contribute to the onset of AD. Genes that are associated with calcium and insulin signaling are found using GATHER (online bioinformatics tool for analyzing genomic signatures). In fact, insulin signaling impairment and AD has been considered to be related in many levels. Functional protein sequence alignments (e.g. ClustalW, MUSCLE) and phylogenetic analysis (e.g. Phylip, Mega) demonstrate that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are highly linked in these two diseases. Increased BChE contributes altered lipoprotein metabolism and insulin insensitivity, and is positively correlated to hypertension and diabetes in correlation studies. AChE allows stabilization of neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), which is one of the main target for AD treatment. However, recent in silico <b>pharmacological</b> <b>study</b> examined drug-disease interaction showed that AChE inhibitors may not be the answer to AD treatment. PKC, ARG, HDAC, and GSK3 inhibitors that regulate calcium homeostasis and genetic modification of cell cycle and apoptosis may be the future targets of AD medication.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review was undertaken by analyzing distinguished books, undergraduate and postgraduate theses, and peer-reviewed scientific articles and by consulting worldwide accepted scientific databases, such as SCOPUS, Web of Science, SCIELO, Medline, and Google Scholar. Medicinal plants used as immunostimulants were classified into two categories: (1) plants with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> and (2) plants without pharmacological research. Medicinal plants with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> of their immunostimulatory properties were subclassified into four groups as follows: (a) plant extracts evaluated for in vitro effects, (b) plant extracts with documented in vivo effects, (c) active compounds tested on in vitro studies, and (d) active compounds assayed in animal models. <b>Pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> {{have been conducted}} on 29 of the plants, including extracts and compounds, whereas 75 plants lack <b>pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> regarding their immunostimulatory activity. Medicinal plants were experimentally studied in vitro (19 plants) and in vivo (8 plants). A total of 12 compounds isolated from medicinal plants used as immunostimulants have been tested using in vitro (11 compounds) and in vivo (2 compounds) assays. This review clearly indicates the need to perform scientific studies with medicinal flora from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, to obtain new immunostimulatory agents...|$|R

40|$|Women {{are known}} to have {{stronger}} prosocial preferences than men, but it remains an open question as to how these behavioural differences arise from differences in brain functioning. Here, we provide a neurobiological account for the hypothesized gender difference. In a <b>pharmacological</b> <b>study</b> and an independent neuroimaging study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural reward system encodes the value of sharing money with others more strongly in women than in men. In the <b>pharmacological</b> <b>study,</b> we reduced receptor type-specific actions of dopamine, a neurotransmitter related to reward processing, which resulted in more selfish decisions in women and more prosocial decisions in men. Converging findings from an independent neuroimaging study revealed gender-related activity in neural reward circuits during prosocial decisions. Thus, the neural reward system appears to be more sensitive to prosocial rewards in women than in men, providing a neurobiological account for why women often behave more prosocially than men...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{frequent}} co-abuse {{of alcohol}} and tobacco may suggest that they share some common neurological mechanisms. For example, nicotine acts on Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain to release dopamine to sustain addiction. Might nAChRs be entwined with alcohol? Objectives This review summarizes recent studies {{on the relationship between}} alcohol and nAChRs, including the role of nAChRs in molecular biological studies, genetic <b>studies</b> and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> on alcohol, which indicate that nAChRs have been potently modulated by alcohol. Methods We performed a cross-referenced literature search on biological, genetic and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> {{of alcohol and}} nAChRs. Results Molecular biological and genetic studies indicated that nAChR (genes) may be important in mediating alcohol intake, but we still lack substantial evidence about how it works. <b>Pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> proved the correlation between nAChRs and alcohol intake, and the association between nicotine and alcohol at the nAChRs. The positive findings of varenicline (a partial agonist at the _ 4 _ 2 nAChR, smoking-cessation pharmaceutical) treatment for alcoholism, provides a new insight for treating co-abuse of these two substances. >Conclusions Molecular biological, genetic and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>studies</b> of alcohol at the nAChR level, provide a new sight for preventing and treating the co-abuse of alcohol and nicotine. Given the important role of nAChRs in nicotine dependence, the interaction between alcohol and nAChRs would provide a new insight in finding effective pharmacological treatments, in decreasing or stopping alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking concurrently...|$|R

The <b>pharmacological</b> <b>study</b> {{was carried out in}} vivo on Wistar rat pre-treated with propolis extract 100 mg/kg/day for seven days. Doxorubicin at 10 mg/kg of body weight was administered intravenously on Day 7. Serum creatinine concentration, scavenging effect of flavonoids, lipid peroxidation and glutathione concentration were measured. Chemical analysis allowed identification and quantification of the phenolic compounds including pinostrombin chalcone (38. 91 %), galangin (18. 95 %), naringenin (14. 27 %), tectochrysin (25. 09 %), methoxychrysin (1. 14 %) and a prenylated coumarin compound suberosin (1. 65 %). The total flavonoid concentration in the propolis extract was 370 mg (quercetin equivalents QE) /g dry weight (QE/g DWPE). Propolis extract restored the renal functions and reduced the toxic effect of doxorubicin. These data show a protective effect of Algerian propolis extract against doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress...|$|E
