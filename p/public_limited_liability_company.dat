The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: [...] "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC.

40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to study the}} special rights other than shares in Spanish Law {{and the protection of}} their holders in cross-border mergers of <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> within the European Union frame. Special rights other than shares are recognised as an independent legal category within legal systems of some EU Member States, such as Germany or Spain, through the implementation of the Third Directive 78 / 855 /CEE concerning mergers of <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies.</b> The above-cited Directive contains a special regime of protection for the holders of securities, other than shares, to which special rights are attached, consisting of being given rights in the acquiring company, at least equivalent to those they possessed in the company being acquired. This safeguard is to highlight the intimate connection between this type of rights and the company whose extinction determines the existence of those. Pursuant to the Directive 2005 / 56 /CE on cross-border mergers of <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> each company taking part in these operations shall comply with the safeguards of members and third parties provided in their respective national law to which is subject. In this regard, the protection for holders of special rights other than shares shall be ruled by the domestic M&A regime. As far as Spanish Law are concerned, holders of these special rights are recognized a right of merger information, in the same terms as shareholders, as well as equal rights in the company resulting from the cross-border merger. However, these measures are not enough guarantee for a suitable protection, thus considering those holders of special rights as special creditors, sometimes {{it will be necessary to}} go to the general protection regime for creditors. In Spanish Law, it would involve the recognition of right to the merger opposition, whose exercise would prevent the operation was completed until ensuring equal rights. ...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the fourth EMOT-workshop, theme 1, Economic performance outco- 1 mes in Europe, Berlin, January 30 -February 1, 1997 This paper discusses performance characteristics and differences at three levels: at sector, firm and top management level. First, it explores {{the extent to which}} the particularities of the Dutch business system history influence the economic performance of different types of firms and sectors in the Netherlands. Elaborating on earlier work on the Dutch business system (Iterson and Olie, 1992; van Dijk and Punch, 1993 : Sorge and Iterson, 1995, Iterson, 1997), it will be hypothesised which sectors and types of firms will prosper in the socio-institutional context and which sectors and types of firms will not. For instance, it will be brought forward that the agricultural sector, the mineral fuels and chemicals sector, the foods and detergents sector, the transport and transshipment sector and the financial services sector have emerged in a favourable socio-institutional context whereas the steel and the car sector have not. As to different types of firms, it will be brought forward that family-owned and state-owned companies are much less dominant in the Netherlands than <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies.</b> At firm level, special attention will be given to the large multinational corporations, such as the Royal Dutch Shell Group, Unilever, AKZO, DSM and Philips. Secondly, the socially constructed managerial capabilities and discretion - again, related to economic performance - will be explored in this paper. They are to be understood as an outcome of the idiosyncratic formation of social groups in the Netherlands and the related emergent governance principles (Cf. Kristensen, 1995), which is known as `pillarisation'. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2006, Norway {{introduced}} a boardroom quota requiring {{a minimum of}} 40 percent of each gender in the boardroom of <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> (ASA). Companies were given until January 2008 to comply. This paper investigates whether Norway’s boardroom quota has had positive spillover effects on the corporate executive committee (C-suite). Through econometric modeling, I will test {{if there was a}} significant increase in female representation and reduced gender wage gap among chief executive officers (CEOs) and executive vice presidents (EVPs) post-quota. My empirical analyses on CEOs are conducted based on data from Statistics Norway from 2004 to 2015. For the EVPs, a case study examining the ten largest ASA companies in Norway is conducted. My empirical results indicate limited evidence of higher female representation in the C-suite post-quota (2008 - 2015). While the female representation has increased in CEO and EVP positions post-quota, my analyses fail to prove that this increase is due to the quota. When investigating a shorter time period (2008 - 2011) there is some evidence of higher female representation due to the quota. However, this finding only applies to CEOs in large firms where the workforce is dominated by women. Furthermore, I find that female CEOs and EVPs earn on average 28. 9 % and 16. 2 % less than their male counterparts when comparing the fixed salary, respectively. My analyses also find a significant gender gap in other types of remunerations. When investigating the effects of the quota, my findings suggest no reduced gender wage gap among CEOs and EVPs. Altogether, this study suggests that the boardroom quota has had no substantial spillover effects on the female representation and gender wage gap in CEO and EVP positions...|$|R

40|$|Danmarks Nationalbank {{introduced}} its annual report on financial stability in Denmark in 2000. The {{purpose of the}} analyses is to identify risks currently faced by the financial sector. As the stability in the financial sector depends on the customers' financial circumstances, and as the majority of lending from Danish banks is granted to companies in Denmark, analyses of the development in the non-financial sector are crucial in a financial stability context. The primary goal {{of this paper is}} to make a tool that can assist the regular analyses of the non-financial sector, namely to make a model that is able to predict the firms that end up in financial distress. As the firms in the non-financial sector may go out of business for various reasons (financial distress, voluntary liquidation, and because they are merged or acquired, etc.) the method of competing-risks models seems appropriate. To get point identification a parametric competing-risks model is suggested. The parametric competing-risks model is estimated and the results are reported. The empirical analysis is based on a panel data set containing information on the whole population of Danish non-financial <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> (aktieselskaber) and private <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> (anpartsselskaber) that existed between 1995 and 2001, covering around 30, 000 firms and more than 150, 000 firm-year observations. After application of certain criteria (e. g. exclusion of holding companies and financial institutions), the sample is representative. More than 20 explanatory variables are included in the estimations. Compared to the existing literature this study introduces a number of novel elements to the empirical analysis. Firstly, the empirical distinction between three modes of exit is developed, namely between firms in financial distress, voluntarily liquidated firms, and firms that merge with other firms or are acquired by other firms, and a competing-risks model is estimated. Secondly, a large number of proxies are used for inherently unobservable variables (e. g. uncertainty, ability and motivation). As is discussed in the paper, proxies are important. Thirdly, the extraordinary data set provides an opportunity to compare different specifications of credit risk models, and so the competing-risks specification is compared to a pooled logit model (where all exits are pooled) and to a simple financial distress model (where the exit to financial distress is modelled and all other firms are treated as censored) ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{main source}} of state public health {{institutions}} financing in Ukraine is budgetary funding. In order to overcome the underfunding, the idea of multichannel health financing was proposed in the late 1990 s. The main forms of extrabudgetary financial support of public health institutions in Ukraine are voluntary health insurance, non-profit self-financing, charity and sponsorship. The study aims to deeper {{understand the nature of}} alternative financing mechanisms of state public health institutions in Ukraine and peculiarities of their use in practice. METHODS. The proposed study is exploratory. Case-study was selected as research method. Nine unstructured interviews were conducted in six health care facilities that have {{agreed to participate in the}} study. All studied facilities were in-patient. RESULTS. The sources of financial revenues of the studied institutions were as follows: reimbursement for treatment of insured patients, reimbursement for treatment of sickness funds members, payments for services (medical examinations, counseling, transportation to the hospital), rental of premises, payment for internship from the students of paid forms of medical education, charitable contributions, contracts with companies, contracts with private clinics based in <b>public</b> institutions’ premises (<b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> private entrepreneurs), sponsorship, grants, gifts, payments for services for foreigners, and in-kind revenues. Major health facilities expenditures were the following: salaries (not covered from extrabudgetary revenues; ranged from 70 % to 92 % of the funds provided to the institutions from state (municipal, regional) budget), energy carriers (partially covered from extrabudgetary funds), patients nutrition, medicines, materials, household expenditures, reparation of premises, and purchase of equipment (mostly covered from extrabudgetary revenues). In the studied cases, funds raised by alternative funding mechanisms amounted from 2 % to 22 % of the total annual institutions budgets, depending on the type of facilities and administrative subordination. CONCLUSIONS. Alternative financing mechanisms (extrabudgetary revenues) help to support functioning of public healthcare institutions. In the studied cases, extrabudgetary revenues amounted on average 10 % of the annual institutions budget. Considering that 70 - 92 % of the funds provided to the institutions from state (municipal, regional) budget were spent on salaries, extrabudgetary funds significantly help public health institutions to work...|$|R
