30|$|If {{one looks}} at the {{potential}} impacts of FPs on shaping the European Research Area (ERA), the most critical issues are the availability and dissemination of FP <b>project</b> <b>result</b> data. This concerns both lower, individual project level and centralised EC level. Currently the <b>project</b> <b>results</b> are not easily available for the use of individual projects/persons or for FP evaluation purposes. Consequently, the FP output quality needs improvements both on a project level (e.g. longer supported maintenance of web sites) and community level (centralised FP project output database). Managerial incentives such as rewards and bonuses for successful projects and excellent R&D achievements by the Commission could provide here a possibility to increase the project quality in terms of <b>project</b> <b>results</b> and dissemination <b>activities</b> alike.|$|R

40|$|Nuclear Safety in Europe {{is one of}} the EU's primary concerns, {{therefore}} the EU decided to take a prominent role to help the New Independent States and countries of Central and Eastern Europe {{to ensure the safety of}} their nuclear reactors. The EU TACIS and PHARE programmes in nuclear safety have been undertaken since 1991. The European Commission's Directorate General External Relations (EC DG RELEX) and Directorate General EuropeAid Co-operation Office (EC DG AIDCO), are responsible for programming and management of implementation of TACIS projects. DG Enlargement (EC DG ELARG) is responsible for programming PHARE programmes, but implementation of most projects has been deconcentrated and decentralised to the Beneficiary Countries. In these activities the TSSTP Unit at the JRC/IE in Petten, The Netherlands, is the technical and scientific adviser of above mentioned EC Directorates General. Several PHARE projects aiming at improving nuclear safety have been successfully implemented for a number of plants from Central and Eastern Europe. In some cases major safety issues have been addressed by means of multi-country <b>projects</b> and <b>results</b> have been disseminated to the rest of the nuclear community. Although a lot of information has been exchanged at a bilateral level, further effort is needed to collect the <b>project</b> <b>results</b> in a systematic way and make them available by means of the internet. At present the TSSTP Unit is implementing two projects for dissemination of PHARE <b>project</b> <b>results.</b> This <b>activity</b> will take a better advantage of today's communication technologies and ensure the management of the acquired knowledge through preservation and user-friendly access and retrieval of the <b>project</b> <b>results.</b> The paper provides an outline of the TSSTP Unit relevant knowledge preservation initiative, a description of the web-based informatics platform used to support the dissemination of PHARE <b>project</b> <b>results,</b> and summarizes the results from the major PHARE Nuclear Safety projects.

40|$|Four {{inactive}} liquid {{low-level waste}} (LLLW) tanks were scheduled for remedial actions as the Batch L Series I Tank Project during fiscal year (FY) 1995. These tanks are 3001 -B, 3004 -B, T- 30, and 3013. The initial tank remediation project was conducted as a maintenance action. One project {{objective was to}} gain experience in remediation efforts (under maintenance actions) to assist in conducting remedial action projects for the 33 remaining inactive LLLW tanks. Batch I, Series 1 <b>project</b> <b>activities</b> <b>resulted</b> in the successful remediation of tanks 3001 -B, 3004 -B, and 3013. Tank T- 30 remedial actions were halted {{as a result of}} information obtained during waste characterization activities. The conditions discovered on tank T- 30 would not allow completion of tank removal and smelting as originally planned. A decision was made to conduct a root cause analysis of Tank T- 30 events to identify and, where possible, correct weaknesses that, if uncorrected, could result in similar delays for completion of future inactive tank remediation projects. The objective of the analysis was to determine why a portion of expected <b>project</b> end <b>results</b> for Tank T- 30 were not fully achieved. The root cause analysis evaluates project events and recommends beneficial improvements for application to future projects. This report presents the results of the Batch I, Series root cause analysis results and makes recommendations based on that analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We derive the {{circumstances}} under which the Kyoto Protocol lead to effective and efficient control of emissions of carbon dioxide. We focus attention to abatement of carbon emissions produced as by-products of industrial production or deforestation. Since carbon emissions generate a positive private consumption benefit as well as a negative and global externality, we utilize the impure public good model to describe tastes. We find that both abatement trading and interregional transfers, implemented by an international authority, are necessary for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol. The equilibrium for the Kyoto Protocol game is Pareto efficient. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, completed December 10, 1997, will probably be remembered most for its innovative use of emissions trading to control global greenhouse gas emissions. 1 However, it will also be remembered for the promulgation of two other incentives – clean development mechanisms and international transfers. The idea behind clean development mechanisms is articulated in Article 11 of the protocol, whereby (1) “[less developed] countries will benefit from <b>project</b> <b>activities</b> <b>resulting</b> in certified emissions reductions, ” and (2) “[developed countries] may use the certified emissions reductions accruing from suc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInterdisciplinary {{developments}} in engineering create challenges {{with regards to}} how <b>resulting</b> <b>projects,</b> technologies, <b>activities</b> impact their broader environment. Under the paradigm of sustainable development, concerns with maximizing positive impacts and minimizing negative impacts are raised. Social impact assessment has been developed {{in the context of}} large industrial projects. For the past about forty years a complex theoretical and practical ground has been developed, sustained by regulations that enforce the use of SIA. Under the sustainable development paradigm, SIA is regarded as a process of analysis that aims to anticipate and manage any intended and unintended impacts generated by planned interventions within the human (and natural environment). As a result SIA becomes a valuable contributor for data-based decision making within management processes. The most recent distinctions with regards to SIA are aiming to position this tool rather ex-ante than ex-post within a planned intervention (project, investment, policy, etc.) [10]. This paper explores into pathways to use SIA tools within engineering projects and emphasize the contributions brought about by the use of such tools...|$|R

The level of expertise among project participants was considered high in both FPs by both the co-ordinators and lead-users.

On the one hand, the majority of project co-ordinators agreed that the <b>project</b> <b>results</b> in both FPs were adequately disseminated to the end-users. The lead-users agreed with the good dissemination level regarding FP 6 projects. On the other hand, in more general terms, e.g. for FP evaluation purposes neither the <b>project</b> <b>result</b> dissemination level nor the quality were adequate. At the time of METRONOME evaluation, the <b>project</b> <b>results</b> were not easily available from a centralised web address.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the project research activities in Genetics course, especially the authentic-based research that utilize Drosophila melanogaster. The present study is qualitative descriptive with the object of this study is project activities in Genetics course. In this institution, the Genetics course is divided into Genetics I (taken by fourth semester students) and Genetics II (taken by fourth semester students). Data collection was conducted from 2014 until 2017 using open ended interviews and observation. An analytical strategy from Miles & Huberman was used to analyze the data. D. melanogaster was used as model organism in several Genetics projects. The genetics project was conducted from first until sixteenth week. In the project activities, the students get some flies strains, observe its phenotypes, design their research project, collect the data, analyze the data, prepare the report, ant present their <b>project</b> <b>result.</b> In this <b>activities,</b> students could practice to be a real researcher.
