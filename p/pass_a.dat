5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E

5|$|As more {{information}} about 's notoriety among neighbors surfaced, focus of investigation shifted towards {{the circumstances under which}} he gained and retained gun license and firearms. In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic, a person must <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> qualification exam, receive a health clearance by a general practitioner, who may require a further examination by a specialist, such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation, and must <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> background check. According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act, an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years. Similarly, the law further makes gun license unaccessible to people with mental illnesses. The license must be renewed every five years (every ten years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014). The renewal requires the presentation of a new health clearance, while the police conduct a new background check. 's license was renewed in January 2015.|$|E

25|$|After the triumph, Caesar {{set out to}} <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> ambitious {{legislative}} agenda. He {{ordered a}} census be taken, which forced {{a reduction in the}} grain dole, and decreed that jurors could only come from the Senate or the equestrian ranks.

He <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> debt-restructuring law, which ultimately eliminated about a fourth of all debts owed.|$|R

Meanwhile, the left-wing OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, {{twice as many as}} the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 million).|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E

25|$|Netball {{strategy}} involves {{several types}} of passes, including centre passes, penalty passes and short <b>passes.</b> <b>A</b> centre <b>pass</b> occurs after <b>a</b> goal has been scored, when the Centre <b>passes</b> the ball. <b>A</b> short <b>pass</b> is <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> between two players on the same team, where {{the length of the}} pass is so short that a defensive player cannot get between the two opposing players to intercept the ball. <b>A</b> penalty <b>pass</b> is <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> where the ball is returned from the sideline into play.
