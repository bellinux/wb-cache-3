5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to be}} sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E
500|$|The {{stated goal}} of the American aerial interdiction campaigns was to force Hanoi to <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> high a price in blood to make the {{continued}} support of its goals in South Vietnam tenable. In this effort, the U.S. failed. Not only were the PAVN/NLF able to continue their efforts, but they managed, under a deluge of ordnance, to launch two major offensives (the Tet Offensive in 1968 and the Nguyen Hue Offensive [...] in 1972 and a counteroffensive (against Operation Lam Son 719 in 1971). The key {{to the failure of}} the American strategy was that the anti-infiltration campaigns targeted supplies and transportation (both of which were imported), instead of manpower. The price in casualties for the PAVN/NLF was high, but it was a price that Hanoi was able and willing to pay.|$|E
500|$|... "True social-cost pricing of {{metropolitan}} travel {{has proven to}} be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents. Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many." ...|$|E

500|$|Since its creation, {{the program}} has {{received}} much criticism {{both within and outside}} Puerto Rico. Critics argue that, since the program provides non-taxable income without any employment requirements, recipients receive free money without incentives for work, which hinders the economic output and development of the island, especially when Puerto Rico's employment participation and unemployment rates have been consistently inferior to U.S. national levels, while the average aid provided in Puerto Rico has exceeded the U.S. national average ($94 versus $74.79, respectively; 2001 estimate). Because of this, Puerto Rico has been called the [...] "welfare island". People from the Dominican Republic do many of the jobs in Puerto Rico that <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> little to attract the locals. However, proponents of the program argue that Puerto Rico's social condition is in far worse shape than any of the 50 U.S. states. Approximately half of the island's population lives below the U.S. Federal poverty guidelines, and many have difficulties in meeting their nutritional needs due to increasing inflation and economic stagnation in the island. Furthermore, the relation between the NAP program's benefits and the low employment participation and high unemployment rates has not been studied, and there is no consensus on their actual causes.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1971 {{interview}} with Dick Cavett, Knievel {{stated that he}} was uninsurable following the Caesars' crash. [...] Knievel said he was turned down 37 times from Lloyd's of London, stating, [...] "I have trouble getting life insurance, accident insurance, hospitalization and even insurance for my automobile...Lloyd's of London has rejected me 37 times so if you hear the rumor that they insure anybody, don't <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> much attention to it." [...] Four years later, a clause in Knievel's contract to jump 14 buses at Kings Island required a one-day $1 million liability insurance to the amusement park. [...] Lloyd's of London offered the liability insurance for what was called a [...] "laughable $17,500". [...] Knievel eventually paid $2,500 to a U.S.-based insurance company.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} Intentional Interruption: Breaking Down Learning Barriers to Professional Practice, Steven Katz and Lisa Ain Dack {{identified}} six mental barriers to learning in PLCs: [...] "we don't think through all possibilities; {{we focus on}} confirming our hypotheses and not challenging them; we <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> much attention to things that are vivid; we consider ourselves to be exceptions; we hesitate to take action in a new direction; we don't want others to see our vulnerabilities". Katz and Dack opt for a psychological definition of learning: [...] "Learning is the process through which experience causes permanent change in knowledge or behaviour". It is the characteristic of permanence which raises the bar for all professional learning, because learning as permanent change is not easy or natural to achieve. Katz and Dack urge designers of professional learning to avoid the [...] "activity trap" [...] of assuming that participation in a protocol or process guarantees real learning has occurred or putting so much emphasis on the activity that learning is lost in the shuffle.|$|E

2500|$|C.R.B. Combellack openly {{challenges}} Ousby's {{interpretation of}} the Informer's identity. He feels that since, [...] "Shakespeare's objections to false accusations against him are the very {{subject matter of the}} poem, an Informer who lays information against another is particularly apropos in the poem". Combellack subscribes to the idea that there are four characters represented in Sonnet 125: the Speaker, the Friend, the Informer, and the Suborner. He believes that the actions of the first quatrain were accusations leveled against Shakespeare as the Speaker. For Combellack, Shakespeare becomes the canopy-bearer as a means of advancement toward fame and fortune. In the second quatrain, Shakespeare shows how those who participate in these grand gestures often <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> much and lose a great deal only to have their gestures be seen as empty. Combellack sees the third quatrain as the offer of genuine love to the Friend, [...] "uncomplicated by any secondary thought of self-interest, in return for love". The couplet then changes tone once more as Combellack views it. He sees it as Shakespeare defending himself against gossip by pointing out how [...] "outrageously untrue gossip" [...] could not possibly be believed by his Friend. There is more hope in Combellack's interpretation of Sonnet 125, because he sees the altruism of the love offered by Shakespeare and how vehemently he denies the rumors against him.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1929, just a {{year after}} the {{purchase}} of Cook Forest by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, McCreight proposed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home in Cook Forest along the Clarion River. The Seneca people of the Iroquois Confederacy once inhabited the great forest, and McCreight visioned man once again living in harmony with nature. It was also wonderful opportunity for McCreight’s Lakota friends to regularly visit The Wigwam, and he proposed that Good Face, William Spotted Tail, John Sitting Bull and Flying Hawk, with their families, be invited to live in Cook Forest. McCreight explained his proposal to the U.S. Indian Field Service of the Department of the Interior in Wood, South Dakota: [...] “I wish you would see Good Face and talk with him about the Cook Forest Park. [...] It is likely that he with his wife would very much enjoy coming to stay at least for a time in this beautiful place. He would be among the best people always and have all the rights and liberties that he would care for, and I am sure it would more than <b>pay</b> <b>too.</b> [...] The Clarion River runs through the property, and he could have his bark canoe, go fishing, if permitted, and his duties would be to watch the fires and act as a guide and keep up the trails, etc. I think it would be arranged that he would have a salary, and his wife would get considerable by selling bed work out to the tourists. [...] It was my idea that they could have not only a log house but tepee which they could move at will and there are many beautiful places along the river and in the forests, to camp in the summer.” ...|$|E
