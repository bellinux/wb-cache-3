500|$|Radcliffe is a {{supporter}} of the Labour Party. Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: [...] "...I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around long enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making <b>people</b> <b>sit</b> up and get excited.

2500|$|Although he was {{expected}} to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with data collection to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them. Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment: [...] "I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it." [...] Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, [...] "Music in Radio." [...] Adorno was primarily interested in how the musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life. [...] "The meaning of a Beethoven symphony," [...] he wrote, [...] "heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert-hall where <b>people</b> <b>sit</b> as if they were in church." [...] In essays published by the Institute's Zeitschrift, Adorno dealt with that atrophy of musical culture which had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—towards conformism, trivialization and standardization—already present in the larger culture. Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the project. At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was duly left out. Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was nevertheless prolific, publishing [...] "The Radio Symphony", [...] "A Social Critique of Radio Music", and [...] "On Popular Music", texts which, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are now found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's recent translation, Current of Music. In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute.|$|E
