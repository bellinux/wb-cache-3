40|$|BACKGROUD: <b>Protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> is a {{frequent}} finding in patients with chronic liver disease, but investigations of nutritional status have been rarely performed in individuals seen at outpatient clinics AIM: To evaluate the nutritional status of patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis, attended {{for the first time}} at a reference outpatient clinic for liver diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 300 consecutive patients attended at the outpatient clinics of a reference center for liver diseases were investigated. Anthropometric evaluation was performed by the usual parameters: triceps skinfold, arm circumference and arm muscle circumference. Biochemical parameters included creatinine/height index, serum albumin and lymphocytes count. The nutritional diagnosis was based on the PCM score proposed by Mendenhall et al. Food intake was retrospectively evaluated using 24 -hour dietary recall data. RESULTS: About 71 % of the patients studied were chronic alcohol abusers, whereas in 29 % cirrhosis was of nonalcoholic etiology. Independently of the disease etiology 75. 3 % of the patients showed some degree of <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> which was moderate or severe in 38. 3 % of them. More advanced <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> degrees were associated with lower energy and protein intake. The prevalence of moderate or severe <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> was higher in patients classified as Child-Pugh C than in patients classified as Child-Pugh A (21 % x 58 %, respectively). Regarding sexual differences, fat reserves, evaluated by triceps skinfold, were more depleted in females than in males (48. 6 % x 26. 6 %) regardless of the etiology of the cirrhosis, whereas muscle reserves (arm muscle circumference) were more depleted in males (43. 4 % x 13. 4 %) regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis. In contrast, cirrhosis of alcoholic etiology was determinant in reducing arm muscle circumference in females (20 % x 9. 1 %) CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the high prevalence of <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> occurring early in the natural history of the disease and accompanying functional hepatic deterioration. In addition, attention should be paid to the different gender patterns of response to <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in these patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> as {{evidenced}} by loss of weight or of lean body mass is a commonly seen disorder. Although its cause is clearly multifactorial, objective measures of <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> have been repeatedly correlated with poor patient outcomes. Total parenteral nutrition was developed to halt or reverse this disorder, but its ability to improve the short- to intermediate-term outcome in patients with impaired nutrient intake has been highly inconsistent. Factors influencing this variable outcome include the degree of functional impairment in the treatment group, the underlying disease causing the impaired intake, and possibly the amount and composition of nonprotein calories delivered. In particular, considerable evidence points to intravenous soybean oil emulsion as a negative factor in the nutritional support of stressed patients.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> (PCM) {{adversely}} affects {{more or less}} all immune competent cells. Nonspecific immunity is impaired, particularly adherence and chemotaxis of phagocytes, {{although the}} responsiveness of circulating cells {{may not be the}} same as that of noncirculating cells. PCM results in numerical and functional impairment in lymphocytes. PCM markedly affects IgG class antibodies which have the highest affinity when directed against T-dependent antigens. These impairments are interrelated, since cooperation between T-helper cell and B-cells is depressed, and the antigen presen-tation to T-helper cells by macrophages is deficient. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 11 : 309 - 313, 1987) <b>Protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> (PCM) is generally con-sidered to be the most frequent cause of immunodepres-sion.

40|$|Cellular and humoral {{aspects of}} the {{antibacterial}} activity of macrophages during experimental <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> were studied. There were no defects in chemotaxis or bactericidal activity of cells from protein-deficient animals, al-though phagocytosis-associated oxygen consumption and hexose monophosphate shunt activity were depressed. However, marked impairment of humoral chemo-tactic factors generated in the peritoneal cavity by glycogen injection and of heat-labile serum opsonins for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi-murium, and Salmonella enteritidis was found. The studies suggested that some macrophage antibacterial functions measured in vitro are not altered in experimen-tal acute <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> but that serum factors, presumably comple-ment-derived, would limit their in vivo function. Thymic involution and lympho-cyte depletion would further impair in vivo cellular immune reactions affected by macrophages.

40|$|Background: One {{anastomosis}} (mini) gastric bypass (OAGB) {{is believed}} to be more malabsorptive than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A number of patients undergoing this procedure suffer from severe <b>proteinâ€“calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> requiring revisional surgery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the magnitude of severe <b>proteinâ€“calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> requiring revisional surgery after OAGB and any potential relationship with biliopancreatic limb (BPL) length. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was carried out on the surgeons performing OAGB. Data were further corroborated with the published scientific literature. Results: A total of 118 surgeons from thirty countries reported experience with 47, 364 OAGB procedures. Overall, 0. 37 % (138 / 36, 952) of patients needed revisional surgery for malnutrition. The highest percentage of 0. 51 % (120 / 23, 277) was recorded with formulae using > 200 cm of BPL for some patients, and lowest rate of 0 % was seen with 150 cm BPL.

40|$|An {{experimental}} <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> {{was produced}} in weanling Sprague-Dawley rats. The model resembles human malnutrition with respect to weight loss, inanition, angular stomatitis, anemia, lymphopenia, hypoproteinemia with hypoal-buminemia, and marked thymic involution. In addition, systemic invasion by gram-negative rods was documented. However, no edema was produced, and animals did not survive for longer than six weeks on the protein-deficient diet. One percent gly-cogen {{was found to be}} a satisfactory nonprotein stimulus for induction of a peri-toneal exudate consisting primarily of young macrophages. Electron microscopy showed that morphologic events of phagocytosis and degranulation proceeded nor-mally in macrophages from protein-deficient animals. In addition, cell surface re-ceptors for IgG were preserved under these experimental conditions. These data indicate that weanling rats may be employed as a small animal model for severe, ful-minant <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in humans. <b>Protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition</b> (PCM) continues to be a prevalent problem throughout the world [1].

We studied the immunological consequences ofa subgroup of malnourished subjects-nine patients with anorexia nervosa, who typically have a lower incidence of infection. The profiles of the patients with anorexia nervosa deviated from the reported typical profile of significantly depressed cell-mediated immunity in subjects with the more common forms of <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> demonstrating normal T-lymphocyte populations and unimpaired prolifera-tive lymphocyte responsiveness to mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and concana-valin A.

However, mean triceps skinfold and arm muscle circumference were 49 &plusmn; 25 and 78 &plusmn; 9 % standard, respectively. Mean serum albumin was 2. 7 &plusmn; 0. 6 g/dl and although mean serum transfer-rin level was 184 &plusmn; 86, eight patients had levels less than normal.
