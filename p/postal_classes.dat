50|$|Since the Breast Cancer Research Stamp {{was first}} {{offered for sale}} in 1998 the DOD BCRP has {{received}} 30% from the sales of the US <b>Postal</b> Service's first <b>class</b> Breast Cancer Research Stamp (Public Law 105-41, Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act 1585), totalling $16,387,657.27.|$|R
50|$|On September 25, 2013, the USPS {{announced}} a 3 cent {{increase in the}} First <b>Class</b> <b>postal</b> rate, to be effective January 26, 2014, increasing {{the price of a}} stamp to 49 cents. Bulk mail, periodicals, and package service rates were also increased by 6 percent. A loss of US$5 billion during the 2013 fiscal year was the reason given for the increase.|$|R

[...] Tourist steam locomotives continued to use the line until 1988. An 030T Borsig T3 and a <b>postal</b> van, both <b>classed</b> as Monuments Historiques, are preserved by the CTS at their Kibitzenau depot.|$|R

5000|$|The Acharya is {{also the}} founder editor of [...] "ARSHA NADAM" [...] Magazine, which is {{exclusively}} devoted to the studies related to the Vedas and Upanishads. He admitted all Hindus irrespective of their caste, in his Gurukulam. Moreover, he initiated them {{to the world of}} Vedic knowledge by presenting them with the sacred thread (janayu) and the scared Mantra, hitherto viewed as exclusive birthrights of Brahmins. The Acharya has so far delivered about 5000 discourses on various topics mainly on Vedas and Vedic practices. He continued his life's mission ignoring health problems. It was Acharya Narendra Bhushan who for first time in Kerala introduced <b>postal</b> tuition <b>classes</b> for Sanskrit. He established the 'Veda Press' (Akshara Bodhini) in Chengannur in 1978 mainly for publishing materials and books related to Vedic studies in Malayalam.|$|R
50|$|Post {{offices and}} other mail service {{providers}} typically offer a mail forwarding service, {{commonly known as}} hybrid mail or virtual post office box services, to redirect mail addressed to one location to another address - usually for a given period. In {{the case of the}} United States <b>Postal</b> Service's First <b>Class</b> Mail, it is generally for a period of one year. British Royal Mail provides a service called Mail Redirection, enabling redirection for up to two years. Customers of such a service usually, but not exclusively, use mail forwarding when they change address.|$|R
5000|$|The American Woman's League {{was created}} by the {{magazine}} publisher Edward Gardner Lewis in 1907. In part, it was a maneuver to lower postal rates by appealing to educational and social opportunities that would appeal to the emerging women's suffrage movement. His magazines, Woman's Magazine and the Woman's Farm Journal, had been denied second <b>class</b> <b>postal</b> rates because they were judged as advertisements and thus did not qualify for a lower rate as second class mail. Rather than magazine sales representatives making commissions, as was the common practice at the time, the payments went to form local women's [...] "Chapter Houses".|$|R
50|$|Reseda {{remained}} {{primarily an}} agricultural {{community with a}} population of 1,805 in 1930. However, by 1940 the population had increased to 4,147 residents. The mid to later 1940's saw a large increase in the numbers of single-family dwellings in Reseda and the loss of numerous acres of agriculture, and the addition of First <b>Class</b> <b>Postal</b> Service. Reseda {{was one of the first}} suburbs in the San Fernando Valley. The large ranches were subdivided, and the area was developed by realtors just as the veterans of World War II were returning home. The familiar orange groves were successively plowed under in favor of housing. At the time, most of the jobs were in the Los Angeles Basin and to the south, over the Santa Monica mountains.|$|R
50|$|Gamerang {{operates}} its rental service {{similarly to}} online video rental {{services such as}} Netflix and Blockbuster Online. Members pay a monthly fee and receive video games delivered to their homes via United States <b>Postal</b> Service First <b>Class</b> Mail, using pre-paid mailers. Subscribers keep the games {{as long as they}} wish and may return them at any time, as long as an account is paid in good standing. Once the returned game is received by the distribution center, the next game on a user's Game Queue, or list of game titles prioritized in order of desired delivery, is sent. Members also are provided the option to purchase games they have rented rather than send them back, as well as to purchase new and previously-played games directly from the Gamerang website.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{conventional}} feedforward neural networks for character recognition {{have been designed}} to classify a large number of classes with one large networkstructure, inevitably it poses the very complex problem of determining the optimal decision boundaries for all the classes involved in a high-dimensional feature space. Limitations also exist in several aspects of the training and recognition processes. This paper introduces the class modularity concept to the feedforward neural networkclassi"er to overcome such limitations. In the class-modular concept, the original K-classi"cation problem is decomposed into K 2 -classi"cation subproblems. A modular architecture is adopted which consists of K subnetworks, each responsible for discriminating a class from the other K! 1 classes. The primary {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove the e!ectiveness of class-modular neural networks in terms of their convergence and recognition power. Several cases have been studied, including the recognition of handwritten numerals (10 classes), English capital letters (26 classes), touching numeral pairs (100 classes), and Korean characters in <b>postal</b> addresses (352 <b>classes).</b> The test results con"rmed the superiority of the class-modular neural networkand the interesting aspects on further investigation...|$|R
