40|$|Capillary zone {{electrophoresis}} (CZE), {{a powerful}} separation method {{based on the}} differential migration of charged species {{under the influence of}} an electric field, has been widely used for separations covering from small ions to big biomolecules. Chapter 1 describes the method, then discusses detection of the separated analytes by laser induced fluorescence and by chemical derivatization, and the use of O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) as a post-column reagent. Chapter 2 describes a <b>post-column</b> <b>reactor</b> which uses two narrow bore capillaries connected coaxially.

40|$|Physical and {{structural}} characteristics of rice flour and starch obtained from gamma-irradiated white rice were determined. Pasting viscosities of the rice flour and starch, analyzed {{by using a}} Rapid Visco Analyser, decreased continuously {{with the increase in}} irradiation dosage. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that gelatinization onset, peak and conclusion temperatures of rice flour and starch changed slightly but the enthalpy change decreased significantly with increase of irradiation dosage. All irra-diated starch displayed an A-type X-ray diffraction pattern like the native starch. Gel permeation chromatography showed that the blue value ratio of the first peak (amylo-pectin) to the second one (amylose) decreased with the increase of the irradiation dosage. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and gyration radius (Rz) of amylo-pectin analyzed by using HPSEC-MALLS-RI (high-performance size-exclusion chro-matography equipped with multiangle laser-light scattering and refractive index detector) decreased gradually from 1. 486109 (Mw) and 384. 1 nm (Rz) of native rice starch to 2. 366108 (Mw) and 236. 8 nm of 9 kGy-irradiated starch.

40|$|Abstract Eighty-five {{samples of}} cocoa {{products}} sampled in Canada were analysed for ochratoxin A (OTA) and afla-toxins in 2011 – 2012. Inclusion of the aflatoxins {{in this survey}} required additional method development. Chocolate was extracted with methanol–water plus NaCl, while for cocoa two successive extractions with methanol and meth-anol–water were made. Extracts were cleaned on an AflaOchra immunoaffinity column (IAC). Determination was by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatog-raphy (HPLC). Detection of the aflatoxins was with a <b>post-column</b> photochemical <b>reactor</b> and of OTA by fluorescence detection. Mean limits of quantification (LOQ) of chocolate and cocoa powders were 0. 16 ng/g (OTA) and 0. 07 ng/g (aflatoxin B 1), respectively.

BiochemistryBibliography: leaves 116 - 132 Starch {{from four}} cultivars (Carneval, Carrera, Grande and Keoma) of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) was {{isolated}} and its composition, structure, and physicochemical properties were investigated. The results obtained {{were compared with}} those of other legume starches reported in the literature. The yield of starch was in the range 32. 7 - 33. 5 % on a whole seed basis. The starch granules were round to elliptical with smooth surfaces. The free lipid was 0. 05 % in all starches. However, bound and total lipids ranged from 0. 24 - 0. 29 % and from 0. 28 - 0. 34 %, respectively. The total amylose content ranged from 48. 8 - 49. 6 %, of which 10. 9 - 12. 3 % was complexed by native lipid. The degree of polymerization (DP) of isolated field pea amyloses ranged from 1300 - 1350. The chain length distributions of debranched amylopectins of the four starches were analyzed using high performance anion exchange chromatography equipped with a <b>post-column</b> amyloglucosidase <b>reactor</b> and a pulsed amperometric detector (HPAEC-ENZ-PAD). The proportion of short branch chains of chain length DP 6 - 12 ranged from 16. 2 - 18. 6 %. Keoma displayed a larger portion (19. 4 %) of long branch chains (DP> 37) than the other three starches (16. 2 - 16. 9 %). The average amylopectin branch chain lengths ranged from 22. 9 - 24. 2. The maximum detectable DP was higher in Keoma (71) than in the other three starches (64 - 65). The X-ray pattern was of (C type. The relative crystallinity was in the range 20. 8 - 25. 1 %. The proportion of 'B' polymorphic form was higher in Keoma (25. 6 %) than in the other three starches (22. 1 to 24. 1 %). There {{were no significant differences in}} swelling factor. The extent of amylose leaching at 95 °C ranged from 25. 20 - 26. 85. All four starches exhibited nearly identical gelatinization transition temperatures. However, the gelatinization temperature range (TC-TO) followed the order: Grande ~ Keoma > Carneval ~ Carrera. The four starches showed identical pasting temperatures and exhibited only marginal differences with respect to 95 °C viscosity and to the increase in consistency during the holding period at 95 °C. However, the set-back viscosity for Carneval was lower than that of the other starches. There were no significant differences in the extent of acid hydrolysis. However, susceptibility towards α-amylase followed the order: Carneva I- Carrera ~ Grande > Keoma. The magnitude of changes in transition temperatures and enthalpy, and the broadening of the endotherm during retrogradation (24 h) at different storage temperatures (4 and 40 °C), followed the order: 4 °C/ 24 h > 4 °C/ 24 h + 40 °C/ 24 h > 40 °C/ 24 h.

40|$|The {{work in this}} {{dissertation}} investigates antibodies {{labeled with}} acridinium ester for use in post-column detection for high-performance immunoaffinity chromatography (HPIAC). The areas that were studied included the optimization of reaction conditions for labeled antibodies {{and the use of}} various surfactants to increase the luminescence signal for labeled antibodies and free phenyl acridinium ester. Also, chromatographic equations that predict the behavior of simultaneous addition chromatographic immunoassays were developed and were examined. ^ Chapter one explains various background information related to the topics studied, such as antibody function and structure, acridinium esters, chemiluminescence, and affinity chromatography. Chapter two deals with improving chemiluminescence detection by optimizing the reaction conditions for acridinium ester labeled antibodies. In this study, various factors that influence light production were examined, such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, and surfactant concentrations. The luminescence was measured by using either a benchtop luminometer or a <b>post-column</b> <b>reactor,</b> and the results were compared between these two methods of detection. ^ Chapter three explores the use of various surfactants for increasing the luminescence intensity of labeled antibodies and phenyl acridinium ester samples at pH 2. 5 and 7. 4. In this study seven surfactants were investigated, including cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and nonionic compounds that are commonly used in the laboratory and are readily available. All luminescence measurements were done using a benchtop luminometer using hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide as the initiating reagents. It was determined that five of the surfactants increased the luminescence intensity, while two compounds decreased the signal for both samples. ^ Chapter four explains a theoretical model for determining the behavior of Simultaneous addition chromatographic immunoassays. In this study, equations were developed that predict calibration curves for competitive binding chromatographic immunoassays when certain factors are varied, such as the flow rate, amount of label, and number of binding sites in the column. In addition, various aspects of each assay were compared, including the limit of detection and dynamic range. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} detector provides a promising detection mode for capillary electrophoresis (CE) {{due to its}} excellent sensitivity, good portability, high selectivity, easy miniaturization, low capital and running cost. To widen its scope for determining trace analytes in complex samples, three dual-electrode detectors were fabricated to enable the determination of electro-inactive analytes, to assess co-eluted peaks and to give a large enhancement of the detection sensitivity by modifying electrode surface using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). To determine trace non-electroactive amino acids present in human tears, a serial dual-electrode detector was developed using an upstream on-capillary Pt film electrode to oxidize bromide to bromine at + 1. 0 V and a downstream Pt disk electrode to detect the residual bromine at + 0. 2 V after their reaction with amino acids eluted out from the separation capillary. The bromide reagent was introduced after CE separation by a newly designed coaxial <b>post-column</b> <b>reactor</b> fabricated onto the PMMA chip. Using optimized CE buffer containing 20 mM borate, 20 mM SDS at pH 9. 8, L-glutamine, L-alanine and taurine were baseline separated with detection limits ranging from 0. 56 - 0. 65 μM and a working range of 2 - 200 μM for L-glutamine and of 2 - 300 μM for both L-alanine and taurine. Method reliability was established by close to 100 % recoveries for spiked amino acids and good agreement between the measured and the literature reported amino acid concentrations in tears. For the determination of polyphenols in wine, a microchip-CE device was fabricated with a dual-opposite carbon fiber microelectrode operated in a parallel mode to assess peak purity. Under optimized conditions, (+) -catechin, trans-resveratrol, quercetin, (-) -epicatechin and gallic acid were baseline separated within 16 min with detection limits ranging from 0. 031 - 0. 21 mg/L and repeatability of 2. 0 - 3. 3 % (n= 5). The use of an opposite dual-electrode enables the simultaneous determination of peaks and measurement of their current ratios at + 0. 8 V and + 1. 0 V vs Ag/AgCl. The capability of using current ratio to identify the presence of co-migrating impurities was demonstrated in a mixed standard solution with overlapping (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin peaks and in a commercial red wine with interfering impurities. Matching of both the migration time and the current ratio reduce false positive and validate polyphenol quantitation in red wine. Lastly, a dual-opposite MWNTs modified carbon fiber microelectrode (CFME) was developed to determine the biomarkers (4 -nitrophenol, 4 -nitrophenyl-glucuronide and 4 -nitrophenyl-sulfate) needed to assess exposure to methyl parathion. Use of the MWNTs modified CFME showed a much higher sensitivity than bare CFME, with a detection limit of 0. 46 μM for 4 -nitrophenol. Baseline separation of all three biomarkers was obtained within 31 min by a 45 cm long capillary under 12 kV in a 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0. The method developed was successfully utilized to determine low levels of biomarkers in human urine without using complex pretreatment steps and delivered recoveries ranging from 95. 3 - 97. 3 % and RSDs within 5. 8 % (n= 3). Using a parallel dual-electrode detector was shown to deliver reliable results with matching current ratios and comparable migration time to those obtained from biomarker standards. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
