40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{possible}} relationships between participation in extracurricular activities and student achievement, participation in extracurricular activities and attendance, and participation in extracurricular activities and behavior. The setting for this study was a high school in western Nebraska. Data for 275 of the school district 2 ̆ 7 s 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009 high school graduates were obtained from the high school activities office and the school district 2 ̆ 7 s student management system. Ten research hypotheses were tested using appropriate statistical analyses. ^ Relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) Students who <b>participated</b> in extracurricular activities had higher grade point averages than students who did not <b>participate.</b> (2) Students who <b>participated</b> in extracurricular activities had a higher rate of school attendance than students who did not <b>participate.</b> (3) Students who <b>participated</b> in only sport activities received more disciplinary referrals than students who <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities. (4) Students whose families have a higher level of socio-economic status were more likely to <b>participate</b> in extracurricular activities. (5) White students were more likely to <b>participate</b> in extracurricular activities than Hispanic and other racial ethnic backgrounds. ^ No relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) Between grade point averages of students who <b>participated</b> in only sports activities and grade point averages of students who <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities. (2) Between attendance of students who <b>participated</b> in only sports activities and attendance of students who <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities. (3) Between participation in extracurricular activities and disciplinary referrals. (4) Between grade point averages of students who <b>participated</b> in only sports activities, grade point averages of students who <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities, and grade point averages of students who <b>participated</b> in both sport and non-sport activities.
