5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} interior, was against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that the new regime was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
5|$|Studying {{the outcome}} of the events in Rolling Thunder, the Air Force and Navy came to very {{different}} conclusions on how to adapt. The Air Force noted that most of their air-to-air losses were due to unseen attacks from the rear, and thus the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> addressed through additional technology that would provide early warning of such attacks. They began modifying their aircraft with built-in M61 Vulcans for close-in use, adopted the Sidewinder and began upgrading them to improve their performance, and introduced new ground and air-based radars to provide an overall watch over the battlefield. The Navy concluded that the primary problem was that their pilots had not been given proper air combat maneuvering training, and were forced to rely on missiles that were not performing as expected. In 1968 they introduced the TOPGUN program, a move that was welcomed by the F-8 pilots who had been campaigning for this all along.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, {{astronomer}} A. J. R.

Prentice also suggested that the young Sun transferred some angular momentum to the protoplanetary disc and planetesimals through supersonic ejections understood to occur in T Tauri stars. However, his contention that such formation would occur in toruses or rings has been questioned, as any such rings would disperse before collapsing into planets.|$|E

After Baldwin I extended his rule over Oultrejordain, Jerusalem gained revenue from the taxation of Muslim caravans passing from Syria to Egypt or Arabia. The money economy of Jerusalem meant that their manpower <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> partially solved by paying for mercenaries, an uncommon occurrence in medieval Europe. Mercenaries could be fellow European crusaders, or, perhaps more often, Muslim soldiers, including the famous Turcopoles.|$|E

25|$|Cuvier {{believed}} {{that the power of}} his principle came in part from its ability to aid in the reconstruction of fossils. In most cases, fossils of quadrupeds were not found as complete, assembled skeletons, but rather as scattered pieces that needed to be put together by anatomists. To make matters worse, deposits often contained the fossilized remains of several species of animals mixed together. Anatomists reassembling these skeletons ran the risk of combining remains of different species, producing imaginary composite species. However, by examining the functional purpose of each bone and applying the principle of correlation of parts, Cuvier {{believed that}} this <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> avoided.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that claims of Medigap’s tendency to cause over-treatment may be exaggerated and that potential savings from restricting it might be smaller than expected. Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the potential effects on enrollees. Individuals who face high charges with every episode of care have been shown to delay or forgo needed care, jeopardizing their health and possibly increasing their health care costs down the line. Given their lack of medical training, most patients tend to have difficulty distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary treatments. The <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> exaggerated among the Medicare population, which has low levels of health literacy.|$|E
25|$|When racing resumed, Bird kept {{first place}} and {{was in front of}} both Mahindra cars. Di Grassi was seven seconds in arrears of Gasly, {{although}} the latter had fallen off the pace of the leading battle, and the two were separated by the yet-to-stop Frijns. Bird used the restart to increase his lead to three seconds over both Mahindra drivers without using too much electrical energy. D'Ambrosio spun at the chicane, and although his car's rear-end was damaged, his rear wing remained in tact. Félix da Costa steered to the inside of Duval, but spun at the first turn, falling behind Duval's teammate d'Ambrosio. Prost caught di Grassi and placed extensive pressure onto the latter for fifth position. Rosenqvist's team noticed his car had an energy readout issue, and they prompted teammate Heidfeld to overtake him for second position on lap 36 to see whether he could draw closer to Bird and pass him. Rosenqvist fell behind quickly so that his <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> solved in a calmer environment. The manoeuvre allowed Bird to further extend his advantage by one second. Piquet was handed a drive-through penalty because he had not served an earlier ten-second penalty—which was issued to him after changing his engine—at his car swap. D'Ambrosio drove to the inside of teammate Duval entering the sixth turn, and passed him, enabling Félix da Costa to draw closer to both Dragon cars. One lap later, Félix da Costa braked later than Duval, but made contact with Duval at the first corner hairpin. Félix da Costa was issued with a drive-through penalty as a result.|$|E

500|$|Van Roomen's friend François Viète, who {{had urged}} van Roomen {{to work on}} Apollonius' problem in the first place, {{developed}} a method that used only compass and straightedge. Prior to Viète's solution, Regiomontanus doubted whether Apollonius' <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> solved by straightedge and compass. Viète first solved some simple special cases of Apollonius' problem, such as finding a circle that passes through three given points which has only one solution if the points are distinct; he then built up to solving more complicated special cases, in some cases by shrinking or swelling the given circles. According to the 4th-century report of Pappus of Alexandria, Apollonius' own book on this problem—entitled [...] ( [...] , [...] "Tangencies"; Latin: De tactionibus, De contactibus)—followed a similar progressive approach. Hence, Viète's solution {{is considered to be}} a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' solution, although other reconstructions have been published independently by three different authors.|$|E
500|$|Propeller {{shaft seals}} were a {{significant}} problem on Collins and Farncomb. Although designed {{to allow for a}} leak of [...] per hour, during trials {{it was found that the}} seals would regularly misalign and allow hundreds of litres per hour into the boat—during one deep diving test the flow rate was measured at approximately [...] a minute. ASC claimed that solving these problems could be done by manually adjusting the seals as the submarine dived and rose, but this would have required a sailor dedicated solely to that task, affecting efforts to minimise the required number of personnel. It was found that the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> temporarily alleviated by running the propeller in reverse for 100revolutions, pulling the seal back into alignment, although a permanent solution could initially not be found, as ASC refused to accept responsibility for the problem, and the original manufacturer of the seals had closed down. New suppliers were found, with modified seals fitted to the first two submarines in late 1996, before completely re-designed seals were fitted to the boats in late 1997, solving the problem.|$|E
