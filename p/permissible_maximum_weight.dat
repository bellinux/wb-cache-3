5000|$|In {{accordance}} with {{an amendment to}} the Public Roads Act, approved by the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia at the end of April 2008, use of toll stickers (vinjete) is obligatory for all vehicles with a <b>permissible</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> of 3,500 kg (the current first and second toll-rate category) on motorways and expressways in Slovenia as of 1 July 2008.

50|$|For {{the use of}} 464,7 km of the Slovenian freeways and expressways use of toll {{stickers}} is obligatory for all {{vehicles with}} the <b>permissible</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> of 3.5 tons on motorways and expressways as of July 1, 2008. The sticker costs are €15 for 7 days, €30 {{for a month and}} €95 for a year. Motorcyclists have to pay €7.50 for 7 days, €25 for a half year and €47.50 for a year.

Use of highways and expressways without a valid and properly displayed sticker in a vehicle is a violation of the law and is punished with a fine of €300 or more.|$|E

The amount of toll charges depends on the category of the vehicle {{and the type of}} thee-vignette.

Each driver has to stop at one of the distribution points located on each border crossing used by heavy traffic and register the vehicle. The driver obtains an electronic on-board unit.|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{reliability}} analysis of an aeronautical armor is proposed, using stochastic optimization techniques. The {{reliability of the}} armor can be assessed by evaluating several types of failures when the armor is hit by a projectile. The possible armor failures include projectile penetration, excessive displacement, excessive deformation, non-absorption of the projectile energy by the structure, etc. Also, the armor should be designed {{in order to avoid}} any conflict with aircraft design restrictions, such as the <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>weight</b> and the aircraft centroid position. Stochastic optimization refers to the minimization or maximization of an objective function in the presence of randomness. Uncertainties can occur in the projectile parameters, such as its mass, velocity, angle of incidence, and also in the armor parameters, such as its material and geometric parameters. Also, there is some uncertainty in the armor boundary conditions, depending on the way the armor is installed in the aircraft structure. The optimization procedure includes several constraint equations, such as, kinetic energy and <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> deformation, <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> and <b>permissible</b> displacement for the aircraft centroid. Some of these constraint equations are obtained through regression of data obtained from numerical simulation. ANSYS/LS-DYNA ® is used for the numerical simulation. This simulation is carried out using a specially designed, existing code for non-linear transient dynamic events, such as ballistic impacts. To simplify the aircraft armor analysis, the protected area is divided into a mesh, consisting of a set of rectangular plates, and only the impact in one plate is considered. In this work, the armor is made of two thin layers. The first layer is made of a ceramic material while the second layer i...|$|R
500|$|The R {{class was}} {{a class of}} sixteen War Emergency Programme destroyers ordered for the Royal Navy in 1940 as the 3rd and 4th Emergency Flotilla. The Q and R class {{repeated}} the preceding O and P class, reverting to the larger J, K and N-class hull to allow for increased top <b>weight</b> (<b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>weight).</b> Since they had fewer main guns than the J, K and Ns, magazine space was replaced by fuel bunkers allowing for [...] at [...] (compared with the [...] of their ancestors). Like the O and P classes, they were armed with available weapons: 4.7-inch (120mm) guns on single mountings allowing only 40° of elevation. As a result, on paper they do not compare favourably with many of their contemporaries. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer. The R class repeated the Qs, except that the officers' accommodation was moved from the traditional right aft to a more accessible location amidships.|$|R
40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that manual materials handling tasks exist in all industries. The exertions {{associated with these}} tasks are often related to increased frequency and disability, particularly involving lower back tissues (44).

50|$|The {{aircraft}}'s Certificate of Airworthiness {{had last}} been renewed in November 1928 and was valid for a year. Its <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>weight</b> was 2946 lb, the aircraft weight was 2494 lb on departure from Croydon. Evidence {{was given by}} {{three of the four}} surviving passengers and both crew. The fourth surviving passenger was not called as she was legally a minor at the time and had lost her father in the accident. The inquiry closed on 3 July. Imperial Airways and Napier, the engine manufacturer, were cleared of any blame for the accident. The report into the investigation was published on 12 July. Amongst the recommendations were that passengers should be provided with seatbelts and that aircraft not capable of maintaining level flight with an inoperative engine and not designed to land on water should be withdrawn from continental routes after 1 July 1930.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{clearway}} {{is a term}} {{related to}} the dimension of some runways and it is abbreviated with CWY. Clearway is an area beyond the paved runway, free of obstructions and {{under the control of}} the airport authorities. The length of the clearway may be included in the length of the takeoff distance available. For example, if a paved runway is 2000 m long and there are 400 m of clearway beyond the end of the runway, the takeoff distance available is 2400 m long. When the runway is to be used for takeoff of a large airplane, the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> takeoff <b>weight</b> of the airplane can be based on the takeoff distance available, including clearway. Clearway allows large airplanes to take off at a heavier weight than would be allowed if only the length of the paved runway is taken into account.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be associated with}} increased serum uric acid (SUA); however, little is known regarding the relationship between <b>maximum</b> <b>weight,</b> or <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> fluctuation, and uric acid concentration. Through retrospective means, we determined the association of <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> with SUA risk. METHODS: Data of 21, 414 participants (8, 630 males and 12, 784 females) from the 2007 - 8 China National Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders Study were analyzed for parameters including lifestyle habits, biochemical blood analysis and self-reported <b>maximum</b> <b>weight.</b> RESULTS: Elevated SUA subjects shared a cluster of demographic features.
