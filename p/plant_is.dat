5|$|The Bintulu {{combined}} cycle power plant {{was started in}} early 2010 with a capacity of 317 megawatts. The power <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> registered under the United Nations Clean Development Management (CDM) scheme as of 18 September 2010. The <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> built to ensure efficient use of energy and reduce green house gas emissions. It is the first CDM power plant in Malaysia, currently operated by Sarawak Power Generation Sdn Bhd (SPG), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sarawak Energy.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, Japan's oldest {{hydroelectric}} power <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> {{located in the}} Shinano River system. The Miyashiro Power Plant No. 1 was opened by the Azumi Electric Power Company in 1904 and has, since then, been in continual operation, currently operated by Chubu Electric Power Company.|$|E
50|$|This <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> first {{collected}} in the 19th century and was not seen again until 1993, when a single <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> found. Three more were found later that year. Four additional <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> found in 1999 and five immature <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> located in 2001. There may be up to fifty plants remaining in unsurveyed areas.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six <b>planting</b> dates <b>were</b> used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) <b>were</b> reported when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed. Minimum <b>Plant</b> height (85 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> observed when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 15 th of December. A negative correlation <b>was</b> recorded between <b>planting</b> dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late <b>planting</b> recorded <b>were</b> 8 % when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 15 th, 22 % loss when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 25 th November, 34 % losses <b>were</b> incurred when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December 5 th and 42 % losses <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> further delayed till December 15 th. Hence it is concluded that {{first two weeks of}} November is the best time for obtaining higher yields from the recommended cultivars...|$|R

40|$|Kavirajes or {{traditional}} medicinal practitioners form the primary healthcare providers of the predominantly rural population of Bangladesh. Kavirajes {{use a variety}} of medicinal plants for treatment of different ailments. The formulations prepared from medicinal plants vary considerably between Kavirajes of different regions of the country. The objective {{of this study was to}} conduct an ethnomedicinal survey amongst the Kavirajes of Chalna area, Khulna district, Bangladesh. That area is known to contain a diversity of medicinal plants. Information on 50 <b>plant</b> species <b>was</b> obtained. These medicinal plants belonged to 49 genera and 33 families. Twenty five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat skin diseases and twenty three plants for treatment of intestinal tract disorders, which included constipation, indigestion, stomachache, diarrhea, and dysentery. Fourteen <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> also used by the Kavirajes to treat cancer or tumor. Nine <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used as insecticide, eight for rheumatoid arthritis, and seven for wounds. Five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat jaundice. Five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> also utilized to treat animal and snake bites, which included tiger bites. Six <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat diabetes, and two each for the treatment of leprosy, and sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea. Five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat impotency, while one <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> used as an abortifacient.
