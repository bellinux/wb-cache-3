5|$|The <b>printing</b> <b>equipment</b> {{was also}} {{delivered}} in December, and 12,000 sheets of banknote paper a month began to arrive from Hahnemühle; it was {{large enough for}} four notes to be printed on each sheet.

5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D <b>printing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E
5|$|Between late February {{and early}} March 1945, with {{the advance of}} the Allied armies, all {{production}} of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them. That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the <b>printing</b> <b>equipment</b> and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.|$|E

5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior digitisation, the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on <b>printing</b> <b>equipment</b> with greater ink spread. Cross-licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation, using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a more delicate and elegant design.|$|E
5|$|Snedden also {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} upgrades to the News-Miner's <b>printing</b> <b>equipment.</b> In 1953, rotary printing was introduced to Fairbanks after Snedden purchased a used rotary press from The Sacramento Union. To house the press, Snedden built a two-story building adjacent to the Lathrop Building. The Lathrop Building still contained most of the News-Miner's offices and typesetting equipment, but it was not large enough to contain the new press without extensive renovations, thus requiring a new building. Shortly after the new press was introduced, the News-Miner produced its first full-color newspaper. The new equipment also allowed for larger print jobs, and Snedden introduced an annual Progress Edition that was intended to be distributed outside Alaska in order to attract business and industry to the state. In 1954, the News-Miner obtained a dedicated teletype to the Associated Press, avoiding the need for contracts for telephone and telegraph service to a correspondent in Seattle who would relay AP material to the News-Miner.|$|E

25|$|An {{edition of}} the Confucian Analects was printed in 1598 using metal {{moveable}} type <b>printing</b> <b>equipment</b> at the order of Emperor Go-Yōzei. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the running script style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the factors}} {{that led to the}} {{emergence}} of omoshirogara/propaganda kimonos, three stand out: the introduction of modern textile manufacturing and <b>printing</b> <b>equipment</b> into Japan in the late 19th century allowed textile manufacturers to produce printable apparel fabric more quickly and cheaply; the social and political impetus for Japan to modernize; and, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the political leadership's desire to rally the population in support of Japan's colonial expansion and, eventually, its war against the Allies.|$|E

25|$|In Japan {{the use of}} {{printing}} beyond its Buddhist origins was insignificant for centuries after its introduction. Printing of secular materials did not pick up until the late 16th century. The Setsuyō-shū, a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary printed in 1591, was the first secular book to be printed in Japan. Only after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea, which brought back artisans and <b>printing</b> <b>equipment</b> in 1593, did Japan acquire its own wooden type font. Under Emperor Go-Yōzei's orders, the Confucian Analects were printed using metal movable type in 1598. It is {{generally considered to be}} the earliest extant Japanese text printed using metal movable type. The popularity of movable type in Japan was short lived. By the 1640s woodblock printing had reasserted itself as the dominant mode {{of printing}} in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{with limited}} budgets {{were allowed to}} pay in four instalments, but when a reader of the weekly newspaper, writing {{in the name of}} low-paid workers with large families, {{suggested}} the creation of savings clubs, Griffith encouraged the idea enthusiastically. The public response was more enthusiastic this time and by 7 May 1909, the Board had already received 3,386 applications. Ó Ceallaigh's minutes for this period reflect an atmosphere of general optimism: the SFPP was in contact with several suppliers of <b>printing</b> <b>equipment,</b> was recruiting personnel, and was actively looking for a new publishing office and a location for its printshop. Griffith was a prudent businessman, however, and the SFPP negotiated simultaneously with the Linotype Machine Co. for the purchase of a Cox Duplex printing press, and the manager of the Ireland's Own Publishing Co., Mr. Walsh, for the printing of the newspaper. If the printshop failed once again to materialise, the SFPP would still have the option of subcontracting to Walsh.|$|E

In 1584, he sent men to break into Wolfe's premises and destroy any materials relating to suspected piracy. Four years before, he had even destroyed his son Richard's <b>printing</b> <b>equipment</b> after Richard had printed the ABC and the Psalmes without his permission.

500|$|The {{problems}} of money-caused inflation were {{exacerbated by the}} influx of counterfeit bills from the North. These were plentiful because Southern [...] "Greybacks" [...] were fairly crude and easy to copy as the Confederacy lacked modern <b>printing</b> <b>equipment.</b> One {{of the largest and}} most famous of the Northern counterfeiters was Samuel C. Upham from Philadelphia. By one calculation Upham's notes made up between 1 and 2.5 percent of all of the Confederate money supply between June 1862 and August 1863. Jefferson Davis placed a $10,000 bounty on Upham, though the [...] "Yankee Scoundrel", as he was known in the South, evaded capture by Southern agents. Counterfeiting was a problem for the North as well, and the United States Secret Service was formed to deal with this problem.|$|E
500|$|Monotype's original, early {{digitisation}} of Bembo {{was widely}} seen as unsuccessful. Two main problems have been cited with it: it was much lighter in type colour than the original metal type, perhaps through failure to anticipate the reduced ink spread on modern <b>printing</b> <b>equipment.</b> In addition, the digital Bembo {{was based on the}} 9 pt metal drawings, creating a font with different proportions to the metal type in the point sizes at which Bembo was most often used in books. This made the proportions of the digital font appear wrong, failing to match the subtlety of the metal type and even phototype, which was released in three different optical sizes for different print sizes.
