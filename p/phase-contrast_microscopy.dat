25|$|More {{sophisticated}} techniques {{will show}} proportional differences in optical density. Phase contrast {{is a widely}} used technique that shows differences in refractive index as difference in contrast. It {{was developed by the}} Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in the 1930s (for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953). The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm. Contrast is excellent; however it is not for use with thick objects. Frequently, a halo is formed even around small objects, which obscures detail. The system consists of a circular annulus in the condenser, which produces a cone of light. This cone is superimposed on a similar sized ring within the phase-objective. Every objective has a different size ring, so for every objective another condenser setting has to be chosen. The ring in the objective has special optical properties: it, first of all, reduces the direct light in intensity, but more importantly, it creates an artificial phase difference of about a quarter wavelength. As the physical properties of this direct light have changed, interference with the diffracted light occurs, resulting in the phase contrast image. One disadvantage of <b>phase-contrast</b> <b>microscopy</b> is halo formation (halo-light ring).|$|E

[...] At a larger scale, cellular interferometry shares aspects with <b>phase-contrast</b> <b>microscopy,</b> but comprises a much larger class of phase-sensitive optical configurations that rely on optical interference among cellular constituents through refraction and diffraction. [...] At the tissue scale, partially-coherent forward-scattered light propagation through the micro aberrations and heterogeneity of tissue structure provides opportunities to use phase-sensitive gating (optical coherence tomography) as well as phase-sensitive fluctuation spectroscopy to image subtle structural and dynamical properties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We present {{detailed}} {{measurements of}} the particle response function of Dynamic <b>Phase-Contrast</b> (DynPC) <b>Microscopy</b> and its application for microfluidic velocity field meas-urements. Microfluidics {{is one of the}} most up-to-date fields of physical research due to the po-tentials for highly sensitive and efficient medical and chemical analysis [1]. The combination of microfluidic systems with optical functions leads to the highly attractive field of optofluidics [2]. Optical techniques are especially the choice for the measurement of full three-dimensional velocity fields in microfluidic flows. By seeding the flow with micro- or nano parti-cles, micro Particle-Image-Velocimetry (µPIV) can detect the velocity field [3]. Optical sec-tioning via the depth of field of a microscope objective or stereoscopy are the most used techniques for three-dimensional measurements of micro-flow fields [4]. However, commonly used µPIV algorithms are strongly dependent on sufficient signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and intensity stability [5]. A method to improve the SNR and to minimize the error rate of µPIV algorithms is Dynamic <b>Phase-Contrast</b> (DynPC) <b>Microscopy</b> based on a photorefractive nov-elty filter [6, 7]. It suppresses static background and thus highlights dynamics in microfluidic systems [8]. For optical sectioning, it is necessary to know the three-dimensional response of DynPC on a micro particle. Observing transparent particles, the response function of conven-tional bright field microscopy is asymmetric (figure 1), because light is scattered and focused by the particle. In contrast to conventional microscopy, DynPC shows a symmetric response and higher signal-to noise ratio (figure 2) ...|$|R

40|$|Image {{formation}} in <b>phase-contrast</b> electron <b>microscopy</b> {{is governed by}} the contrast transfer function (CTF). The key parameter to tune the CTF is the defocus. A precise and unbiased estimate of the defocus is essential to determine the forward model and interpret high resolution images in cryo-TEM. We present an algorithm based on the weak-phase approximation for determination of the defocus and astigmatism of the objective lens from recorded images of an amorphous sample. The algorithm identifies Thon rings in the power spectrum density (PSD) and uses them to estimate astigmatism and defocus together with their uncertainties. For the astigmatism estimation we use a transformation to polar coordinates to fit ellipses to the Thon rings. Averaging the PSD over these ellipses reduces CTF estimation to a 1 D problem and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio. Index Terms — cryo-TEM, phase contrast, CTF estimation, astigmatis...|$|R
