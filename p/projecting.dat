5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. <b>Projecting</b> from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns.

40|$|Businesses and organisations are {{undertaking}} innovative <b>projects</b> to gain {{competitive advantage}} in the market. Research into innovative <b>project</b> management has been biased towards how innovative <b>projects</b> are managed {{to the detriment of}} the formulation of success criteria for innovative <b>projects.</b> There is a need to evaluate how innovative <b>projects</b> are managed. <b>Project</b> managers for innovative <b>projects</b> find it difficult to do so because success criteria for innovative <b>projects</b> have not been formulated. This paper is a theoretical study on managing different types of <b>projects</b> as different types of <b>projects</b> are managed in different ways. The paper also explores the characteristics of conventional <b>projects</b> as opposed to inno-vative <b>projects</b> and R&D <b>projects.</b> In addition, it critically analyses the differences between <b>project</b> man-agement in conventional <b>projects</b> and <b>project</b> management in innovative <b>projects.</b> By comparing the char-acteristics of conventional <b>projects</b> to those of innovative <b>projects</b> and R&D <b>projects,</b> and the way these different types of <b>projects</b> are managed, the paper attempts to formulate success criteria for innovative <b>projects</b> that can be used by <b>project</b> managers to determine the success or failure of innovative <b>projects...</b>|$|R
30|$|Whether a <b>project</b> is {{successful}} or not {{depends on the}} opinion of the responsible managers. Some of them may focus more on whether the <b>project</b> is on time or before. Some others may pay more attentions to the <b>project</b> budget. For some <b>projects,</b> e.g., China’s manned space program, the highest priority is technical performance. Generally, the success of a <b>project</b> is measured by three dimensions, i.e., time, cost, and performance (quality or agreed-upon specifications). For many <b>projects,</b> since <b>project</b> managers only need to meet some quality standards, the dimension of quality is not so important for <b>project</b> success. In this case, <b>project</b> managers are required to make trade-off between <b>project</b> cost and <b>project</b> completion time with the <b>project</b> progress. Furthermore, <b>project</b> cost and <b>project</b> completion time are always in some relation. Sometimes, <b>project</b> managers may make decisions to finish <b>projects</b> sooner with <b>project</b> cost augment by accelerating <b>project</b> schedule, which is also named as <b>project</b> crashing in <b>project</b> management. In other cases, motivated by reducing <b>project</b> costs, managers may be conscripted to sacrifice with prolonging <b>project</b> completion times. To sum up, it is natural for <b>project</b> managers to find some schedules to complete <b>projects</b> with the balance of <b>project</b> costs and <b>project</b> completion times.|$|R
50|$|For {{any given}} <b>project,</b> several <b>project</b> tasks should be defined. <b>Project</b> tasks {{describe}} {{the activities and}} phases {{that have to be}} performed in the <b>project</b> such as writing of layouts, customising, testing. What is needed is a system that allows <b>project</b> positions to be correlated with <b>project</b> tasks. <b>Project</b> positions describe <b>project</b> roles like <b>project</b> manager, consultant, tester, etc. Project-positions are typically arranged linearly within the <b>project.</b> By correlating <b>project</b> tasks with <b>project</b> positions, the qualifications and availability of personnel assigned to the <b>project</b> positions may be considered.|$|R

5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} style, the so-called Swiss chalet style. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as <b>projecting</b> roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, <b>projecting</b> details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E
5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and <b>projecting</b> out from the gate to allow {{defenders}} to shoot into the area in front of the entrance.

5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a <b>projecting</b> molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the <b>projecting</b> bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house.

5|$|More {{numerous}} than new-build forts {{were old}} forts upgraded to higher defensive specifications. Thus the two parallel ditches common around earlier forts could {{be joined by}} excavating the ground between them. <b>Projecting</b> towers were added. Gates were either rebuilt with <b>projecting</b> towers or sealed off by constructing a large rectangular bastion. The walls were strengthened by doubling the old thickness. Upgraded forts were generally much larger than new-build. New forts were rarely over one hectare in size and were normally placed to fill gaps between old forts and towns. However, {{not all of the}} old forts that continued {{to be used in the}} 4th century were upgraded e.g. the forts on Hadrian's Wall and some other forts in Britannia were not significantly modified.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Many product {{innovation}} <b>projects</b> do not adequately develop an effective <b>project</b> strategy. This leads to poor choices of <b>project</b> approaches often resulting in poor <b>project</b> outcomes. Unfortunately, business and strategic level thinking is rarely examined {{in detail in}} the <b>project</b> management literature. This paper contributes {{to the advancement of}} business and strategic thinking in {{product innovation}} <b>project</b> management by developing a conceptual model of (i) how <b>project</b> innovation type, <b>project</b> uncertainty and firm-project compatibility influence the required <b>project</b> capabilities, and (ii) how <b>project</b> strategy aligns <b>project</b> capabilities with these <b>project</b> contingencies to drive <b>project</b> success. It is argued that such a theoretically well founded and practical strategic <b>project</b> management approach will guide practitioners in making appropriate <b>project</b> strategy choices.

5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} {{the skull}} bones, in the form of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of the skull roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony projections from the skull. Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, <b>projecting</b> outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, <b>projecting</b> upwards from the skull. These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level of the skull roof. Maybe this rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E

40|$|Efficient <b>project</b> {{execution}} {{is a key}} business {{objective in}} many domains and particularly so for capital <b>projects</b> in the process industries, but existing <b>project</b> management research gives little direction about how <b>project</b> team factors influence three important capital <b>project</b> outcomes: cost, schedule, and operability. After an extensive cross-disciplinary review of the general team and <b>project</b> management literatures, we constructed and tested a theoretically based, five-dimensional model of organizational context, <b>project</b> team design, <b>project</b> team leadership, <b>project</b> team processes, and <b>project</b> outcome factors. We examined the model {{by means of an}} empirical study of 56 newly completed capital <b>projects</b> executed by 15 Fortune 500 companies in the process industries. The results indicate the value of disaggregating <b>project</b> outcomes for research purposes. Different bundles of <b>project</b> team factors were found to drive <b>project</b> cost, schedule, and operability. <b>Project</b> team efficacy, cross-functional <b>project</b> teams, autonomous <b>project</b> team structure, and virtual office usage were the strongest predictors of <b>project</b> cost effectiveness. Continuity of <b>project</b> leadership, cross-functional <b>project</b> teams, and <b>project</b> manager incentives were the strongest predictors of <b>project</b> construction schedule. In contrast, clear <b>project</b> goals and an office design to facilitate effective communication were the main predictors of plant operability. Implications of these findings for researchers and <b>project</b> practitioners are discussed. One major practical implication of our findings is that <b>project</b> managers need to clearly focus and prioritize their goals for each <b>project</b> so they can adopt the appropriate bundles of <b>project</b> team practices that will facilitate their goal achievement.
