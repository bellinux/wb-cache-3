5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} these four territories to be {{incorporated}} into Imerina was Fanongoavana, then a principality ruled by Andriampanarivofomanjaka. Continual threats to his kingdom's security led Andriampanarivofomanjaka to secretly travel to the Rova of Antananarivo to pledge submission to Andriamasinavalona. He was accompanied by seven advisers who eloquently communicated their master's willingness to acknowledge Andriamasinavalona as his king. Andriamasinavalona accepted this offer and sealed the union of their territories by marrying Andriampanarivofomanjaka to his sister, Ranavalontsimitovy. Andriampanarivofomanjaka then returned to his realm, announced the union to his <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> spoke {{with the leaders of}} the neighboring Bezanozano people to successfully persuade them to join the kingdom and benefit from Andriamasinavalona's protection.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E

Nomadic pastoralism is practiced in different climates and environments with daily movement and seasonal migration. Pastoralists {{are among the most}} flexible populations.

The products of the herd animals are the most important resources, although the use of other resources, including domesticated and wild plants, hunted animals, and goods accessible in a market economy are not excluded.

He took meticulous care in observing all the religious procedures attached to state affairs and all the civil procedures related to state administration to boost the morale of the city population, after having blamed the Trasimene disaster on the lack of proper religious observations by the dead consul Flaminius. The senate consulted the Sibylline Books at the suggestion of Fabius and a praetor was assigned to appease the Roman gods through generous sacrifices. Divine duties taken care of, Fabius next went about preparing for Hannibal's anticipated visit to Latium, being ignorant of his location and intention at that time.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E

Powderfinger had already written most of the album before departing to the United States. In particular, Powderfinger wrote songs in parts and brought them together; some songs were written in pairs or trios, while others were written in parts by different <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> combined. According to the band, this brought a [...] "diverse" [...] and [...] "fresh" [...] approach to songwriting.

500|$|The Proto-Germanic or Germanic {{cultures}} on Polish lands developed gradually and in {{a diverse}} way, beginning with the old local Lusatian and Pomeranian stock, influenced and augmented first by La Tène culture and the Celtic <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> by the Jastorf culture and its tribes, which settled northwestern Poland beginning in the 4th century BC, and later migrated in the southeastern direction through and past the main stretch of Polish lands (mid-3rd century BC and afterwards). The disappearing Celtic people made a big impact in central Europe and left a lasting legacy. Their advanced culture catalyzed economic and other progress within the contemporary as well as future populations, which had often {{had little or no}} ethnic Celtic component. The archeological period is considered [...] "La Tène" [...] until the beginning of the Common Era. The beginnings of the powerful ascent of the Germanic people, who replaced the Celts, are not easy to discern (e.g. to what degree the Pomeranian culture lands became the Przeworsk culture lands by internal evolution, external population influx or just permeation by the new regional cultural trends).|$|E

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy.

[...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
