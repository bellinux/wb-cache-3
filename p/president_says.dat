5|$|Suharto is soon {{called to}} the {{secondary}} palace in Bogor to speak with Sukarno. There, the <b>president</b> <b>says</b> that he has received assurances from Air Marshal Omar Dani that the Air Force was not involved. Suharto refutes the statement, noting that the movement's arms were {{like those of the}} Air Force. The meeting eventually results in Suharto being confirmed as leader of the Army, working together with Pranoto Reksosamodra. In their investigation of the events, the Army discovers the camp at Lubang Buaya– including the generals' bodies, which are recovered while Suharto delivers a speech describing the coup and the PKI's role in it. The generals are interred elsewhere and Suharto delivers a hagiographic eulogy in which he condemns the G30S and PKI and urges the Indonesian people to continue the fallen generals' struggle.|$|E

2500|$|Pointing {{out that}} [...] "The former {{president}} rarely speaks about his book at universities. He says he’s {{been invited to}} more than 100 campuses, but he's only visited five," [...] Claire Keller reported that, during his public appearance at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, on 18 April 2007, [...] Carter stated: [...] "I wrote this book to describe {{the plight of the}} Palestinians and because I'm convinced we desperately need debate about where we are and where we ought to be going, and how to rejuvenate the non-existent peace process in the Middle East" ... Carter says the book's objective is permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors; it’s something the former <b>president</b> <b>says</b> he’s dedicated his entire adult life to.|$|E
2500|$|Santorum {{states that}} he values faith over {{politics}} and considers the theological views of a politicians' faith as significant. [...] He questions whether President Obama truly has a religion, alleging {{that he may have}} chosen Christianity as a politically expedient platform for power. Santorum stated, [...] "if the <b>President</b> <b>says</b> he's a Christian, he's a Christian" [...] but has stated that Obama's agenda is based on a [...] "phony theology", not the Bible. In an interview with Glenn Beck, Santorum said Obama's desire for greater higher education rates nationwide was a veiled attempt at [...] "indoctrination", saying that [...] "62 percent of kids who go into college with a faith commitment leave without it." [...] Santorum declined to provide a source for that figure. He believes colleges reinforce secular relativism and antagonize religiosity, particularly of Christianity, and lists young people's support for abortion, gay marriage, and pornography as [...] "symptoms" [...] of indoctrination.|$|E

2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The <b>president</b> <b>says,</b> it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
2500|$|The Human Rights Watch (HRW) {{had called}} {{the first year of}} Duterte in office as a human rights calamity. The HRW {{estimates}} that there has been 7,000 extrajudicial killings from the day Duterte first took office to January 2017. The Duterte administration suspended the drugs war by February 2017 in an effort to cleanse the police ranks, also halting the disclosure of figures on deaths related to drug arrests and raids. In March 2017, the HRW released a special investigation and report on the state of police related shooting, titled [...] "License To Kill". The New York Times had also released a video documentary [...] "When A <b>President</b> <b>Says</b> I'll Kill You", which depicts Duterte's war on drugs through a local photographer's eyes. In August 17, 2017, HRW called Duterte a threat to the Human Rights community after Duterte made threats against Human Rights activists. As of August 2017, Human Rights groups and activists had claimed that more than 13,000 people had been killed in extra-judicial killings including those they believed the government had executed such as Kian de los Santos, contrary to government figures which estimated it to be only around 3,000.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{short of}} victory. There {{can be no}} arrangement, no agreement, no parley with or {{confidence}} in these modern scions of darkness--Hohenzollerns, Hindenburgs, Zudendorffs and their tools. Propaganda must not cease; the eyes of Germans still capable of sight must be opened. But, as the <b>President</b> <b>says,</b> force must be used to the limit--force for a social end as opposed to force for an evil end. There are those among us who advocate a boycott of Germany after peace is declared. These would seem to {{take it for granted}} that we shall fall short of victory, and hence that selfish retaliative or vindictive practices between nations, sanctioned by imperialism, will continue to flourish after the war. But should Germany win she will see to it that there is no boycott against her. A compromised peace would indeed mean the perpetuation of both imperialism and militarism.|$|E

60|$|There {{is another}} {{circumstance}} that must strike your Lordships relative to this institution. It {{is where the}} <b>President</b> <b>says</b> {{that the use of}} the President would be to exert his best abilities, his greatest application, his constant guard,--for what?--to prevent his dewan from being guilty of bribery and being guilty of oppressions. So here is an executive constitution in which the chief executive minister is to be in such a situation and of such a disposition that the chief employment of the presiding person in the Committee is to guard against him and to prevent his doing mischief. Here is a man appointed, of the greatest possible power, of the greatest possible wickedness, in a situation to exert that power and wickedness for the destruction of the country, and without doubt it would require the greatest ability and diligence in the person at the head of that Council to prevent it. Such a constitution, allowed and alleged by the persons themselves who composed it, was, I believe, never heard of in the world.|$|E
