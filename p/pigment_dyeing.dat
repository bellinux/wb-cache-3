40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{application}} of glow discharge (low pressure) and dielectric barrier discharge (atmospheric）prior to <b>pigment</b> <b>dyeing</b> of cotton fabric was studied. Different parameters of power and time during the process were also discussed. The dyeing effect after different plasma treatment was analyzed by SEM observations and measurements of the K/S value, levelness and color fastness. The {{results indicated that the}} particle diameter of pigment affected <b>pigment</b> <b>dyeing,</b> and the K/S value increased as particle diameter decreased. These two plasma treatments could enhance the properties of <b>pigment</b> <b>dyeing</b> with satisfied color fastnesses. Fabrics treated by plasma should be dyed within 2 hours of plasma treatment to ensure optimum results. The power of atmospheric plasma treatments was relatively high without maintaining a vacuum atmosphere, and it could be processed continuously with high efficiency and K/S value...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to investigate the effect of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on dark shade <b>pigment</b> <b>dyeing</b> of cotton fabric. Experimental results reveal that plasma-treated cotton fabric can attain better color yield, levelness, and crocking fastness in dark shade <b>pigment</b> <b>dyeing,</b> compared with normal cotton fabric (not plasma treated). SEM analysis indicates that cracks and grooves were formed on the cotton fiber surface where the pigment and the binder can get deposited and improve the color yield, levelness, and crocking fastness. It was also noticed that pigment was aggregated when deposited on the fiber surface which could affect the final color properties...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Well-controlled polystyrene-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate) -b-polystyrene (PSt-b-PnBA-b-PSt) triblock {{copolymers}} {{were prepared}} by RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer) emulsion polymerization process. The mechanical {{properties of the}} triblock copolymers were investigated {{in comparison to the}} P(nBA-co-St) statistical copolymers. When the PSt content is 20 %, the ultimate tensile strength of triblock copolymer is nearly six times the strength of statistical copolymer, while their modulus are all around 3. 0 × 103 Pa. The triblock copolymer films feel smooth and non-tacky as the PSt content is higher than 20 %. It indicates that PSt-b-PnBA-b-PSt triblock copolymers can be used as binders in <b>pigment</b> <b>dyeing,</b> providing the dyed fabrics with soft non-tacky handle and good fastness properties. ...|$|E
30|$|The soluble redwoods {{included}} two famous genera caesalpinia and haematoxylum in both which neoflavonoids {{as the main}} coloring principle [30, 33], however, there were no mass sources of the recognizable colorant haematoxylin or haematoxylein further to exclude the application of logwood in this red dyeing. Since protosappanin B and brazilin were colorless, the clarified coloring mechanism was speculated that brazilein was the responsible agent which formed a metal coordination complex with aluminum and produced the meta red color [37]. As a result, after verified by the high resolution MS/MS spectra of the extracts of reddish pigments and sappanwood as well as reference standards including protosappanin B, brazilin and brazilein, the use of natural dyestuff plant sappanwood in <b>pigment</b> <b>dyeing</b> was confirmed.|$|E

Colour strength, colourfastness and serviceability of fabrics dyed with the methods of foam-padding and liquid-padding were evaluated and compared. Results show that surface dyeing for cotton-knitted fabric with foam media could overcome the shortcoming of poor penetration in foam dyeing method, and turn the poor penetration into the superiority for obtaining the surface-dyed result. The serviceability such as water absorption and handle property was also well improved in foam dyeing method. Finally, the advantages of energy saving and reducing chemical usage were implemented throughout the dyeing process. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

5000|$|If a {{dielectric}} material {{does not include}} light-absorbent additive molecules (<b>pigments,</b> <b>dyes,</b> colorants), it is usually transparent to the spectrum of visible light.
