40|$|Aims: This {{study was}} done to {{clinically}} verify the symptomatology of Formic acid by ascertaining the symptoms improved during verification and to incorporate new findings (if any) to the known symptomatology of Formic acid. Methods: A multicentric observational clinical verification study was conducted at nine research centers of Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy to verify the proving symptoms of rarely used medicine, Formic acid. Two hundred and seventy participants having symptomatological similarity with Formic acid were included and prescribed in 6 C, 30 C, 200 C, and 1 M potencies, as per need of each case. The data were compiled in a specially designed Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. The collected data were presented in terms of descriptive statistics. Prevalence of the symptoms in the responding and nonresponding population was compared using Chi-square or Fisher′s exact test. Results: Out of 266 followed up patients, 215 cases responded (80. 8 %) with 95 % confidence interval of 0. 75 - 0. 85. The number of symptoms verified was as follows: proving symptoms (n = 11) and new observations (n = 22). The widely emerged new general symptoms, i. e., clean tongue, disturbed sleep, loose stool, tastelessness, and <b>profuse</b> <b>sweat</b> may be worth consideration during prescription of Formic acid. Conclusions: The proving symptoms of Formic acid could be verified clinically, but the correlation of patient-specific symptom needs cautious interpretation.

60|$|Suffering of {{the body}} and mind: weeping.--I have already {{described}} in sufficient detail, in the third chapter, the signs of extreme pain, as shown by screams or groans, with the writhing of the whole body and the teeth clenched or ground together. These signs are often accompanied or followed by <b>profuse</b> <b>sweating,</b> pallor, trembling, utter prostration, or faintness. No suffering is greater than that from extreme fear or horror, but here a distinct emotion comes into play, and will be elsewhere considered. Prolonged suffering, especially of the mind, passes into low spirits, grief, dejection, and despair, and these states will be the subject of the following chapter. Here I shall almost confine myself to weeping or crying, more especially in children.|$|E
60|$|Most {{of these}} {{symptoms}} {{are probably the}} direct result, independently of habit, of the disturbed state of the sensorium; but it is doubtful whether {{they ought to be}} wholly thus accounted for. When an animal is alarmed it almost always stands motionless for a moment, in order to collect its senses and to ascertain the source of danger, and sometimes for the sake of escaping detection. But headlong flight soon follows, with no husbanding of the strength as in fighting, and the animal continues to fly as long as the danger lasts, until utter prostration, with failing respiration and circulation, with all the muscles quivering and <b>profuse</b> <b>sweating,</b> renders further flight impossible. Hence it does not seem improbable that the principle of associated habit may in part account for, or at least augment, some of the above-named characteristic symptoms of extreme terror.|$|E
60|$|From {{these facts}} it is {{manifest}} that the erection of the dermal appendages is a reflex action, {{independent of the}} will; and this action must be looked at, when, occurring {{under the influence of}} anger or fear, not as a power acquired for the sake of some advantage, but as an incidental result, at least to a large extent, of the sensorium being affected. The result, in as far as it is incidental, may be compared with the <b>profuse</b> <b>sweating</b> from an agony of pain or terror. Nevertheless, it is remarkable how slight an excitement often suffices to cause the hair to become erect; as when two dogs pretend to fight together in play. We have, also, seen in a large number of animals, belonging to widely distinct classes, that the erection of the hair or feathers is almost always accompanied by various voluntary movements-- by threatening gestures, opening the mouth, uncovering the teeth, spreading out of the wings and tail by birds, and by the utterance of harsh sounds; and the purpose of these voluntary movements is unmistakable. Therefore it seems hardly credible that the co-ordinated erection of the dermal appendages, by which the animal is made to appear larger and more terrible to its enemies or rivals, should be altogether an incidental and purposeless result of the disturbance of the sensorium. This seems almost as incredible as that the erection by the hedgehog of its spines, or of the quills by the porcupine, or of the ornamental plumes by many birds during their courtship. should all be purposeless actions.|$|E

Pain in the torso, usually in the chest or back, {{is considered to be}} a classical feature of dissect-ing aneurysm of the aorta, but reliance on the presence of pain may result in unnecessary delay in diagnosis and treatment. Without treatment, approximately 25 per cent of pa-tients survive the acute aortic dissection for more than 2 weeks, and approximately 10 per cent live for more than 6 months. 3 Although dissecting aneurysm occurs most commonly in the sixth and seventh decades of life and is known to be associated with abnormal cardio-vascular conditions, such as the Marfan syn-drome, hypertension, and coarctation of the aorta, it may also occur in young adults with otherwise normal cardiovascular systems 4 and in pregnant women. 5 The present report was prompted by experi-ence with a patient who had a painless dissect-ing aneurysm of the aorta and who exhibited certain features that allowed the correct clini-cal diagnosis to be made in the absence of pain in the torso.

60|$|I {{once had}} a horse at home, born and bred on the place, so docile that {{whenever}} I required him I could go to him where the horses were at pasture, and, though they all galloped off at my approach, he would calmly wait to be caught. Springing on to his back, I would go after the other horses, or gallop home with only my hand on his neck to guide him. I did not often ride him, as he was slow and lazy, but with timid women and children he was a favourite; he was also frequently used for farm work, {{in or out of}} harness, and I could shoot from his back. In the peach season he would roam about the plantation, getting the fruit, of which he was very fond, by tugging at the lower branches of the trees and shaking it down in showers. One intensely dark night I was riding home on this horse. I came through a road with a wire fence on each side, two miles in length, and when I had got nearly to the end of this road my horse suddenly stopped short, uttering a succession of loud terrified snorts. I could see nothing but the intense blackness of the night before me and tried to encourage him to go on. Touching him on the neck, I found his hair wet with the sudden <b>profuse</b> <b>sweat</b> of extreme fear. The whip made no impression on him. He continued to back away, his eyes apparently fixed on some object of horror just before him, while he trembled {{to such a degree that}} I was shaken in the saddle. He attempted several times to wheel round and run away, but I was determined not to yield to him, and continued the contest. Suddenly, when I was beginning to despair of getting home by that road, he sprang forward, and regularly charged the (to me) invisible object before him, and in another moment, when he had apparently passed it, taking the bit between his teeth he almost flew over the ground, never pausing till he brought me to my own door. When I dismounted his terror seemed gone, but he hung his head in a dejected manner, like a horse that has been under the saddle all day. I have never witnessed another such instance of almost maddening fear. His terror and apprehension were like what we can imagine a man experiencing at sight of a ghost in some dark solitary place.|$|R

30|$|Indolent lymphomas may undergo histologic {{transformation}} (HT), {{which is}} defined as evolution from indolent, low-grade lymphoma to aggressive, high-grade lymphoma, by means of genetic mutations with corresponding modifications in histologic architecture, clinical behavior, and prognosis of the disease [9, 10]. Clinically, transformed indolent lymphoma (TIL) presents with new systemic or “B” symptoms (unexplained weight loss, fever, and <b>profuse</b> night <b>sweating),</b> rapid or discordant nodal growth, new involvement of extranodal sites, rising lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hypercalcemia [9, 11]. Imaging has {{a crucial role in}} recognizing TIL: it helps to identify transformed lymph nodes or extranodal site involvement to guide biopsy, or can raise concern for transformation before clinically evident. In addition, imaging may allow differentiation between HT and recurrent/progressive indolent lymphoma or secondary malignancies, with change in patient management and impact on patient prognosis [9, 11 – 14]. Transformation commonly occur to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), less commonly to other types of aggressive lymphoma, including Burkitt and T cell/histiocyte-rich B cell lymphoma (TCRBCL) [9 – 11, 15, 16]. Recognizing and diagnose transformation is crucial since prognosis and management of indolent lymphoma and its transformed counterpart highly differs. While follicular lymphoma (FL), the most common indolent lymphoma, shows median survival of 14  years, after transformation survival drops to 1 – 2  years [9, 11, 17]. In addition, while treatment and follow up care of indolent lymphoma is based on the stage and subtype of disease, treatment and surveillance of transformed indolent lymphoma (TIL) is individualized, as currently there are no randomized studies in the modern era to guide practice [11, 12].|$|R
60|$|Mr. Esmond's {{commission}} was scarce three weeks old when that accident befell King William which ended {{the life of}} the greatest, the wisest, the bravest, and most clement sovereign whom England ever knew. 'Twas the fashion of the hostile party to assail this great prince's reputation during his life; but the joy which they and all his enemies in Europe showed at his death, is a proof of the terror in which they held him. Young as Esmond was, he was wise enough (and generous enough too, let it be said) to scorn that indecency of gratulation which broke out amongst the followers of King James in London, upon the death of this illustrious prince, this invincible warrior, this wise and moderate statesman. Loyalty to the exiled king's family was traditional, as has been said, in that house to which Mr. Esmond belonged. His father's widow had all her hopes, sympathies, recollections, prejudices, engaged on King James's side; and was certainly as noisy a conspirator as ever asserted the King's rights, or abused his opponent's, over a quadrille table or a dish of bohea. Her ladyship's house swarmed with ecclesiastics, in disguise and out; with tale-bearers from St. Germains; and quidnuncs that knew the last news from Versailles; nay, the exact force and number of the next expedition which the French king was to send from Dunkirk, and which was to swallow up the Prince of Orange, his army and his court. She had received the Duke of Berwick when he landed here in '96. She kept the glass he drank from, vowing she never would use it till she drank King James the Third's health in it on his Majesty's return; she had tokens from the Queen, and relics of the saint who, if the story was true, had not always been a saint as far as she and many others were concerned. She believed in the miracles wrought at his tomb, and had a hundred authentic stories of wondrous cures effected by the blessed king's rosaries, the medals which he wore, the locks of his hair, or what not. Esmond remembered a score of marvellous tales which the credulous old woman told him. There was the Bishop of Autun, that was healed of a malady he had for forty years, and which left him after he said mass for the repose of the king's soul. There was M. Marais, a surgeon in Auvergne, who had a palsy in both his legs, which was cured through the king's intercession. There was Philip Pitet, of the Benedictines, who had a suffocating cough, which wellnigh killed him, but he besought relief of heaven through the merits and intercession of the blessed king, and he straightway felt a <b>profuse</b> <b>sweat</b> breaking out all over him, and was recovered perfectly. And there was the wife of Mons. Lepervier, dancing-master to the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, who was entirely eased of a rheumatism by the king's intercession, of which miracle there could be no doubt, for her surgeon and his apprentice had given their testimony, under oath, that they did not in any way contribute to the cure. Of these tales, and a thousand like them, Mr. Esmond believed as much as he chose. His kinswoman's greater faith had swallow for them all.|$|R

Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to investigate malaria imported into Germany by identifying the high-risk endemic areas, clinical presentations, and chemoprophylactic and therapeutic regimens related to reported cases. Methods: Between 1990 and 1993, the 160 nonimmune travelers, all German nationals or residents for more than 10 years, presenting to our travel clinic wi th microscopically confirmed malaria were investigated. For each, the travel history, chemoprophylaxis used during travel, symptoms, pathological diagnosis, and treatment efficacy were analyzed. Results: Africa (73 %). Asia (21 %), and Central South America (6 %) were the endemic countries visited by our patients, of whom only 3 % used the chemoprophylaxis recommended for their destination.

The aims of this {{research}} were to investigate the effects of HIVIAIDS on the psychological and physical well being of learners; determine whether learners suffering from HIVIAIDS are ecosystemically supported; and make suggestions for an ecosystemic approach to supporting learners who are suffering from HIVIAIDS. The literature review revealed that the HIVIAIDS epidemic is seriously affecting the psychological and physical well being of learners. This {{is due to the}} effects of the epidemic's associated opportunistic diseases such as, among others, weight loss, dry cough, recurring fever or <b>profuse</b> night <b>sweats,</b> profound and unexplained fatigue, swollen lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck, diarrhoea that lasts for more than a week, white spots or unusual blemishes on the tongue, in the mouth, or in the throat, red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids; memory loss, concentration, creativity, depression, and other neurological disorders; tuberculosis, pneumonia, gastro-enteritis, meningitis and cancer which affect both the physical and psychological well being of learners suffering from both HIV and AIDS.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2006. The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} what the 'lived' experiences of HIV infected school-going learners are, determine how their psychological and physical well being are affected by HIV occurrences; investigate how their general functioning at school is, investigate the type of social support they get from their families, schools, communities and the society in general, and develop a constructivist counseling programme to assist these learners to realize their psychological and social strengths in order to succeed at school and in general life. The findings from the proceedings of the literature review indicated that HIV attacks the immune system, that is, the human body's defense against infection, and reduces the resistance of the body to all kinds of opportunistic diseases such as, inter alia, - weight loss, dry cough, recurring fever or <b>profuse</b> night <b>sweats,</b> profound and unexplained fatigue, swollen lymph glands in the armpits groin, or neck, diarrhea that lasts for more than a week, white spots or unusual blemishes on the tongue, in the mouth, or in the throat, red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids, memory loss, depression, and other neurological disorders; tuberculosis, pneumonia, gastro-enteritis, meningitis and cancer which seriously affect the psychological and the physical well-being of human beings. Constructivism formed the theoretical framework of this research. Constructivist theory propounds that people create meaning from the interaction between their existing knowledge or beliefs and the new ideas and situations that they encounter, ideas and situations that can only be effectively found in social settings. The constructivist theory postulates that attending to counselee’s socio-cultural factors in the counseling processes provides counselors with a cognitive framework for understanding the major tasks and crises of each stage of human functioning development. Self-efficacy was highlighted in the literature review as an important psycho-social variable that may influence coping among persons with HIVIAIDS as it refers to personal judgments concerning the ability to engage successfully in specific behaviors that lead to specific desired outcomes. The findings from the proceedings of the empirical research revealed that living with HIV becomes a burden which infected individuals carry wherever they go and they find it difficult to separate themselves from the virus; learners suffering from HIVIAIDS {{do not seem to be}} doing well at school because of continual sickness due to being infected with HIV, their high rate of absenteeism, their fear of being stigmatised and being socially discriminated against, hopelessness and helplessness, poverty, lack of social support and care by educators which all contribute to their poor scholastic performance; lack of support from family members, members of the community and the school makes it difficult for these learners to live positively; and that those learners who became infected with HIVIAIDS as a result of sexual abuse seem to be eager to spread the disease, instead of using preventative measures. Based on the literature study on HIVIAIDS and constructivist counseling for assisting learners suffering from HIVIAIDS, as well as feedback on the interviews conducted with learner participants who were suffering from HIVIAIDS, recommendations, which could prove useful to implementation of effective constructivist counseling services in schools, were suggested.
