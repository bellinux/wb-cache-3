50|$|Although the {{responsibilities}} are primarily technical, lead programmers also generally {{serve as an}} interface between the programmers and management, have ownership of development plans and have supervisorial responsibilities in delegating work and ensuring that software projects come in on time and under budget. Lead programmers also serve as technical advisers to management and provide <b>programming</b> <b>perspective</b> on requirements. Typically a lead programmer will oversee a development team of between two and ten programmers, with three to five often considered the ideal size. Teams larger than ten programmers tend to become unmanageable without additional structure. A lead programmer normally reports to a manager with overall project or section responsibility, such as a director or product unit manager (PUM).|$|E

In time, the Variety Network was renamed the General Network, the News Network became the Mainland Network, and eventually the Mainland, General, and Dialect Network were merged in with Radio Taiwan International. One consequence of this was that CBS could no longer broadcast domestically over AM radio.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a work in}} progress. We address a problem of reachability of states in planning from the constraint <b>programming</b> <b>perspective.</b> We propose an alternative way how planning graphs known from the Graph-plan algorithm can be constructed. We propose to do an additional consistency check every time when our variant of the planning graph is extended. This leads into a more accurate approximation of reachable states than it {{is done by the}} standard Graphplan algorithm. It is theoretically shown in this paper that our variant of planning graph forbids strictly more situations than it is forbidden by the standard planning graphs. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} learning constraint satisfaction problems from an inductive logic <b>programming</b> <b>perspective.</b> Constraint satisfaction problems are the underlying basis for constraint programming {{and there is a}} long standing interest in techniques for learning these. Constraint satisfaction problems are often described using a relational logic, so inductive logic programming is a natural candidate for learning such problems. So far, there is however only little work on the intersection between learning constraint satisfaction problems and inductive logic programming. In this article, we point out several similarities and differences between the two classes of techniques that may inspire further cross-fertilization between these two fields. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractStudies of the {{mathematical}} properties of impredicatively polymorphic types {{have for the}} most part focused on the polymorphic lambda calculus of Girard-Reynolds, which is a calculus of total polymorphic functions. This paper considers polymorphic types from a functional <b>programming</b> <b>perspective,</b> where the partialness arising from the presence of fixpoint recursion complicates the nature of potentially infinite (‘lazy’) datatypes. An operationally-based approach to Reynolds' notion of relational parametricity is developed for an extension of Plotkin's PCF with ∀types and lazy lists. The resulting logical relation is shown to be a useful tool for proving properties of polymorphic types up to a notion of operational equivalence based on Morris-style contextual equivalence...|$|E

Today, only CS 1 -level knowledge is necessary to do a serious review and exploration of computer music, as the algorithms have become more well understood (and thus easier to explain), and Moore's Law makes even ine#cient algorithms successful. A serious impediment, however, has been the lack of a text that is written from a <b>programming</b> <b>perspective</b> (instead of mathematical or musical).

40|$|ObjectiveHIV in Nicaragua is {{concentrated}} among key populations (KPs) – {{men who have}} sex with men, female sex workers and female transgender – in whom prevalence is 600 - 4 000 times higher than the general population. The USAID PrevenSida Project is aimed at increasing healthy behavior among KPs and people with HIV and improving testing, counseling, and continuity of prevention and treatment by building capacity and improving performance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing services to KPs. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PrevenSida’s activities. MethodsThis retrospective observational evaluation used individuals in KPs covered by NGOs receiving assistance from PrevenSida from 2012 to 2014. Cost-effectiveness analysis compared PrevenSida’s intervention with business-as-usual. Model inputs were generated from epidemiological modeling and PrevenSida’s records. ResultsBy 2014, 24 NGOs received grants and technical assistance from PrevenSida with 72 955 people in KPs served at $ 11. 32 /person ($ 9. 39 to $ 16. 55 /person depending on region). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 50 700 /HIV case averted or $ 2 600 /Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted (95 % CI: $ 1 000 -$ 99 000 and $ 50 -$ 5 100, respectively). ConclusionPrevenSida distributed about $ 600 000 in grants and used $ 230 000 to support 24 NGOs in 2014. Cost-effectiveness from the <b>program</b> <b>perspective</b> compared to no program was slightly over half of GDP per capita per DALY averted, considered highly cost-effective by WHO criteria. Cost and efficiency varied by region, reflecting the number of people in KPs receiving services. Cost-sharing by NGOs improved cost-effectiveness from the <b>program</b> <b>perspective</b> and likely promotes sustainability. Focused interventions for KP service provision organizations can be acceptably efficient in this setting...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} launch operations from a <b>program</b> <b>perspective.</b> Launch operations cost is {{a significant}} part of program cost. New approaches to launch operations, integrated with lessons learned, have the potential to increase safety and reliability as well as reduce cost. Operational efficiency must be an initial program goal. Design technology and management philosophy must be implemented early to ensure operational cost goals. Manufacturing cost and launch cost are related to operational efficiency. True program savings can be realized through implementation of launch operations cost saving approaches which do not correspondingly increase cost in other program areas such as manufacturing and software development and maintenance. Launch rate is a key factor in the cost/flight analysis and the determination of launch operations efficiency goals...|$|R
