Miceli, a veteran women's wrestler who has competed under the name Madusa {{for most of her}} career, performed as Alundra Blayze in the WWF in 1993 and 1995 and won the Women's Championship during her stay there. McMahon, however, had neglected to renew her contract when it expired and Miceli signed with WCW where she changed her ring name back to Madusa. When she made her first appearance on WCW Monday Nitro, Madusa made fun of her time in the WWF and brought her title belt with her to the <b>program,</b> <b>dumping</b> it into a trash can.

Hart continued to refuse to drop the title to Michaels, offering to lose the title anywhere in the United States prior to Survivor Series or to surrender the title to McMahon on the episode of Monday Night Raw the day after Survivor Series, in Ottawa. After several disagreements, McMahon, Michaels and Hart agreed to a proposal of a disqualification finish, which would be the result of a brawl between Hart's allies Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith with Michaels's allies Triple H and Chyna, who would interfere in the match to aid Michaels. Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date, as he was not due to start in WCW until December.

40|$|Abstract—Intermittent {{hardware}} faults {{are hard}} to diagnose as they occur non-deterministically at the same location. Hardware-only diagnosis techniques incur significant power and area overheads. On the other hand, software-only diagnosis techniques have low power and area overheads, but have limited visibility into many micro-architectural structures and hence cannot diagnose faults in them. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hardware-software integrated framework for diagnosing intermittent faults. The hardware part of our framework, called SCRIBE continuously records the resource usage information of every instruction in the processor, and exposes it to the software layer. SCRIBE incurs a performance overhead of 12 % and power overhead of 9 %, on average. The software part of our framework is called SIED and uses backtracking from the <b>program’s</b> crash <b>dump</b> to find the faulty micro-architectural resource. Our technique has an average accuracy of 84 % in diagnosing the faulty resource, which in turn enables fine-grained deconfiguration with less than 2 % performance loss after deconfiguration...|$|R

Because of this and other concerns, such password capabilities were considered a vulnerability in NLTSS. A design was done to protect against this vulnerability, the Control by Public Key Encryption mechanism.

Modern advances in cryptography would make such protection for capabilities practical, especially for Internet/Web capabilities (e.g. see YURLs or WideWORD).|$|R

5000|$|Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA) or Ocean Dumping Act is one {{of several}} key {{environmental}} laws passed by the US Congress in 1972. The Act has two essential aims: to regulate intentional ocean disposal of materials, and to authorize any related research. While the MPRSA regulates the ocean dumping of waste and provides for a research <b>program</b> on ocean <b>dumping,</b> it also provides for the designation and regulation of marine sanctuaries. The act regulates the ocean dumping of all material beyond the territorial limit (3 mi from shore) and prevents or strictly limits dumping material that [...] "would adversely affect human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities”. The MPRSA authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate ocean dumping of materials including, but not limited to, industrial waste, sewage sludge, biological agents, radioactive agents, NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical), garbage, chemicals, and biological and laboratory, as well as other wastes, into the territorial waters of the United States through a permit program. The EPA can issue permits for dumping of materials other than dredge spoils if the agency determines, through a full public notice and process, that the discharge will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health or welfare or the marine environment.

We aimed at characterizing fungal communities from different poplar habitats at a Hg-contaminated phytomanagement site by using Illumina-based sequencing, network analysis approach, and direct isolation of Hg-resistant fungal strains. The highest diversity {{estimated by the}} Shannon index was found for soil communities, which was negatively affected by soil Hg concentration. Among the significant correlations between soil operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the co-occurrence network, 80 % were negatively correlated revealing dominance of a pattern of mutual exclusion. The fungal communities associated with Populus roots mostly consisted of OTUs from the symbiotic guild, such {{as members of the}} Thelephoraceae, thus explaining the lowest diversity found for root communities. Additionally, root communities showed the highest network connectivity index, while rarely detected OTUs from the Glomeromycetes may have {{a central role in the}} root network.

The aboveground habitats were dominated by yeasts from the Lalaria, Davidiella, and Bensingtonia genera, not detected in belowground habitats.

40|$|A new archive format called rat was developed. This format was {{designed}} to allow very fast retrieval of individual files. This is achieved using a table of contents to quickly find the file. Each file in the archive is individually compressed with a compression method specific to the file. A user created configuration file is used to specify what type of compression to use on each file based on parameters such as the file extension and file size. Multiple sets of rules can be defined and activated from the command line to achieve different aims such as speed or size or to deal with different types of file sets. Parameters passed to the compression algorithms may also be specified. The format also provides for signatures to be stored with the files. The program will generate and save the signature when the archive is created and verify the file when the archive is restored. Encryption is possible but not implemented. The format is quite robust. If the archive is truncated or the table of contents is lost, the files in the portion that survived can still be recovered. Every file and table is preceded by a magic number so even recovery from bit rot may be possible. The current implementation incorporates gzip (as zlib), bzip 2, and LZO compression. Library versions of these compression algorithms are linked in for performance reasons. Only PGP signatures are currently implemented. Due to export restrictions on encryption software, a child process is spawned to execute a separate binary to do the signature creation and verification. A library called librat implements all the functionality required to create the archive and restore files from the archive. Alternate user interfaces or embedded applications are therefore quite readily created. Three front ends to librat have been implemented.
