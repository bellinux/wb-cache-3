5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|Videoball plays as a {{two-dimensional}} hybrid of air hockey and soccer {{on a single}} screen. Players form two teams of one to three players. Each player uses an analog stick to control a triangle-shaped avatar and <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> single button to shoot triangle-shaped projectiles. The object {{of the game is}} to knock one or more circular balls into the opposing team's goal. Players hold the button to charge a shot, which fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, block other projectiles, and incapacitate opponents. Since the shot is triangle-shaped, it can only drive the ball for some distance before the ball veers off-course.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find {{the wreck of the}} Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E

25|$|Negative {{reinforcement}} (escape): This {{occurs when}} a behavior (response) {{is followed by the}} removal of an aversive stimulus, thereby increasing that behavior's frequency. In the Skinner box experiment, the aversive stimulus might be a loud noise continuously sounding inside the box; negative reinforcement would happen when the rat <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> lever, turning off the noise.|$|E
25|$|The {{saxophone}} (also {{referred to}} as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments. Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece {{similar to that of the}} clarinet. Like the clarinet, saxophones have holes in the instrument which the player closes using a system of key mechanisms. When the player <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> key, a pad either covers a hole or lifts off a hole, lowering or raising the pitch, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Mary is {{depicted}} {{sitting on a}} stool, with a slightly oversized Christ child figure sitting on her lap. She wears a tight, long-sleeved tunic and a cloak (palla) drawn over her shoulders. On her head she wears a veil, the ends of which are covered by the cloak. In her right hand she holds aloft a globe with her thumb and two fingers, while her left hand supports the infant in her lap. The Christ figure himself wears a pontifical gown and <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> book against his breast with his left hand.|$|E
25|$|Electric-motor-driven {{mechanical}} sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 volts (DC) when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate {{wiring and}} transient protection for engine control computers {{is a necessary}} part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the wiring to the vehicle engine starter motor. Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an electric brake, a solenoid that <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> friction pad against the siren rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop the siren.|$|E
25|$|When the typist <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> key, a pawl on the {{key lever}} {{depresses}} a matching metal bar (interposer) for that key. The interposer, which is oriented front to back in the machine, has one or more short projections (lugs) protruding from its bottom edge. Each interposer has a unique combination of lugs, corresponding to the binary code for the desired character. Each interposer also has a tab that slots in between loose steel balls in a race, the size of balls and race selected precisely to leave a total gap barely larger than {{the width of the}} interposer tab, such that only one interposer tab can fit in the free space and thus only one letter can be selected at a time.|$|E

25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, {{the trolley}} pole {{has given way}} to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|E
500|$|The {{first round}} {{consists}} of three questions. Each question has one correct answer, and the opening value is $5,000. After the first question has been played, the team is afforded two [...] "takeovers" [...] {{to use in the}} rest of the game. To use a takeover, one contestant <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> smaller red button (yellow in season one only) in front of them; their answer is then considered to be the team's answer.|$|E
500|$|When driving, control {{options include}} [...] "directional steering" [...] where [...] "left" [...] and [...] "right" [...] {{controls}} the vehicle {{in that direction}} (like a steering wheel) and [...] "up" [...] accelerates, and another option where the player <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> button corresponding to the desired direction. The player targets enemies by pressing the pound key and then pressing [...] "5" [...] repeatedly, which also leaves the character vulnerable. Players can run faster than the cars can drive.|$|E

500|$|In 1833, Peale {{was sent}} {{on a tour}} of European mints and came home with ideas for new {{machines}} and innovations, including the introduction of steam power, used at Britain's Royal Mint since 1810 on equipment purchased from the firm of Boulton & Watt. [...] Although Eckfeldt would have preferred to apply steam to the existing coin <b>presses,</b> <b>a</b> new one was built for steam power, and commemorative medals were the first pieces struck by steam at the Philadelphia Mint, in early 1836.|$|E
500|$|A man (Henry Ian Cusick) {{wakes up}} from his bunk bed and {{immediately}} <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> few keys on {{what appears to be}} a late 1970s-era computer. He then gets dressed, and begins his day as the camera moves about the surrounding rooms, which contain an assortment of objects from the 1960s to the present. He puts on some music, begins an exercise routine, has a shower, makes himself some breakfast, and injects himself with a vaccine. He is interrupted by an explosion, spurring the man to arm himself before using a telescope-and-mirror system. His gaze reveals the faces of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) standing around the now-open [...] shaft.|$|E
500|$|A third meter {{increases}} {{after each}} combo and allows when maxed out {{to perform a}} [...] "Code Drive" [...] attack. Executed with the triangle button, a Code Drive triggers a brief close-up sequence in which a blue circle appears around the character. If the player <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> second button before the circle shifts to red, a powerful special attack will be unleashed. If the enemy blocks the Code Drive, a second, shorter close-up sequence is triggered. Enemies can also perform Code Drives, {{in which case the}} player's button press allows for protection rather than attack. Executing Code Drives frequently can cause the weapon used to upgrade, or the character to go into a [...] "Code Crisis"; a mode which reduces speed and renders immune to attack, but slowly drains hit points.|$|E

500|$|Burns {{introduces}} Homer to Aristotle Amadopoulos, {{the owner}} of the nuclear power plant in Shelbyville, Springfield's neighbor town. Amadopoulos wants Homer to give a pep talk to his plant's lackluster workers. Homer is hesitant to accept, but Mr. Burns forces him into it. At the Shelbyville plant, he gives a fumbling motivational speech. Suddenly an impending meltdown threatens the Shelbyville plant. Amadopoulos and Homer go to the control room, and Amadopoulos asks Homer to avert the meltdown. In front of everyone, Homer repeats his rhyme and <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> button blindly. By luck, he again manages to avert a meltdown. Amadopoulos thanks Homer for saving the plant, but angrily berates him for his stupidity. Soon the phrase [...] "to pull a Homer", meaning [...] "to succeed despite idiocy," [...] becomes widely used and is entered into the dictionary.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening made a minor cameo in the episode, {{though his}} {{appearance}} is {{not mentioned in}} the closing credits. In the episode, a robot examines the health of Maggie's fetus. Maggie's band is present, and one of the band members <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> button on the robot's [...] "face", which is a screen showing its facial expressions, and a soccer game comes on instead. A sports commentator, voiced by Groening, gives a long [...] "goal!" [...] shout that is heard over the game. According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, as the episode was being recorded, [...] "there were only sounds of crowd cheering during that shot and Matt said we needed to spice it up somehow." [...] After going through some different ideas, the staff settled on a commentator shouting [...] "goal!". The staff members wanted Groening to provide the voice and he finished the recording in two takes.|$|E
500|$|By the 1940s, al-Birwa {{had three}} olive oil <b>presses,</b> <b>a</b> mosque, a church, and {{approximately}} 300 houses. In {{addition to the}} Ottoman-era boys' school, an elementary school for girls was established in 1943. By this time, many of the inhabitants lost {{all or part of}} their lands due to debts, and concurrently, men and women from al-Birwa increasingly worked in public projects, such as road construction and the Haifa oil refinery, or in British military installations, to compensate for lost income. [...] However, the main source of income remained agriculture, and the village's principal crops were olives, wheat, barley, corn, sesame, and watermelons. In 1944/45, residents of the village owned a total of 600 cattle, 3,000 goats and 1,000 chickens. Women, particularly young women from smaller landowning families, participated alongside the men of their family in working the land, while many women from landless families drew income as seasonal workers on other village residents' lands. There were general, gender-based divisions of labor, with women collecting well water, raising livestock, curdling milk, transporting goods to markets in Acre and collecting herbs; men typically plowed and sowed seeds, and both men and women picked olives and harvested crops.|$|E
