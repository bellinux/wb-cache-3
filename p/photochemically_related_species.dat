40|$|The Common topological {{features}} of <b>related</b> <b>species</b> gene regulatory networks suggest {{reconstruction of the}} network of one species by using the further information from gene expressions profile of <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> We present an algorithm to reconstruct the gene regulatory network named; F-MAP, which applies the knowledge about gene interactions from <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> Our algorithm sets a Bayesian framework to estimate the precision matrix of one species microarray gene expressions dataset to infer the Gaussian Graphical model of the network. The conjugate Wishart prior is used and the information from <b>related</b> <b>species</b> is applied to estimate the hyperparameters of the prior distribution by using the factor analysis. Applying the proposed algorithm on six <b>related</b> <b>species</b> of drosophila shows that the precision of reconstructed networks is improved considerably compared to the precision of networks constructed by other Bayesian approaches...|$|R

25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that closely <b>related</b> <b>species</b> {{are more likely}} to compete than are more distantly <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> and hence many {{researchers}} investigate character displacement among species in the same genus. While character displacement was originally discussed in the context of very closely <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> evidence suggests that even interactions among distantly <b>related</b> <b>species</b> can result in character displacement. Finches and bees in the Galapagos provide support for this. Two finch species (Geospiza fuliginosa and G. difficilis) exploit more flower nectar on islands where the lager carpenter bee (Xylocopa darwini) is absent than on islands with the bees. Individual finches that harvest nectar are smaller than members of the same species that do not.|$|R
