5|$|Bone Copse, {{which was}} named in 2005, {{was started by}} the Bone family in 1988 by {{purchasing}} and <b>planting</b> a tree from the park authorities in memory of Bessie Bone who died in that year.

5|$|The <b>planting</b> was recreated in the 1930s. No {{original}} {{plan of the}} renaissance garden survives, although records show fruit was grown in the 17th century. The garden has decorative hedges, trimmed into {{the shapes of the}} Scottish thistle, English rose, and French fleur-de-lis. Further <b>planting</b> is clipped into letters, spelling out the two Lindsay family mottoes, Dum Spiro Spero (while I breathe I hope), and Endure Forte (endure firmly).|$|E
5|$|This {{classification}} is {{a useful}} tool for planning <b>planting.</b> Most commercially available narcissi come from Divisions 1 (Trumpet), 2 (Large-cupped) and 8 (Tazetta).|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space <b>planting.</b> From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside <b>planting</b> have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5000|$|Today {{the garden}} {{contains}} more than 1,000 <b>plant</b> taxa, including medicinal and aromatic <b>plants</b> (38 species), cosmetic/perfume <b>plants</b> (92 species), fruit <b>plants</b> (50 taxa), industrial <b>plants</b> (23 species), dye <b>plants</b> (19 species), useful <b>plants</b> of the tropics (150 species), and desert <b>plants</b> (250 species).|$|R
50|$|<b>Plant</b> variety {{certificates}} {{should not}} be confused with <b>plant</b> patents. The <b>Plant</b> Variety Protection Act (PVPA) and the <b>Plant</b> Patent Act of 1930 provide protection based on different types of <b>plant</b> reproductive strategies. The PVPA, which authorizes <b>plant</b> variety protection certificates, protects sexually reproduced and tuber propagated <b>plants,</b> whereas the <b>Plant</b> Patent Act, which authorizes <b>plant</b> patents, is limited to asexually reproduced <b>plants,</b> excluding tuber propagated <b>plants.</b> However, the same <b>plant</b> may be protected under both the <b>Plant</b> Variety Protection Act and the <b>Plant</b> Patent Act of 1930. The most appropriate means of protection may be decided by the applicant based on the applicant's business requirements.|$|R

5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by <b>planting</b> mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion <b>planting.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for <b>planting.</b> He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal <b>planting,</b> supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
