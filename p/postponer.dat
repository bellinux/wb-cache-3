Anhand von sodass und zumal werden die Kerneigenschaften solcher Konnektoren im Deutschen vorgestellt. Am Beispiel der italienischen Konjunktionen cosicché, tanto più che und perché wird diskutiert, ob der Begriff des Postponierers für den Sprachvergleich genutzt werden kann. In einem nächsten Schritt werden die Postponierer des Deutschen unter Beiziehung sprachgeschichtlicher Argumente präziser beschrieben und im Übergangsfeld zwischen Adverbkonnektoren und Subjunktoren verortet. Es zeigt sich, dass die untersuchten Konnektoren sich letztlich sehr unterschiedlich verhalten, sodass es fraglich erscheint, ob ihre Zusammenfassung zu einer gemeinsamen Klasse gerechtfertigt ist. This article {{studies the}} syntax and {{semantics}} of so-called postponers, i. e. appending conjunctions which require the subordinate clause they introduce {{to follow the}} main clause. German sodass and zumal are prototypical examples, which illustrate the grammatical properties of those connectives. Other languages have conjunctions with similar characteristics, e. g. Italian cosicché, tanto più che and perché. In {{the first part of}} the article we discuss whether the concept of the <b>postponer</b> brings benefits for comparative grammatical descriptions. In a subsequent step, the syntactic and semantic behaviour of the German postponers is examined more thoroughly. Historical evidence characterises them as manifestations of the transition from adverbial connectives to subordinating conjunctions. It becomes apparent that each <b>postponer</b> has its individual grammatical properties, so that it seems questionable whether they should be considered instances of one and the same category...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{average age}} at onset of {{malignancies}} arising from epithelial tissues is between 40 and 70 years old even in familial cancers. Although {{it is believed}} that the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations is needed for cancer onset, we hypothesize [...] based on the diversity of ages at onset for most types of epithelial cancer [...] that there is a postponing mechanism inside the human body that significantly delays the process of carcinogenesis. The key molecules controlling the cancer onset, here called "postponers", are hypothesized to be functioning in the individuals carrying susceptibility genes. As a consequence, cancers occur in middle age or even old age, with several decades of cancer-free lifetime for the patient. Genome-wide association studies and genomic expression profiling are suggested to identify candidate postponers.

40|$|Exploration of the postponing {{mechanism}} that delays carcinoma onset Chao-Nan Qian 1, 2 The average age at onset of malignancies arising from epithelial tissues is between 40 and 70 years old even in familial cancers. Although {{it is believed}} that the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations is needed for cancer onset, we hypothesize–based on the diversity of ages at onset for most types of epithelial cancer–that there is a postponing mechanism inside the human body that significantly delays the process of carcinogenesis.

40|$|Few {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between adults who make early, explicit decisions not to have children, and others who reach voluntary childlessness {{through a series of}} postponements. The present Australian study using questionnaire responses examined possible background, sex role, and other differences between 55 early deciders and 23 childless respondents labelled as <b>postponers.</b> Early deciders {{were more likely to have}} been raised in smaller families and to believe that their childlessness was influenced by concerns with overpopulation. While there were fewer differences in sex role beliefs, early deciders reported more negative reactions to their childlessness than <b>postponers.</b> They highlighted being labelled as selfish and as child-haters, and avoided places with parents and children...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the world view of women who decide not to have {{children}} or of women who decide to have an only child. The present study compared the pregnancy–related perceptions of single and married women who prefer either childlessness, or one or 2 children. When asked to rate their image of a pregnant woman, married women who had decided early in life not to parent, and currently single women who intended to be childfree, considered pregnant women as less intelligent, responsible, attractive, dignified, natural and self–fulfilled than did other women. Voluntarily childless wives who were classified as <b>postponers</b> were less negative than early deciders in their view of pregnant women, especially on the attractiveness and social acceptance benefits of pregnancy. Mothers of one child by choice did not differ from two-child mothers in their view of pregnancy. Within each fertility choice, single and married women had very similar attitudes...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Online banking is facing too many types of resistance which hinders its adoption by Tunisian customers. The objective behind this present research is to identify the barriers underlying the non adoption of online banking in Tunisia. It {{is based on a}} survey of nearly 150 Tunisian customers who are non adopters of internet banking services. This study identifies three groups of non- adopters of online banking technology: the <b>postponers,</b> the opponents and the rejectors. On the one hand, the results indicate that the three groups of non- adopters differ significantly with respect to psychological barriers (tradition and image). On the other hand they revele that the functional barriers (use, value and risk) have no impact on the resistance to the adoption of e- banking in Tunisia...|$|R

50|$|This {{comprised}} {{questions of}} the Last day, or in Arabic, the Qiyamah (Day of Judgment). According to 'Abd al-Jabbar, The doctrine of irreversible Divine promises and warnings, is fashioned out the Islamic philosophy of human existence. Humans, (or insan in Arabic) are created with an innate need in their essence to submit themselves to something. Also, {{it is seen as}} an innate need of all humans to pursue an inner peace and contentment within the struggles of an imperfect world. Knowledge of God, truth, and choices, in relation to one's innate need of submission is seen in Islam as the promise and recompense of God (al-thawab) to those who follow. His warning is looked at as a conscious decision by a human submitting themselves, and choosing a varying principle which He had given a clear warning to. He will not go back on His word, nor can He act contrary to His promise and warning, nor lie in what He reports, in contrast to what the <b>Postponers</b> (Murjites) hold.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{reproductive}} intentions among childless Finnish {{men and women}} aged 18 to 34 years. In Finland, as in other European countries, young adults are postponing parenthood to an ever-later age. Our intention is to investigate expressions of reproductive intentions, and particularly, {{to focus on the}} division of intentions between more positive and more hesitant expressions. We examine how education, factors related to economic security and values relate to childbearing hesitation among young adults. We also use information on the reasons that the young themselves have provided to examine differences in fertility intentions. Our study uses a sample of 724 men and women drawn from the PPA 2 survey, which focused on Finns attitudes in 2002 toward family and children, family policy measures, values in life, and fertility intentions. We ? nd that education is related to postponement, and that unemployment increases hesitation. Partnership and the state of the relationship are clearly important preconditions for positive childbearing intentions among both men and women. <b>Postponers</b> are more likely to stress reasons that are related to present life situation and are more open to change, while persons who hesitate regarding future childbearing stress longer-standing reasons behind their intentions...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{smart home}} {{services}} have been highlighted as the Internet of things market grows. Since the smart home services {{were introduced in}} the market, {{they were expected to}} grow rapidly. However, the smart home market recently experienced chasm, and still remains in early stage. This paper tried to find the possible barriers that consumers encounter when they are faced with smart home services. Based on the resistance theory and perceived risk model, this paper investigates the influence of perceived risk on the resistance using the technological uncertainty and service intangibility as the antecedents of the perceived risk. Dividing the perceived risks into four types of performance risk, financial risk, privacy risk and psychological risk, the empirical results show that these four types of risk are affected by the technological uncertainty and service intangibility on the one hand, and have positive effects on the resistance to smart home on the other hand. When the survey respondents are divided into two groups of <b>postponers</b> and rejecters based on the resistance type, there are no big differences except that the privacy risk becomes unimportant to postpners and the financial risk becomes unimportant to rejecters...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} ecology of vascular epiphytes and vines in the Waikato region of the North Island, and the water relations of the shrub hemiepiphyte Griselinia lucida. The main goal was to develop robust recommendations {{for the inclusion of}} epiphytic species in urban forest restoration projects. To achieve this, three broad questions were addressed: 1. How are vascular epiphytes and vines distributed throughout the nonurban and urban areas of the Waikato region, and how does this compare to other North Island areas? 2. Why are some epiphyte and vine species absent from urban Hamilton and what opportunities exist for their inclusion in restoration projects? 3. How does Griselinia lucida respond to desiccation stress and how does this compare to its congener G. littoralis? To investigate questions one and two, an ecological survey of the epiphyte communities on host trees in Waikato (n= 649) and Taranaki (n= 101) was conducted, alongside canopy microclimate monitoring in five Waikato sites. Results show that epiphyte and vine populations in Hamilton City forests represent only 55. 2 % of the total Waikato species pool, and have a very low average of 0. 8 epiphyte species per host. In contrast, the urban forests of Taranaki support 87. 9 % of the local species pool and have an average of 5. 5 species per host tree. The low diversity and abundance in urban Waikato can be primarily attributed to the alteration of canopy microclimates by edge effects. Mean temperature and vapour pressure deficits in Waikato were 1. 9 °C and 1. 1 kPa (respectively) higher in the canopy of small urban patches than the larger, nonurban forests. These warmer and drier conditions are speculated to be interrupting species accumulation and community formation processes. This phenomenom is not as pronounced in Taranaki which has larger trees and higher rainfall. Epiphyte diversity and abundance was also found to be associated with seed dispersal distances and the size, bark type, and architecture of host trees. To link the microclimate findings with physiological limitations of epiphytes and to address question three, a desiccation tolerance experiment was conducted on the shrub hemiepiphyte Griselinia lucida. Moderate and severe levels of desiccation stress were applied to seedlings of G. lucida and its terrestrial congener, G. littoralis. Both species endured over two months of drought with negligible mortality. In G. lucida, stomatal conductance reduced to zero, and leaf bulk elastic modulus reduced from 8. 09 (± 0. 51) MPa in the control group to 3. 66 (± 0. 61) MPa under severe stress. When compared to G. littoralis, G. lucida exhibited a more acute response to stress and recovered faster with rewatering. However, the overall response of each species was similar and both species can be classified as desiccation <b>postponers.</b> To summarise and combine the findings of this research with existing information on Griselinia lucida, a contribution to the New Zealand Biological Flora Series for this species is presented. Recommendations for the inclusion of epiphytes in restoration projects are presented. Reintroductions should use epiphyte and vine species that are appropriate for the conditions of the target forest, and focus on large host trees in relatively humid microclimates...|$|R
