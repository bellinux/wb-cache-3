40|$|Analysis of {{deformity}} {{and subsequent}} correction {{are the basis}} for many orthopaedic surgical procedures. In advanced cases of joint degeneration, arthroplasty {{may be the only}} available treatment option. Until recently, these analyses and preoperative surgical plans have been performed using standard radiographs, tracing <b>paper,</b> and/or <b>plastic</b> <b>overlays.</b> Numerous customized, commercially available, computer-based preoperative planning software programs have been introduced. The purposes of this study were to describe (1) the techniques used in deformity analysis and preoperative surgical planning using standard radiographs for joint arthroplasty and corrective osteotomies of the extremities, (2) the use of computed tomography (CT) scans to analyze rotational deformities in the presence and absence of joint prostheses and in planning corrective rotational osteotomies or revision joint replacement, and (3) the techniques for analyzing angular deformities of the spine. All these applications were performed with a widely available image analysis software...|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the {{controllers}} {{is similar to that}} of Mattel's Intellivision—the controller is rectangular and consists of a numeric keypad and a set of side buttons. In place of the circular control disc below the keypad, the Coleco controller has a short, 1.5-inch joystick. The keypad is designed to accept a thin <b>plastic</b> <b>overlay</b> that maps the keys for a particular game. Each ColecoVision console shipped with two controllers.|$|R
5000|$|For the proposal, Smithson {{submitted}} a {{design in the}} form of a photostat with <b>plastic</b> <b>overlay</b> on which he marked with wax pencil. [...] The mine's massive spiraling cavity was already sympathetic to Smithson's aesthetics and he did not plan to alter it. At the circular bottom of the open pit, the proposal called for four dividing crescent rises. During heavy rains, these would turn into jetties rising from the collected pool of water.|$|R

5000|$|To {{further reduce}} costs, the {{traditional}} front panel lights showing internal registers were absent. Instead, Librascope mounted a small oscilloscope {{on the front}} panel. It displayed the output from the three register read heads, one above the other, allowing the operator to [...] "see" [...] and actually read the bits. Horizontal and vertical size controls let the operator adjust the display to match a <b>plastic</b> <b>overlay</b> engraved with the bit numbers.To read bits the operator counted the up- and down- transitions of the oscilloscope trace.|$|R
500|$|The {{front part}} of the case is {{occupied}} by an integrated 40-key membrane keyboard displaying 20graphic and 54inverse video characters. Each key has up to five functions, accessed via the SHIFT and FUNCTION keys or depending on context. For example, the P key combines the letter P, the [...] " [...] character, and the BASIC commands PRINT and TAB. The ZX81 uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout. The keyboard is mechanically very simple, consisting of 40pressure-pad switches and 8 diodes under a <b>plastic</b> <b>overlay,</b> connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns.|$|R

5000|$|The 2250 {{was housed}} in a desk with an {{alphanumeric}} (QWERTY) keyboard and a separate programmed function keyboard which had keys, indicator lights and switches. A <b>plastic</b> <b>overlay</b> label could be placed over the function keyboard. Punches on {{the top edge of}} the overlay could be sensed by the computer so the keys, lights and switches could be reprogrammed simply by changing overlays. The 2250s CRT measured 21" [...] diagonal, but the useful display area was 12 inch by 12 inch. A light pen was provided as a pointing device, serving the function of the modern computer mouse.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In four studies {{children}} {{were asked to}} read aloud a passage of randomly ordered common words with and without a coloured sheet of <b>plastic</b> (<b>overlay)</b> placed upon the page. The children’s rate of reading increased with the overlay, for some children more than for others. The {{children were}} also asked to undertake a test of texture segmentation in which targets consisting of a structured texture had to be distinguished from within a random background texture. The texture segmentation was improved when the overlay was used, again for some children more than for others. The improvement in texture segmentation was, in general, correlated with the improve-ment in rate of reading. Slower readers were generally poorer at texture segmentation. The implications for reading, for texture segmentation, and for clinical tests of vision are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{finishing}} {{properties of}} particleboard {{made from the}} Empty-Fruit Bunch (EFB) of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) were evaluated for its suitability for furniture applications, using different coating and overlay materials. The results found that the thick plastic-formica overlay provided the best surface finish, in terms of surface smoothness, adhesion strength and impact resistance. Although the polyurethane lacquer provided an acceptable finish, its quality and performance is not {{comparable to that of}} the thick <b>plastic</b> <b>overlay.</b> Despite the fact that the use of such overlay material may render the material not aesthetically appealing and limit it to concealed applications or where the thick overlay material is tolerated, its cost competitiveness and environmental friendliness may be able to position the oil palm particleboard as a substitute for the conventional wood-based particleboard in the furniture manufacturing industry...|$|R
