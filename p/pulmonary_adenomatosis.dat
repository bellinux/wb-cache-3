In vivo transfection of three newborn lambs by intratracheal inoculation with pJSRV 21 DNA complexed with cationic lipids showed that pJSRV 21 is an infectious molecular clone. Viral DNA was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the transfected animals by a highly sensitive JSRV-U 3 heminested PCR at various time points ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months posttransfection. In addition, proviral DNA was detected in the PBMCs, lungs, and mediastinal lymph nodes of two lambs sacrificed 9 months posttransfection, but no macroscopic or histological SPA lesion was induced.

Currently, ovine <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis</b> exists in most sheep-raising areas of the world, with the exception of New Zealand and Australia.

Etiology Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma results from infection by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), which is also known as the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis</b> virus. This virus {{is a member of the}} genus Betaretrovirus in the Retroviridae. Species Affected Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma mainly affects domesticated sheep (Ovis aries). Sardinian moufflon (Ovis musimon, a species of wild sheep) can also become ill, and a few cases have been reported in domesticated goats. Geographic Distribution Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be found in sheep-raising countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This disease does not occur in Australia or New Zealand. It has been eradicated from Iceland. Transmission Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be transmitted by the respiratory route, probably via aerosols or droplets. Infectious virus occurs in the respiratory exudates of infected sheep. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus can be found in tumors, lung fluids, peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs; before tumors develop, the virus is detected in lymphoreticular cells. Horizontal transmission has been demonstrated among sheep of all ages, but neonates seem to be particularly susceptible to infection. There is no evidence that in utero transmission is significant in the epidemiology of this disease; however, recent studies suggest that JSRV might be spread in milk or colostrum.

40|$|Jaagsiekte sheep {{retrovirus}} (JSRV) {{is a type}} D retrovirus specifically {{associated with}} a contagious lung tumor of sheep, sheep <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis</b> (SPA). JSRV replicates actively in the transformed epithelial cells of the lung, and JSRV DNA and RNA have been detected in lymphoid tissues of naturally affected animals. To determine the lymphoid target cells of JSRV, CD 4 + T cells, CD 8 + T cells, B lymphocytes, and adherent cell (macrophage/monocyte) populations were isolated from the mediastinal lymph nodes of naturally affected sheep and lambs inoculated with JSRV. Cells were enriched to high purity and then analyzed for JSRV proviral DNA by heminested PCR, and the proviral burden was quantitated by limiting dilution analysis. JSRV proviral DNA was found in all subsets examined but not in appropriate negative controls. In sheep naturally affected with SPA, JSRV proviral burden was greatest in the adherent cell population. In the nonadherent lymphocyte population, surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells contained the greatest proviral burden, while CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells contained the lowest levels of JSRV proviral DNA. In {{most of the cases}} (5 of 8), provirus also could be detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) population. A kinetic study of JSRV infection in the mediastinal lymphocyte population of newborn lambs inoculated with JSRV found that JSRV proviral DNA could be detected as early as 7 days postinoculation before the onset of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis,</b> although the proviral burden was greatly reduced compared to adult natural cases. This was reflected in the levels found in PBMC since proviral DNA was detected in 2 of 13 animals. At the early time points studied (7 to 28 days postinoculation) no one subset was preferentially infected. These data indicate that JSRV can infect lymphoid and phagocytic mononuclear cells of sheep and that dissemination precedes tumor formation.

Since very little information is available on the biology of JSRV it is important to establish if orf-x is conserved between different virus isolates.

Orf-x was highly conserved in all the exogenous isolates (n= 10) and in most of the endogenous sequences (n= 8). Thus orf-x may be an accessory gene of JSRV and haves a biological function which might be advantageous to JSRV. Phenetic analysis conducted on the complete orf-x nucleotide sequences seems to highlight the presence of three distinct groups statistically well supported by bootstrapping: i) exogenous JSRV sequence from the UK; ii) exogenous JSRV sequences from Southern Europe and iii) the exogenous South African strain plus all the endogenous sequences analyzed and collected from Australia, Italy, UK and South Africa...|$|E

Histopathological examination of lungs noticed a number of conditions or lesions such as chronic interstitial pneumonia (3. 75 %), edema fluid (3. 75 %), broncho-pneumonia (3. 75 %), bronchitis (2. 5 %), bronchiolitis (2. 5 %), pneumonia-congested stage (8. 75 %), hydatid cyst (6. 25 %), fibrinous pneumonia (3. 75 %), healed nodule (7. 5 %), purulent broncho-pneumonia (1. 25 %), fibrino-purulent pneumonia (1. 25 %), subacute fibrinous pneumonia (1. 25 %), <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis</b> (1. 25 %), pleuritis (2. 5 %) and hemosiderosis (3. 75 %). For morphological descriptions, the lesions were categorized into various types; however a single section showed intermixed of various lesions...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{nitrogen}} dioxide inhalation 11 {{has been reported}} to produce signs and lesions typical of field cases of bovine <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis</b> (BPA) as described by MONLUX et al. 9, 10 and SEAT ON^^. Similar lesions have been produced in mice and guinea pig+. These studies were conducted because of the similarities between silo-filler’s disease of man, caused by {{nitrogen dioxide}}, and BPA. Since previous studies involved inadequate numbers of cattle, a more critical evaluation of the effects of nitrogen dioxide was needed. This project was designed to study the clinical and pathologic altera-tions induced in cattle by repeated exposure to nitrogen dioxide gas. Materials and Methods Six Holstein-Friesian heifers (10 - 19 months of age) were used. None had clinical signs or history of respiratory disease. Tracheotomies were performed on 4 animals and a Nalgon * tube was inserted into the trachea of each. Two of these were given commercial nitrogen dioxide gas**, another the gas evolved from the reduction of nitric acid by sheet copper and the last, gas evolved from the reduction of nitric acid by copper elec-trical wire. Different sources of gas were used to determine if impurities were involved in previously reported workll. Gas was administered via the tracheal tubes to 4 animals for a 5 -minute period each day until death occurred or was imminent. They lived for 11 to 25 days after initial exposure. Methemoglobin levels were used to adjust the dosage rates. Starting with small doses, the amount of gas given was gradually increased until the methemoglobin levels, one-half hour after exposure, approached but did not exceed 1 / 3 the total hemoglobin. The average daily dose was 1600 ml, the lowest initial dose being 200 ml and th...|$|E
40|$|The main {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics of}} the subacute spongiform encephalo-pathies are outlined; {{it is suggested that}} the group of diseases covered by the term "subacute spongiform encephalopathies " should be considered as distinct in their properties from other slow infections. The early experimental work in scrapie is briefly reviewed. Biochemical changes in brain that are characteristic of scrapie are summarized. Recent physicochemical studies of the properties of the scrapie agent are considered in relation to the biological nature of the scrapie agent. The repli-cation of the scrapie agent is discussed in terms of viral and membrane hypotheses of scrapie and in the light of recent genetic studies of mouse scapie. The concept of slow infections, which was first introduced by Sigurdsson [1], has been fruitful of much interesting research. However, Sigurdsson's concept was based largely on a study of a limited number of diseases prevalent in his native Iceland, and were he alive today it is probable that he would have wished to modify and extend his main criteria for distinguishing slow infections from acute and chronic disorders. He considered the main characteristics of slow infections to be: (1) an initial long period of incubation of many months or years without overt sign of clinical disease; (2) a rather regular, protracted clinical phase of the disease with serious sequelae, often death; and (3) limitation of infection to a single host species and localization of lesions within a single organ or tissue system. Sigurdsson's list of slow infections included <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis,</b> maedi, visna, and scrapie (rida) of sheep, mam-mary carcinoma and leukemia of mice, avian lymphoblastosis, and the Rous sarcoma. Clearly the third criterion could not be applied to all these This paper was presented at the Ninth Annual Meetin...|$|E
40|$|Jaagsiekte sheep {{retrovirus}} (JSRV) is the {{etiologic agent}} of a contagious bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of sheep known as sheep <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis</b> (SPA; ovine pulmonary carcinoma). JSRV is unique among retroviruses because it transforms the alveolar type II cells and the nonciliated bronchiolar cells (Clara cells) of the lungs; these cells are where JSRV is specifically expressed in both naturally and experimentally SPA-affected sheep. In this study, we investigated the cell specificity of JSRV expression. By transient-transfection assays of 23 different cell lines {{with a reporter}} plasmid driven by the JSRV long terminal repeat (LTR), pJS 21 -luc, {{we found that the}} JSRV LTR is preferentially active in cell lines derived from type II pneumocytes and Clara cells (MLE- 15 and mtCC 1 - 2 mouse cell lines). Reporter assays using progressive 5 ' deletions of pJS 21 -luc allowed us to establish that the JSRV enhancers are able to activate the JSRV proximal promoter in MLE- 15 and mtCC 1 - 2 cells, but they have very low activity in mouse cells of other lineages (e. g., NIH 3 T 3). The JSRV enhancers are able to activate heterologous promoters in both MLE- 15 and 3 T 3 cells, although optimal activity is achieved in MLE- 15 cells only with the homologous JSRV promoter. Thus, JSRV cell-specific LTR activity appears to result from an interaction between the enhancer elements and the JSRV proximal promoter elements. By mutation analysis, we established that an upstream NF-B-like element appears to be responsible for approximately 50 % of the JSRV LTR transcriptional activity in MLE- 15 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed evidence of a factor(s) that binds to this sequence. Antibody supershift experiments indicated that the factor(s) is not related to NF-B component p 50 or p 52. This factor also appeared to be present in cells that do not support a high level of JSRV expression. Finally the JSRV 21 LTR contains putative enhancer binding motifs for transcription factors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF- 3) that are involved in lung-specific gene expression. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that exogenous HNF- 3 is able to enhance the expression of pJS 21 -luc in NIH 3 T 3 cells, which normally show minimal enhancer activity for the JSRV LTR...|$|E
40|$|Sheep <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis</b> (SPA), {{also known}} as {{jaagsiekte}} or ovine pulmonary carcinoma, is a contagious lung cancer of sheep, originating from type II pneumocytes and Clara cells. Previous studies have implicated a type D retrovirus (jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus [JSRV]) as the causative agent of SPA. We recently isolated a proviral clone of JSRV from an animal with a spontaneous case of SPA (JSRV 21) and showed that it harbors an infectious and oncogenic virus. This demonstrated that JSRV is necessary and sufficient to induce SPA. A major impediment in research on JSRV has been {{the lack of an}} in vitro tissue culture system for the virus. The experiments reported here show the first successful in vitro infection with this virus, using the JSRV 21 clone. JSRV 21 virus was obtained by transiently transfecting human 293 T cells with a plasmid containing the JSRV 21 provirus driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. Virus produced in this manner exhibited reverse transcriptase (RT) activity that banded at 1. 15 g/ml in sucrose density gradients. Infection of concentrated JSRV 21 into ovine choroid plexus (CP), testes (OAT-T 3), turbinate (FLT), and intestinal carcinoma (ST 6) cell lines resulted in establishment of infection as measured by PCR amplification. Evidence that this reflected genuine infection included the fact that heat inactivation of the virus eliminated it, the levels of viral DNA increased with passage of the infected cells, and the infected cells released active RT as measured by the sensitive product enhancement RT assay. The RT activity released from the infected cells banded at 1. 15 g/ml, and JSRV 21 provirus was transmitted from infected cells to uninfected ones by cocultivation. However, the amount of virus released from infected cells was low. These results suggest that the JSRV receptor is present on many ovine cell types and that the observed restriction of JSRV expression in vivo to tumor cells might be controlled by factors other than the viral receptor. Finally we tagged the U 3 of pJSRV 21 with the bacterial supF gene, an amber suppressor tRNA gene. The resulting clone, termed pJSRVsupF, is infectious in vitro. It may be a useful tool for future studies on viral DNA integration, since the normal sheep genome contains 15 to 20 copies of highly JSRV-related endogenous sequences that cross-react with many JSRV hybridization probes...|$|E
