40|$|The Higher Order Mode Frequency Shifter (HOMFS) of the ELETTRA-type cavity {{has been}} {{improved}} by designing a plunger {{that can work}} without RF contacts. These were necessary in the original design to isolate the <b>plunger</b> <b>housing</b> from any RF field excited by the cavity fundamental or HOM mode. The used RF contacts have shown good electrical behaviour, but, in case of frequent movement, the internal surface of the cavity port in copper might be scratched due to the strong mechanical force which is applied. The new plunger has a modified profile that attenuates the field penetrating into the cavity <b>plunger</b> <b>housing,</b> therefore avoiding the RF contacts. The design and the power tests on a prototype are described. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{accelerating}} cavity of the ASTRID Electron Syn-chrotron was studied. The cavity is a capacity loaded TEM cavity resonating at 104. 95 MHz. Two plungers driven in parallel keep the cavity in tune, yielding a tuning range of about 0. 8 MHz {{to compensate the}} beam loading. The RF spring contact liners placed on {{the entrance of the}} <b>plunger</b> <b>housing</b> are used to isolate the <b>plunger</b> <b>housing</b> from the RF field. The surface current flowing through the contacts lim-its the power in the cavity to less than 5 kW due to heating. We analyse the electrodynamics of the tuner and investigate two options of a new tuner geometry, one with contacts and one without contacts. The new design should remove the power limitation due to contact problems. ...|$|E
40|$|The variable-pressure washer (VPW) is a {{proposed}} device {{that is so}} named because (1) it would play the role similar to that played by an ordinary washer, except that (2) the clamping pressure applied by it would vary with either circumferential or radial position. In a typical contemplated application, the radially varying clamping pressure {{would be used to}} obtain more nearly uniform compression on a pair of concentric seals (e. g., an O-ring or a gasket) in an assembly that experiences larger deformations normal to the sealing surface for locations around the outer diameter of the attachment flange when compared to locations around the inner diameter. The VPW (see figure) would include two interlocking channel rings pushed axially away from each other by compression spring-like components located at two or more radial positions. Each spring would have a different stiffness based on the radial location. Overlapping splits in each interlocking channel ring would allow for the non-uniform deformation in the rings. Each spring would be held in place by retaining cups attached to the inner flat surfaces of the channel rings. A plunger attached to one channel ring on the central axis would be captured in a <b>plunger</b> <b>housing</b> attached to the other channel ring: The capture of the plunger would hold the VPW together. When the VPW was clamped between two flat surfaces, the clamping force would be distributed unevenly across the face of the washer in the radial direction. The different stiffnesses of the springs would be chosen, in conjunction with other design parameters, to obtain a specified radial variation of clamping pressure {{in the presence of a}} specified clamping force...|$|E
40|$|The plunger of an {{aircraft}} {{was found to}} have fractured by overload. It appears that the fracturing took place during removal of the <b>plunger</b> from the <b>housing.</b> There were no evidences of delayed failure like fatigue, stress corrosion cracking etc. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were responsible for the failure. It is reported that following a seizure, the <b>plunger</b> and the <b>housing</b> surfaces were polished and reassembled before the incidence took place. Hence the evidences causing the seizure of the plunger were lost and {{it was not possible to}} find out the exact cause of failure. However, since scoring marks were observed on both <b>plunger</b> and the <b>housing,</b> there is a possibility that foreign particles got entrapped in the annular space between the plunger and the barrel leading to seizure. This needs to be established to incorporate any remedial measures for prevention of recurrence of similar failure. Probably, the testing of hydraulic oil sample, if collected, would help in this regard...|$|R
40|$|An {{adjustable}} mechanical {{end joint}} system for connecting structural column elements and eliminating {{the possibility of}} free movement between joint halves during loading or vibration has a node joint body having a cylindrical engaging end and a column end body having a cylindrical engaging end. The column end joint body has a compressible preload mechanism and <b>plunger</b> means <b>housed</b> therein. The compressible preload mechanism may be adjusted from {{the exterior of the}} column end joint body through a port...|$|R
40|$|An {{atomizer}} for {{thermal management}} system for efficiently thermally managing {{one or more}} heat producing devices. The atomizer for thermal management system includes a housing having a coolant passage and a dispensing end, an orifice within the dispensing end, and an actuator manipulating a <b>plunger</b> within the <b>housing.</b> The <b>plunger</b> includes a head that is sealable within a recessed portion of the orifice to open or close the orifice. The coolant passes through the coolant passage into the orifice for spraying upon a heat producing device. The actuator may reciprocate so that the coolant spray emitted through the orifice is pulsating. The pulsing frequency may be increased to increase cooling or decreased to decrease cooling of the heat producing device...|$|R
