Without some sort of <b>preference</b> <b>criterion,</b> any two theories that explain a set of examples are equally acceptable. This paper presents a scheme for evaluating alternative inductive theories based on an objective <b>preference</b> <b>criterion.</b> It strives to extract maximal redundancy from examples, transforming structure into randomness. A major strength of the method is its application to learning problems where negative examples of concepts are scarce or unavailable.

40|$|In {{inductive}} logic programming, concept {{formation in}} noisy domains {{can be considered}} as learning from noisy data.

The theory <b>preference</b> <b>criterion</b> is a coding scheme which extends the minimum description length (MDL) principle by unifying model complexity and exception cost.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the prob-lems related to the extensional integration of information sources. In particular, we propose an approach for man-aging inconsistent databases, i. e. databases violating in-tegrity constraints. The presence of inconsistent data can be resolved by “repairing ” the database, i. e. by providing a computational mechanism that ensures obtaining consis-tent “scenarios ” of the information or by consistently an-swer to queries posed on an inconsistent set of data. In this paper we consider preferences among repairs and possible answers by introducing a partial order among them on the base of some <b>preference</b> <b>criteria.</b> More specifically, pref-erences are expressed by considering polynomial functions applied to repairs and returning real numbers. The good-ness of a repair is measured by estimating how much it vio-lates the desiderata conditions and a repair is preferred if it minimizes the value of the polynomial function used to ex-press the <b>preference</b> <b>criteria.</b> The main contribution of this work consists in the proposal of a logic approach for query-ing and repairing inconsistent databases that extends previ-ous works by aallowing to express and manage <b>preference</b> <b>criteria.</b> The approach here proposed allows to express re-liability on the information sources and is also suitable for expressing decision and optimization problems. The intro-duction of <b>preference</b> <b>criteria</b> strongly reduces the number of feasible repairs and answers; for special classes of con-straints and functions it gives a unique repair and answer.

The case of a group decision maker is analyzed in depth, and a methodology for obtaining a group disutility function is proposed.
