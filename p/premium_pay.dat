40|$|Propensity score {{matching}} is used {{to estimate}} {{the size of the}} public sector <b>pay</b> <b>premium</b> in four countries. Three sets of matching covariates are used; worker characteristics only, then including job attributes and finally adding union membership. When worker characteristics and job attributes are controlled for, the public sector <b>pay</b> <b>premium</b> ranges from 30 % in Canada to 19 - 20 % in Australia and Great Britain and only 6 % in the United States. Differences in job attributes between private sector and public sector workers make almost no difference to the estimated <b>pay</b> <b>premium.</b> But once differences in union membership across sectors are controlled for, the estimated public sector <b>pay</b> <b>premium</b> is reduced in all countries and disappears in Canada. This finding favors the hypothesis that the <b>pay</b> <b>premium</b> partially reflects rents accruing to public sector workers, obtained most probably with assistance from the actions of their labor unions.
