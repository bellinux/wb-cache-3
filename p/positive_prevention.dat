40|$|Over 40, 000 {{people are}} now living with {{diagnosed}} HIV in the UK. The term 'positive prevention' has been coined to describe HIV prevention that focuses on people living with an HIV diagnosis. There is uncertainty, however, about how people with HIV manage risk and how their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV is linked to their mental health and social circumstances. We analysed 44 individual and three group interviews with the people most affected by HIV in the UK: black African heterosexual {{men and women and}} gay men (mostly white). We found that participants had similar as well as contextually different needs when it came to negotiating safe sex, assimilating prevention knowledge. The themes that emerged included taking 'additional responsibility' for partners, negotiating with partners who are willing to have unprotected (anal or vaginal) sex, links with mental health, constructing the moral 'other' and power differences.

40|$|Few <b>Positive</b> <b>Prevention</b> {{interventions}} {{have been}} implemented in Africa; however, greater attention is now being paid to interventions that include messages of personal responsibility or altruism that may motivate HIV-infected individuals towards HIV prevention behaviors in Africa. We conducted 47 in-depth interviews in 2004 with HIV-infected men and women purposefully sampled to represent a range of sexual activities among clients of an AIDS support organization in Uganda. Qualitative interviews were selected from a cross-sectional survey of 1092 HIV-infected men and women. Clients were interviewed about their concerns around sexual HIV transmission, feelings of responsibility and reasons for these feelings, as well as about the challenges and consequences of actions to prevent HIV transmission. The reasons they provided for their sense of prevention responsibility revolved around ethical and practical themes. Responsibility toward sexual partners {{was linked to the}} belief that conscious transmission of HIV equals murder, would cause physical and emotional harm, and would leave children orphaned. The primary reason specific to preventing HIV transmission to unborn children was the perception that they are 'innocent'. Most participants felt that HIV-infected individuals held a greater responsibility for preventing HIV transmission than did HIV-uninfected individuals. Respondents reported that their sense of responsibility lead them to reduce HIV transmission risk, encourage partner testing, disclose HIV test results, and assume an HIV/AIDS educator role. Challenges to HIV preventive behavior and altruistic intentions included: sexual desire; inconsistent condom use, especially in long term relationships; myths around condom use; fear of disclosure; gender-power dynamics; and social and financial pressure. Our finding that altruism {{played an important role in}} motivating preventive behaviors among HIV-infected persons in Uganda supports the inclusion of altruistic prevention and counseling messages within <b>Positive</b> <b>Prevention</b> interventions.

A hospital-based survey of (n= 292) PL WHA in Tamil Nadu, using both quantitative and qualitative teclmiques, {{was the first of}} its kind to be conducted in India in 1999. The study represents a contribution to knowledge, being one of very few studies ofPLWHA in India. The main sources of reported HIV knowledge among PL WHA were discussions with peers, community members, other hospital patients, and friends, for both men and women (80 % and 79 %, respectively). Latent class analysis of correct knowledge showed that 76 % of respondents had high knowledge of sex-related transmission and 86 % had high knowledge of blood-related transmission. Education was an important predictor of lmowledge for women. Contrary to socio-cultural norms, ever-married male respondents repOlied relatively high levels of premarital sex (80 %) and extra marital sex (49 %). This study examined reported behaviour changes post-diagnosis with a <b>positive</b> <b>prevention</b> focus, including condom use. A large majority ofPLWHA had heard about condoms (94 % men, 81 % women) and their use as a prophylaxis for HIV/AIDS. However, only 35 % of men (excluding high-risk occupation groups) reported ever-use of condoms. Qualitative evidence revealed that reported consistent condom use did not, in fact, mean every single time they had sex. Culture was intricately interwoven with attitudes and behaviours reported by PL WHA and experiential knowledge influenced attitudes towards possible behaviour change.

40|$|Despite widely {{acknowledged}} WHO {{guidelines for the}} integration of TB and HIV services, heavily burdened countries {{have been slow to}} implement these and thus significant missed opportunities have arisen. The individual-centred, rights-based paradigm of the SA National AIDS Policy, remains dissonant with the compelling public-health approach of TB control. The existence of independent and disconnected TB and HIV services results in a wastage of scarce health resources, an increased burden on patients' time and finances, and ignores evidence of patients' preference for an integrated service. The current situation translates into a web of unacceptable, ongoing missed opportunities such as failure to maximize collaborative disease surveillance, VCT, adherence support, infection control, and <b>positive</b> <b>prevention.</b> TB services present a readily identifiable cohort for HIV provider-initiated testing. Integrating HAART and DOTS will promote efficient usage of health workers' time and a more navigable experience for patients, ultimately ensuring increased TB treatment completion rates and MDR-TB prevention. As direct observation evolves into a more supportive, empowering experience for patients, adherence to both TB drugs and HAART will be bolstered. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the transmission of TB within HIV services. Low cost infection control interventions include: triaging patients, scheduling new and follow-up patients separately; well-ventilated, sheltered waiting rooms; and the use of personal respirators by patients and staff. A more patient-centred approach to TB care may be able to recruit the active participation of TB patients in <b>positive</b> <b>prevention</b> efforts, including maximizing personal infection control, limiting exposure of social contacts to TB during the intensive phase of treatment, advocating isoniazid prophylaxis within the home and patient-centred education efforts to reduce overall transmission. Several model programmes demonstrated synergy, in which the impact of the "whole" or integrated response was greater than the sum of the non-integrated parts. The full potential of an integrated TB-HIV service has not been fully harvested. Missed opportunities discount existing efforts in both programmes, will perpetuate the burden of disease, and prevent major gains in future interventions.
