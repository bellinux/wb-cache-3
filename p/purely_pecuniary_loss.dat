A person who has wrongfully caused the death of another shall also be bound to make compensation for the injury to any person incurring the medical expenses, increasing the need in living, or incurring the funeral expenses. If the deceased was statutorily bound to furnish maintenance to a third party, the tortfeasor shall also make compensation to such third party for any injury arising therefrom.

A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals. A person, who violates a statutory provision enacted {{for the protection of}} others and therefore prejudice to others, is bound to compensate for the injury, except no negligence in his act can be proved. If several persons have wrongfully damaged the rights of another jointly, they are jointly liable for the injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied even if which one has actually caused the injury cannot be sure. Instigators and accomplices are deemed to be joint tortfeasors.|$|E

40|$|Data {{breaches}} are {{pervasive and}} costly. Recent civil data breach cases have {{centered on the}} consumer credit card payment chain in the retail industry. An important issue in such cases is whether the economic loss doctrine should bar negligence claims for <b>purely</b> <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> suffered by a non-negligent party, such as an issuing bank or a federal credit union that must incur costs to reimburse cardholders for the fraudulent use of stolen card numbers. The economic loss doctrine should not bar these claims. Large-scale data networks, such as consumer credit card networks, often entail significant network externalities. These include externalities relating to market concentration {{as well as to}} the “weakest link” nature of security in these networks. Although the primary players in these networks are tied together in a complex web of contractual relationships, there are significant transaction costs involved with any effort to change or monitor another party’s security measures. Moreover, “outside” entities such as third-party payment processors, which are not in contractual privity with all other parties in the network, have become ubiquitous. Under these circumstances, a negligence rule should help improve cybersecurity hygiene and promote a more robust cyber risk insurance market...|$|R
40|$|Corporate limited {{liability}} laws (CLL) [the corporate veil (tCV) ] {{is a major}} obstacle for implementation of UN and other covenants’ prevention and jurisprudence ex ante and ex post facto Corporate Human Rights Violations (CHRV) and International Corporate Crime (ICrC). I. d. aggregates the inability of States and International Bodies to farther establish unified e. g., Lex Non Scripta common law with adjudicative and prescriptive jurisdiction and to apply the Lex Scripta civil and criminal laws to reduce infringements {{of the human rights}} and impunity in cases of corporate violations and criminal acts. In this paper is argued that the change from Corporate Limited Liability (referred to as tCV) to Corporate Unlimited Liability (referred as PtCV) laws and thus criminalizing and adjudicating breaches of HR covenants and civil and criminal laws by corporate individuals, at prima facie should have a substantial preventative and sanctioning affect on reducing such CHRV and ICrC. I. d., the unambiguous correlation between CHRV and ICrC, (which in many occasions includes Human Trafficking, Slavery, Sex Trade, Child Labor, ext), which are accelerated by the 2001 - 2007 Recessions through expanding global poverty and inequality. Piercing the Corporate Veil (PtCV) and Enhancing Business & Contract Laws (eBCL) would raise the market security thus needed to establish fair market competition benefiting Small and Medium Enterprises and Investors, which have become major global employers: action that would have a general positive market effect. Id. Anyway with the current judicial practice, in most cases where there are grave personal injuries the court is willing to impute negligence to the parent company – especially where the subsidiary is thinly capitalized or appears to have been formed precisely to avoid liability. In contrast, courts are extremely reluctant to pierce the corporate veil in cases of <b>purely</b> <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses,</b> namely where the creditors of a bankrupt corporation seek to reach the personal assets of the shareholders of the corporation. Eric Engle (2006). This is for the obvious reason that general financial liability of shareholders for all debts of a corporation would discourage investment in stocks with deleterious economic consequences. See, e. g. Krivo Indus. Supply Co. v. National Distillers & Chem. Corp., 483 F. 2 d 1098, 1102 (5 th Cir. 1973) ...|$|R
40|$|Non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> can be {{characterized}} as losses that are suffered by damaging goods or interests which have in themselves no economic price or value on a financial market. Examples are damage to goods with a primarily sentimental value, such as an album of wedding photos, pain and suffering as a result of physical injury, damage to personal reputation, or even the death of a person. Due to the fact that these goods or interests have no substantial or direct market value, non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> are often characterized as losses that cannot be undone with money. Rogers (2001, p. 246) defines non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> as “losses which are not damage to a person’s assets or wealth or income and which is are therefore incapable of being quantified in objective financial manner by reference to a market”. Tort law, however, generally recognizes non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> to some extent as losses that should be compensated with money...|$|R

40|$|In 1967, a {{helicopter}} carrying three passengers and a pilot returning from an offshore drilling platform {{crashed into the}} Gulf of Mexico beyond Louisiana 2 ̆ 7 s territorial waters, killing all aboard. The families of the decedents instituted a wrongful death suit in admiralty, seeking recovery under general maritime law, the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), and the Jones Act. The federal district court found Mobil Oil Corporation, the owner and operator of the helicopter, negligent. In awarding damages the district court limited recovery to <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses,</b> holding that a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> limitation applied regardless {{of the theory of}} recovery. Specifically, the court denied plaintiffs recovery for loss of society damages. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that under recent Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit decisions, beneficiaries of a decedent wrongfully killed on the high seas could recover loss of society damages under general maritime law despite the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> limitation of DOHSA. Because of conflicting decisions in the circuit courts of appeals regarding the precise limits of the cause of action and remedies for wrongful death under general maritime law, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and, reversing the court of appeals, held in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham that nonpecuniary damages could not supplement DOHSA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> limitation; thus, the Court reinstated the district court 2 ̆ 7 s holding and denied recovery for loss of society damages. Consequently, DOHSA now provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful deaths occurring on the high seas. By so holding, however, the Court ignored the legislative history of DOHSA, which does not mandate this result. Moreover, Higginbotham not only restores various anomalies to maritime wrongful death actions that earlier decisions sought to eliminate, but also contravenes the humane policies of admiralty law. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision, therefore, retreats from the modem trend toward fashioning a uniform cause of action and remedy for maritime wrongful deaths and creates further confusion in maritime law...|$|R
