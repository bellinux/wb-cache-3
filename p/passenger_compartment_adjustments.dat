40|$|Good {{ventilation}} {{system in a}} bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> is important for providing clean, healthy air and comfortable micro-environment for passengers. Lack of fresh air inside the bus compartment could increase the contaminant concentration level and affect the passenger's health. This research presents field measurement on contaminant concentration level of particulate matter and carbon monoxide inside the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> of a university's shuttle bus. The field measurements were conducted at the front, middle and rear locations of the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> Computational fluid dynamics software was used to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of the bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> Two cases of air return grilles location namely three air return grilles and four air return grilles were performed. The results show that four air return grilles could reduce the contaminant concentration levels of CO and PM 1 inside the bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment...</b>|$|R
50|$|An early car {{built for}} {{comfortable}} transportation {{was likely to}} have an enclosed <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> at the rear for the owner and his guests while the driver sat in front either in the open (in a brougham or a coupé de ville) or under an extension of the roof of the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> (in a limousine). In some versions, the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> would have a folding roof; these cars were called landaulets.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} temperature field inside a <b>passenger's</b> <b>compartment</b> of a Proton Wira saloon car using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The main goal is to investigate the effects of different glazing types applied onto {{the front and rear}} windscreens of the car on the distribution of air-temperature inside the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> in the steady-state conditions. The air-flow condition in the <b>passenger's</b> <b>compartment</b> is also investigated. Fluent CFD software was used to develop a three-dimensional symmetrical model of the <b>passenger's</b> <b>compartment.</b> Simplified representations of the driver and one rear passenger were incorporated into the CFD model of the <b>passenger's</b> <b>compartment.</b> Two types of glazing were considered namely clear insulated laminated tint (CIL) with a shading coefficient of 0. 78 and green insulated laminate tint (GIL) with a shading coefficient of 0. 5. Results of the CFD analysis were compared with those obtained when the windscreens are made up of clear glass having a shading coefficient of 0. 86. Results of the CFD analysis show that for a given glazing material, the temperature of the air around the driver is slightly lower than the air around the rear passenger. Also, the use of GIL glazing material on both the front and rear windscreens significantly reduces the air temperature inside the <b>passenger's</b> <b>compartment</b> of the car. This contributes to a better thermal comfort condition to the occupants. Swirling air flow condition occurs in the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> The air-flow intensity and velocity are higher along the side wall of the <b>passenger's</b> <b>compartment</b> compared to that along the middle section of the compartment. It was also found that the use of glazing materials on both the front and rear windscreen has no significant effects on the air-flow condition inside the <b>passenger's</b> <b>compartment</b> of the car...|$|R

It also puts the sound {{where it will be}} useful. Studies in some agencies operating emergency vehicles show sound levels over 120dB(A) in the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> In one study, a specific vehicle's engine sounds and the siren produced sound levels over 123dB(A) in the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|R
40|$|Good {{ventilation}} {{system in a}} bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> is important for providing clean, healthy air and comfortable micro-environment for the passengers. Lack of fresh inside the bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> due to poor {{ventilation system}} could increase the contaminants concentration which could affect the passenger’s health. This research reports findings of field measurement on the contaminants concentration of particulate matter (PM 1) and carbon monoxide (CO) inside the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> of a university’s shuttle bus. The field measurements were conducted at the front, middle and rear locations of the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> Measurements of PM 1 and CO were done continuously in the morning, afternoon and evening. A CFD software was employed to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of the bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> Velocity and temperature boundary conditions were prescribed at the air supply diffusers, {{based on the measured}} data. Meanwhile, the contaminants concentration was prescribed at the door. Flow analysis was carried out using RNG k-? turbulent model for air flow, discrete phase and species transport for contaminants. Four cases of air supply diffuser locations namely mixing ventilations (MV 3 and MV 4), mixing ventilation with displacement ventilation (MV 2 +DV) and mixing ventilation with underfloor air distribution (MV 2 +UFAD) were examined. Two cases of air return grille locations namely three air return grilles (3 RG) and four air return grilles (4 RG) were also examined in this research. It was found from the field measurement that the contaminants concentration of PM 1 and CO were high at the front location of the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> This is due to insufficient ventilation inside the bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> Result of the CFD simulation shows that the MV 2 +DV, MV 2 +UFAD and 4 RG of air supply diffuser and air return grille locations could reduce the contaminants concentration of CO and PM 1 in the occupied zone inside the bus <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment...</b>|$|R
