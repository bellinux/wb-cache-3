5000|$|Curb cuts or {{sidewalk}} ramps, {{essential for}} people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example. Color-contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another. There are also cabinets with <b>pull-out</b> <b>shelves,</b> kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's public transit systems, low-floor buses that [...] "kneel" [...] (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts.|$|E
5000|$|For boys, the Johnny Lightning and Johnny Seven O.M.A toys {{were the}} most popular; for girls, the Dawn Doll. Deluxe Reading dolls were sold in the 1950s - 1970s through {{supermarkets}} and are {{often referred to as}} Grocery Store Dolls. They were an inexpensive alternative to department store dolls, although of similar quality. Another successful toy for girls was the [...] "Dream Kitchen" [...] (circa 1961) which consisted of four 12-inch-tall colorful kitchen appliances, a kitchen table and four chairs. This toy was unique in that the sink worked with water, the oven contained batteries which revolved a plastic turkey on a spit inside the oven, the refrigerator had <b>pull-out</b> <b>shelves,</b> and the dishwasher also worked with water. Also included were scores of food boxes, cleaning supplies, food replica items, plates, utensils and more. The box proclaimed that it held [...] "176 pieces." [...] The size of the set perfectly matched the size of Barbie, a toy doll which was wildly popular at that time. As of 2014, this kitchen toy set can be seen on sale (used) for up to $400.|$|E
5000|$|Kitchens today. Modern kitchen {{design has}} {{improved}} {{partly as a}} result of ergonomic research. Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, <b>pull-out</b> <b>shelves</b> to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of sink cabinets, pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, lazy susans in corner cabinets, vertical storage for cookie sheets, full-extension drawer slides, and drawers and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), reface existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular. As homes in Western countries became more airtight to save on heating and cooling costs, air quality has sometimes suffered as gases which are released from resins as they cure. Resins, organic materials which convert from liquid to solid form, are used to manufacture engineered wood (e.g., particleboard) frequently used to build kitchen cabinet carcases can be a factor.

5000|$|In most instances, the top [...] "5th drawer" [...] of a five-drawer {{lateral file}} is a flipper door with <b>pull-out</b> <b>shelf,</b> {{as most people}} {{would not be able}} to access the top of a drawer at this height.|$|R
50|$|A {{roll-out}} shelf, {{also known}} as a glide-out <b>shelf,</b> <b>pull-out</b> <b>shelf</b> or slide-out shelf is a shelf that can be moved forward on slides in order to more easily reach the contents stored {{in the back of a}} cupboard or cabinet. The slide mechanism can also be found in modern chests of drawers. Cabinet makers have been installing roll-out shelves for over 50 years.|$|R
