There was no clear view on the relationship between carbolic acid and creosote; Runge described it as having similar caustic and antiseptic properties, but noted that it was different, in that it was an acid and formed salts. Nonetheless, Reichenbach argued that creosote was also the active element, as it was in <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>acid.</b> Despite evidence to the contrary, his view held sway with most chemists, and it became commonly accepted wisdom that creosote, carbolic acid, and phenylhydrate were identical substances, with different degrees of purity.|$|E
25|$|Creosote {{was first}} {{discovered}} in its wood-tar form in 1832, by Carl Reichenbach, {{when he found}} it both in the tar and in pyroligneous acids obtained by a dry distillation of beechwood. Because <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>acid</b> was known as an antiseptic and meat preservative, Reichenbach conducted experiments by dipping meat in a diluted solution of distilled creosote. He found that the meat was dried without undergoing putrefaction and had attained a smoky flavor. This led him to reason that creosote was the antiseptic component contained in smoke, and he further argued that the creosote he had found in wood tar was also in coal tar, as well as amber tar and animal tar, in the same abundance as in wood tar.|$|E
25|$|Given this history, and the {{antiseptic}} properties {{known to}} creosote, it became popular among physicians in the 19th century. A dilution of creosote in water {{was sold in}} pharmacies as Aqua creosoti, {{as suggested by the}} previous use of <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>acid.</b> It was prescribed to quell the irritability of the stomach and bowels and detoxify, treat ulcers and abscesses, neutralize bad odors, and stimulate the mucous tissues of the mouth and throat. Creosote in general was listed as an irritant, styptic, antiseptic, narcotic, and diuretic, and in small doses when taken internally as a sedative and anaesthetic. It was used to treat ulcers, and as a way to sterilize the tooth and deaden the pain in case of a tooth-ache.|$|E
25|$|The Pharmacopeé of Lyons, {{published}} in 1786, says that cedar tree oil can induce vomiting, and suggests it helps medicate tumors and ulcers.

Tar water had been used as a folk remedy since the Middle Ages to treat affections like dyspepsia. Bishop Berkeley wrote several works on the medical virtues of tar water, including a philosophical work in 1744 titled Siris: a chain of philosophical reflexions and inquiries concerning the virtues of tar water, and divers other subjects connected together and arising one from another, and a poem where he praised its virtues. <b>Pyroligneous</b> <b>acid</b> was also used at the time in a medicinal water called Aqua Binelli.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after it}} was {{discovered}} and recognized as the principle of meat smoking, wood-tar creosote became used {{as a replacement for}} the process. Several methods were used to apply the creosote. One was to dip the meat in <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>acid</b> or a water of diluted creosote, as Reichenbach did, or brush it over with them, and within one hour the meat would have the same quality of that of traditionally smoked preparations. Sometimes the creosote was diluted in vinegar rather than water, as vinegar was also used as a preservative. Another was to place the meat in a closed box, and place with it a few drops of creosote in a small bottle. Because of the volatility of the creosote, the atmosphere was filled with a vapour containing it, and it would cover the flesh.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum.

50|$|Historically, all <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>acid</b> products, Wright’s {{product and}} many other condensates have been made as {{byproducts}} of charcoal manufacturing which was of greater value.

It was in 1959 that the era of modern condensed smoke based products began with the establishment of Red Arrow Products Company in Manitowoc Wisconsin. The important distinction marking this era from the past is the production of modern condensates to be used industrially as a replacement for smoking food directly with non-condensed smoke. Today there are many manufacturing locations around the world, most of which pyrolyze wood primarily to generate condensates which are further processed to make hundreds of derivative products. These are now referred to less so as liquid smoke products rather as smoke flavourings, smoke flavors, and natural condensed smokes.|$|E

5000|$|Pyrolysis or thermal {{decomposition}} of wood {{in a low}} oxygen manner originated prehistorically to produce charcoal.

Pliny the Elder recorded in one of his ten volumes of Natural History the use of wood vinegar as an embalming agent, declaring it superior to other treatments he used.

5000|$|Through the Dublin Whiskey Distillery Company, Brannick was {{a founder}} and {{operator}} of the subsidiary Jones Road Distillery, established by {{a consortium of}} seven businessmen. Construction began in July 1872, and by July 1873 mashing had commenced. It {{was one of the}} six great Irish whiskey distilleries of Dublin city visited and documented by Alfred Barnard in 1886 for his seminal 1887 publication [...] "The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom". It was located {{on the north side of}} the city on the banks of the river Tolka, approximately a mile north of the city center. The Irish whiskey produced there was sold under the brand name D.W.D., with the first mash being produced in July 1873. Barnard reported that it was equipped with some of the best and most modern distilling equipment available at that time, and had a capacity of 800,000 gallons per annum. Early in his tenure at this company, Brannick married Mary Hayes, on January 26, 1873.

5000|$|In {{the common}} {{practice}} of charcoal burning using internal heating of the charged wood by burning {{a part of}} it, all the by-product vapors and gas escapes into the atmosphere as smoke. The by-products can be recovered by passing the off-gases {{through a series of}} water to yield so-called wood vinegar (<b>pyroligneous</b> <b>acid)</b> and the non-condensible wood gas passes on through the condenser and may be burned to provide heat. The wood gas is only usable as fuel and consists typically of 17% methane; 2% hydrogen; 23% carbon monoxide; 38% carbon dioxide; 2% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. It has a gas calorific value of about 10.8 MJoules per m3 (290 BTU/cu.ft.) i.e. about one third the value of natural gas. When deciduous tree woods are subjected to distillation, the products are methanol (wood alcohol) and charcoal. The distillation of pine wood causes Pine tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. Birch tar from birch bark is a particularly fine tar, known as [...] "Russian oil", suitable for leather protection. The by-products of wood tar are turpentine and charcoal.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of liquid smoke to food {{has grown to}} encompass {{a wide variety of}} methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. By far the widest use of liquid smoke is for the purpose of replacing direct smoking of food with onsite-generated smoke from wood. To impart the desired functional effects of smoke, liquid smoke preparations must be applied topically. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are the functionalities that can only be obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing liquid smoke followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright’s liquid smoke and <b>pyroligneous</b> <b>acid</b> precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization. It remains the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved and direct applications of solutions of liquid smoke via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines have grown to be the largest type of application method. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of liquid smoke for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Also noteworthy is the method of topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings. Meat products are subsequently stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another important means of imparting smoke flavor. It is used when other technical functions of smoke are not imperative to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods or injecting whole muscle meat. Incorporation into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings and compounding with other flavors are other important ways in which the flavors are used. Further utility of aqueous smoke solutions is gained by the use of more complex food-grade processing such as extraction into oil, spray drying using maltodextrin carriers, or plating onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt.|$|E
