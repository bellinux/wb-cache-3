40|$|Abstract Background- The aim of {{the study}} was to develop quality {{indicators}} that can be used for quality assessment of registries of occupational diseases in relation to <b>preventive</b> <b>policy</b> on a national level. The research questions were: 1. Which indicators determine the quality of national registries of occupational diseases with respect to their ability to provide appropriate information for <b>preventive</b> <b>policy?</b> 2. What are the criteria that can distinguish low quality from high quality? Methods- First, we performed a literature search to assess which output of registries can be considered appropriate for <b>preventive</b> <b>policy</b> and to develop a set of preliminary indicators and criteria. Second, final indicators and criteria were assessed and their content validity was tested in a Delphi study, for which experts from the 25 EU Member States were invited. Results- The literature search revealed two different types of information output to be appropriate for preventive policy: monitor and alert information. For the evaluation of the quality of the monitor and alert function we developed ten indicators and criteria. Sixteen of the twenty-five experts responded in the first round of the Delphi study, and eleven in the second round. Based on their comments, we assessed the final nine indicators: the completeness of the notification form, coverage of registration, guidelines or criteria for notification, education and training of reporting physicians, completeness of registration, statistical methods used, investigation of special cases, presentation of monitor information, and presentation of alert information. Except for the indicator "coverage of registration" for the alert function, all the indicators met the preset requirements of content validity. Conclusion- We have developed quality indicators and criteria to evaluate registries for occupational diseases on the ability to provide appropriate information for <b>preventive</b> <b>policy</b> on a national level. Together, these indicators form a tool which can be used for quality improvement of registries of occupational diseases. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{procedure}} of on-line process control by attributes, known as Taguchi`s on-line process control, consists of inspecting the mth item (a single item) at every m produced items and deciding, at each inspection, whether {{the fraction of}} conforming items was reduced or not. If the inspected item is nonconforming, the production is stopped for adjustment. As the inspection system can be subject to diagnosis errors, one develops a probabilistic model that classifies repeatedly the examined item until a conforming or b non-conforming classification is observed. The first event that occurs (a conforming classifications or b non-conforming classifications) determines the final classification of the examined item. Proprieties of an ergodic Markov chain were used to get the expression of average cost {{of the system of}} control, which can be optimized by three parameters: the sampling interval of the inspections (m); the number of repeated conforming classifications (a); and the number of repeated non-conforming classifications (b). The optimum design is compared with two alternative approaches: the first one consists of a simple <b>preventive</b> <b>policy.</b> The production system is adjusted at every n produced items (no inspection is performed). The second classifies the examined item repeatedly r (fixed) times and considers it conforming if most classification results are conforming. Results indicate that the current proposal performs better than the procedure that fixes the number of repeated classifications and classifies the examined item as conforming if most classifications were conforming. On the other hand, the <b>preventive</b> <b>policy</b> can be averagely the most economical alternative rather than those ones that require inspection depending on the degree of errors and costs.

40|$|Capital assets, such as {{manufacturing}} equipment, require maintenance {{to remain}} functioning. Maintenance {{can be performed}} when a component breaks down and needs replacement (i. e., corrective maintenance), or the maintenance and part replacement can be performed preventively. Preventive maintenance can be planned on a periodic basis (periodic maintenance), {{or it can be}} triggered by a certain monitored condition (condition-based maintenance). <b>Preventive</b> maintenance <b>policies</b> are gaining traction in the business world, but for many companies it is unclear what their impact is on the resulting inventory requirements for the spare parts that are used for the maintenance interventions. For a setting that is realistic at an OEM in the compressed air industry with whom we collaborate, we study the impact of the maintenance policy on the inventory requirements and the corresponding costs. <b>Preventive</b> <b>policies</b> increase the total demand for spare parts compared to corrective maintenance, since the former do not exploit the entire useful life of the components. This leads to higher inventory requirements. At the same time, the <b>preventive</b> <b>policies</b> inhibit advance demand information, as the interventions, and correspondingly the spare parts demands, are planned in advance. Using a simulation study, we show that by using this advance demand information in managing the spare part inventory, the increase in inventory requirements of <b>preventive</b> maintenance <b>policies</b> can to a large extent be offset; for condition-based maintenance, we find that inventories can even be lower compared to corrective maintenance, provided that the advance demand information is used correctly when managing inventories. For the OEM with whom we work, our analysis sheds light on the behaviour of the inventory related costs under various maintenance policies. nrpages: 22 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In the literature, {{the study}} of <b>preventive</b> {{maintenance}} <b>policies</b> has been largely focused on ergodic analysis where the expected economic performance measure per unit time would be optimized in a long run. When the planning horizon τ is not large, however, the optimal <b>preventive</b> maintenance <b>policy</b> in [0, τ] could be significantly different from that under ergodicity. In this paper, the classical semi-Markov model of Makabe [6] is first examined thoroughly at ergodicity, yielding many new results. Then, through the dynamic analysis of the semi-Markov model, the asymptotic expansion of the expected reward in [0, τ] is obtained explicitly in an affine form. The optimal <b>preventive</b> maintenance <b>policies</b> in [0, τ] are then compared with the ergodic counterparts, thereby demonstrating danger of exclusive reliance on ergodic analysis when τ is not sufficiently large...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} which factors drive the formation of policy preferences when there are remaining uncertainties about the causes and effects of the problem at stake. To answer this question we examine policy preferences reducing aquatic micropollutants, a specific case of water protection policy and different actor groups (e. g. state, science, target groups). Here, we contrast two types of <b>policy</b> preferences: a) <b>preventive</b> or source-directed <b>policies,</b> which mitigate pollution {{in order to avoid}} contact with water; and b) reactive or end-of-pipe policies, which filter water already contaminated by pollutants. In a second step, we analyze the drivers for actors’ policy preferences by focusing on three sets of explanations, i. e. participation, affectedness and international collaborations. The analysis of our survey data, qualitative interviews and regression analysis of the Swiss political elite show that participation in the policy-making process leads to knowledge exchange and reduces uncertainties about the policy problem, which promotes preferences for <b>preventive</b> <b>policies.</b> Likewise, actors who are affected by the consequences of micropollutants, such as consumer or environmental associations, opt for anticipatory policies. Interestingly, we find that uncertainties about the effectiveness of <b>preventive</b> <b>policies</b> can promote preferences for end-of-pipe <b>policies.</b> While <b>preventive</b> measures often rely on (uncertain) behavioral changes of target groups, reactive policies are more reliable when it comes to fulfilling defined policy goals.

Background In Europe {{important}} differences exist concerning policies {{for the prevention}} of common diseases. In most cases these cannot be explained by the underlying epidemiology. However, successful policies should have a measurable effect on disease epidemiology. There has been little research comparing the effect of national <b>preventive</b> <b>policies</b> on disease-specific mortality. Objectives To describe the mortality trends for three health problems representing the three levels of prevention in Germany and in selected European countries, which are of interest for the disease under question. To relate epidemiological trends to <b>preventive</b> <b>policies</b> at the national level and {{at the level of the}} European Union (EU). Methods Comparison of age-standardized mortality rates for road traffic accidents, cervical cancer and diabetes mellitus in the period 1970 – 2002, using routine data. Analysis of disease-specific prevention policies in countries that deviate from the general trend in the EU, with a special focus on developments in Germany. Results The development of mortality rates during the last 30 years for road traffic accidents, cervical cancer and diabetes mellitus varied substantially across Europe. Although the evidence linking specific public policies to epidemiological trends is sparse and often limited to ecological studies, a number of epidemiological changes can be plausibly linked to specific policies in the countries concerned. Conclusion Successful <b>preventive</b> <b>policies</b> exist for all health problems reviewed. The current status of implementation of these policies can only be interpreted in the historical and political context of the countries concerned. The role of epidemiology to guide health policy decisions is under-utilized, as is the regulatory framework for disease and injury prevention at the level of the EU. Less formal policy measures such as European clinical guidelines are equally scarce. More rigorous comparative health services research is needed to formulate evidence-based policies for disease prevention. Christian A. Gericke and Reinhard Buss...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tests the}} rationalist and intuitionist sequences for forming moral judgments {{about people in}} media, proposed by Lee and Shapiro (2014), and applies those sequences to explaining processes whereby news stories about alcoholrelated crimes influence readers' support for two types of policies: punitive policies aiming to punish perpetrators and <b>preventive</b> <b>policies</b> aiming to prevent alcoholrelated crimes. Following the rationalist sequence, Study 1 tested the role of intentionality. In an experiment, participants were randomly assigned either to the intentional condition (an owner of a liquor shop sold an alcohol beverage to an underage minor intentionally) or to the unintentional condition (the owner sold the beverage unintentionally). Participants blamed and disliked the owner in the intentional condition {{more than in the}} unintentional condition and the increased blame judgment was associated with disliking of the owner and with participants' increased support for both punitive and <b>preventive</b> <b>policies.</b> Study 2, following the intuitionist sequence, tested the role of affective dispositions (i. e., liking or disliking) toward a perpetrator and a victim of a car accident caused by drunk driving. The results supported hypotheses driven by the intuitionist sequence in several ways. First, when the perpetrator was a liked administrator, participants blamed the perpetrator less than when the perpetrator was a disliked administrator. Second, when the perpetrator was a liked administrator, a liked coach victim led participants to blame the perpetrator more than a disliked coach victim; however, no effect of victim was found when the perpetrator was a disliked administrator. Third, when participants were asked about their alcohol use {{at the beginning of the}} study, they supported <b>preventive</b> <b>policies</b> more when the perpetrator was a liked administrator than when the perpetrator was a disliked one.
