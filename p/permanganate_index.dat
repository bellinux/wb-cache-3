40|$|Abstract The {{quality of}} {{drinking}} water {{is an issue of}} primary interest for the residents of the European Union. Water is essential to sustain life, and a satisfactory supply must be made available to consumers. Failure to provide effective treatment of water sources and safe distribution of treated drinking water can expose the community to the risk of outbreaks of diseases or other adverse heath effects. The paper aims to emphasize the actual sources of water supply in Constanta town, the applied treatments according to their quality and the water treatment processes performances obtained in 2009. All the studied quality parameters (turbidity, pH, ammonium, nitrites, nitrates, free residual chlorine, chlorides, <b>permanganate</b> <b>indices,</b> total hardness, total dry residues, sulfates, conductivity) have been maintained in the accepted limits.

40|$|Water quality {{safety is}} of {{critical}} importance in environmental improvement, {{particularly with respect to}} drinking water resources worldwide. As the main drinking water sources in Shenzhen, China, the cascade reservoirs comprising the Shiyan, Tiegang, and Xili Reservoirs are highly regulated and have experienced water quality deterioration in recent years. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was established using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) for the cascade reservoirs. The relationships between water quality and improvement measures were quantified and the main pollution sources for individual reservoirs were identified. Results showed that the hydrodynamic and water quality model well captured the spatial and temporal variations of water level, the <b>permanganate</b> concentration <b>index</b> (CODMn), and total nitrogen (TN), with high resolution in the cascade reservoirs. The correlation coefficients between simulations and observations were close to 1. 00 for water levels, and over 0. 50 for CODMn and TN concentrations. The most effective methods for water quality improvement were the reduction of the runoff load for TN and transferred water load for CODMn in the Shiyan Reservoir, reduction of the transferred water load in the Tiegang Reservoir, and an increase in transfer water volume, especially in the flood season, in the Xili Reservoir. Internal pollution sources also {{played an important role in}} water pollution, and thus sedimentation should be cleaned up regularly. This study is expected to provide scientific support for drinking water source protection and promote the application of hydrodynamic model in water quality management...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} of microlayers on freshwater storages in Northern Europe {{have been studied}} for decades. Research in Australia is more recent, highlighting differences in microlayer and subsurface water composition associated with vegetation and climate. Freshwater microlayers in Northern Europe are primarily formed on peat, whereas in Australia they are formed from bark and leaf litter. The hydrophobic, aromatic compounds concentrating within the microlayer strongly absorb ultraviolet light to produce photoreactive compounds. Rates of photodegradation {{are likely to be}} higher in subtropical Australia. South East Queensland (SEQ) experiences 290 clear days per year, in contrast to Sweden with only 165 clear days per year. Leaf fall in Europe occurs in Autumn prior to winter rain, whereas in SEQ leaf and bark fall predominantly in the dry winter, prior to summer storms. Furthermore, the hole in the ozone layer above Australia allows more UVB light to reach the surface. In this study, the concentration and reactivity of humic substances (HS) present in natural microlayers on water storages in SEQ was investigated. Microlayer and subsurface samples were taken from eight water storages with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) used to quantify HS concentration. The E 2 /E 3 ratio (ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm) was used to indicate the molecular weight of DOC compounds, and absorbance at 253. 7 nm and the <b>permanganate</b> <b>index</b> were used to compare the reactivity of humified DOC. The concentration of carbonyl compounds in the microlayer was also investigated as carbonyls are considered the most photoreactive functional group present in HS. Significant regressions were obtained for the E 2 /E 3 ratio and absorbance at 253. 7 nm (r 2 = 0. 89), and the E 2 /E 3 ratio and the <b>permanganate</b> <b>index</b> (r 2 = 0. 95). The regression for the <b>permanganate</b> <b>index</b> and UV absorbance was initially significant (r 2 = 0. 91), primarily reflecting differences in HS concentration. When data was standardised for DOC concentration, results for the eight storages tested clustered into four groups, reflecting the attributes of the water catchments. Results indicate that larger molecules more recently derived from wooded catchments absorb UV light more strongly, and are more chemically reactive (higher <b>permanganate</b> <b>index).</b> Smaller molecules derived from highly resilient carbon in the black vertisol soil of a cleared catchment absorbed less UV light, and were relatively unreactive (lower <b>permanganate</b> <b>index).</b> These preliminary results will be used to develop bioassays to compare the rate of photodegradation in the microlayers of freshwater storages in SEQ. ...|$|E

The study {{was carried out in}} semi-technical scale on a model filter composed of activated carbon WD-extra. The development of biological activity in a biosorption bed, as well as observations on the relationship between the processes of sorption and biodegradation was evaluated based on the Eberhardt, Madsen, Sontheimer (EMS) test. Leading operation control parameters of biologically active carbon filter BAF included: change of TOC content, dissolved oxygen and <b>permanganate</b> <b>index.</b> To evaluate the colonization of granular carbon determination of ATP value was used. The presence of the biofilm was found by observation using light and scanning microscopes. The organic compounds in the water taken were adsorbed 100 % and 70 % biodegradable. The combination of sorption process with biodegradation until depletion of activated carbon adsorption capacity allowed in the initial phase of coalbed work for the removal of organic matter in approx. 100 %. Formation of biofilm at the right time allowed to extend the filtration cycle and helped lower the TOC by 70 %, i. e. from 10 mg C/l to 3 - 4 mg C/l...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of water quality in lakes and its {{negative effects on}} freshwater ecosystems have become a serious problem worldwide. Exploring the dynamics in the associated factors is essential for water pollution management and control. GIS interpolation, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate statistical techniques were used to identify the main pollution sources in different areas of Honghu Lake. The {{results indicate that the}} spatial distribution of the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphate (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 +–N), and <b>permanganate</b> <b>index</b> (CODMn) have similar characteristics and that their values gradually increased from south to north during the three seasons in Honghu Lake. The major influencing factors of water quality varied across the different areas and seasons. The relatively high concentrations of TN and TP, which might limit the growth of submerged aquatic plants, were mainly caused by anthropogenic factors. Our work suggests that spatial analyses combined with PCA are useful for investigating the factors that influence water quality and submerged aquatic plant biomass in different areas of a lake. These findings provide sound information for the future water quality management of the lake or even the entire lake basin...|$|E
40|$|Microlayers {{are natural}} surface films derived from {{hydrophobic}} organic compounds that form on most lakes and streams. Holoarctic brown water lakes {{have been most}} commonly studied, with Australian research limited to marine microlayers. Artificial monolayers based on long-chain fatty alcohols have been applied to freshwater storages to reduce evaporative loss. As a water conservation strategy, monolayer technology was not widely adopted due to variable field performance. However, the role of natural microlayers in reducing monolayer performance has not previously been investigated. In this study, microlayer and subsurface samples from six water storages in Queensland were characterized for water quality indices including biochemical oxygen demand, <b>permanganate</b> <b>index</b> and ultraviolet light absorbance. Microlayer enrichment in southeast Queensland is comparable to or higher than holoarctic lakes. Results indicate that microlayer compounds {{have the potential to}} disrupt monolayers in at least three ways: As substrates for microbes capable of degrading monolayer compounds, as chromophores accelerating photodegradation, and as impurities disrupting the molecular packing required to reduce evaporative loss. The knowledge gained from studying natural microlayers {{can also be used to}} benchmark novel monolayer compounds, to minimize their environmental impact on freshwater ecosystems. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between land use and surface water quality is necessary for effective water management. We estimated the impacts of catchment-wide land use on water quality during the dry and rainy seasons in the Dongjiang River basin, using remote sensing, geographic information systems and multivariate statistical techniques. The {{results showed that the}} 83 sites can be divided into three groups representing different land use types: forest, agriculture and urban. Water quality parameters exhibited significant variations between the urban-dominated and forest-dominated sites. The proportion of forested land was positively associated with dissolved oxygen concentration but negatively associated with water temperature, electrical conductivity, <b>permanganate</b> <b>index,</b> total phosphorus, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and chlorophyll-a. The proportion of urban land was strongly positively associated with total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations. Forested and urban land use had stronger impacts on water quality in the dry season than in the rainy season. However, agricultural land use did not {{have a significant impact on}} water quality. Our study indicates that urban land use was the key factor affecting water quality change, and limiting point-source waste discharge in urban areas during the dry season would be critical for improving water quality in the study area...|$|E
40|$|Using {{land use}} types and {{landscape}} metrics, {{as well as}} statistical and spatial analysis, we determined the relationships between land use patterns and river water quality in the Taizi River basin, China, during dry and rainy seasons in 2009. Correlation and multiple linear regressions indicated that vegetated areas had a positive contribution to river water quality and predicted total nitrogen during the rainy season. Built-up land use strongly influenced nitrogen and phosphorus parameters in river water. Agricultural land use was associated with most physicochemical variables and nitrogen during the rainy season. Landscape metrics during both seasons {{were significantly associated with}} river water quality. Shannon's diversity index was the primary predictor for chloride and ammoniacal nitrogen. Mean Euclidean nearest neighbor index defined ammoniacal nitrogen, orthophosphate, and total phosphorus during the dry season. Biological oxygen demand and <b>permanganate</b> <b>index</b> were expressed by Contagion during the rainy season. Factor analysis indicated that the river suffered organic, phosphorus, and nitrogen pollution and a zone dominated by agricultural and built-up land uses in the river basin tended to have worse water quality than other areas. The results provide a useful approach that uses landscape patterns to estimate water quality in rivers for water pollution control and land use management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the {{relationship}} between nutrient pollutants and suspended sediments (SS) in {{the upper reaches of}} the Yangtze River and two tributaries, water samples were collected from September 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011 at the Zhutuo, Cuntang, Beibei, Wulong, Qingxichang, Wanxian, and Fengjie cross-sections. In the laboratory, the SS concentration and the concentration of SS whose particle size was smaller than 0. 02  mm were measured. The phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and <b>permanganate</b> <b>index</b> (CODMn) concentrations in the natural water sample, the settled water sample, and two types of filtered water samples obtained through filter membranes with pore sizes of 0. 02  mm and 0. 45  μm were monitored synchronously. The results show that there are strong relationships between the P and CODMn concentrations and the SS concentration. P mainly exists in particulate form, while N mainly exists in dissolved form. SS whose particle size is smaller than 0. 02  mm accounts for a high proportion of sediments in the Yangtze River and has a strong effect on water quality. At the seven cross-sections, the amounts of P, N, and CODMn in particulate form in the wet season are higher than in the dry season and the adsorption amounts of P, N, and CODMn per unit mass of sediment are higher in the dry season than in the wet season...|$|E
