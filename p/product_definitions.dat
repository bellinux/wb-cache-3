40|$|Abstract: <b>Product</b> <b>definition</b> {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the deciding factors in designing a product for success in the marketplace. It involves a tedious elaboration process enacted between customers, marketers and designers. Difficulties associated with <b>product</b> <b>definition</b> for developing <b>product</b> specifications are observed as contextual mismatching, lack of definite structures in requirements, lack of structured mapping, and life-cycle requirements. Facing these difficulties, it is imperative to explore requirement management methodologies and develop computer tools to support requirement management automation. This paper introduces an approach to requirement management for <b>product</b> <b>definition</b> by evolving from similar existing products. The approach is based on recognizing functional requirement patterns from past design efforts and taking into account product migration, technological trends, competition. A two-phase methodology of functional requirement pattern recognition and pattern adoption is presented in the paper. To facilitate and demonstrate the methodology, a database system is developed to provide a computerized environment for requirement management during the <b>product</b> <b>definition</b> phase. The database system improves <b>product</b> <b>definition</b> during design and redesign efforts by integrating customer and design information all together and by reusing this information. A prototype requirement management database system is implemented for an electronics company to illustrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed methodology...|$|R

40|$|Product classifications {{are used}} by {{statistical}} offices and others {{for a number of}} measurement purposes. These include measurement of product usage, current and capital expenditure on products, domestic production, and trade in goods and services. They are therefore an important element of a set of statistical standards, with Information Economy (IE) standards no exception. This document presents the definition of information economy (IE) products developed by the WPIIS Classifications Expert Group. The <b>product</b> <b>definitions</b> complement the IE sector definitions that were released in early 2007. The latter are based on the 2007 revision of the UNSD’s International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC Rev. 4). The document includes two IE <b>product</b> <b>definitions,</b> 3 ICT products and Content and media products.

40|$|Today’s {{computer}} aided design systems {{enable the}} creation of digital <b>product</b> <b>definitions</b> that are widely used throughout the design process, for example in analysis or manufacturing. Typically, such <b>product</b> <b>definitions</b> are created after the bulk of [shape] designing has been completed because their creation requires a detailed knowledge of the shape {{that is to be}} defined. Consequently, there is a gulf between the exploration processes that result in the selection of a design concept and the creation of its definition. In order to address this distinction, between design exploration and product definition, understanding of how designers create and manipulate shapes is necessary. The research outlined in this paper results from work concerned with addressing these issues, with the long term goal of informing a new generation of {{computer aided design}} systems which support design exploration as well as the production of <b>product</b> <b>definitions.</b> This research is based on the shape grammar formalism. Shape grammars have been applied in a range of domains, commonly to generate shapes or designs that conform to a given style. However, a key challenge that restricts the implementation of shape grammar systems lies in the detection of embedded parts, or sub-shapes, which are manipulated according to shape rules to create new shapes. The automatic detection of sub-shapes is an open research question within the shape grammar community and has been actively explored for over thirty years. The research reported in this paper explores the use of computer vision techniques to address this problem; the results achieved to date show real promise.

The outcome of these various approaches can be summarized in all cases as a simple price.

A similar argument requires clear consistent descriptions of the product bought or sold in a particular market.

Energy products also include non-electricity products such as natural gas.

This paper discusses the requirements of clear price and product communications to and from energy markets. We discuss how such communications enable national markets in energy management systems even when there are no national markets in energy. We also discuss how such communications foster the adoption of service oriented architectures in integrating smart grids, and how these architectures will further the goals of smart grids. 1...|$|E
