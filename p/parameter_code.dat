Background NWQL Technical Memorandum 99. 03 (Brenton, 1998) announced that beginning October 15, 1998, the NWQL would analyze water samples for Total Recoverable Phenols by using method 5530 (American Public Health Association, 1998).

The Minimum Reporting Level (MRL) was set at 4 ug/L. The Organic Blind Sample Project, operated by the Branch of Quality Systems, produced results suggesting that the bias of the analytical results, for samples spiked near 4 ug/L, was unacceptable.

40|$|The Prismatic Modular Reactor (PMR) {{is one of}} {{the major}} Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) concepts, which {{consists}} of hexagonal prismatic fuel blocks and reflector blocks made of nuclear grade graphite. However, the shape of the graphite blocks could be easily changed by neutron damage during the reactor operation and the shape change can create gaps between the blocks inducing the bypass flow. In the VHTR core, two types of gaps, a vertical gap and a horizontal gap which are called bypass gap and cross gap, respectively, can be formed. The cross gap complicates the flow field in the reactor core by connecting the coolant channel to the bypass gap and it could lead to a loss of effective coolant flow in the fuel blocks. Thus, a cross flow experimental facility was constructed to investigate the cross flow phenomena in the core of the VHTR and a series of experiments were carried out under varying flow rates and gap sizes. The results of the experiments were compared with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis results in order to verify its prediction capability for the cross flow phenomena. Fairly good agreement was seen between experimental results and CFD predictions and the local characteristics of the cross flow was discussed in detail. Based on the calculation results, pressure loss coefficient across the cross gap was evaluated, which is necessary for the thermo-fluid analysis of the VHTR core using a lumped <b>parameter</b> <b>code.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Effective thermal conductivity models {{which can be used}} to analyze the heat transfer phenomena of a prismatic fuel block were evaluated by the experiments. In the accident condition of VHTR when forced convection is lost, the heat flows in radial direction through the hexagonal fuel blocks that contain the large number of coolant holes and fuel compacts. Due to the complex geometry of fuel block and radiation heat transfer, the detail computation of heat transfer on the fuel block needs excessive computation resources. Therefore, the detail computation isn't appropriate for the lumped <b>parameter</b> <b>code</b> and a system code such as GAMMA+ adopts effective thermal conductivity model. Despite the complexity in heat transfer modes, the accurate analysis on the heat transfer in fuel block is necessary since it is directly relevant to the integrity of nuclear fuel embedded in fuel block. To satisfy the accurate analysis of complex heat transfer modes with limited computing sources, the credible effective thermal conductivity (ETC) models in which the effects of all of heat transfer modes are lumped is necessary. In this study, various ETC models were evaluated with the experiment result. Experiments for measuring the ETC values of the VHTR fuel block geometry were conducted with IG- 11 graphite block. And four probable models compared to the experiment result showed good agreement with them, and thus they could be a candidate ETC model for VHTR fuel block.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} at author's request, from July 12, 2013 - July 12, 2014. The metastable isotope of technetium- 99 (Tc- 99 m) is {{an important}} diagnostic tool used {{in the field of}} nuclear medicine due to the isotope's 6. 0 hour half-life, 140. 5 keV γ-decay mechanism, and multiple oxidation states [1, 2]. Approximately 70 % of the world’s nuclear medicine procedures involve the use of Tc- 99 m [3]. The conventional source of Tc- 99 m comes from the β-decay of molybdenum- 99 (Mo- 99), an isotope which may be produced via the fission of uranium- 235 (U- 235) atoms [2]. As Mo- 99 has a half-life of 2. 7 hours [2]; it is difficult to produce anything but short-term stockpiles of Tc- 99 m. A handful of geographically dispersed facilities maintain a continuous production of Mo- 99 via U- 235 fission as a means to satisfy the demand of nuclear medicine worldwide [4]. However, 96 % of all Mo- 99 production is concentrated among only 4 facilities [4]. This centralized production dynamic has been shown to leave the world susceptible to Tc- 99 m shortages in the event of multiple reactor shutdowns [5]. Oregon State University (OSU) has undertaken a study to investigate the safety of implementing a fueled experiment, known as the "molybdenum element," within the OSU TRIGA® reactor (OSTR) for the purpose of producing Mo- 99.

40|$|Hydrogen {{combustion}} {{may represent}} a threat to containment integrity in a VVER- 440 / 213 plant owing to the combination of high pressure and high temperature. A study {{has been carried out}} using the GASFLOW 2. 1 three-dimensional CFD code to evaluate the hydrogen distribution in the containment during a beyond design basis accident. The VVER- 440 / 213 containment input model consists of two 3 D blocks connected via one-dimensional (1 D) ducts. One 3 D block contains the reactor building and the accident localization tower with the suppression pools. Another 3 D block models the air traps. 1 D ducts represent the check valves connecting the accident localization tower with the air traps. The VVER pressure suppression system, called ''bubbler condenser,'' was modeled as a distributed heat sink with water thermodynamic properties. This model accounts for the energy balance. However, it is not currently possible to model dynamic phenomena associated with the water pools (e. g., vent clearing, level change). The GASFLOW 2. 1 calculation gave detailed results for the spatial distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and gas concentrations. The range and trend of the parameters are reasonable and valuable. There are particularly interesting circulation patterns around the steam generators, in the bubbler tower and other primary system compartments. In case of the bubbler tower, concentration and temperature contour plots show an inhomogeneous distribution along the height and width, changing during the accident. Hydrogen concentrations also vary within primary system compartments displaying lower as well as higher (up to 13 - 20 % and higher) values in some nodes. Prediction of such concentration distributions was not previously possible with lumped parameter codes. GASFLOW 2. 1 calculations were compared with CONTAIN 1. 2 (lumped <b>parameter</b> <b>code)</b> results. Apart from the qualitatively similar trends, there are, for the time being, quantitative differences between the results concerning, for example, pressure histories, or the total amount of steam available in the containment. The results confirm the importance of detailed modeling of the containment, {{as well as of the}} bubbler condenser and sump water pools.
