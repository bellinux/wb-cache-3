With a predicted rise in the aging population and no mandatory retirement age, this form of employment is expected to see an upward trend. This research explores the concept of <b>part-time</b> bridge <b>employment</b> at OCAD University.

5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers.

Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million.

40|$|This study uses a {{cross-section}} national sample of four-year {{colleges and universities}} in the United States to examine the variation of <b>part-time</b> faculty <b>employment.</b> Results {{of this study suggest that}} higher educational institutions actively design and adopt contingent work arrangements to save on labor costs and to manage their resource dependence with constituencies. Institutions that pay high salaries to their full-time faculty members, have limited resource slack, and are located in major urban areas tend to employ a high proportion of part-time faculty. Furthermore, institutions that have small student enrollment and large proportion of part-time students are found to rely more heavily on <b>part-time</b> faculty <b>employment.</b> Private institutions, on average, have higher levels of part-time faculty than their public counterparts; however, this result does not hold for doctoral and research institutions. Finally, institutions that rely more on tuition and fees revenue tend to employ more part-time faculty. Such a relationship is significantly moderated by institutional quality, suggesting that different institutions may adopt different strategies to attract students and secure their tuition revenues. 1 What Determines <b>Employment</b> of <b>Part-Time</b> Facult...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{arguments}} in favor of the construction of I-68 was that the freeway would improve the poor economic conditions in western Maryland. The economy of the surrounding area has improved since the construction of the freeway, especially in Garrett County, where the freeway opened up the county to tourism from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Correspondingly, Garrett County saw a sharp increase in population and employment during and after the construction of the road, with full- and <b>part-time</b> <b>employment</b> increasing from 8,868 in 1976 to 15,334 in 1991. However, economic difficulties remain in Allegany and Garrett counties.

It is assumed that worsening labour market opportunities for the less educated and a ‘familialistic’ social policy context have resulted in growing differentials in mothers’ employment by education. Data from the scientific use files of the German micro-censuses for the years 1976 to 2004 show that the <b>part-time</b> and marginal <b>employment</b> rates of mothers have increased, while full-time employment rates have declined.

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains two}} sections: a literature review of material related to part-time faculty, and the review's bibliography. The most recent {{research indicates that}} the use of part-time faculty positions in higher education as a proportion of total faculty positions has reached a plateau. The recently released study by the U. S. Department of Education estimates that part-timers made up 435 k of the faculty workforce at colleges and universities. The pay and benefits of the part-time faculty in community colleges clearly do not equal those of full-time faculty in community colleges. The inequality in pay and benefits itself plays a role in the growth or decline of <b>part-time</b> <b>employment's</b> share of the total employment of faculty. Findings on any difference in instructional effectiveness between part-time and full-time faculty are inconclusive despite extensive work in this area. Many researchers emphasize the link between working conditions and effectiveness of the part-time faculty member. A critical working condition is the integration of the faculty member into the whole campus. The limited job mobility or opportunity facing part-time faculty has negative effects on these individuals. The likelihood or desire of part-time faculty to become full-time faculty underlies much of the discussion about limited opportunities and inequity. (Contains 83 references.)
