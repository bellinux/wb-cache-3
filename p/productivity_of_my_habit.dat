60|$|I hire myself unto Griffiths, and my poesy [3] {{comes out}} on Saturday. Hobhouse is here; I shall tell him to write. My stone is gone for the present, but I fear is part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habit.</b> We all talk of a visit to Cambridge.|$|R
60|$|For {{a person}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> life and {{temperament}} I had certainly {{fallen into a}} strange adventure. Not only had Eve herself come to mean for me everything that was real and vital in life, but I was most curiously attracted by her terrible father. I liked him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{even asked}} to the wedding. I reckon the bride had my {{pedigree}} {{and the front}} elevation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits</b> all mapped out, and she decided that Perry would trot better in double harness without any unconverted mustang like Buck Caperton whickering around on the matrimonial range. So it was six months before I saw Perry again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} a man <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits</b> call live on his pay {{and a hundred}} a year?" [...] George cried out in great anger. [...] "You must be a fool to talk so, Dobbin. How the deuce am I to keep up my {{position}} in the world upon such a pitiful pittance? I can't change <b>my</b> <b>habits.</b> I must have my comforts. I wasn't brought up on porridge, like MacWhirter, or on potatoes, like old O'Dowd. Do you expect my wife to take in soldiers' washing, or ride after the regiment in a baggage waggon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither more nor less," [...] says master, bobbing his head; [...] "a sufficiency, my dear Miss Griffin,--to a man <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{moderate}} <b>habits</b> {{an ample}} provision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well, well,’ said he, {{a little}} sobered, ‘it {{must be as}} you wish, though you would hardly speak {{otherwise}} if you had committed homicide! Mine is the loss. I must eat alone; a very pernicious thing for a person <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> body, content myself with a pint of skinking claret, and meditate the discourse. But about this business of yours: if it is so particular as all that, it will doubtless admit of no delay.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may {{not matter}} to you--there's no {{accounting}} for tastes--but it matters {{a good deal}} to me. I'm not used to sitting in a hole, like a bear in a trap, waiting for what other folks choose to do with me. It's new to me. I found Paris a pretty close sort of place, but it's a prairie compared to this. It don't suit a man <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits,</b> and I am {{going to come out}} of it." ...|$|R

60|$|My long {{habitation}} in the neighbourhood, and {{the quiet}} respectability <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits,</b> {{have given me}} a sort of intimacy with good Mrs. Policy, the housekeeper in that most interesting {{part of the old}} building called Queen Mary's Apartments. But a circumstance which lately happened has conferred upon me greater privileges; so that, indeed, I might, I believe, venture on the exploit of Chatelet, who was executed for being found secreted at midnight in the very bedchamber of Scotland's mistress.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am no {{believer in}} miracles, my dear Miles," [...] {{observed}} my guardian, with amusing self-complacency; [...] "but I do think a {{change has been}} wrought in me, to meet the emergencies of a situation, in which the interests of two orphans have been so suddenly intrusted to my guidance and care. God be thanked! everything prospers; your affairs, {{as well as those}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dear Grace. It is wonderful, boy, how a man <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits</b> has been directed in his purchases of wheat, for instance; I, who never bought a bushel until the whole responsibility of your mills fell upon my shoulders I take no credit to myself for it--no credit to myself!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Laquidara {{has said}} he [...] "quit radio in ’76 because it was {{getting in the way}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cocaine <b>habit.</b> When I came back in ’78, I didn’t want to come back, because I still wanted to {{continue}} being able to do cocaine. Luckily I’m still alive." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2016, The Guardian {{newspaper}} {{published a}} detailed account of Grant's writing process, in which she noted, [...] "My rituals of writing are so calcified I could be an elderly colonel at his gentleman's club: ironed newspaper, tea piping hot, shoes the correct colour for in town. Without the scaffolding <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits,</b> I'm superstitiously convinced I'd never write a word. I don't - can't - write after lunch, in a cafe or any other public place, including trains and planes, or when anyone else is in the house. It's an act of severe, intense solitude, partly now destroyed by the internet, and its deceptive promise of the ease of looking things up as you go along." ...|$|R
60|$|AUSTIN. Madam, I foresaw this question. So be it: I respect, and I {{will not}} deceive you. But give me, first of all, {{a moment for}} defence. There are few men <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits</b> and {{position}} who would have done as I have done: sate {{at the feet of}} a young boy, accepted his lessons, gone upon his errand: fewer still, who would thus, at the crisis of a love, risk the whole fortune of the soul--love, gratitude, even respect. Yet more than that! For conceive how I respect you, if I, whose lifelong trade has been flattery, stand before you and make the plain confession of a truth that must not only lower me, but deeply wound yourself.|$|R
60|$|For a man <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits,</b> {{who kept}} clear of drink, I was now rich. Instead of {{remaining}} in town, however, I went immediately {{down to the}} Harbour, and presented myself to its respectable superintendant, the venerable Captain Whetten.[18] I was received into the institution without any difficulty, and have belonged to it ever since. My entrance at Sailors' Snug Harbour took place Sept. 17, 1840; just one month after I landed at Sailors' Retreat. The last of these places is a seamen's hospital, where men are taken in only to be cured; while the first is an asylum for worn-out mariners, for life. The last {{is supported by a}} bequest made, many years ago, by an old ship-master, whose remains lie in front of the building.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Laniston, [...] "you {{seemed to}} me, at the time, {{to be in}} a decidedly {{unbalanced}} state of mind, but I think I acted most unwarrantably in speaking of Marcia as I did. In fact, I often act unwarrantably. It is one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits.</b> And to prove it to you, I am going to act unwarrantably again. Having brought the elder Miss Raynor before you in a way that might have led you to have undefined ideas about her, I am going to bring her before you again in order that those ideas may be exactly defined. It is all wrong, I know, but I like to set things straight, whether I do it in the right way or wrong way." ...|$|R
40|$|This image {{originally}} {{appeared in}} the 2015 Research student photography and image competition held to celebrate National Science Week (Aug 15 - 23). Blurb: It is amazing to image the nanostructured silver metallic films using scanning electron microscope (SEM) for the characterization. But I would say {{it really is a}} challenge. While I was expecting the same patterns of nano island structures, look what I found one day! A nano-beach - full of lovely waves, shining sands along the shore and of course some sea corals. It’s always been one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits</b> to write <b>my</b> name on sands whenever I went to beach. I am even happier today because I could write my name on this nano-beach too. How amazing the life is…How fascinating would this beach be with some surfers...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} stomach, Sir, {{you will not}} {{have reason to be}} disappointed," [...] {{retorted}} the Alderman, a little more severely than was usual with one so callous. [...] "The heiress of Myndert Van Beverout will not be a penniless bride, and Monsieur Barbérie did not close the books of life without taking good care of the balance-sheet--but yonder are those devils of ferrymen quitting the wharf without us! Scamper ahead, Brutus, and tell them to wait the legal minute. The rogues are never exact; sometimes starting before I am ready, and sometimes keeping me waiting in the sun, as if I were no better than a dried dun-fish. Punctuality is the soul of business, and one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habits</b> does not like to be ahead, nor behind his time." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “- Yes, I {{think that}} this system could {{potentially}} be much more secure than existing systems, as it would require either a very constant update on my behavior to successfully guess or a very thorough understanding <b>of</b> <b>my</b> daily <b>habits,</b> both <b>of</b> which I feel would {{be more difficult to}} easily identify than a single piece of information.” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Allison M. Lyzenga <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Film <b>Habit</b> {{praised the}} film saying [...] "This movie {{especially}} recognizes that even while high-school {{can be a}} battlefield of insecurity and bullying, you can find allies to help you through the struggle. It also shows {{that we all have}} a brighter future ahead if we let ourselves reach for it." ...|$|R
60|$|We plodded on; and at length, towards noon, when we {{had gained}} the {{neighbourhood}} of the village of Cattolica, we halted at the hut of a peasant on a small campagna. I had divested myself <b>of</b> <b>my</b> monk's <b>habit,</b> and cut away the cowl from Madonna's. She had thereafter fashioned it by means that were mysterious to my dull man's mind into a more feminine-looking garb.|$|R
3000|$|... (P 10) When I was gambling, I didn’t {{provide a}} {{comfortable}} living environment {{to my wife}} and family. I’m not a good father. I never teach my children what is good and bad. I set a very bad example for them. I never watched movies with them. [Families] go on holidays and go shopping together but I do not do it as I’m always away from <b>my</b> family because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> gambling <b>habit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{went back}} to a more organic style of writing and production. I {{personally}} {{was finally able to}} abandon a lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> writing <b>habits</b> or 'rules,' if you will. No more 'oh, that part doesn't really sound like us, have to change that,' type of bullshit. Doing that created a fresher sound. This is the most raw and extreme sounding material we've ever written. Keep an eye out for studio blogs and more updates." ...|$|R
60|$|Thinking it very {{unlikely}} that two snakes had got on {{board at the}} same time, I turned in and went to sleep; but having all the time a vague dreamy idea that I might {{put my hand on}} another one, I lay wonderfully still, not turning over once all night, quite the reverse <b>of</b> <b>my</b> usual <b>habits.</b> The next day we reached Ternate, and I ensconced myself in my comfortable house, to examine all my treasures, and pack them securely for the voyage home.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Haifa {{people were}} close upon our track {{at the time}} when I was abandoned, and they picked me up in the desert. I must have been delirious, I suppose, for they tell me that they heard my voice, singing hymns, a long way off, and it was that, under the {{providence}} of God, which brought them to me. They had a camel ambulance, and I was quite myself again by next day. I came with the Sarras people after we met them, because they have the doctor with them. My wound is nothing, and he says that a man <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habit</b> will be the better for the loss of blood. And now, my friends,"--his big, brown eyes lost their twinkle, and became very solemn and reverent,--"we have all been upon the very confines of death, and our dear companions may be so at this instant. The same power which saved us may save them, and let us pray together that it may be so, always remembering that if, in spite of our prayers, it should not be so, then that also must be accepted as the best and wisest thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I believe {{every word}} you have said,' he returned. 'I am full of self-reproach that I {{might have known}} this and seen this, and known you and seen you, any time these dozen years, and that I never have. I hardly know how I ever got here--creature that I am, not only <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>habit,</b> but <b>of</b> other people's! But having done so, let me do something. I ask it in all honour and respect. You inspire me with both, in the highest degree. Let me do something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|THE STATUE. Thank you: that's {{very good}} of you. Even in heaven, I never quite got out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old {{military}} <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> speech. What I {{was going to}} ask Juan was why Life should bother itself about getting a brain. Why should it want to understand itself? Why not be content to enjoy itself? ...|$|R
60|$|I can quit any <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{nineteen}} injurious <b>habits</b> at any time, {{and without}} discomfort or inconvenience. I {{think that the}} Dr. Tanners and those others who go forty days without eating do it by resolutely keeping out the desire to eat, in the beginning, and that {{after a few hours}} the desire is discouraged and comes no more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{devoted a}} man of {{business}} as yourself has a perfect understanding of a fair bargain. I wish to make a fair bargain with you, that you shall enlighten me concerning the Dorrit family when you have it in your power, as I have enlightened you. It may not give you a very flattering idea <b>of</b> <b>my</b> business <b>habits,</b> that I failed to make my terms beforehand,' continued Clennam; 'but I prefer to make them a point of honour. I have seen so much business done on sharp principles that, {{to tell you the}} truth, Mr Pancks, I am tired of them.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{necessary}} to give the reader this information, without which he {{would be at the}} same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these people, as they conducted me {{up the stairs to the}} top of the island, and from thence to the royal palace. While we were ascending, they forgot several times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their memories were again roused by their flappers; for they appeared altogether unmoved by the sight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> foreign <b>habit</b> and countenance, and by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should tell}} you that I have seldom reared a pupil from childhood. Mine have been chiefly from fifteen to eighteen, whose parents {{required}} their instruction, not education, from me; and till I came here, I never fully beheld the growth and development of character. I found that whereas all I could do for Phoebe was to give her method and information, leaving alone the higher graces elsewhere derived, with Bertha, my efforts were inadequate to supply any motive for overcoming her natural defects; and I believe that association with a person <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sceptical <b>habit</b> has tended to prevent Phoebe's religion from influencing her sister.' ...|$|R
40|$|I am {{invested}} in mindless activity, repetitive actions, and hasty production. Performance and completion {{are at the}} forefront <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hurried work <b>habits.</b> Practicality has directed <b>my</b> selection <b>of</b> materials and decision-making process toward meaningful and intentional outcomes. However the outcome is reminiscent of goal-oriented activities that are misplaced, in essence, a pragmatic process of customization gone astray.

60|$|In my {{visits to}} the {{hospitals}} I found {{it was in the}} simple matter of personal presence, and emanating ordinary cheer and magnetism, that I succeeded and help'd more than by medical nursing, or delicacies, or gifts of money, or anything else. During the war I possess'd the perfection <b>of</b> physical health. <b>My</b> <b>habit,</b> when practicable, was to prepare for starting out on one of those daily or nightly tours of from a couple to four or five hours, by fortifying myself with previous rest, the bath, clean clothes, a good meal, and as cheerful an appearance as possible.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{rigidity}} vanished like a flake {{of snow in}} the sunshine. “Oh! Azzolati. It was a most solemn affair. It {{had occurred}} to me to make a very elaborate toilet. It was most successful. Azzolati looked positively scared for a moment as though he had got into the wrong suite of rooms. He had never before seen me en toilette, you understand. In the old days once out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> riding <b>habit</b> I would never dress. I draped myself, you remember, Monsieur Mills. To go about like that suited my indolence, my longing to feel free in my body, as at that time when I used to herd goats. [...] . But never mind. My aim was to impress Azzolati. I wanted to talk to him seriously.” ...|$|R
60|$|I say I {{got myself}} into disgrace in the {{hospital}} of Pensacola, in consequence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> drinking. The facts were as follows, for I {{have no desire to}} conceal, or to parade before the world, my own delinquencies; but, I confess them with the hope that the pictures they present, may have some salutary influence on the conduct of others. The doctor, who was steadily my friend, and often gave me excellent advice, went north, in order to bring his wife to Pensacola. I was considered entitled to a pension for the hurt which had brought me into the hospital, and the doctor had promised to see something about it, while at Washington. This was not done, in consequence of his not passing through Washington, as had been expected. Now, nature has so formed me, that any disgust, or disappointment, makes me reckless, and awakens a desire to revenge myself, on myself, as I may say. It was this feeling which first carried me from Halifax; it was this feeling that made me run from the Sterling; and which has often changed and sometimes marred my prospects, as I have passed through life. As soon as I learned that nothing had been said about my pension, this same feeling came over me, and I became reckless. I had not drawn my grog for months, and, indeed, had left off drinking entirely; but I now determined to have my fill, at the first good opportunity. I meant to make the officers sorry, by doing something that was very wrong, and for which I should be sorry myself.|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} interests broadly span programming languages and compilers. Specifically, I {{am interested in}} program analysis, verification, and testing problems that improve the <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> programmers. <b>My</b> recent {{focus has been on}} tools for analyzing and testing C/C++ programs. In particular, I worked on an automated test-case generation tool for C/C++ programs, and a source-to-source translation tool that models inheritance and exceptions {{in such a way that}} makes it easier to statically analyze C++ programs. Quite recently, I have been involved in building a framework for testing large-scale distributed systems such as HBase, Zookeeper, and so on. For my Ph. D. dissertation, I developed static-analysis algorithms to address the problem of analyzing executables without debugging information...|$|R
