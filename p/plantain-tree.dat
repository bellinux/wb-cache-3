60|$|Hathi and {{his three}} sons had arrived, in their usual way, without a sound. The mud of the river was still fresh on their flanks, and Hathi was thoughtfully chewing the green stem of a young <b>plantain-tree</b> that he had gouged up with his tusks. But every line in his vast body showed to Bagheera, who could see things when he came across them, {{that it was not}} the Master of the Jungle {{speaking}} to a Man-cub, but one who was afraid coming before one who was not. His three sons rolled side by side, behind their father.|$|E
60|$|Advancing {{towards the}} children, {{who were so}} {{numerous}} that I began to think {{this must be the}} general playground of the village, I sat down on a grassy bank under the shade of a <b>plantain-tree</b> to watch them. And a happier or more noisy crew I have never seen. There were at least two hundred of them, both boys and girls, all of whom were clad in no other garments than their own glossy little black skins, except the maro, or strip of cloth, round the loins of the boys, and a very short petticoat or kilt on the girls. They did not all play at the same game, but amused themselves in different groups.|$|E
5000|$|An {{inscription}} {{found on}} a slab set {{in the front of}} the Anjaneya temple at Yenigi, Hadagali Taluk, records that [...] "while the king (the Sevuna Yadava king Kandharadeva or Kannara (1247-1261)) was camping at the nelevidu of Devagiri, the 120 Brahman Mahajanas of Puvina-Padangile, who are described as very learned in the Vedas and the Shastras, performing Aupasana and Agnihotra and as ripukula-kadali-vana-kunjarar (as destructive to enemies as elephants to a forest of <b>plantain-trees)</b> and saranagata-vajra-panjarar (mail-armour to those who seek shelter under them), made a gift of various plots of land of specified boundary, for the service of the god Kusmanatha at the village." [...] Puvina-Padangile is stated to have been [...] "situated in the Kogali-nadu, which was the eye of the Nolambavadi-nadu which again was, as it were, the nose of Kuntala-desa".|$|R
6000|$|... "When Susan {{came from}} her room, to breakfast, at eight o'clock, I pointed out to her the {{extraordinary}} height and violence of the surf, and the singular appearance of the clouds of heavy rain sweeping down the valleys before us. At this time I had so little apprehension of what was coming, that I talked of riding down to the shore when the storm should abate, as I had never seen so fierce a sea. In {{about a quarter of}} an hour the House-Negroes came in, to close the outside shutters of the windows. They knew that the <b>plantain-trees</b> about the Negro houses had been blown down in the night; and had told the maid-servant Tyrrell, but I had heard nothing of it. A very few minutes after the closing of the windows, I found that the shutters of Tyrrell's room, at the south and commonly the most sheltered end of the House, were giving way. I tried to tie them; but the silk handkerchief which I used soon gave way; and as I had neither hammer, boards nor nails in the house, I could do nothing more to keep out the tempest. I found, in pushing at the leaf of the shutter, that the wind resisted, more as if it had been a stone wall or a mass of iron, than a mere current of air. There were one or two people outside trying to fasten the windows, and I went out to help; but we had no tools at hand: one man was blown down the hill in front of the house, before my face; and the other and myself had great difficulty in getting back again inside the door. The rain on my face and hands felt like so much small shot from a gun. There was great exertion necessary to shut the door of the house.|$|R
60|$|At last, after {{consulting}} together, {{they began to}} paddle slowly round the ship, and make signs of peace and friendship, which those on board were not slow to return, endeavouring to induce {{some of them to}} come on deck. This they were naturally afraid to do, but at length one fellow took heart and began by making a speech, which lasted for full fifteen minutes. As none of the sailors understood a word of it, they were not much enlightened; but the savage, who held a branch of the <b>plantain-tree</b> in his hand during his oration, concluded by casting this branch into the sea. This was meant as a sign of friendship, for soon after, a number of similar branches were thrown on the ship's deck, and then a few of the islanders ventured on board.|$|E
