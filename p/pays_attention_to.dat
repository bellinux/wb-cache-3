25|$|Understanding a {{particular}} musical style's treatment of dissonance—what is considered dissonant and what rules or procedures govern how dissonant intervals, chords, or notes are treated—is key in understanding that particular style. For instance, harmony is generally governed by chords, which are collections of notes defined as tolerably consonant by the style. (There is likely, however, to be {{a hierarchy of}} chords, with some considered more consonant and some more dissonant.) Any note that does not fall within the prevailing harmony is considered dissonant. A given style typically <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> how its musical structure approaches dissonance (in steps is less jarring, a leap is more jarring), and even more to how they resolve (almost always by step), to how they fit within the meter and rhythm (dissonances on strong beats are more emphatic, those on weaker beats less vital), and to how they lie within the phrase (dissonances tend to resolve at phrase's end).|$|E

25|$|The {{historians are}} also not {{unanimous}} about {{who led the}} missions to Rome and Constantinople. According to Yordan Ivanov the second mission was led by Sondoke, while Venedikov suggests it was Stazis. According to Gyuzelev the leading person in the Bulgarian delegation was Peter which was made clear during the Council of Constantinople. He emphasizes that according {{to the story of}} Anastasius Bibliothecarius the gifts to the Roman legates were sent through Peter. Peter is the person of the Bulgarian delegation in Constantinople who spoke at the Council. Gyuzelev also <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the letters of Pope John VIII. Letters were sent to Boris I (16 April 878 and May 879), to Doks— brother of Boris I (April 878), to Peter (16 April 878) and to high ranking boils including Peter (in the letter of May 879). In the letter of April 878 addressed personally to Peter the Pope called him comita (Petrum comitem). It has been suggested that under comita the Pope did not mean a regional governor but comes palatii, i. e. the first person in the court of the ruler. Gyuzelev concludes that Peter's role in the events between 866 and 879 is more important than that of the ichirgu-boil Stazis and therefore Peter must have been kavhan at least during that period.|$|E

I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{purposes}} of his contribution, Wissenburg takes many standard contentions in animal ethics for granted. However, he challenges mainstream animal ethicists' tendency to adopt the language of liberalism, which he suggests misconstrues nonhuman animals as individuals and posits false dichotomies about their status. This adoption of liberal ideas can come in Tom Regan's [...] "old" [...] form or Donaldson and Kymlicka's [...] "new" [...] form. Wissenburg challenges Donaldson and Kymlicka's extension of citizenship to nonhuman animals, and instead sketches the outline of an alternative proposal which <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> individual animals' modes of being. This he labels, paraphrasing Robert Nozick, [...] "liberalism for humans and feudalism for animals".|$|E

50|$|Attention {{decrement}} hypothesis: Information presented first has {{a greater}} influence on participants than information that is presented later, causing a primacy effect to occur, even if the information is consistent. Steiner and Rain (1989) explain people <b>pay</b> more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> information presented at the beginning, but progressively <b>pay</b> less <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the information presented to them. The primacy effect occurs because participants <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the beginning information and ignore the information presented later. On the other hand, if participants are {{in a situation where}} they have <b>to</b> continuously <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> information, a recency effect may occur.|$|R

NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) appeals to Jenna to allow Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) birthday celebration {{to be combined}} with hers, [...] as Tracy has never celebrated a birthday. Jenna dislikes the idea, but plays along. On her birthday, Jenna, upset that no one <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> her, decides to fake an injury to get sympathy, to no avail. To get attention, Jenna is seen riding a wheelchair, but this fails, so she gets fed up with everyone. Tracy sees Jenna jumping out of a wheelchair to get attention and tells her that his birthday wish was that she get better, after seeing her wear a back brace at the birthday party.|$|E
500|$|Minor {{characters}} include The Cowboy (Monty Montgomery, credited as Lafayette Montgomery), the Castigliani Brothers (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti) and Mr. Roque (Michael J. Anderson), all of {{whom are}} somehow involved in pressuring Adam to cast Camilla Rhodes in his film. These characters represent the death of creativity for film scholars, and they portray a [...] "vision of the industry as a closed hierarchical system in which the ultimate source of power remains hidden behind a series of representatives". Ann Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. Coco, {{in the first part of}} the film, represents the old guard in Hollywood, who welcomes and protects Betty. In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adam's mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Diane's embarrassed tale of how she got into acting.|$|E
500|$|Davidson was 39 {{years old}} at the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914. In October 1915, possibly to escape the increasingly turbulent atmosphere in the Stiffkey rectory, he joined the Royal Navy as a chaplain. He began his service on HMS Gibraltar, a depot ship based in the Shetland Islands, where he irritated his shipmates by calling church parades every time another ship visited the anchorage; he had the full approval of the base commander, Vice Admiral Sir Reginald Tupper, who was known as [...] "Holy Reggie". [...] Davidson's service report from Gibraltars captain records that [...] "he performs his duties in a perfunctory manner. Not on good terms with messmates, disregards mess rules and regulations". In October 1916 Davidson joined HMS Fox in the Middle East, and shortly afterwards was arrested by the naval police during a raid on a Cairo brothel. He explained that {{he was looking for a}} diseased prostitute who had been infecting his men. Again his commanding officer's reports were negative; however, Davidson remained with the Fox until August 1918 when he was posted to HMS Leviathan in the northern Atlantic. Here, his commander was slightly more complimentary; he found Davidson [...] "a clever writer and entertainer [...] <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> duty". Davidson left the Navy in March 1919.|$|E

500|$|More than 50 {{years since}} its release, [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] remains highly regarded, as {{measured}} by polls of reviewers and fellow songwriters. A 2002 ranking by Uncut and a 2005 poll in Mojo both rated it as Dylan's number one song. As for his personal views on such polls, Dylan told Ed Bradley in a 2004 interview on 60 Minutes that he never <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> them, because they change frequently. Dylan's point was illustrated in the [...] "100 Greatest Songs of All Time poll" [...] by Mojo in 2000, which included two Dylan singles, but not [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". Five years later, the magazine named it his number one song. Rolling Stone picked [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] as the number two single of the past 25 years in 1989, and then in 2004 placed the song at number one on its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". In 2010, Rolling Stone again placed [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] {{at the top of}} their list of [...] "500 Greatest Songs Of All Time".

Ryūji takes Taiga and Ami to the family diner to try out various foods, and he usually competes against Minori to see which dish is the best. There is a recurring gag in which Ryūji gets ignored when he gives boring trivial facts about the food. Moreover, Yūsaku declares each contest as a draw, but no one <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> him. Each episode ends with a segment titled [...] "Today's Inko", in which Ryūji's pet bird Inko struggles to say something.|$|E
2500|$|In brief, {{situation}} awareness {{is viewed as}} [...] "a state of knowledge," [...] and situational assessment as [...] "the processes" [...] used to achieve that knowledge. [...] Endsley argues that [...] "it is important to distinguish the term {{situation awareness}}, as a state of knowledge, from the processes used to achieve that state. These processes, which may vary widely among individuals and contexts, will {{be referred to as}} situational assessment or the process of achieving, acquiring, or maintaining SA." [...] Note that SA is not only produced by the processes of situational assessment, it also drives those same processes in a recurrent fashion. For example, one's current awareness can determine what one <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> next and how one interprets the information perceived.|$|E
2500|$|Verse 4 {{says that}} the believers pay Zakat, i.e. poor-due that is paid on one's wealth. Commentators on the Qur'an, like Ibn Kathir are {{of the opinion that}} this verse could also be {{referring}} to the poor-due mentioned in Sura 6:141 which states [...] "pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest.", as well as that it could be that what is meant here by Zakaat is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in Sura 91:9-10 which says [...] "Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself." [...] The commentators are hence of the opinion that probably both meanings are intended, purification of the soul as well as purification of one's wealth, because that is also part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who <b>pays</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> both matters.|$|E
