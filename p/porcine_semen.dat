40|$|Results {{obtained}} in fertility and litter size using frozen-thawed <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> {{are far from}} those obtained with natural service or artificial insemination of cooled semen. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate freeze-thawing of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> comparing the traditional slow method to a rapid curve of temperature descent, using two cryoprotectants. Six males of proven fertility (n= 6, r= 2) were used. Semen was obtained using the gloved-hand technique and was transported to the laboratory at 17 ºC diluted in Androstar® plus. Samples were centrifuged 15 minutes at 800 g and re-diluted in: a) 5 % dimethylformamide, 11 % lactose, 20 % egg yolk, 0. 5 % Equex or b) 3 % glycerol, 11 % lactose, 20 % egg yolk, 0. 5 % Equex. The semen was frozen in 0. 5 ml straws up to a final concentration of 300 millions sperm /ml using either a modified slow traditional Westendorff curve or a rapid curve. In both cases thawing was carried out at 37 ºC during 1 minute. Kinetic motility parameters were evaluated using a CASA system (ISAS v 1, Proiser®, Spain). Sperm viability and acrosome status were evaluated using the FITC-PNA/PI stain. The results were analyzed using a factorial design (analysis ofvariance) with two factors, with two levels for each one and using the male as a blocking factor. No interaction was observed between the parameters. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed between curves or between cryoprotectants neither in any of the kinetic motility parameters evaluated nor in sperm viability and acrosome status. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed between curves or between cryoprotectants in sperm morphology in thawed <b>porcine</b> <b>semen.</b> Taking into account the results obtained, the rapid curve would be the practical choice as it is, faster and more manageable for fieldwork in any pig farm...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of sperm and seminal plasma (SP) on the freezability of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen.</b> Semen of eight commercial males from two farms in the central-western region of Colombia (four boars in each farm) was frozen and tested to select two males with high freezability (MHF) and two with low freezability (MLF), according to the percentage of functionally competent sperm (FCS). Immediately after the collection was completed, the SP and sperm from the males selected were separated by centrifugation to combine the two types of plasma with the two types of sperm, incubate them for three hours and then freeze them. The variables evaluated were: sperm morphology, structural and functional integrity of plasmatic membrane, progressive and total motility, DNA fragmentation, acrosome integrity, capacitated sperm and FCS. The combination of sperm and plasma of MHF recorded the highest value (P< 0. 01) of acrosome integrity (24. 3 ± 0. 082 vs 6. 076 ± 0. 16) when compared to MLF plasma and cells. Membrane structural integrity was higher (P< 0. 01) with MHF (53. 56 ± 0. 0395) than with MLF plasma (47. 49 ± 0. 0419).

40|$|Dilution and {{extension}} of semen longevity {{has been widely}} used in the swine industry to improve reproductive efficiency and genetic progress through artificial insemination. Through the dilution {{and extension}} {{of the life of}} the sperm cell, other organisms such as bacteria are also maintained and can produce a negative impact on sperm cell motility and potential reproductive capacity. Bacterial contamination in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> is a widespread problem in semen collection facilities and routinely testing is essential to determine which organisms are present and the effectiveness of the antimicrobial in the semen diluents (extender). The antibiotics used in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> extenders are generally chosen to be effective against the most common bacterial contaminants, gram-negative bacteria. Two isolates, Achromobacter xylosoxidans (AX) and Ralstonia pickettii (RP), were identified in the water distillation system of a boar stud facility that uses this water to extend the raw semen and found to produce pyometras in sows post-insemination. The effects of these bacteria have not been investigated in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> diluents in long term storage (14 days). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of AX and RP on pH, motility, and progressive motility in culture negative semen samples over a 14 day period in 3 different diluents (BTS: Beltsville Thawing Solution; XC: X-cell; and TXC: Tri-X-cell; IMV USA; Maple Grove, MN, USA) at 16 ??C. Banked isolates of AX and RP were grown on Columbia blood agar for 48 h at 37 ??C. For each isolate, a single colony was selected and transferred to 10 ml of Luria broth and then incubated for 24 h at 37 ??C in 5 % CO 2. The broth cultures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. and used to make the final concentrations of approximately 2. 5 x 107 CFUs/ml (AX) and/or 2 x 106 CFUs/ml (RP). There were four treatment groups per extender: AX, RP, AX + RP, and Control (no bacteria added). All samples were incubated at 16 ??C and rotated once daily. Motility and morphology of all samples were viewed using the Computer Automated Semen Analysis Program (SpermVision??, Minitube of America, Verona, WI), and pH were measured daily for each sample. Data from 6 replicates were was analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measurements divided into 5 time periods (1 - 2 d; 3 - 5 d; 6 - 8 d; 9 - 11 d; and 12 - 14 d) post-inoculation. Overall, sample pH did not significantly increase over time, but was found to be the highest (p 0. 05) drastically in the semen samples inoculated with RP+AX as compared to AX, RP or Control sample. The motility of the samples remained similar during the first week of incubations, but began dropping during period 4 (9 - 11 days) with the most notable decline during period 5 (12 - 14 days). This study showed that the presence of A. xylosoxidans and R. pickettii in water for semen extension of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> does not detrimentally affect sperm motility or pH of the final solution regardless of choice of semen diluent...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine if the European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can be transmitted via spiked semen to preimmunized sows and induce reproductive failure. Sows were immunized with the North American PRRSV-based modified live vaccine (Ingelvac PRRSMLV; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, St. Joseph, MO) and were artificially inseminated. The sows were randomly divided into three groups. The vaccinated (group 2) and nonvaccinated (group 3) sows developed a PRRSV viremia at 7 to 28 days postinsemination with the European PRRSV-spiked semen. The number of genomic copies of the European PRRSV in serum samples was not significantly different between vacci-nated and nonvaccinated sows. All negative-control sows in group 1 farrowed at the expected date. The sows in groups 2 and 3 farrowed between 103 and 110 days after the first insemination. European PRRSV RNAwas detected in the lungs of 8 out of 11 live-born piglets and 46 out of 54 stillborn fetuses. In addition, PRRSV RNA was detected using in situ hybridization in other tissues from vaccinated sows that had been inseminated with European PRRSV-spiked semen (group 2). The present study has demonstrated that vaccinating sows with the North American PRRSV-based modified live vaccine does not prevent reproductive failure after insemination with European PRRSV-spiked <b>semen.</b> <b>Porcine</b> reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member of the Arterivirus genus (family Arteriviridae, or-der Nidovirales).

40|$|Semen {{preparation}} and cryopreservation require finely adjusted procedures. Gametes {{are sensitive to}} environmental stresses, so in vitro procedures aim to minimize the inevitable harmful conditions. Applying stress to precondition cells has only been investigated recently. Studies demonstrated that by utilizing a well defined and properly applied hydrostatic pressure (HP) stress treatment to spermatozoa before in vitro storage, cryopreservation or insemination, cell survival and fertility improved compared with untreated controls. The birth of healthy piglets from treated fresh or frozen-thawed semen demonstrates the in vivo safety of the procedure. Although the biological mechanism is still unclear, several processes incorporating cellular stress response might explain the observations. This paper summarizes results, background, aspects and considerations of HP treatment for <b>porcine</b> <b>semen.</b> The new principle, i. e. to improve the stress tolerance by a defined sublethal stress may outline a new strategy in assisted reproductive technologies with unique theoretical and practical consequences...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is to}} review: (a) the current status of swine AI in the world, (b) significance and limitation of AI with liquid and frozen semen, (c) the biological traits of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> in relation to in-vitro sperm storage, (d) the criteria used for selection of a boar stud as a semen supplier, (e) how to process boar semen for liquid and frozen storage in the commercial settings and (f) how to improve fertility and prolificacy of boar semen. More than 99 % of the inseminations conducted worldwide are made with liquid-stored semen. AI with frozen semen is used only for upgrading the genetic base in a particular country or herd. Determining the initial quality of semen ejaculates along with the selection of the optimum storage extender has a profound effect on the quality and fertility of AI doses. Different procedures have been used for improving the fertility of preserved spermatozoa including colloidal centrifugation of the semen, intrauterine insemination and modulation of the uterine defense mechanism after AI.

40|$|Objectives: Infections due to multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM) {{has emerged}} {{globally}} as important nosocomial infections. The role of this bacterium in animal diseases is still less investigated. SM {{was considered to}} be the cause of fleece rot in sheep and it has been isolated from fish, lizards, frogs, rabbit feces, captive snakes, and African crocodiles. SM DNA was also detected in dogs with knee arthritis/degenerative anterior cruciate ligament rupture, in squirrel feces, in <b>porcine</b> <b>semen,</b> in bovine and ovine milk, and from the gastrointestinal tract of laboratory animals. In veterinary medicine, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole resistant SM strains have been observed from horses, dogs and cats with chronic respiratory disease and urinary tract infections. The purposes of the present retrospective observational study were: - to establish the frequency of occurrence of SM infections in animals by body site of infection; - to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of SM isolates; - to assess the antibiotic resistance trends in animal SM strains from 2008 to 2013. Methods: Over 6 -yrs period, 77 SM clinical isolates from dog/cat (n= 46), horse/cattle (n= 27), and snake/turtle/parrot (n= 4) were identified by biochemical tests (Remel, Oxoid, Italy) and were subsequently tested by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method using single veterinary and human antibiotics.

40|$|Abstract. The oviduct {{plays a role}} in {{successful}} {{animal reproduction}} not only in spermatozoa and ova transport to the fertilization site but also by affording a microenvironment for fertilization and early embryonic development. The sperm reservoir (SR) is restricted in the uterotubal junction (UTJ) and caudal isthmus. Billions of porcine spermatozoa are distributed to the female reproductive tract during/after insemination, and small amounts of them are stored for about 36 – 40 hours in the SR, which maintains sperm viability in the pre-ovulation period through its surface epithelium and production of fluid. The SR regulates the release of spermatozoa so that only a small population moves towards the fertilization site (ampulla) to decrease polyspermy. This review attempts to provide information about the structure and function of the porcine SR, its intraluminal content (hyaluronan, HA), and the influences of HA on porcine spermatozoa in vivo. In pigs, the spermatozoa are stored in a mucous-like fluid within the UTJ and caudal isthmus in the pre-ovulation period. The oviduct fluid contains sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and non-sulfated GAGs, i. e., HA. It {{is interesting to note that}} HA is synthesized by hyaluronan synthase- 3 (HAS- 3), and its receptor, CD 44, is found in the epithelium of the porcine SR site. Additionally, sperm capacitation does not occur in vivo in the SR during the pre- and peri-ovulation periods, but spermatozoa in the SR will attempt to capacitate if exposed to bicarbonate. However, capacitation in the SR will rise in the post-ovulation period, indicating the role of HA in modulating sperm capacitation after ovulation. All data support the understanding that the porcine SR ensures the viability of fertile spermatozoa and maintains the non-capacitated status during the pre-ovulation period. This basic knowledge about the SR is believed to be useful to advance sperm preparation procedures for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and improve the preservation process of <b>porcine</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) is an {{emerging}} virus {{that may result}} in devastating disease that affects swine herds worldwide. Only a decade has passed since researchers began to study {{the characteristics of the}} virus and the resulting diseases, and limited information was available regarding the long term presence or persistence of the virus in healthy swine herds. Our research contributes to the knowledge of the persistence of the virus in serum and semen, and the PCV 2 antibody profile in healthy pigs. In addition, we developed a novel quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and quantified the PCV 2 -shedding in healthy and PCVD (porcine circovirus disease) -affected pigs. Lastly, we determined the efficacy of a novel vaccine in a subset of pigs from a PCVD-affected herd. Porcine serum was assayed by two PCR protocols (nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and non-nested PCR) and a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) to determine when PCV 2 viremia and a rise in the serum level of PCV 2 -specific antibody (Ab) occurred in pigs raised in a large Canadian farrow-to-finish barn. Eight serial blood samples were collected from each of 40 pigs from 5 to 156 (± 1. 5) days of age; six pigs were removed from the study for various reasons at various times. Viremia was not detected in the samples collected before 72 days of age but was detected in those collected on or after 72 days: of 33 pigs, seven (21 %) had only one serum sample positive for PCV 2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by nPCR after day 72; 11 (33 %) were intermittently positive by nPCR, non-nested PCR, or both between 72 and 156 days; and the remaining 15 (45 %) were repeatedly positive (in two to four samples). The level of serum Ab against PCV 2 declined after weaning and increased between 72 and 107 days of age, only after PCV 2 was detected in serum. Our results show that PCV 2 viremia persists in the presence of elevated levels of PCV 2 -specific Ab. In a separate study, we determined the long term presence or persistence of PCV 2 -shedding in semen from healthy boars and the effects of PCV 2 on sperm quality. A nPCR protocol was applied to <b>porcine</b> <b>semen</b> to demonstrate the PCV 2 -shedding patterns and duration in naturally-infected boars. Sperm morphology analysis was performed on a subset of samples to determine if the presence of PCV 2 DNA in semen was associated with reduced semen quality. Semen was collected serially from 43 boars representing six breeds, aged 33. 9 to 149. 3 weeks. Of the 903 semen samples collected, 30 samples (3. 3 %) were positive for PCV 2 DNA by nPCR from 13 boars. Boars shedding PCV 2 DNA in semen ranged between 35. 9 and 71. 0 weeks of age, and shedding occurred over a period of up to 27. 3 weeks. A semen nPCR test was 2. 6 {{times more likely to be}} positive when collected from pigs that were ≤ 52 weeks of age and 3. 0 times more likely to be positive when collected from pigs that were ≤ 26 weeks from the time of entry into the stud main unit (Generalized Estimating Equations: P= 0. 02; 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the Odd’s ratio (OR) 1. 2 to 5. 5 and P= 0. 01; 95 % CI of the OR 1. 3 to 6. 9, respectively). PCV 2 DNA was detected in semen from Duroc and Landrace boars only; however, the semen of the Hamline, Large White maternal, Large White paternal, and Meishan-synthetic boars were negative for PCV 2 DNA. These results demonstrate a sporadic and long-term shedding pattern of PCV 2 DNA in semen from naturally-infected boars. PCV 2 DNA in semen did not have detrimental effects on sperm morphology; however, boar age and possibly breed may contribute to the persistence of PCV 2 -shedding in semen. To further our studies of PCV 2 -shedding from pigs, a PCV 2 quantitative molecular assay was developed using SYBR green technology. This assay allowed for the simultaneous quantification of all the genotypes of PCV 2. The emergence of multiple genotypes of PCV 2, as demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis of whole genome or capsid sequences, makes it necessary to have quantitative diagnostic assays that perform equally well on all strains. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a novel real-time PCR assay targeting the highly conserved replication-associated gene (Rep) open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) and investigate the effects of diagnostic specimen choice on its performance. The assay was tested in naturally-infected conventional pigs, experimentally-infected gnotobiotic pigs, and plasmid-spiked negative serum, lung tissue, and feces and found to have a linear detection range of 2. 2 × 103 to 2. 2 × 1010 copies of PCV 2 per mL. The assay successfully detected and quantified PCV 2 DNA in serum, buffy coat, feces, and multiple lymphoid (bronchial, mesenteric, and superficial inguinal lymph nodes, thymus, tonsil, ileal Peyer’s patches, and spleen) and non-lymphoid (myocardium, lung, kidney, liver, and gluteal muscle) tissues from naturally-infected pigs. Across all tissues and sera of naturally-infected pigs, the mean PCV 2 concentration was 3. 0 logs higher in pigs that were demonstrating weight loss, as a primary clinical sign of PMWS (postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome) when compared with PMWS-nonaffected pigs. PCV 2 concentration measured by tissue culture and immunohistochemical staining in homogenized liver samples of experimentally-infected gnotobiotic pigs were compared to the concentrations estimated by quantitative PCR. Similar trends were noted with increasing PCV 2 concentration detected in subclinically-infected to severely PMWS-affected pigs across all assays. Our diagnostic assay was developed with a conserved target sequence, and performed efficiently in the quantification of PCV 2 in a variety of tissues from naturally- and experimentally-infected pigs. With a quantitative assay, we then determined the amount of PCV 2 -shedding in feces between healthy and PCVD-affected herds. This study examined if pigs (n= 100) in a PCVD-affected herd shed more PCV 2 in their feces than pigs in a PCVD-nonaffected herd (n= 101), and if differences in shedding among production stages within and between the herds existed. The PCV 2 -shedding was quantified by real-time PCR. The highest median PCV 2 -shedding was found in the nursery stage of the PCVD-affected herd and in the grower stage of the PCVD-nonaffected herd. The PCV 2 -shedding was significantly higher in earlier stages (newly weaned, nursery, and pregrower) in the PCVD-affected herd (Wilcoxon Rank Sum; P< 0. 001) compared with the PCVD-nonaffected herd. PCV 2 DNA was not detected in a significant proportion of lactating sows (parity ≥ 3) in the PCVD-nonaffected herd (Fisher’s Exact Test; P= 0. 001) compared with the PCVD-affected herd. The results of this study suggest there may be an association between the presence of PCV 2 in the feces of lactating sows and increased PCV 2 -shedding in younger pigs. The quantitative PCR assay was used in a field study to determine the efficacy of a novel transdermal immune stimulating complex (ISCOM) technology-based PCV 2 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidate administered at one and three weeks of age. Fifty-four pigs (vaccinates (VX) (n= 27); non-vaccinated controls (CTRL) (n= 27)) with variable levels of maternally-derived antibodies (MDAb) (high (hiMDAb) versus low (loMDAb)) in a PCVD-affected farm were assessed for PCV 2 -specific Ab levels by cELISA, PCV 2 DNA concentration in serum and feces by quantitative PCR, mortality, and average daily gain (ADG) from 1 to 18 weeks of age. A significant reduction in mortality (P= 0. 05) was observed in the VX. PCV 2 DNA concentration in serum was lower in the VX at 9 and 11 weeks of age (P= 0. 003 and 0. 01, respectively). The VX (both hiMDAb and loMDAb groups) at nine weeks of age had a higher Ab response to natural PCV 2 exposure, while the CTRL (both hiMDAb and loMDAb groups) had a significantly reduced Ab response in comparison. This suggests a priming of the immune response against PCV 2 infection by use of the vaccine. During this period from 9 to 11 weeks of age, the loMDAb CTRL were susceptible to PCVD. PCV 2 -specific Ab in serum was significantly higher in the VX at the onset of PCVD-related mortality (P= 0. 001); however, no significant difference was observed in the PCV 2 DNA concentration shed in feces, or in ADG between VX and CTRL. The benefit of the novel ISCOM vaccine was most evident in the loMDAb VX, as these pigs were protected from a PCVD-related death that was otherwise experienced in the loMDAb CTRL. However, producers and veterinarians using a vaccine against PCV 2 would expect a significant improvement in ADG and reduced viral shedding in feces. Although the vaccine prevented a PCVD-related death in the highest risk population, the loMDAb group, modifications regarding the protein or ISCOM concentration, or PCV 2 protein construction should be considered to potentially improve the vaccine’s efficacy. This study is the first report of the use of an ISCOM matrix (Matrix Q) mixed with PCV 2 VLP protein administered transdermally for the prevention of PCVD in swine...|$|E
