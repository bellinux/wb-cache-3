5|$|If was a digest-sized {{magazine}} {{throughout its}} life. It began at 164 pages {{and with only}} the fifth issue, November 1952, dropped to 124 pages. The page count increased again to 134 <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> the July 1959 issue, and to 164 <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> the September 1965 issue; it stayed at this length until the September–October 1970 issue. The page count was then increased to 180 with the June 1971 issue, and to 164 for the very last issue, December 1974. It was priced at 35 cents to begin with, and increased to 40 cents with the March 1963 issue, to 50 cents with the December 1964 issue, to 60 cents with the August 1967 issue, and finally to 75 cents with the September–October 1970 issue. With the April 1972 issue, UPD began using card stock for the covers, rather than paper, and continued to do so until the magazine ceased publication.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> four full-page colour frames, thus bringing {{it up to the}} standard 62-page format.|$|E
40|$|Redaction is {{the process}} of {{removing}} data from a <b>page.</b> <b>With</b> printed <b>pages,</b> redaction involves blacking-out or cutting-out areas of the printed <b>page.</b> <b>With</b> electronic documents that use formats such as PDF, redaction involves removing (not just obscuring) content within a region.

Often pages had the canal 'straightened' mid <b>page,</b> <b>with</b> the location of north changing at the split point.|$|R

5|$|In May 1941, a paper {{shortage}} {{led to the}} Soir-Jeunesse being {{reduced to}} four <b>pages,</b> <b>with</b> {{the length of the}} Tintin strip being cut by two thirds. Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with The Crab with the Golden Claws being moved into Le Soir itself, where it became a daily strip. While some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, he was heavily enticed by the size of 's readership, which reached 600,000.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> smaller decorations.|$|E
5|$|As a {{guide to}} the {{contents}} of each chapter, musical notations were added before the chapter number. In School Rumble, chapters marked with a sharp sign(♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign(♭). The one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder, which uses the natural sign(♮). School Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> each page telling a self-contained story.|$|E

5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be erased only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the data {{in some of the}} pages of the block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only the <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. Garbage collection {{is a big part of}} write amplification on the SSD.|$|E
5|$|The lavish {{illumination}} programme is {{far greater}} than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits, three <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> the four evangelist symbols, a carpet page, a miniature of the Virgin and Child, a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ. There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages {{for the first few}} words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.|$|E
