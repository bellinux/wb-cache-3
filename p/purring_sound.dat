25|$|Information on {{fennec fox}} social {{behavior}} is mainly based on captive animals. The basic social unit {{is thought to}} be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are believed to remain in the family even after a new litter is born. Playing behavior is common, including among adults of the species. Fennec foxes make a variety of sounds, including barking, a <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> similar to that of a domestic cat, and a snarl if threatened.|$|E
500|$|A {{bubbling}} or <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> is {{made when}} the guinea pig is enjoying itself, {{such as when}} being petted or held. It may also make this sound when grooming, crawling around to investigate a new place, or when given food.|$|E
60|$|And then, slowly {{uncoiling}} their tentacles, {{they all}} began moving towards him--creeping at first deliberately, {{and making a}} soft <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> to each other.|$|E
60|$|Closer {{and closer}} they crept toward the unsuspecting beast, Sheeta upon {{his right side}} and Tarzan upon his left nearest the great heart. They had hunted {{together}} now for some time, so that they worked in unison, with only low, <b>purring</b> <b>sounds</b> as signals.|$|R
50|$|Pichis are solitary {{outside of}} the mating season. When threatened, they wedge {{themselves}} into their shallow burrow {{making it difficult for}} an attacker to drag them out because of their jagged scales, or else lie flat on the ground to protect their vulnerable belly. They have been reported to make both <b>purring</b> <b>sounds</b> and a loud grunt or scream.|$|R
500|$|The Atlantic puffin has {{a direct}} flight, {{typically}} [...] above the sea surface and higher over the water than most other auks. It mostly moves by paddling along efficiently with its webbed feet and seldom takes to the air. It is typically silent at sea, except for the soft <b>purring</b> <b>sounds</b> it sometimes makes in flight. At the breeding colony it is quiet above ground but in its burrow makes a growling sound somewhat resembling a chainsaw being revved up.|$|R
60|$|On {{his lips}} was the soothing, <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> {{that the great}} cats {{themselves}} made when contented and happy. It was the nearest approach to a friendly advance that Tarzan could make {{in the language of}} Sheeta.|$|E
6000|$|Just {{what the}} man said after that Uncle Ethan didn't follow. His voice had a {{confidential}} <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> as he stretched across the wagon-seat and talked on, eyes half shut. He straightened up at last, and concluded {{in the tone of}} one who has carried his point: ...|$|E
60|$|Instantly every eye {{turned toward}} {{one member of}} the herd, a large fellow who evidently was the leader. A strange <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> issued from the mouth in the palm of one of his hands, {{and at the same time}} he started rapidly toward the bluff, {{followed}} by the entire herd.|$|E
5000|$|.....Skye Edwards {{operates}} with an understated <b>purr</b> that <b>sounds</b> like Sade {{filtered through}} Portishead....she has enough hypnotic charms and charisma {{to counter the}} dangers of techno-riff overkill. - Rating: B+ (Entertainment Weekly, 8 November 1996) ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{completing}} the game, the screen reverts {{from the final}} maze to the wilderness map, where the dragon's <b>purring</b> no longer <b>sounds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kevin Ash wrote, [...] "the {{performance}} feels distinctly retro too, {{but in a}} {{good way,}} as the W800 <b>purrs</b> along. The <b>sound</b> is friendly and mellow and the engine pulls well enough not to feel breathless, as the W650 could". The 360Â° engine has a balance shaft to reduce vibration.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the secret}} of Thuvia's {{excitement}} became apparent as from her lips there issued the <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> I had heard once before; that time that, within the Golden Cliffs, she called the fierce banths about her and led them as a shepherdess might lead her flock of meek and harmless sheep.|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} move towards the spot where Fenn lay {{crouching}} behind a bush. Mr Mulholland followed, mildly amused. They were a dozen yards away when Fenn, debating in his mind whether {{it would not be}} better--as it would certainly be more dignified--for him to rise and deliver himself up to justice instead of waiting to be discovered wallowing in the damp grass behind a laurel bush, was aware of something soft and furry pressing against his knuckles. A soft <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> reached his ears.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had struck}} a light; the wood {{was already in}} a blaze; and truly, when contrasted with the darkness, the wild tumult of the tempest without, that {{peaceful}} glow which began to beam on the now animated hearth, seemed very cheering. A low, <b>purring</b> <b>sound,</b> from some quarter, announced that another being, besides myself, {{was pleased with the}} change; a black cat, roused by the light from its sleep on a little cushioned foot-stool, came and rubbed its head against Frances' gown as she knelt; she caressed it, saying it had been a favourite with her [...] "pauvre tante Julienne." ...|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make <b>purring</b> (or cooing) <b>sounds</b> when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|R
5|$|One {{recorded}} case of courtship behavior involving curve-billed thrashers describes two males attacking {{each other}} vigorously and resorting to <b>purring</b> and hissings <b>sounds</b> when neither bird appeared to relent. The two males then puffed up their chests and strutted {{up and down}} in front of the female. They continued to alternate between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|R
50|$|Some vocalizations {{of black}} titi are listed here: (1). Morning duet - the most {{commonly}} heard vocalization of the pair, singing in duet, complex and utilized to defend territory; it is interchanged with neighboring groups as counter-singing; (2) danger peep - various soft, high-pitched peeps but sometimes low intensity, advising of danger; very difficult to localize; (3) <b>purr</b> - <b>sounds</b> {{very much like a}} cat's purr; used by all members of the group to show contentment, affection or request for food, grooming or contact; (4) rough growl - given by young animals when complaining of rain or when greeting adults; (5) sharp scream - when fighting to express extra disgust; (6) play growl - low, gargling growl used in play and changing in tone, terminating in interrogative tone; (7) soft whine - especially young animals but also adults when requesting something of another such as food or while grooming another; (8) bark - loud, sharp and sudden bark when molested by the unwelcome close presence of other larger primates such as Lagothrix, Cebus, Ateles or raptors.|$|R
6000|$|Robert bowed {{in silent}} {{appreciation}} of his master's humour and began ladling out soup at the sideboard. Tallente's lips were curled a little, partly in self-contempt, with perhaps just {{a dash of}} self-pity. It had come to this, then, that he must dine with fancies rather than alone, that this tardily developed streak of sentimentality must be ministered to or would drag him {{into the depths of}} dejection. He began to understand the psychology of its late appearance. Stella's artificial companionship had kept his thoughts imprisoned, fettered with the meshes of an instinctive fidelity, and had driven him sedulously to the solace of work and books. Now that it was removed and he was to all practical purposes a free man, they took their own course. His life had suddenly become a natural one, and all that was human in him responded to the possibilities of his solitude, He had had as yet no time to experience the relief, to appreciate his liberty, before he was face to face with this new loneliness. To-night, he thought, as he looked at the empty place and remembered his wistful, almost diffident invitation, the solitude was almost unendurable. If she had only understood how much it meant, surely she would have made some effort, would not have been content with that half-embarrassed, half-doubtful shake of the head! In the darkened room, with the throb of the sea and the crackling of the lop in his ears, and only Robert's silent form for company, he felt a sudden craving for the things of his youth, for another side of life, the restaurants, the bright eyes of women, the whispered words of pleasant sentiment, the perfume shaken into the atmosphere they created, the low music in the background [...] "I beg your pardon, sir," [...] Robert said in his ear, [...] "your soup. Gertrude has taken such pains with the dinner, sir," [...] he added diffidently. [...] "If I might take the liberty of suggesting it, it would be as well if you could eat something." [...] Tallente took up his spoon. Then they both started, they both turned to the window. A light had flashed into the room, a low, <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> came from outside.|$|E

5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known as}} the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher, is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous gopher forages for vegetable and plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes color and texture over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth; males and females make <b>purring</b> (or crooning) <b>sounds</b> when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|R
40|$|Background. Syngnathid fishes produce {{three kinds}} of sounds, named click, growl and <b>purr.</b> These <b>sounds</b> are {{generated}} by different mechanisms to give a consistent signal pattern or signature which is believed {{to play a role}} in intraspecific and interspecific communication. Commonly known sounds are produced when the fish feeds (click, purr) or is under duress (growl). While there are more acoustic studies on seahorses, pipefishes have not received much attention. Here we document the differences in feeding click signals between three species of pipefishes and relate them to cranial morphology and kinesis, or the sound-producing mechanism. Methods. The feeding clicks of two species of freshwater pipefishes, Doryichthys martensii and Doryichthys deokhathoides and one species of estuarine pipefish, Syngnathoides biaculeatus, were recorded by a hydrophone in acoustic dampened tanks. The acoustic signals were analysed using time-scale distribution (or scalogram) based on wavelet transform. A detailed time-varying analysis of the spectral contents of the localized acoustic signal was obtained by jointly interpreting the oscillogram, scalogram and power spectrum. The heads of both Doryichthys species were prepared for microtomographical scans which were analysed using a 3 D imaging software. Additionally, the cranial bones of all three species were examined using a clearing and double-staining method for histological studies. Results. The sound characteristics of the feeding click of the pipefish is species-specific, appearing to be dependent on three bones: the supraoccipital, 1 st postcranial plate and 2 nd postcranial plate. The sounds are generated when the head of the Dorichthyes pipefishes flexes backward during the feeding strike, as the supraoccipital slides backwards, striking and pushing the 1 st postcranial plate against (and striking) the 2 nd postcranial plate. In the Syngnathoides pipefish, in the absence of the 1 st postcranial plate, the supraoccipital rubs against the 2 nd postcranial plate twice as it is pulled backward and released on the return. Cranial morphology and kinesis produce acoustic signals consistent with the bone strikes that produce sharp energy spikes (discrete or merged), or stridulations between bones that produce repeated or multimodal sinusoidal waveforms. Discussion. The variable structure of the sound-producing mechanism explains the unique acoustic signatures of the three species of pipefish. The differences in cranial bone morphology, cranial kinesis and acoustic signatures among pipefishes (and seahorses) could be attributed to independent evolution within the Syngnathidae, which warrants further investigation...|$|R

50|$|The {{song was}} first {{released}} in France {{as a single}} where it was wildly successful. The song features Kitt singing in a low, seductive-sounding voice. Included in the song are some sounds {{that have come to}} be associated with Kitt, including a <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> similar to one she made while portraying Catwoman on the 1960s TV series Batman. The lyrics to the song detail specific things the singer expects to receive from her future lover, such as a trip to Saint-Tropez and shopping at Tiffany's.|$|E
5000|$|One common {{display is}} the bowing display, where the legs are held {{straight}} {{and the body}} held vertically, with the breast almost touching the ground. This display has only been observed being performed by males. During this display the pitta makes a <b>purring</b> <b>sound</b> made at no other time. This display is territorial, and is performed by neighbours along territorial boundaries, one bird displaying after another. The display and purring call are adapted to be noticeable {{in the dim light}} of the forest floor yet not so conspicuous so as to attract predators. The most commonly given call [...] "teow-whit, teow-whit" [...] or [...] "choowip-choowip" [...] is probably territorial as well.|$|E
