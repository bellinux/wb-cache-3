40|$|Purpose. Considerable {{responsibility}} for safety of operation rests on signal telephone and telegraph department of railway. One {{of the most}} attackable nodes (both automation systems, and railway in whole) is track switches. The aim of this investigation is developing such system for monitoring and diagnostics of track switches, which would fully {{meet the requirements of}} modern conditions of high-speed motion and heavy trains and producing diagnostics, collection and systematization of data in an automated way.

In order to achieve the desired objectives research of a structure and the operating principle description of the switch electric drive, sequence of triggering its main units were carried out.

40|$|Purpose. In {{order to}} ensure reliability, security, and the most {{important}} the continuity of the transportation process, it is necessary to develop, implement, and then improve the automated methods of diagnostic mechanisms, devices and rail transport systems. Only systems that operate in real time mode and transmit data on the instantaneous state of the control objects can timely detect any faults and thus provide additional time for their correction by railway employees. Turnouts {{are one of the most}} important and responsible components, and therefore require the development and implementation of such diagnostics system. Methodology. Achieving the goal of monitoring and control of railway automation objects in real time is possible only with the use of an automated process of the objects state diagnosing. For this we need to know the diagnostic features of a control object, which determine its state at any given time. The most rational way of remote diagnostics is the shape and current spectrum analysis that flows in the power circuits of railway automatics. Turnouts include electric motors, which are powered by electric circuits, and the shape of the current curve depends on both the condition of the electric motor, and the conditions of the turnout maintenance. Findings. For the research and analysis of AC electric <b>point</b> <b>motor</b> it was developed its mathematical model.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the uniformity of the muscle <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> location for lower limb muscles in healthy subjects. Fifty-three subjects of both genders (age range: 18 - 50 years) were recruited.

The muscle <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> was identified by scanning the skin surface with a stimulation pen electrode and corresponded to the location of the skin area above the muscle in which an electrical pulse evoked a muscle twitch with the least injected current.

40|$|During {{sustained}} maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), most fatigue occurs {{within the}} muscle, but some occurs because voluntary {{activation of the}} muscle declines (central fatigue), and some of this reflects suboptimal output from the motor cortex (supraspinal fatigue). This study examines whether supraspinal fatigue occurs during a sustained submaximal contraction of 5 % MVC. Eight subjects sustained an isometric elbow flexion of 5 % MVC for 70 min. Brief MVCs were performed every 3 min, with stimulation of the motor <b>point,</b> <b>motor</b> cortex, and brachial plexus. Perceived effort and pain, elbow flexion torque, and surface EMGs from biceps and brachioradialis were recorded. During the sustained 5 % contraction, perceived effort increased from 0. 5 to 3. 9 (out of 10), and elbow flexor EMG increased steadily by ~ 60 – 80 %. Torque during brief MVCs fell to 72 % of control values, while both the resting twitch and EMG declined progressively. Thus the sustained weak contraction caused fatigue, some of which was due to peripheral mechanisms. Voluntary activation measured by motor point and motor cortex stimulation methods fell to 90 % and 80 %, respectively. Thus some of the fatigue was central. Calculations based on the fall in voluntary activation measured with cortical stimulation indicate that {{about two-thirds of the}} fatigue was due to supraspinal mechanisms. Therefore, sustained performance of a very low-force contraction produces a progressive inability to drive the motor cortex optimally during brief MVCs. The effect of central fatigue on performance of the weak contraction is less clear, but it may contribute to the increase in perceived effort...|$|E

This study compared the efficacy of two poststroke upper limb therapy protocols. Aims and/or hypothesis We tested the hypothesis that Wii-based movement therapy would {{be as effective as}} modified constraint-induced movement therapy for post-stroke upper-limb motor rehabilitation. Methods Forty-one patients, 2 – 46 months poststroke, completed a 14 -day program of Wii-based Movement Therapy or modified Constraint-induced Movement Therapy in a dose-matched, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial, conducted in a research institute or patient 2 ̆ 7 s homes. Primary outcome measures were the Wolf Motor Function Test timed-tasks and Motor Activity Log Quality of Movement scale. Patients were assessed at prebaseline (14 days pretherapy), baseline, post-therapy, and six-month follow-up. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models and repeated measures analysis of variance. Results There were no differences between groups for either primary outcome at any time <b>point.</b> <b>Motor</b> function was stable between prebaseline and baseline (P[*] 3 ̆e [*] 0 · 05), improved with therapy (P[*] 3 ̆c [*] 0 · 001); and improvements were maintained at six-months (P[*] 3 ̆e [*] 0 · 05). Wolf Motor Function Test timed-tasks log times improved from 2 · 1 [*]±[*] 0 · 22 to 1 · 7 [*]±[*] 0 · 22 [*]s after Wii-based Movement Therapy, and 2 · 6 [*]±[*] 0 · 23 to 2 · 3 [*]±[*] 0 · 24 [*]s after modified Constraint-induced Movement Therapy. Motor Activity Log Quality of Movement scale scores improved from 67 · 7 [*]±[*] 6 · 07 to 102 · 4 [*]±[*] 6 · 48 after Wii-based Movement Therapy and 64 · 1 [*]±[*] 7 · 30 to 93 · 0 [*]±[*] 5 · 95 after modified Constraint-induced Movement Therapy (mean[*]±[*]standard error of the mean). Patient preference, acceptance, and continued engagement were higher for Wii-based Movement Therapy than modified Constraint-induced Movement Therapy.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} twitch {{in response}} to increasing electrical stimulus intensity, delivered both over the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> and <b>motor</b> nerve, was recorded in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and the adductor pollicis (AP), and only over the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> in the soleus (Sol), lateral (LG), and medial (MG) gastrocnemius muscles of human subjects. The relationship between intensity of electrical stimulation (ES) and twitch torque showed a positive linear regression in all muscles. In the FDI and AP the relationship was not significantly different when ES was applied at the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> or over the motor nerve. At small intensities of activation, ES induced larger twitch torques in the MG and LG, which contain a roughly equal proportion of slow and fast motor units (MUs) compared to the Sol, which is composed mainly of slow type fibres. Moreover, the relationship between ES intensity and twitch time-to-peak is best fitted in all muscles by a power curve that shows a greater twitch time-to-peak range in its initial part for muscles containing {{a larger proportion of}} fast MUs (LG, MG) than for muscles mainly composed of slow MUs (Sol). In conclusion, these results induced by ES at the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> and/or over the motor nerve confirm the concept of a reversed sequence of MU activation, as compared to voluntary contractions, and document this viewpoint in muscles of different function and composition.
