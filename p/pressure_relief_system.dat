40|$|This paper expands on {{previous}} work that examined how large a fire {{a crew member}} could successfully survive and extinguish {{in the confines of}} a spacecraft. The hazards to the crew and equipment during an accidental fire include excessive pressure rise resulting in a catastrophic rupture of the vehicle skin, excessive temperatures that burn or incapacitate the crew (due to hyperthermia), carbon dioxide build-up or accumulation of other combustion products (e. g. carbon monoxide). The previous work introduced a simplified model that treated the fire primarily as a source of heat and combustion products and sink for oxygen prescribed (input to the model) based on terrestrial standards. The model further treated the spacecraft as a closed system with no capability to vent to the vacuum of space. The model in the present work extends this analysis to more realistically treat the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>system(s)</b> of the spacecraft, include more combustion products (e. g.

40|$|Due to the Three Mile Island {{accident}} in 1979 the Swedish government took {{the decision in}} 1986 to impose a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> for Swedish BWR’s which prevents containment overpressure in case of LOCA. This <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> consists of a rupture disks in two different systems, non-filtered system 361 and filtered system 362. During a steam line break {{it is not clear}} if an unjustified activation of rupture disk 361 or 362 could possibly occur. If significant amount of nitrogen will leak out from the containment then, there is a risk of low pressure in the containment (e. g. due to activation of containment spray) with leaking rupture disks, which might cause air inflow to the containment and burning of hydrogen, so conditions of activation of rupture disk must be studied. The main objective of this master thesis is the investigation of conditions of activation of rupture disk in BWR containment filtering system. In order to find out these conditions specific software called GOTHIC has been used. The methodology of this master thesis has been modeling different containments with GOTHIC software; this thesis work will go from a simple GOTHIC model, that consist in nine lumped control volumes connected by flow paths, until a more complex GOTHIC model that consist in a combination of lumped and 3 D control volumes, connected among them by flow paths and 3 D connectors. A large LOCA in {{the upper part of the}} reactor vessel will be considerate, due to this severe accident; conditions for the activation of the rupture disk will be complying. It has to be mentioned that pressure in the lumped modeling will be lower than pressure in the 3 D volumes. Activation time for the lumped modeling will be 8, 5 seconds after the steam break for system 362 and activation time for 3 D modeling will be 2, 8 seconds for system 362 as well. In neither case 361 system will be activated. Considering this is a nuclear safety study and accuracy must be a key point, for further investigations it might be more than advisable using 3 D control volumes instead of lumped control volumes. It has to be mentioned also that due to there is no experimental data, uncertainty regarding to the results exist, and if a further safety analysis want to be done, sensitive study of the parameters implemented on GOTHIC software should be performed in the future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Pressure {{relief valve}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} devices used on the security of pipelines, since it is responsible to guarantee the integrity of the installations. Generally, the response and behavior of a relief valve during its transient is unknown by users, who employ simplified and static analysis to design the pipeline, further, the information provided by manufactures is limited. The flow-pressure, displacement-time and pressure –time relationships are an important external characteristic of the pressure relief valve and the hydraulic circuit. So, many engineers have been put an effort on this topic for its significant impact on the overall hydraulic system. Most of them are focused on the influences of the pressure relief valves, their selections and applications. It is very important to select, size, locate properly and maintain the pressure relief systems to prevent or minimize the losses from major incidents. Detail of selection and sizing of pressure relief valve is shown the following sections of this study. In order to help the circuit operators, a few flow charts are also included. <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> is used to protect piping and equipment against excessive overpressure for equipment and personnel safety...|$|E

Once at apogee, {{about half an hour}} after MECO, the Shuttle's Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines were fired to raise its perigee and achieve orbit, while the external tank fell back into the atmosphere and burned up over the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean depending on launch profile. [...] The sealing action of the tank plumbing and lack of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> on the external tank helped it break up in the lower atmosphere.

40|$|The aircraft-based Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a {{platform}} for multiple infrared astronomical observation experiments. These experiments carry sensors cooled to liquid helium temperatures. The liquid helium supply is contained in large (i. e., 10 liters or more) vacuum-insulated dewars. Should the dewar vacuum insulation fail, the inrushing air will condense and freeze on the dewar wall, resulting in a large heat flux on the dewar's contents. The heat flux results in a rise in pressure and the actuation of the dewar <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>system.</b> A previous NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) assessment provided recommendations for the wall heat flux that would be expected from a loss of vacuum and detailed an appropriate method to use in calculating the maximum pressure that would occur {{in a loss of}} vacuum event. This method involved building a detailed supercritical helium compressible flow thermal/fluid model of the vent stack and exercising the model over the appropriate range of parameters. The experimenters designing science instruments for SOFIA are not experts in compressible supercritical flows and do not generally have access to the thermal/fluid modeling packages that are required to build detailed models of the vent stacks. Therefore, the SOFIA Program engaged the NESC to develop a simplified methodology to estimate the maximum pressure in a liquid helium dewar after the loss of vacuum insulation. The method would allow the university-based science instrument development teams to conservatively determine the cryostat's vent neck sizing during preliminary design of new SOFIA Science Instruments. This report details the development of the simplified method, the method itself, and the limits of its applicability. The simplified methodology provides an estimate of the dewar pressure after a loss of vacuum insulation {{that can be used for}} the initial design of the liquid helium dewar vent stacks. However, since it is not an exact tool, final verification of the dewar pressure vessel design requires a complete, detailed real fluid compressible flow model of the vent stack. The wall heat flux resulting from a loss of vacuum insulation increases the dewar pressure, which actuates the pressure relief mechanism and results in high-speed flow through the dewar vent stack. At high pressures, the flow can be choked at the vent stack inlet, at the exit, or at an intermediate transition or restriction. During previous SOFIA analyses, it was observed that there was generally a readily identifiable section of the vent stack that would limit the flow e. g., a small diameter entrance or an orifice. It was also found that when the supercritical helium was approximated as an ideal gas at the dewar condition, the calculated mass flow rate based on choking at the limiting entrance or transition was less than the mass flow rate calculated using the detailed real fluid model 2. Using this lower mass flow rate would yield a conservative prediction of the dewars wall heat flux capability. The simplified method of the current work was developed by building on this observation...|$|E

However experiences shows limitations in applications on cryogenic pressure vessels: Set pressure varies in a wide range, unauthorized increase of set pressure, seat not tight etc. Alternatively, in some applications, spring related relief valves with cold seating, so called “Quench Relief Valves” (QRV) are used. Beside their relief function further functionalities like tight seating for system isolation as well as shut-off function for bypass precooling may be requested.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{liquefied}} natural gas has increased, safety concerns about the performance of transport vessels under fire conditions have been raised. Current codes for the sizing of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> require that the vessels are able to withstand an emmissive heat flux of 108 kW/m 2 and do {{not take into account}} the effects of insulation loss due to thermal decomposition of the insulation materials. To address this possible oversight in the current code models were presented to a working group organized by the Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators Ltd. focusing on the decomposition rate of the polystyrene insulation used on many of these shipping vessels under fire conditions. The working group considered a range of heat flux from liquified natural gas pool fires with fluxes up to 300 kW=m 2. However, without experimental verification of the behavior of the polystyrene insulation under these conditions the working group deferred the concerns stating that, 2 ̆ 2 a better understanding of the foam plastic insulation vulnerability to heating is required to adequately assess the hazards that could result from loss of insulation effectiveness with fire exposure 2 ̆ 2. Using an experimental procedure adapted from the work of Braumen, Chen and Matzinger on the thermal response of solid polystyrene under fire conditions, a rod driven apparatus was constructed to measure the regression rates of both solid and foamed samples of polystyrene as a function of external heat flux. From a plot of this data the heat loss to the surroundings and the heat of vaporization of the samples were calculated. Comparisons of the heats of vaporization were made to the values reported here as well as to independent differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis data. It was shown that the mass loss rate of the foamed polystyrene is essentially the same as the solid polystyrene when exposed to high rates of heating. The only significant difference between the two forms of polystyrene is in the linear regression rate which is higher in the foamed polystyrene by approximately the same ratio as the densities, about 40 to 1. The heat of vaporization for the solid polystyrene and the foamed polystyrene were found to be 1592 J/g and 1693 J/g respectively.
