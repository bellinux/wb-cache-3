25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three gimbals, which are a pivoted supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two gimbals, the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The inner gimbal is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal) so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> of the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal). This inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{qualitative}} inquiry into the theory of action of school development planning (SDP) constituted within the professional culture of the School Development Planning Initiative (SDPI). SDP is delineated as an historically contingent term of art most influential in scholarly and policy discourse {{under the auspices of}} the Education Reform Act (1988) in the United Kingdom and the Education Act (1998) in Ireland. SDP in Ireland reflects national policy aspiration and traditional Irish cultural and educational values. SDPI, though only established for eleven years, had a crucial role as an agency of the then Department of Education and Science in promoting and supporting SDP in Irish secondary schools in fulfilment of statutory obligations and a national agenda of school improvement. This study presents a qualitative thematic analysis of documentary material and interview data. Using qualified grounded theoretical analytic techniques, the analysis produces findings showing that the primary goal for SDPI was the development of collaborative, deliberative professional cultures among teachers as self-conscious learners, facilitated by supportive leadership, focused upon enhanced pupil learning. The findings also chart an historical pattern of shifting priorities for SDPI in building capacity for SDP until school self evaluation discursively displaced SDP, culminating in a more instrumentalist model of planning. The study also identifies competing loci of control and power between central instrumentalist and accountability expectations on the one hand, and, on the other, the promotion of school autonomy and teacher empowerment. These competing loci of control form the <b>pivotal</b> historical <b>axis</b> of the problematisation of SDP in the study. The findings give weight to the argument that this antinomy is a core determinant of SDPI’s theory of action. The relationship of SDPI to the inspectorate reflects this tension. Conceptualising the inner culture of SDPI the thesis identifies both strong cultural cohesion and creative licence. Key features of valorised SDP derive from the internal culture of SDPI experienced as a community of practitioners. However, strategic naivity and conflicted loyalties to school communities and the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the decline both of SDP as a leading term of art in school improvement discourse in Ireland and to SDPI as a pivotal programme of support for schools. In relation to categories derived from Argyris and Schon, SDPI displays model 2 behaviours operationally, but model 1 behaviours strategically. The thesis contributes to an understanding of an important phase of recent school improvement practice in Ireland, including the relationship of professional culture to praxis, and the need for alignment of purpose among key agencies in school improvement policy design and implementation...|$|R
5000|$|... "Over-arcing" [...] in this definition's context {{relates to}} one of two variables, {{dictated}} by which of two halves the rocker arm's <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> resides in relation to the ensuing motion. In the strict definition, over-arcing pertains to the <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> residing too low with regard to its starting point of motion, in providing a 90 degree relationship at exactly the mid-lift point of motion; whereby 90 degrees is reached (if ever) at some point AFTER the exact half way point of motion (mid-lift) occurs. In the opposite example to this definition, the rocker arm's <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> sits too high with regard to the starting point (valve tip) of motion, thus effecting a sweep of its radial path that dominates beneath itself, whereby the 90 degree relationship of the linear component's axis (valve and push-rod, respectively) to the tangent points to the rocker arm's <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> is acquired BEFORE the mid-lift point of movement is attained. In this example, the term used is under-arcing. As with over-arcing, the result in wasted motion is the same, but the consequences to the ever changing velocity delivered to the valve, which is dictated by where this 90 degree tangent point occurs, is opposite (in both symptoms and effect) to the phenomena of its counterpart. Although both terms are simple in principle, their consequences to the efficient design and implementation of high performance push-rod driven (and otherwise) valve trains is decisive.|$|E

Anything else is termed to be [...] "over-arcing," [...] as it inevitably requires a greater period of contact with the respective linear motion components (i.e., push-rod and valve) to effect the same desired linear motion (valve lift). Thus, the rocker arm geometry is stated to be over-arcing.|$|E

5000|$|Specific to {{the term}} coined in {{internal}} combustion engine valve train technology, for automotive, marine, motorcycle and truck engines, where it is being referenced to in this definition, and as set forth originally in the explicative surrounding the Miller mid-lift Patent, #4,365,785 issued to Jim Miller in December 1982, regarding rocker arm geometry: over-arcing (adjective and verb) relates to the radial path which either end of a rocker arm makes as it follows the inherent arc created from a pre-specified distance of measurement from its <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> (the radius), whereby a connection and/or contact is made with respective components: push-rod and valve, both of which operating under linear (in-line) definitions of motion.

40|$|Layered double {{hydroxides}} (LDHs) and derived {{materials have}} been widely used as heterogeneous catalysts for different types of reactions either in gas or in liquid phase. Among these processes, the valorization/upgrading of lignocellulosic biomass and derived molecules have attracted enormous attention because it constitutes a <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> in the transition from an economic model based on fossil resources to one based on renewable biomass resources with preference for biomass waste streams. Proof of this is the increasing amount of literature reports regarding the rational design and implementation of LDHs and related materials in catalytic processes such as: depolymerization, hydrogenation, selective oxidations, and C-C coupling reactions, among others, where biomass-derived compounds are used. The major aim of this contribution is to situate the most recent advances on the implementation of these types of catalysts into a lignocellulosic-feedstock biorefinery scheme, highlighting the versatility of LDHs and derived materials as multifunctional, tunable, cheap and easy to produce heterogeneous catalysts...|$|E
40|$|The {{narrative}} of retail design {{is a complex}} interweaving plot between place, consumer and product, which ultimately culminates in an entire fusion of experience, lifestyle and culture. In the South African context the Township Mall presents as a new symbol of aspiration in keeping with a growing middleclass. However globally {{there appears to be}} new trends to create multi sensorial and experiential retail spaces. The question is how this trend is manifesting in the Global and South African context? What design strategies are being explored that represent community and lifestyle? We propose that the answer to these questions lies in the fusion and incorporation of street culture within the more formal retail environments. The street represents an informal, liminal and to some extent marginalized retail space that is paradoxically the <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> from which new and dynamic design can be re- invested into formal retail spaces. Inherent in African street culture is the concept of ubuntu or sense of community, which has implications for future design both locally and globally. This paper will therefore investigate these issues by examining both global and local examples and will also present student work that has a direct correlation to the issues discussed...|$|E
40|$|The  {{characteristic}} of  the  Indonesia  Islamic  education modernism  is  largerly determined by  the  creativity which  the Muslim pointed  out.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This {{dissertation}} {{reviews the}} historical interpretations of “guestworkers” that emerged {{with the creation}} of the labor importation agreements between the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean during and after World War II, to expose “guestworker” programs as a <b>pivotal</b> <b>axis</b> in the U. S. imperial framework of the twentieth century. Cast as facilitating individual salvation and international reciprocity, U. S. migrant labor importation policies with Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas, Honduras, Barbados, and Puerto Rico emphasized the labor contract, bilateral agreements between nation-states, and equal rights, all of which appeared as advances from older labor arrangements forged under colonialism and slavery. Through various debates between and among U. S. government officials, leftist labor leaders, civil rights activists, and agribusiness employers, this dissertation examines how they all, in contradictory ways, celebrated and projected these labor programs as marking a new global age of freedom. This emergent rhetoric of freedom surrounding labor migrations to the United States facilitated, obscured, legitimated, and extended global racial and colonial dynamics in the post-World War II era. To expose how empire and race drove the programs, each chapter places the labor programs within the context of their formative moments: U. S imperial interventions in Latin America in the nineteenth century, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, slavery and indentured servitude in the British Caribbean colonies, the U. S. labor and civil rights movements, and the movements for independence in the British West Indies. In viewing the co-constitutive logic of “guestworker” labor programs within these formative contexts, it reveals that the “break” from empire that the labor programs seemed to signify in the 1940 s was hardly a break at all. It then addresses how “guestworkers” and their advocates struggled to compel the state to fulfill the “freedom” of the labor programs during the long civil rights movement. Within the daily struggles of migrant workers and anticolonial activists, we can begin to find glimpses of wider visions of social justice that challenged the mandates of the U. S. liberal state, beyond universal “freedom” as it is framed by “rights” under nation. “Contracting Freedom” demonstrates that the racial formation of the U. S. “guestworker” was much more than a minor footnote to U. S. race relations, usually assumed to matter only along the West Coast {{with the advent of the}} Bracero Program. Instead, the “guestworker” proved central to the reconstruction of race, class, and nation during the mid-twentieth century, by upsetting and then recreating social and cultural dualisms that lay at the heart of American identities and imperial subjectivities: foreign and domestic, freedom and slavery, citizen and noncitizen, guest and alien...|$|E
