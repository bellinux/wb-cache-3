25|$|Off the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe {{was losing}} money {{on both the}} Islanders and the Nets even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL {{prominence}} and the Nets became an American Basketball Association power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10million they had paid in startup costs, and the expenses associated with moving the Nets to the National Basketball Association threw Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale {{to one of the}} team's limited partners, John Pickett, who assigned Torrey as team president. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative cable contract with the fledgling SportsChannel network as their owner, Charles Dolan, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended to not only keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as MSG <b>Plus,</b> <b>for</b> over a quarter-century.|$|E

500|$|A {{version of}} Sonic the Hedgehog was {{developed}} by Ancient and released in late 1991 for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear.
