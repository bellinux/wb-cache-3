The authors describe the shipment volumes, campaign duration, and route options {{likely to be used}} to transport spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste nationally and in Nevada. The authors describe several alternate routing strategies, using a variety of decision-criteria and varying levels of stakeholder involvement. The authors emphasize the importance of building on the success of past efforts to achieve consensus on route selection and the associated administrative controls that regulate use of specific routes. The authors note that route selection decisions may become effectively <b>permanent</b> <b>designations</b> inducing significant social and economic impacts.

At the IAU General Assembly in July 2004, the WGPSN allowed Jovian satellites to be named for Zeus' descendants in addition to his lovers and favorites which were the previous source of names, due to the large number of new Jovian satellites that had then recently been discovered.

40|$|In this {{introduction}} to the IJIR special issue on refugee youth in academic settings, the editors sought manuscripts that examined both challenges and effective practices in countries of temporary and permanent refugee resettlement. We welcomed diverse methodological approaches and empirical work at all levels and types of education (formal, non-formal, and informal). Our final selections do not fully represent the field of refugee education, as eight of the nine are studies in third countries of <b>permanent</b> resettlement, a <b>designation</b> received by only about {{one percent of the}} total refugee population. Perspectives came from the social sciences: psychology, sociology, anthropology, and sociolinguistic disciplines. Themes of the articles fall into two broad categories: 1) educational challenges due to trauma, acculturation stressors, and educational issues; and 2) educational practices intended to address some of these challenges. Although the resettlement category is the smallest of the UNHCR’s “durable solutions”, the authors present important findings to support refugee students’ success. These have to do with collaborative processes, issues of identity, the use of social media, and teacher training in multicultural and language support. In considering future work in this field, we conclude that dimensions of justice need to be more fully examined in other refugee solutions (such as repatriation and local integration in the first country of refuge). We recommend that more research be conducted on the current European “migrant crisis”. We also call for scholars to be public intellectuals in venues that can reframe the characterization of refugees in opposition to “fake news” fanning public fears...|$|R

5000|$|Until 1994, the {{systematic}} naming of comets (the [...] "Old Style") involved first {{giving them a}} provisional designation of the year of their discovery followed by a lower case letter indicating its order of discovery in that year (e.g. the first Comet Bennett is 1969i, the 9th comet discovered in 1969). In 1987, more than 26 comets were discovered, so the alphabet was used again with a [...] "1" [...] subscript, very much like what is still done with asteroids (an example is Comet Skorichenko-George, 1989e1). The record year was 1989, which went as high as 1989h1. Once an orbit had been established, the comet was given a <b>permanent</b> <b>designation</b> in order of time of perihelion passage, consisting of the year followed by a Roman numeral.

5000|$|On 1 October 1933 the 1st Provisional Transport Squadron was constituted. However, {{there were}} no funds to man or equip the unit, which {{remained}} inactive.

The squadron was given a <b>permanent</b> <b>designation</b> as the 1st Transport Squadron in June and fully activated on 15 July 1935 with Bellanca C-27 Airbus aircraft assigned. [...] With enlisted men as pilots, the squadron hauled engines, parts, and other equipment to airfields in their assigned depot area, returned items to the depot, and transferred materiel between depots. They also furnished transportation for maneuvers. The rapid transport of supplies by the squadrons permitted the Air Corps to maintain low levels of materiel at its airfields, relying on replenishment from depot stocks only when needed.|$|E
5000|$|Supernova discoveries are {{reported}} to the IAU's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and are automatically given a provisional designation based on the co-ordinates of the discovery. Historically, when supernovae are identified as belonging to a [...] "type", CBAT has also published circulars with assigned year-letter designations, and discovery details. A supernova's <b>permanent</b> <b>designation</b> is formed by the standard prefix [...] "SN", the year of discovery, and a suffix composed {{of one or two}} letters of the Latin alphabet. The first 26 supernovae of the year receive a capital letter from A to Z. Subsequent supernovae of that year are designated with pairs of lower-case letters from [...] "aa" [...] to [...] "az", and then continuing with [...] "ba" [...] until [...] "zz". For example, the prominent SN 1987A, {{was the first one to}} be observed in 1987. Several thousand supernovae have been reported since 1885. In recent years, several supernova discovery projects have retained their more distant supernova discoveries for in-house follow-up, and not reported them to CBAT. Starting in 2015, CBAT has scaled back its efforts to publish assigned designations of typed supernovae: By September 2014, CBAT had published names and details of 100 supernovae discovered in that year. By September 2015, CBAT had only published names of 20 supernovae discovered in that year. The Astronomer's Telegram provides some surrogate services independent from CBAT.|$|E

The F 2 segregation ratios and the segregation of F 3 seeds from the F 2 plants indicated that A 22 and A 24 have alleles at different independent loci than those of C 1726, C 1727, and A 21. The temporary designation of fapx for the allele in A 22 was replaced by the <b>permanent</b> <b>designation</b> of fap 3, and the temporary designation of fap? for the allele in A 24 was replaced by the <b>permanent</b> <b>designation</b> of fap 4. The study showed that there are at least four independent loci in soybean that control palmitate content;It would be useful in a breeding program to be able to distinguish between normal, reduced, and elevated palmitate genotypes before the flowering of a plant is complete or the seed is mature. An experiment was conducted to (a) determine the earliest stage of seed development at which genotypes with normal, reduced, and elevated palmitate could be differentiated and (b) determine the relationship between the fatty ester content of the seed and that of the vegetative tissues of the three palmitate genotypes. It was determined that differences among reduced, elevated and normal palmitate lines can be detected as early as 17 DAF and remain throughout seed development. Significant differences for palmitate content of roots, stems, and leaves were observed among the reduced, elevated and normal palmitate genotypes as early as V 2, the first-trifoliate leaf stage. The study also indicated that the genes for reduced, elevated, and normal palmitate are constitutively expressed...|$|E
