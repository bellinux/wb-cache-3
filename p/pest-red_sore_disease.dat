Kikuchi-Fujimoto <b>disease</b> {{is an extremely}} rare disease known to have a worldwide distribution with higher prevalence among Japanese and other Asiatic individuals. The clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features appear to point to a viral etiology, a hypothesis that still has not been proven. KFD is generally diagnosed {{on the basis of}} an excisional biopsy of affected lymph nodes. Its recognition is crucial especially because this disease can be mistaken for systemic lupus erythematosus, malignant lymphoma or even, though rarely, for adenocarcinoma. Clinicians' and pathologists' awareness of this disorder may help prevent misdiagnsois and inappropriate treatment. The diagnosis of KFD merits active consideration in any nodal biopsy showing fragmentation, necrosis and karyorrhexis, especially in young individuals presenting with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Treatment is symptomatic (analgesics-antipyretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, rarely, corticosteroids). Spontaneous recovery occurs in 1 to 4 months. Patients with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease should be followed-up for several years to survey the possibility of the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. </p...|$|R

'Love is gone, and now coveting, pinching, griping, and such things, are in fashion; now iniquity abounds instead of grace, in many that name the name of Christ.' p. 529, 520. 'Alas! alas! there is a company of half priests in the world; they dare not teach the people the whole counsel of God, because they would condemn themselves, and their manner {{of living in the}} world: where is that minister now to be found, that dare say to his people, walk as you have me for an example, or that dare say, what you see and hear to be in me, do, and the God of peace shall be with you.' p. 520.

It is almost a miracle that Bunyan escaped persecution for his plain dealing.

'The sins of our day are conspicuous and open as Sodom's were; pride and covetousness, loathing of the gospel, and contemning holiness, have covered the face of the nation.' p. 534.

'0! it is horrible to behold how irreverently, how easily, and malapertly, children, yea, professing children, at this day, carry it to their parents; snapping and checking, curbing and rebuking of them, as if they had received a dispensation from God to dishonour and disobey parents.' p. 535. 'This day, a sea and deluge of iniquity has drowned those that have a form of godliness. Now immorality shall, with professors, be in fashion, be pleaded for, be loved and more esteemed than holiness; even those that have a form of godliness, hate the life and power thereof, yea, they despise them that are good.' p. 543.|$|R
40|$|Background: Dystonia is a {{movement}} disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and abnormal postures. Primary dystonia {{is the most common}} form and is thought to be a multifactorial condition in which one or more genes combine with environmental factors to reach disease. Methods: We reviewed controlled studies on possible environmental risk factors for primary early- and late-onset dystonia. Results: Environmental factors associated with primary early-onset dystonia are poorly understood. Early childhood illnesses have been reported to be more frequent in patients with DYT 1 dystonia than in subjects carrying the DYT 1 mutation that did not manifest dystonia, thus raising the possibility that such exposures precipitate dystonia among DYT 1 carriers. Conversely, several environmental factors have been associated with primary adult-onset focal dystonias compared to control subjects. Namely, eye <b>diseases,</b> <b>sore</b> throat, idiopathic scoliosis, and repetitive upper limb motor action seem to be associated with blepharospasm (BSP), laryngeal dystonia (LD), cervical dystonia (CD), and upper limb dystonia, respectively. In addition, an inverse association between coffee drinking and BSP has been observed in both case-unrelated control and family-based case-control studies. Additional evidence supporting a causal link with different forms of primary late-onset dystonia is only available for diseases of the anterior segment of the eye, writing activity, and coffee intake. Conclusion: There is reasonable epidemiological evidence that some environmental factors are risk-modifying factors for specific forms of primary adult-onse...|$|R
40|$|Author Summary Leishmaniasis is {{a disease}} induced by a {{protozoan}} parasite and transmitted by the sandfly. Several forms of infection are identified, and the different diseases have wide-ranging symptoms from localized cutaneous <b>sores</b> to visceral <b>disease</b> affecting many internal organs. Animal models of human cutaneous leishmaniasis have been established in which disease is induced by infecting mice subcutaneously with Leishmania major. Different strains of inbred mice {{have been found to}} be susceptible or resistant to L. major infection. "Healer" C 57 BL/ 6 mice control infection with transient lesion development. The protective response to infection in this strain is dominated by type 1 cytokines inducing parasite killing by nitric oxide. Conversely, "nonhealer" BALB/c mice are unable to control infection and develop nonhealing lesions associated with a dominant type 2 immune response driven by cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 13. However, mice deficient in IL- 4 /IL- 13 signaling are not protected against development of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Here we describe a BALB/c mouse where the ability to polarize to a dominant type 2 response is removed by cell-specific deletion of the receptor for IL- 4 /IL- 13 on CD 4 + T cells. These mice are resistant to L. major infection similar to C 57 BL/ 6 mice, which highlights the role of T helper 2 cells in driving susceptibility and the protective role of IL- 4 /IL- 13 signaling in non-CD 4 + T cells in BALB/c mice...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{interested}} in syphilis since 1922 and had published many international articles on its diagnosis, treatment, hereditary properties, serology and social aspects. Leishmaniasis (Oriental <b>sore)</b> was another <b>disease,</b> which Behçet worked on, beginning in 1923. He wrote about it in many articles and succeeded in its treatment with diathermic. He first described [...] "the nail sign" [...] appearing by {{the removal of the}} crust of an oriental sore. A part of his published work was concerned with parasitosis. In 1923, he described the etiologic agents of [...] "gale cereal" [...] in Turkey. Behçet dealt with superficial and deep mycosis and their treatments. Due to his observations, he described the dermatitis of fig in 1933. In 1935, at the Dermatology Congress in Budapest, he was honoured for his studies on mycosis. He was also in the publishing vanguard to improve Turkish medicine and he was responsible for the first dermato-venerology journal of Turkey called ’’Turkish Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology’’ in 1924. In 1939, he was elected as a correspondent member to the German scientific journals ’’Dermatologische Wochenschrift’’ and ’’Medizinische Wochenschrift’’. The same year, he has been promoted to ordinary professor. The most important work that Behçet brought to Turkish medicine was the monograph published in 1940 called ’’Clinical and Practical Syphilis, Diagnosis and Related Dermatoses’’. Every page of this book contains an aspect of syphilis and the footnotes, provides a wealth of detailed information about the differential diagnosis of other skin diseases. As a result, scientists had the chance to learn about syphilis and dermatology at the same time. This book, despite its outdated style, still retains its value and spirit in medicine as being the only example in its field. Behçet continued as the Head of the Department of Dermatology and Venereal Diseases until 1947.|$|R
30|$|Worldwide, the {{frequency}} of edentulism over 65  years of age fluctuates considerably between countries (26 % in the USA, 19 % in Italy, and 46 % in the United Kingdom, to name but a few) (Petersen and Yamamoto 2005). In France, the prevalence of edentulism continues to increase in the population, from 16.3 % in 1995 to 23.8 % in 2004 (Haute Autorité de Santé 2006), {{and it is a}} phenomenon that can be partially explained by population ageing. No data is available on the proportion of partially edentate persons, which would further increase the previous percentage if taken into account. Prosthetic treatment with removable dentures (RD) represents one of the therapeutic treatments available against tooth loss, and it is also that used most frequently. Esthetics and oral functions such as phonation and mastication should be restored (Roumanas 2009) following RD placement and patients should recover “good” oral health. The definition of oral health {{is not limited to the}} absence of pathology. Just as the World Health Organization’s states that “health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (World Health Organisation 1948), oral health is defined as a “state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, oral infection and <b>sores,</b> periodontal (gum) <b>disease,</b> tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual’s capacity for biting, chewing, smiling and speaking, and their psychosocial well-being” (World Health Organisation 2012). In the case of tooth loss, rehabilitation of oral health by wearing an RD does not allow patients to return to a state of oral health as defined above. Indeed, the literature showed that oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) measured using the “Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index” (GOHAI) (Atchison et al. 1998) remained deteriorated in the presence of RD (Locker and Miller 1994; McGrath and Bedi 2001; John et al. 2004). Similar results were shown using the shortened version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14) and OHIP-edent questionnaires (Pistorius et al. 2013; Peršić and Čelebić 2015; Yen et al. 2015). RD renewal is often suggested to solve patients’ discomfort and grievances, and/or denture wear. However, few data are available on the impact of RD renewal on patients’ OHRQoL and their RD-related satisfaction, and existing data mainly focus on bi-maxillary complete RD (Veyrune et al. 2005). Moreover, in France, the evaluation of practice has recently become a key objective within university hospitals and private practices, in order to improve the quality of health care. In this context, the evaluation of RD renewal would undoubtedly contribute to improving the quality of oral health care. Such evaluation remains difficult, especially for prosthetics rehabilitation, because of the wide variety of existing processes. It has therefore been decided to focus on patient-centered outcomes, as done by Donabedian (2005).|$|R
