5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} {{be broken down into}} smaller <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available along the route but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one claimed the lives of more than 60 people travelling over Chilkoot Pass.|$|E
5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or cream and cornstarch.

Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained unauthorized access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September. Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E

40|$|Packaging is a {{fundamental}} element in logistics systems. It not only affects every logistical activity; {{it also has a}} significant impact on logistics costs and performance. In order for <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> logistics professionals to gain insight into packaging-dependent costs and performance, the interactions between <b>packaging</b> systems <b>and</b> logistics systems must be understood. The presented research provides a comprehensive overview of the physical interactions between <b>packaging</b> systems <b>and</b> logistics systems in retail supply chains. It also serves as an elementary step towards understanding the role of <b>packaging</b> in logistics, <b>and</b> as an aid in showing how packaging-related decisions might impact on supply chains. The research implies that understanding the interactions between <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> logistics makes it possible to make decisions, such as changing the packaging system or logistics system, or both, based on a holistic packaging approach. As a result, the research provides means {{to bridge the gap between}} <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> logistics professionals and presents a model of the impact of decisions on <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> logistics systems...|$|R

5|$|The {{closure of}} the border had a {{substantial}} economic and social impact on both halves of Germany. Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24secondary lines, 23autobahns or national roads, 140regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise interrupted. The tightest level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open. When {{relations between the two}} states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for economic assistance. Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> letters were routinely opened and telephone calls were monitored by the East German secret police.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic <b>packages</b> <b>and</b> graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} and the series' legacy {{has focused on}} the two main trilogies of episodes, with Vorticons having large success as a shareware game and impacting the success of Apogee (now 3D Realms) and its shareware model. The second trilogy sold fewer copies, which was blamed by id and Apogee on its split into two parts, and the 2001 game received mixed reviews. The MS-DOS games have been re-released in several compilation <b>packages,</b> <b>and</b> all but the sixth episode are still sold through modern emulation releases on platforms such as Steam. References to the series have been made by dozens of other games, especially to the Dopefish, an enemy in the fourth episode, which has been termed one of the video game industry's biggest in-jokes. An active modding community has grown around the series, producing editing tools and unofficial sequels.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the pilgrimage}} to Mecca was mainly an {{overland}} journey using camels {{as a means}} of transport. During {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century (after 1850s), steamships began to be used in the pilgrimage journey to Mecca, and the number of pilgrims traveling on sea route increased. This continued for some time, until air travel came to predominate; Egypt introduced the first airline service for Hajj pilgrims in 1937. Today, many airlines and travel agents offer Hajj <b>packages,</b> <b>and</b> arrange for transportation and accommodation for the pilgrims. King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah and Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Airport in Medina have dedicated pilgrim terminals to assist the arrival of pilgrims. Other international airports around the world, such as Indira Gandhi in New Delhi, Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, Jinnah in Karachi and Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta also have dedicated terminals or temporary facilities to service pilgrims as they depart and return home. During Hajj, many airlines run extra flights to accommodate the large number of pilgrims.|$|E
