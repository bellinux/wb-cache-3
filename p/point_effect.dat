40|$|Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) {{is a new}} biologically {{inspired}} meta-heuristic {{optimization technique}} based the pollination process of flowers. FPA mimics the flower pollination characteristics in order to survival by the fittest. This paper presents implementation of FPA optimization in solving Combined Economic Emission Dispatch (CEED) problems in power system. CEED actually is a bi-objective problem where the objective of economic dispatch (ED) and emission dispatch (EMD) are combined into a single function by using price penalty factor. Hence, CEED is used to minimize the total generation cost by minimizing fuel cost and emission concurrently {{and at the same}} time determines the optimum power generation. In this paper, the valve point loading effect problem in power system also will be considered. The proposed algorithm are tested on four different test systems which are: 6 -generating unit and 11 -generating unit without valve <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> with no transmission loss, 10 -generating unit with having valve <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> and transmission loss, and lastly 40 -generating unit with having valve <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> without transmission loss.

40|$|International audienceWe {{examine a}} Fe–Cr–Al foil-based {{material}} and a continuous-wave laser weld generated in ultra-fine “keyhole” mode undergoing tensile and creep-tension tests over a temperature range of 25 – 1000 °C. At all temperatures, the bead exhibits superior tensile resistance than the base material {{due to a}} homogenous reprecipitation of fine aluminum nitrides, AlN, but creeps faster at 900 °C, because of a finer-grained microstructure scarcely undergoing secondary recrystallization. Under tensile loading, the base material ductility is {{higher than that of}} the weld and increases with increasing temperature, but drops above 900 °C due to faster grain growth and chromium carbide precipitation. The base material stress–strain curves exhibit concomitant decrease of the yield <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> magnitude and increase of the strain hardening rate with the temperature, but only up to a critical value, which decreases with increasing the strain rate. After vanishing at this critical temperature, the yield <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> reappears upon the onset of sample necking responsible for the ensuing continuous decrease of the engineering stress. The strain–stress curves of laser welds show no yield <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> and the work hardening persists at all temperatures. Under creep-tension, the weld shows a strong anisotropic behavior, and the highest flow rate is recorded for welds oriented parallel to the loading direction, because of a more important cavity nucleation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this article, the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) {{has been}} {{proposed}} to find the optimal solution for Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) problems. It is aimed, in the CEED problem, that scheduling of generators should operate with both minimum fuel costs and emission levels, simultaneously, while satisfying the load demand and operational constraints. In this paper, the CEED problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem by considering the fuel cost and emission objectives of generating units. The bi-objective optimization problem is converted into a single objective function using a price penalty factor in order to solve it with GSA. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on four different test cases, having a valve <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> with transmission loss and having no valve <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> without transmission loss.

40|$|Suppose that a {{sequence}} of treatments are assigned to influence an outcome of interest that occurs after the last treatment. Between treatments there exist time-dependent covariates that may be posttreatment variables of the earlier treatments and confounders of the subsequent treatments. In this article, we develop a parametric approach to inference of the causal effect of the treatment sequence on the outcome called the sequential causal effect. We construct a point parametrization for the conditional distribution of an outcome given all treatments and time-dependent covariates, in which the point parameters of interest are the <b>point</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments considered as single-point treatments. We (1) identify net effects of treatments by <b>point</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments, (2) express patterns of net effects of treatments by constraints on <b>point</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments, and (3) show that all sequential causal effects are determined by net effects of treatments. Accordingly we (1) estimate net effects of treatments through <b>point</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments by maximum likelihood, (2) improve the estimation by constraints on <b>point</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments and assignment conditions of treatments, and (3) use the estimates of net effects of treatments to obtain those of sequential causal effects. As a result, we obtain unbiased consistent maximum-likelihood estimates of sequential causal effects even for long treatment sequences.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{reference}} <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> on M&As. Prospect theory proposes that the reference dependence bias is firmly rooted in people’s minds, affirming that people {{rely heavily on}} a piece of relevant information while making decisions. This thesis applies this reference point to M&As, showing that M&A participants are subject to reference-dependence bias. The reference point theory explains the M&A motives in a new way. The results of this thesis offer important implications to M&A practitioners. Baker et al. (2012) suggest that the target’s reference price enhances the target’s bargaining power in the U. S. market, inspiring the author’s thinking that the reference <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> is likely to be reinforced in a competitive market and in the scenario where the bidder is in the face of considerable information barriers. In this pursuit, Chapter 3 studies the reference <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> on a sample of public acquisitions involving a U. K. target. Using the target 52 -week high as the reference price, a positive relationship emerges between the reference price and the offer premium. Further, there is evidence of overpayment among domestic bidders whereas little evidence among cross-border bidders, indicating that the market acquiesces the payment according to the target reference point among cross-border bidders. Evidence that reference- dependence bias serves as the bargaining power is confirmed outside the United States. However, the real M&A motive of the bidder is unlikely to be revealed solely depending on the target reference point. Therefore, Chapter 4 extends Baker et al. ’s paper (2012) by adding both the target and the bidder reference points. A Relative Reference Point (RRP) is proposed for M&A misvaluations as per Shleifer and Vishny (2003), indicating {{the extent to which the}} bidder is more overvalued relatively to the target. The joint reference point effects can explain the motivation of why bidders paying high offer premiums. The results obtained in this chapter show that bidders are likely to pay with stocks when RRP increases, suggesting that bidders accelerating the process of overvaluation dilution is a sign of bidder overvaluation. In addition, the offer premium increases with the RRP, indicating the motive of diluting overvaluation is to be seen by the target, leading targets to bargain over high offer premiums. When assessing the long-term performance of stock bidders, it became evident that bidders time the market by paying stocks according to the RRP. A direct implication of prospect theory is that people seek risk in the face of loss gauged by a reference point. Chapter 5 proposes the bidder reference point to assess the market anticipation effect. Investors suffer mental loss when their firm’s current performance is significantly below its best recently achieved performance. They anticipate that the firm will take risks to turn the table round. It was evident that the firm is rewarded with positive market reactions when it takes risks according to the market’s anticipation. In a further analysis, it also emerged that managers taking the market-anticipated risks exhibit greater efforts in the processes of M&A negotiation and post-merger integration, reflected in the low offer premiums paid to the target shareholders and positive long-term abnormal returns earned. This thesis has empirically investigated many implications of the reference <b>point</b> <b>effect</b> in the M&A context. The main aim of this thesis is to simplify M&A decisions for managers in order to structure M&A effectively. ...|$|E
