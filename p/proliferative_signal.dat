50|$|Induction of {{proliferation}} by the EpoR {{is likely}} cell type-dependent. It {{is known that}} EpoR can activate mitogenic signaling pathways {{and can lead to}} cell proliferation in erythroleukemic cell lines in vitro, various non-erythroid cells, and cancer cells. So far, there is no sufficient evidence that in vivo, EpoR signaling can induce erythroid progenitors to undergo cell division, or whether Epo levels can modulate the cell cycle. EpoR signaling may still have a proliferation effect upon BFU-e progenitors, but these progenitors cannot be directly identified, isolated and studied. CFU-e progenitors enter the cell cycle at the time of GATA-1 induction and PU.1 suppression in a developmental manner rather than due to EpoR signaling. Subsequent differentiation stages (proerythroblast to orthochromatic erythroblast) involve a decrease in cell size and eventual expulsion of the nucleus, and are likely dependent upon EpoR signaling only for their survival. In addition, some evidence on macrocytosis in hypoxic stress (when Epo can increase 1000-fold) suggests that mitosis is actually skipped in later erythroid stages, when EpoR expression is low/absent, in order to provide emergency reserve of red blood cells as soon as possible. Such data, though sometimes circumstantial, argue that there is limited capacity to proliferate specifically in response to Epo (and not other factors). Together, these data suggest that EpoR in erythroid differentiation may function primarily as a survival factor, while its effect on the cell cycle (for example, rate of division and corresponding changes in the levels of cyclins and Cdk inhibitors) in vivo awaits further work. In other cell systems, however, EpoR may provide a specific <b>proliferative</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} (Shh) {{signal transduction}} via the G-protein-coupled receptor, Smoothened, {{is required for}} proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs) during development. Activating mutations in the Hedgehog pathway are also implicated in basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, a tumor of the cerebellum in humans. However, Shh signaling interactions with cell cycle regulatory components in neural precursors are poorly understood, in part because appropriate immortalized cell lines are not available. We have utilized primary cultures from neonatal mouse cerebella {{in order to determine}} (i) whether Shh initiates or maintains cell cycle progression in CGNPs, (ii) if G 1 regulation by Shh resembles that of classical mitogens, and (iii) whether individual D-type cyclins are essential components of Shh <b>proliferative</b> <b>signaling</b> in CGNPs. Our results indicate that Shh can drive continued cycling in immature, proliferating CGNPs. Shh treatment resulted in sustained activity of the G 1 cyclin-Rb axis by regulating levels of cyclinD 1, cyclinD 2, and cyclinE mRNA transcripts and proteins. Analysis of CGNPs from cyclinD 1 −/− or cyclinD 2 −/− mice demonstrates that the Shh proliferative pathway does not require unique functions of cyclinD 1 or cyclinD 2 and that D-type cyclins overlap functionally in this regard. In contrast to many known mitogenic pathways, we show that Shh <b>proliferative</b> <b>signaling</b> is mitogen-activated protein kinase independent. Furthermore, protein synthesis is required for early effects on cyclin gene expression.

40|$|Engagement of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) mediates the heterodimeridation of {{the common}} beta chain (beta(c)) and common gamma chain (gamma(c)) of the IL- 2 {{receptor}} (IL- 2 R). This is sufficient and necessary for receptor activation and signal transduction. It is generally held that the IL- 2 R is activated by the trans-activity of the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) Jak 1 and Jak 3 associated with beta(c) and gamma(c) respectively. Transduction of <b>proliferative</b> <b>signals</b> requires Jak 3 activity. A Jak 3 independent signalling pathway involving p 56 (lck), generating anti-apoptotic signals, can be observed and requires the PROX domain of gamma(c). p 56 (lck) can be activated by dephosphorylation of an inhibitory carboxyl terminal phosphorylated tyrosine residue (Y 505). We propose that this is mediated by a PROX domain associated protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). Activation of p 56 (lck) alone is insufficient for transduction of <b>proliferative</b> <b>signals</b> and thus works in concert with Jak 3 mediated receptor activation. This indicates that both gamma(c) domains are vital for signal transduction...|$|R

However, therapy options are limited leaving an urgent need to develop new strategies. Currently, targeting cancer cell lipid and cholesterol metabolism is gaining interest especially regarding HCC. High cholesterol levels support proliferation, membrane-related mitogenic signaling and increase cell softness, leading to tumor progression, malignancy and invasive potential. However, effective ways to target cholesterol metabolism for cancer therapy are still missing. The V-ATPase inhibitor archazolid was recently shown to interfere with cholesterol metabolism. In our study, we report a novel therapeutic potential of V-ATPase inhibition in HCC by altering the mechanical phenotype of cancer cells leading to reduced <b>proliferative</b> <b>signaling.</b> Archazolid causes cellular depletion of free cholesterol leading {{to an increase in}} cell stiffness and membrane polarity of cancer cells, while hepatocytes remain unaffected.

40|$|Traumatic brain {{injuries}} (TBIs) cause {{the breakdown of}} the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the extravasation of serum albumin, and induce epileptiform activity via astrocytic transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of serum albumin alone is sufficient to induce seizures in rodents and has been associated with increased TGF-β signaling and synaptogenesis, which contribute to epileptogenesis. This study demonstrates that ICV infusion of serum albumin also promotes the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and aberrant neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse. Treatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (Losartan) prevents these changes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that serum albumin alone does not affect the proliferation of these NSCs in vitro, and is not sufficient to induce the secretion of astrocytic <b>proliferative</b> <b>signals.</b> This suggests that the increase in proliferation observed in animals exposed to serum albumin may require activity-induced <b>proliferative</b> <b>signals</b> from epileptiform activity, contributions from other cells in the niche in addition to astrocytes, cell-to-cell contact signals, or all three.

Little is known about alternate signaling of the Fas Ag pathway in gastric mucosal cells. Using a cell culture model of rat gastric mucosal cells, we show that gastric mucosal cells utilize a type II signaling pathway for apoptosis.

40|$|AbstractBackground Hematopoiesis {{entails the}} {{production}} of multiple blood cell lineages throughout the lifespan of the organism. This is accomplished by the regulated expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic precursors that originate from self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells. Studies of lineage commitment and proliferation {{have shown that the}} cytokine family of growth factors {{plays an important role in}} hematopoietic differentiation. However, in hematopoiesis, as in most self-renewing biological systems, the molecules that regulate the stem cells directly remain largely unknown. In this study, we have undertaken a search for novel cytokines that may influence the fate of hematopoietic stem cells. Results We have cloned three splice variants of a novel cytokine receptor from human hematopoietic stem cells expressing the CD 34 antigen, one of which is identical to the leptin receptor. Expression analysis revealed that the leptin receptor is expressed in both human and murine hematopoietic stem cell populations, and that leptin is expressed by hematopoietic stroma. We show that leptin provides a <b>proliferative</b> <b>signal</b> in hematopoietic cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that leptin provides a <b>proliferative</b> <b>signal</b> in BAF- 3 cells and increases the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cell populations. The proliferative effects of leptin seem to be at the level of a multilineage progenitor, as shown by increased myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Analysis of db/db mice, in which the leptin receptor is truncated, revealed that the steady-state levels of peripheral blood B cells and CD 4 -expressing T cells were dramatically reduced, demonstrating that the leptin pathway plays an essential role in lymphopoiesis. Colony assays performed using marrow from db/db and wild-type mice indicated that db/db marrow has a deficit in lymphopoietic progenitors; furthermore, db/db mice are unable to fully recover the lymphopoietic population following irradiation insult, and although the levels of peripheral blood erythrocytes are normal in db/db mice, spleen erythrocyte production is severely compromized. Conclusions We have discovered that leptin and its cognate receptor constitute a novel hematopoietic pathway that is required for normal lymphopoiesis. This pathway seems to act at the level of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell, and may well also impact upon erythropoiesis, particularly in anemic states that may require output from the spleen. These findings offer a new perspective on the role of the fat cell in hematopoiesis...|$|E

Although promoters and inhibitors of muscle differentiation have been isolated, nothing is known about how the amplification of the muscle precursor pool is regulated; this amplification provides muscle mass during development. Furthermore, {{little is known about}} how cells accumulate in the pre-muscle masses in the limbs. We investigated the role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) during proliferation, differentiation and positioning of muscle. Results: The proliferation of muscle precursors in limbs was linked to Pax- 3 expression. Ectoderm removal downregulated Pax- 3 expression, arrested proliferation and prematurely initiated muscle differentiation which exhausted the muscle precursor pool and prevented further muscle growth. BMP- 2, BMP- 4 and BMP- 7 had a dose-dependent effect on pre-myogenic cells: low concentrations maintained a Pax- 3 -expressing proliferative population, substituting for ectoderm-derived <b>proliferative</b> <b>signals</b> and delaying differentiation, whereas high concentrations prevented muscle development, probably by inducing apoptosis. In the limb, Shh upregulated Bmp- 2 and Bmp- 7 expression which delayed muscle differentiation, upregulated Pax- 3, amplified the muscle precursor population and stimulated excessive muscle growth. Conclusions: These data indicate that embryonic muscle growth requires muscle differentiation to be delayed. Muscle differentiation may occur through a default pathway after cells escape <b>proliferative</b> <b>signals.</b> Positioning of muscle is regulated by high concentrations of BMPs, thus a single type of signalling molecule can determine crucial steps in muscle development: when and where to proliferate, and when and where to differentiate...|$|R
