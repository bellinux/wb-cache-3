The Avenger was a steady seller in the 1970s, in competition with the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Viva. Chrysler was attempting to make the Avenger to be a [...] "world car", and took the ambitious step of marketing the Avenger as the Plymouth Cricket in the U.S. Complaints of rust, unreliability, plus the general unpopularity of smaller cars on the American market, saw it withdrawn from that market after only two years.|$|E

40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} (EDCs) are {{chemicals that}} interfere with the organizational or activational effects of hormones. Although {{the vast majority of}} the EDC literature focuses on steroid hormone signaling related impacts, growing evidence from a myriad of species reveals that the nonapeptide hormones vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) may also be EDC targets. EDCs shown to alter pathways and behaviors coordinated by AVP and/or OT include the <b>plastics</b> <b>component</b> bisphenol A (BPA), the soy phytoestrogen genistein (GEN), and various flame retardants. Many effects are sex specific and likely involve action at nuclear estrogen receptors. Effects include the elimination or reversal of well-characterized sexually dimorphic aspects of the AVP system, including innervation of the lateral septum and other brain regions critical for social and other non-reproductive behaviors. Disruption of magnocellular AVP function has also been reported in rats, suggesting possible effects on hemodynamics and cardiovascular function...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the effect of long-term treatment with the phytoestrogen soy isoflavone [(SIF); 43 mg/kg body weight/day] and/or the <b>plastics</b> <b>component</b> bisphenol-A [(BPA); 3 mg/kg body weight/day] on some monoamines in the forebrain and both serum thyroid hormones and cortisol levels of adult rats. Significant increases in serotonin (5 -HT) and norepinephrine (NE) level, and significant decreases in 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) level and 5 -HIAA/ 5 -HT ratio, were observed after treatment with SIF or BPA. Level of dopamine (DA) was increased in SIF-treated group and decreased in BPA-treated group. Activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO) was decreased in all treated groups. The level of serum thyroid hormones (fT 3 and fT 4) was increased after treatment with SIF and decreased after exposure to BPA, while cortisol level was increased in all treated groups. It may be concluded that long-term exposure to SIF or BPA disrupts monoamine levels in the forebrain of adult rats through alteration in the metabolic pathways of amines and disorders of thyroid hormones and cortisol levels...|$|E

An oil vehicle and estradiol benzoate (EB; 25 μg) were used as negative and positive controls. Exposure to EB, PPT, or the low dose of BPA advanced pubertal onset. A total of 67 % of females exposed to the high BPA dose were acyclic by 15 wk after vaginal opening compared with 14 % of those exposed to the low BPA dose, all of the EB- and PPT-treated females, and none of the control animals. Ovaries from the EB-treated females were undersized and showed no evidence of folliculogenesis, whereas ovaries from the PPT-treated females were characterized by large antral-like follicles, which did not appear to support ovulation. Severity of deficits within the BPA-treated groups increased with dose and included large antral-like follicles and lower numbers of corpora lutea. Sexual receptivity, examined after ovariectomy and hormone replacement, was normal in all groups except those neonatally exposed to EB. FOS induction in hypothalamic gonadotropic (GnRH) neurons after hormone priming was impaired in the EB- and PPT-treated groups but neither of the BPA-treated groups. Our data suggest that BPA disrupts ovarian development but not the ability of GnRH neurons to respond to steroid-positive feedback...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The use of {{structural}} calculation software based on {{finite element analysis}} is nowadays a common practice when designing new industrial products processed from thermoplastic materials like polyamides or ABS. {{in order to make}} an adequate Prediction of the service behavior of the <b>plastics</b> <b>component,</b> it is Essential to carry out appropriate analysis when working with the software. This requires both the correct mechanical characterization of the materials used for inputting the required properties in the calculation code, and the specification of the different solution characteristics. In this work, two materials (polyamide and ABS) have been studied for the analysis of single disc machine. The single disc machine includes top cover and bottom cover. Where the top cover consist of motor, pulley and the provision provided for inserting the handle of the machine. The analysis of the top cover is to increase the contact force between the brush and surface. for that a mass of 12 kg is Placed on the space provide for the top cover and The structural analysis should be carried out in the top cover {{in order to reduce the}} maximum stress and deformation level within the safe limit. Whereas The linear impact analysis is carried out on the bottom cover in order to find a good stiffness level and the minimum hand force at an angle of 60 degree is required for the machine avoid to hitting the wall. for that to make a slot on the bottom cover and place a rubber bush in the slot to reduce the deformation level as well as life time of the machine will also increased. This simulation tests are conducted in the finite element code ANSYS and stress deformation is calculated to achieve the efficient material...|$|E

40|$|Occupant {{safety is}} a major concern in today’s {{automotive}} industry. Recent standards (e. g. FMVSS- 201) impose specific requirements to <b>plastic</b> <b>components</b> used in automotive interiors, which have to afford impact protection for occupants, namely against head impact. The design criteria require head injury criteria (HIC) (d), 1000 and a deceleration lower than 180 g (1 g 59. 81 m s 22), in order to avoid severe occupant head injuries. The <b>plastic</b> <b>components</b> are therefore required to act as passive safety components. In the present work, the impact of an anthropomorphic mass in a plastic pillar is simulated by a finite element code (ABAQUS). The polymer properties are obtained at high strain rates and described by an elasto–plastic model, being adopted as a maximum allowable strain failure criterion. The contacts between the mass, the <b>plastic</b> <b>component</b> and the steel chassis are considered and a deceleration–time plot and a HIC(d) value computed.
