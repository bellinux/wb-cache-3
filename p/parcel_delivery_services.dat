40|$|<b>Parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services</b> (e. g., US Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx) are {{significant}} parts of modern transportation systems. Availability of service, responsiveness of service, reliability of service, completeness of service, and professionalism of service {{were identified as}} the five significant factors affecting customer satisfaction in parcel delivery service. A model of customer satisfaction in parcel delivery service was developed. ^ Written questionnaire responses from 181 university academic departments in Nebraska and across the U. S. were used. The questionnaire determined the ranking of importance of factors and gathered data {{on the characteristics of}} each factor. The internal reliability of the questionnaire components was excellent. The research concluded that all the five factors were positively correlated with overall customer satisfaction with respect to all customers, US Postal Service (USPS) customers, UPS customers, and FedEx customers, for both outgoing and incoming <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services.</b> Results show that reliability of service was ranked as the most important among the five factors with respect to eight conditions: all customers, USPS customers, UPS customers, and FedEx customers, for both outgoing and incoming <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services.</b> Professionalism of service received the lowest rank among factors for three conditions, and it tied as the lowest rank for all other five conditions. Availability of service, responsiveness of service, and completeness of service {{were in the middle of}} the importance ranking with no consistent preference among the three factors. ^ Descriptive statistics revealed that for the surveyed academic units for outgoing parcels, on average, 48 % used FedEx, 25 % used UPS, 22 % used USPS and 5 % used others. For incoming parcels the surveyed respondents reported, on average, 46 % from UPS, 26 % from FedEx, 22 % from USPS and 6 % from others. Thus for university departments/units, the majority of outgoing parcels were via FedEx and the majority of incoming parcels were via UPS. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} of e-commerce {{has a tremendous}} effect on logistic service providers such as <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services.</b> Since {{an increasing number of}} customers shop online these providers face a growing demand for their services. In addition the demand from online customers is highly fluctuating and companies with big transportation volumes like Amazon. com Inc. select their logistic service providers based on least cost criteria and award most often short term contracts. The ever increasing speed of changes in the cost and demand structure forces companies to reconfigure their network frequently. We contribute by developing a multi-period approach that incorporates these changes and enables optimal configuration of hub location networks. We consider a multi-period single allocation hub location problem with multiple capacity levels. Which locations serve as hubs, the capacity of these hubs and the allocation of non-hub locations to hub locations are the key decisions in each period. Several formulations of mixed integer programs for the multi-period model are proposed. We develop and evaluate heuristics to solve large-scale problems. We compare the models and heuristics in terms of computational performance...|$|E
40|$|In France, {{e-commerce}} {{has experienced}} steady {{growth over the}} past decade. A striking aspect {{is that it is}} now widespread among different segments of the population, including suburban and rural households. This growth has generated significant demand for dedicated delivery services to end consumers. Pickup points (PP) represent a fast-growing alternative to home delivery, accounting for about 20 % of parcel deliveries to households. The article focuses on the strategy of PP network operators. Our results are threefold. We have documented the récent development of alternative <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services</b> to e-shoppers in Europe, and especially in France. We have described how the operators have decided to organize their PP network, identifying main variables and constraints. We have provided an analysis of the spatial distribution of PPs in France. The paper shows that at the French national level, PPs are nowawell established alternative to home deliveries and their presence covers urban, suburban and rural areas. While PP density in remote areas decreases faster than population density, rural e-consumers' accessibility to PP sites has reached a viable level. Furthermore, PP delivery services generate new types of B 2 B freight trips that are not yet included in current urban freight models...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose – When {{services}} fail, recovery {{efforts are}} often contingent upon the terms set in service guarantee policies. Service guarantees set the pledged recovery compensation (payout) and procedures (ease of invocation), {{and these two}} terms signal justice rendered to customers and the firm’s motives. This study focuses on how service guarantees are implemented as recovery strategies, {{and the impact of}} guarantee terms on customer justice perceptions, motive attributions and repatronage intentions. Design/methodology/approach – A between-subjects experiment was conducted in <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services.</b> Findings – Customer justice perceptions vary across guarantee payout levels. Payout in the form of discount does not restore justice, and leads to inferences that the firm offers the guarantee to maximise its profits. Conversely, full refund restores justice. Full refund plus discount is perceived as undeserved, and does not enhance justice perceptions. A moderately easy-to-invoke guarantee is perceived as fair, when it includes full refund. Inferences of negative firm’s motives, however, diminish perceived fairness of easy-to-invoke guarantees. Research limitations/implications – Future research could examine the interaction of guarantee scope with payout and ease of invocation, and how types of motives differentially impact justice perceptions. Practical implications – Full refund can enhance justice perceptions, whereas discount is perceived as unfair. Firms should offer full refund as guarantee payout, but refrain from offering a discount. Flexibility should be embedded in guarantee invocation procedures. Originality/value – This study demonstrates that service guarantees employed as recovery strategies signal justice and the firm’s motives...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the level of {{customer}} satisfaction in the <b>parcel</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery.</b> A questionnaire survey based on the SERVQUAL model was carried out among 103 <b>parcel</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> users from the Cheras area, Kuala Lumpur.

40|$|Optimizing city {{logistics}} {{is a topic}} of great importance for big cities today. Even though the environmental- and economical consequences of the increasing goods transportation fleet has been present for quite some time, actions from affected stakeholders has not been taken until just recently.   In this brief 9 week project the aim has been to,  from a design point-of-view, in this complex topic, give a suggestion and raise a discussion onto how goods transportation in cities {{can be made in}} the future.   The basic idea is to get the consignments as close to the consignees and their travel patterns as possible. Public transportation networks are an existing grid where people are moving around and can potentially be used for combined transport of goods and people. The outcome of this concept is focusing on light parcel delivery towards private consignees, due to the increasing e-commerce trend. By using small transporter vehicles connected to buses, light parcels can be distributed throughout a city and easily accessible for consignees at the bus stops.   The transporter vehicle developed through this project aims to conceptualize connectivity and integration between mobility and <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>services,</b> to ease the every day life of urban citizens as well as decrease the environmental- and economical impacts which the distribution vehicle-fleet of today entails.   The design of the transporter vehicle is an interpretation of how a autonomous distribution vehicle can look like in a future city environment where the integration of public-utility-vehicles is of greater importance...|$|E

40|$|International audienceToday {{road haulage}} is France's most {{important}} transport mode, proving {{its ability to}} meet shippers' demands. Road haulage has several success factors, {{some of which are}} technical (for example, the speed and density of the motorway and road network). Others are economic (the low price or road transport). Last but not least, relationships among road hauliers {{play a major role in}} competitiveness. Among other factors, the opportunity that large companies have to subcontract with very small ones, with very low fixed costs and great flexibility, is often quoted as a major advantage. The ECHO survey, conducted in France in 2004, provides information on 10 000 shipments made by 3000 shippers. For each shipment, the survey gives details about the shipper, the shipment itself, and each company providing transport or logistics services for that shipment. The survey allows us to analyze subcontracting, by showing us each stage at which a shipment is contracted to the next carrier. This analysis reveals the frequency of subcontracting in France, and gives us the opportunity to study why subcontracts are made. Of course, some of the subcontracts are mainly cost driven. However, others aim at using the specialized skills of a particular haulier (a frequent service to a given destination, for example). Finally, the aim of some subcontracts is to increase transport chain efficiency. The usual transport segments are studied : single <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service,</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>service,</b> less than truck load, full truck load. The share of shipments and the number of tonnes which fall under the purview of subcontracting are studied. For each transport segment, subcontracting is described in terms of size of companies involved, services provided, and the reason for subcontracting. These results demonstrate the main features of several different types of subcontracting relationships. Beyond the search for low costs, the paper highlights the various forms of partnership between road hauliers...|$|R
