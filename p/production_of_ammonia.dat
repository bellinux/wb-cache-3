5|$|Norsk Hydro {{announced}} in 1963 a savings plan for its four plants in Norway; Chief Executive Officer Rolf Østbye {{made it clear}} that new technology in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammonia</b> would force the closure of the plant at Rjukan, {{and replace it with a}} petroleum-based process at Herøya. The Rjukan situation, as it was named in the press, became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Herøya, but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Herøya—what would become the death sentence for the Rjukan Line. Permission for the construction of the power line was granted in 1968. Production of fertilizer was moved to Herøya and Glomfjord, and Rjukan transferred to production of kalkammonsalpeter in 1963 and ammonium nitrate in 1964.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis aims {{to measure}} the harmful gas {{emissions}} and evaluate methods and technologies used in an observed fattening pigs company. Subsequently observed methods and technologies are compared with best available techniques BATs and economically evaluated. The thesis contains three hypotheses. 1. Do measured <b>production</b> emissions <b>of</b> <b>ammonia</b> from the selected plant comply with the limits and recommendation of EU directives? 2. Is the applied BAT suitable from the economical point of view even for Czech agriculturists? 3. Do measured values comply with the decrease <b>of</b> <b>ammonia</b> levels according to the calculated decrease in the BREF document? The measured values and subsequent evaluation show that the <b>production</b> emissions <b>of</b> <b>ammonia</b> comply with the EU directives.

BAT-reducing technologies used in the plant are suitable for Czech agriculturists...|$|R

25|$|Iceland already {{converts}} its {{surplus electricity}} into exportable goods and hydrocarbon replacements. In 2002, it produced 2,000tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis, {{primarily for the}} <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammonia</b> (NH3) for fertilizer. Ammonia is produced, transported, and used throughout the world, and 90% {{of the cost of}} ammonia is the cost of the energy to produce it. Iceland is also developing an aluminium-smelting industry. Aluminium costs are driven primarily by the cost of the electricity to run the smelters. Either of these industries could effectively export all of Iceland's potential geothermal electricity.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the Haber process for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammonia</b> in 1913, nitric acid was produced using the Birkeland–Eyde process, also known as the arc process. This process is based upon the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen by atmospheric oxygen to nitric oxide at very high temperatures. An electric arc was used to provide the high temperatures, and yields of up to 4% nitric oxide were obtained. The nitric oxide was cooled and oxidized by the remaining atmospheric oxygen to nitrogen dioxide, and this was subsequently absorbed in dilute nitric acid. The process was very energy intensive and was rapidly displaced by the Ostwald process once cheap ammonia became available.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe role of γ-glutamyl-transferase in {{regulation}} of N 2 -fixation and ammonia assimilation in Nostoc muscorum was examined by isolating mutants {{in which the}} enzyme was resistant to L-methionine—D,L-sulfoximine. Mutant and wild-type were compared with respect to nitrogenase activity, extracellular <b>production</b> <b>of</b> nitrogenase-catalysed <b>ammonia,</b> γ-glutamyl-transferase activity and growth in N 2 and glutamine media. While the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> inhibitor-resistant enzyme with defective γ-glutamyl-transferase activity fully explains the inhibitor-resistant growth phenotype, the present results also suggest close metabolic linkage between γ-glutamyl transferase, nitrogenase and assimilation and extracellular <b>production</b> <b>of</b> N 2 -derived ammonia...|$|R
