500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set {{to appear on the}} album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
2500|$|Further, Pallett writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> me in my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title. [...] "How brilliant. The title of the song is rhythmically weighted two ways—it's like a flank attack. Two {{sides of the same}} face. You WILL remember the name of this song." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "So Emotional", [...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] and [...] "Somebody's Somebody" [...] {{incorporate}} strong {{elements of}} R and soul. [...] "So Emotional" [...] is a midtempo gospel-inspired number {{talking about a}} man who has got Aguilera [...] "on the ropes." [...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] is a pop track which is musically similar to Carey's [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1996), while [...] "Somebody's Somebody", in which Aguilera sings about being secure in one's arms, features drums snap, bass pops, and a gospel organ in the bridge. Aguilera sings about a woman longing to reveal her true self on [...] "Reflection", which Partridge characterized it as the song that [...] "sums up the album." [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" [...] is deemed the most [...] "sexual" [...] track on Christina Aguilera, a hip hop-influenced song which features a rap verse written by Aguilera herself. [...] "When You <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>On</b> Me", an R song co-written by Robin Thicke, addresses the alchemy of sex: [...] "I just know / when you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> me / I feel sexy / and my body turns to gold." [...] "Blessed" [...] features elements of gospel, while [...] "Love Will Find A Way" [...] features an R groove and was compared to Carey's songs [...] "Emotions" [...] (1991) and [...] "Dreamlover" [...] (1993). On the final song, [...] "Obvious", Aguilera wonders whether her confusion about her life is apparent to everyone.|$|E

2500|$|While {{initially}} {{signed as}} a singer and artist in his own right, Thicke first {{made a name for}} himself within the industry as a songwriter and producer for other artists before releasing and performing his own music. Among his work for other artists, Thicke co-wrote [...] "Love Is on My Side" [...] on Brandy's eponymous debut album; he also wrote for 3T's Brotherhood, and collaborated with Jordan Knight, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on several songs in Knight's 1999 album Jordan Knight including the Billboard top 10 hit [...] "Give It to You". According to Thicke, Knight also invested in the ability of the young songwriter early on by purchasing studio equipment for him. He also co-wrote the song [...] "When You <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>on</b> Me" [...] for Christina Aguilera's debut album and co-wrote and produced three songs for Mýa's sophomore release, Fear of Flying. In 1999, Thicke co-wrote the song [...] "Fall Again" [...] with Walter Afanasieff, which was intended to be a track on Michael Jackson's 2001 album Invincible, but it failed to be presented as a completed song. The demo Michael recorded in 1999 was released on November 16, 2004 as an album track of his limited edition box set The Ultimate Collection. As an artist, he recorded and performed solely under his surname, Thicke. He would continue to do so until 2005.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{producers}} of the album was Guy Roche, who produced two tracks ("What a Girl Wants" [...] and [...] "I Turn to You") and co-wrote one of them ("What a Girl Wants"), along with Shelly Peiken. [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] was later re-recorded for its single release, replacing the [...] "lighter" [...] version for a more [...] "funky" [...] R version. Peiken also re-wrote with Roche the single version for the track [...] "Come on Over", first produced by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein and Aaron Zigman. According to herself, [...] "We're {{going to give it}} more of an edge, R it up a little, maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there." [...] Aguilera also recorded a cover of All-4-One's song [...] "I Turn to You", written by Diane Warren. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers (who would eventually broke into the scene as the producers who launched Rihanna's career) wrote and produced two tracks, while the then up-and-coming Robin Thicke co-wrote and co-produced [...] "When You <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>on</b> Me". Franne Golde (who previously worked with Whitney Houston) also wrote a song for Aguilera. At the final stages, producer and songwriter David Frank presented a song called [...] "Genie in a Bottle", which Aguilera almost didn't record, [...] "because {{there were a lot of}} other artists out there that were after this song, so we had to fight a little bit to get it," [...] she claimed. With Heather Holley, Aguilera also co-wrote a track called [...] "I Will Be", which she said was inspired by Mariah Carey's [...] "Vanishing". Producer of the track [...] "So Emotional" [...] revealed that Aguilera in-between recordings [...] "she was only listening to Mariah Carey and Brandy, putting on her walk man and practicing their riffs and runs, before she did her ad-libs.|$|E

6000|$|He {{could never}} have been {{anything}} but American, if he had tried, and he certainly never tried; but he certainly {{did not return to}} the outward simplicities of his life as I first knew it. There was no more round- hat-and-sack-coat business for him; he wore a frock and a high hat, and whatever else was rather like London than Cambridge; I do not know but drab gaiters sometimes added to the effect of a gentleman of the old school which he now produced upon the witness. Some fastidiousnesses showed themselves in him, which were not so surprising. He complained of the American lower class manner; the conductor and cabman would be kind to you but they would not be respectful, and he could not see the fun of this in the old way. Early in our acquaintance he rather stupified me by saying, [...] "I like you because you don't <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> me," [...] and I heard of his consenting to some sort of reception in those last years, [...] "Yes, if they won't shake hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{perfectly}} true that the Boer population, {{the men who}} signed the terms of peace at Vereeniging, have loyally observed those terms and have carried them out faithfully. They profess to-day, and I absolutely believe them, that no idea of an armed rising or unlawful action is in their minds. I may say I am in constant, perhaps I should say frequent communication with the men who in the war fought us so manfully and then made manful terms. We differ on many points, no doubt, and I do not expect them to rejoice with us in what has happened, or to feel affection for a man who, like myself, {{has been instrumental in}} bringing about the great change which has come over the Constitution of the country. But I firmly believe their word when they come forward and meet us, and, without professing to agree in all respects with the policy of the Government, declare that they desire to co-operate in all questions affecting the prosperity of the country and the maintenance of public order. I accept the assurance they give in that respect, and I think it is practically impossible to <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> anything done by myself or any member of the Government which can be regarded as a manifestation of distrust of the men who have shown themselves, and do show themselves, men of honour. Let me say, then, I am perfectly satisfied that so great is the influence of their leaders over the minds of the main section of the Boer population that so long as those leaders maintain that attitude a general rising is out of the question." ...|$|E
