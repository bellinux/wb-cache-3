5|$|Observatories were {{constructed}} {{to the north}} and south of the mountain, plus a bothy to accommodate equipment and the scientists. Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine the zenith distances with respect to the <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed due south. Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in the other. From the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars. By conducting sets of measurements with the plane of the zenith sector first facing east and then west, he successfully avoided any systematic errors arising from collimating the sector.|$|E
25|$|The tondo e quadro {{device is}} very similar to the Arab sine {{quadrant}} (Rubul mujayyab), with the corner rays replicating the role of the adjustable <b>plumb</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{every point}} on Earth, the local {{direction}} of gravity or vertical direction, materialized with the <b>plumb</b> <b>line,</b> is {{perpendicular to the}} geoid. On this is based a method, astrogeodetic levelling, for deriving the local figure of the geoid by measuring deflections of the vertical by astronomical means over an area.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{to modern}} spirit levels, the Chorobates {{consisted}} of a beam of wood 6 m in length held by 2 supporting legs and equipped with 2 <b>plumb</b> <b>lines</b> at each end. The legs were joined to the beam by two diagonal rods with carved notches. If the notches corresponding to the <b>plumb</b> <b>lines</b> matched on both sides, it showed that the beam was level. On top of the beam, a groove or channel was carved. If the condition was too windy for the plumb bobs to work effectively, the surveyor could pour water into the groove and measure the plane by checking the water level.|$|R
25|$|Traditional {{geodetic}} instruments such as theodolites rely on {{the gravity}} field for orienting their vertical axis along the local <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> or local vertical direction {{with the aid of}} a spirit level. After that, vertical angles (zenith angles or, alternatively, elevation angles) are obtained with respect to this local vertical, and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon, perpendicular to the vertical.|$|E
25|$|In the Earth's {{rotating}} {{frame of}} reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates {{from the one}} it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the northern hemisphere (and left in the southern) from {{the direction in which}} they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the differing rotation direction of cyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, when Bradley and Samuel Molyneux {{entered this}} sphere of {{research}} in 1725, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not, and {{it was with the}} intention of definitely answering this question that they erected a large telescope at Molyneux's house at Kew. They decided to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis with a telescope constructed by George Graham (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker. This was fixed to a vertical chimney stack in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a <b>plumb</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{experimental}} method for locating {{the center of}} mass is to suspend the object from two locations and to drop <b>plumb</b> <b>lines</b> from the suspension points. The intersection of the two lines {{is the center of}} mass.|$|R
50|$|This method can be {{extended}} (in theory) to concave shapes where the centroid lies outside the shape, and to solids (of uniform density), but {{the positions of the}} <b>plumb</b> <b>lines</b> need to be recorded by means other than drawing.|$|R
5000|$|Sulfur water (or sulphur water) is a {{condition}} where the running water contains a high amount of hydrogen sulfide gas that escapes into the air when the <b>plumbing</b> <b>line</b> is opened, giving a distinct [...] "rotten egg" [...] smell.|$|R
25|$|The {{same two}} factors {{influence}} {{the direction of}} the effective gravity (as determined by a <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> or as the perpendicular to the surface of water in a container). Anywhere on Earth away from the Equator or poles, effective gravity points not exactly toward the centre of the Earth, but rather perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} geoid, which, due to the flattened shape of the Earth, is somewhat toward the opposite pole. About half of the deflection is due to centrifugal force, and half because the extra mass around the Equator causes a change in {{the direction of the}} true gravitational force relative to what it would be on a spherical Earth.|$|E
25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local <b>plumb</b> <b>line.</b> When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.|$|E
500|$|After {{the attack}} on Southland, UB-14 broke down again and put in at Chanak to await repairs. While there on 4 September, word came of the British {{submarine}} [...] entangled in Turkish antisubmarine nets off Nagara Point. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and UB-14s cook, {{a man by the}} name of Herzig, set out in a rowboat to observe the Turkish attempts to destroy E7. After several mines that formed part of the net had been detonated to no avail, von Heimburg and his group rowed out and repeatedly dropped a <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> until it contacted metal. Then, von Heimburg dropped a Turkish sinker mine with a shortened fuse right on top of E7. After the hand-dropped mine detonated too close for the British submarine's captain's comfort, he ordered his boat surfaced, abandoned, and scuttled. Between shellfire from the Turkish shore batteries and E7s scuttling charges, von Heimburg and company narrowly escaped harm. While most sources credit E7s sinking to the Turkish efforts, author Robert Stern contends that von Heimburg and UB-14 deserve partial credit for the demise of E7.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{performance}} of gas adsorption cryocoolers is greatly improved by using adsorbents with low void volume within and between individual adsorbent particles (reducing void volumes in <b>plumbing</b> <b>lines),</b> and by compressing the working fluid {{in more than one}} stage. Refrigerator specific power requirements and compressor volumetric efficiencies are obtained in terms of adsorbent and <b>plumbing</b> <b>line</b> void volumes and operating pressures for various charcoal adsorbents using an analytical model. Performance optimization curves for 117. 5 and 80 K charcoal/nitrogen adsorption cryocoolers are given for both single stage and multistage compressor systems, and compressing the nitrogen in two stages is shown to lower the specific power requirements by 18 percent for the 117. 5 K system...|$|R
50|$|A 14th century instrument, the rectangulus, {{was invented}} by Richard of Wallingford. This carried out the same task as the torquetum, but was {{calibrated}} with linear scales, read by <b>plumb</b> <b>lines.</b> This simplified the spherical trigonometry by resolving the polar measurements directly into their Cartesian components.|$|R
25|$|Atlantis {{arrived at}} Palmdale, California in October 1992 for OMDP-1. During that visit 165 {{modifications}} were {{made over the}} next 20 months. These included the installation of a drag chute, new <b>plumbing</b> <b>lines</b> to configure the orbiter for extended duration, more than 800 new heat tiles and blankets and new insulation for main landing gear and structural modifications to the airframe.|$|R
2500|$|The Astrologer's {{instruments}} (horologium and palm) are a <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> and sighting instrument. They {{have been}} identified with two inscribed objects in the Berlin Museum; a short handle from which a <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> was hung, and a palm branch with a sight-slit in the broader end. The latter was held close to the eye, the former in the other hand, perhaps at arms length. The [...] "Hermetic" [...] books which Clement refers to are the Egyptian theological texts, which probably {{have nothing to do}} with Hellenistic Hermetism.|$|E
2500|$|Schneemann {{began work}} on the next film, <b>Plumb</b> <b>Line,</b> in her Autobiographical Trilogy in 1968. [...] The film opens with a still shot of a man's face with a <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> {{in front of it}} before the entire image begins to burn. [...] Various images {{including}} Schneemann and the man appear in different quadrants of the frame while a discombobulating soundtrack consisting of music, sirens, and cat noises among other things play in the background. [...] The sound and visuals grow more intense as the film progresses, with Schneemann narrating about a period of physical and emotional illness. [...] The film ends with Schneemann attacking a series of projected images and a repetition of the opening segment of the film. [...] During a showing of <b>Plumb</b> <b>Line</b> at a women's film festival, the film was booed for the image of the man {{at the beginning of the}} film.|$|E
2500|$|Astronomical {{latitude}} (...) is {{the angle}} between the equatorial plane {{and the true}} vertical at a point on the surface. The true vertical, {{the direction of a}} <b>plumb</b> <b>line,</b> is also the direction of the gravity acceleration, the resultant of the gravitational acceleration (mass-based) and the centrifugal acceleration at that latitude. Astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the zenith and stars whose declination is accurately known.|$|E
40|$|M. F. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical {{reference}}s. The {{title of}} this thesis exhibition, Out of True: Line and Body, is a direct reference to the <b>line</b> of the <b>plumb</b> bob and {{the body of the}} viewer. This thesis suggests that the obstacles in life, which we have most likely created for ourselves, will continuously push us out of true. The viewer is responsible for finding and following that one unconditional truth that one sets forth for one's self. A truth for one person can be completely different for another person. That is where the idea for multiple unconditional truths stems from. All of the hanging <b>plumb</b> <b>lines</b> are true even if they do not agree with one another. If multiple <b>plumb</b> <b>lines</b> are next to each other, all pointing {{to the center of the}} earth, they create a pie shape rather than being parallel to one another. This simply proves there are always multiple ways of truing one's self...|$|R
50|$|Before the {{announcement}} by Phoenicia occurred, rumors spread stating that Whole Foods Markets wanted to lease space in One Park Place {{to establish a}} store there. Originally the opening was scheduled for December 2010.

2500|$|However, {{based on}} {{abnormalities}} in <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> deflection by the Andes in Peru, Pierre Bouguer had deduced that less-dense mountains {{must have a}} downward projection into the denser layer underneath. The concept that mountains had [...] "roots" [...] was confirmed by George B. Airy a hundred years later, during study of Himalayan gravitation, and seismic studies detected corresponding density variations. Therefore, by the mid-1950s, the question remained unresolved as to whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating on it like an iceberg.|$|E

40|$|Several aesthetic, health, and {{plumbing}} quality issues can arise during new construction or renovation of premise plumbing. There {{has been little}} research done on many of these concerns and therefore few guidelines or regulations are in place to protect {{the health of the}} consumer or the integrity of the plumbing infrastructure. This work examines common construction practices including: 1) effect of residual construction debris, 2) shock chlorination of new <b>plumbing</b> <b>lines,</b> and 3) lead leaching propensity of new brass ball valves. During installation of plumbing systems, residual chemicals and debris including copper brass particles and flux, can be left in <b>plumbing</b> <b>lines</b> following construction and installation. This debris is considered undesirable from health, aesthetic, and corrosion perspectives. Soldering flux is of particular concern due to its corrosive nature. Experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} residual solder flux, PVC glue, and metallic debris and to quantify flushing velocities and durations to effectively remove them from a new plumbing system. A flushing velocity of 3 fps for 30 minutes is needed to remove water soluble flux, while petroleum based flux still persists after extensive flushing at 7 fps...|$|R
50|$|In 1925 Ladovsky {{teamed with}} El Lissitzky to design new housing for Ivanovo; their plans {{were based on}} {{arranging}} residential blocks at 120° in zigzag or star patterns.

60|$|So, {{with the}} {{wonderful}} pitching {{of an angry}} rube, the Worcester team came into its own again. I sat through it all without another word; without giving a signal. In a way I realized the awakening of the bleachers, and heard the pound of feet and the crash, {{but it was the}} spirit of my team that thrilled me. Next to that the work of my new find absorbed me. I gloated over his easy, deceiving swing. I rose out of my seat when he threw that straight fast ball, swift as a bullet, true as a <b>plumb</b> <b>line.</b> And when those hard-hitting, sure bunting Bisons chopped in vain at the wonderful drop, I choked back a wild yell. For Rube meant the world to me that day.|$|E
60|$|Berne {{carefully}} {{stepped into}} the batter's box, {{as if he wanted}} to be certain to the breadth of a hair how close he was to the plate. He was there this time to watch the Rube pitch, to work him out, to see what was what. He crouched low, and it would have been extremely hard to guess what he was up to. His great play, however, was his ability to dump the ball and beat out the throw to first. It developed presently, that this was now his intention and that the Rube knew it and pitched him the one ball which is almost impossible to bunt--a high incurve, over the inside corner. There was no mistaking the Rube's magnificent control. True as a <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> he shot up the ball--once, twice, and Berne fouled both--two strikes. Grudgingly he waited on the next, but it, too, was over the corner, and Berne went out on strikes. The great crowd did not, of course, grasp the finesse of the play, but Berne had struck out--that was enough for them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'From {{the top of}} {{the wall}} the ladder that led to one of these houses was 60 feet long, but it was not quite upright, and the tree was growing at some little {{distance}} {{from the bottom of the}} rock, and the distance by a <b>plumb</b> <b>line</b> from the floor of the verandah to the ground on the lower side of the tree was 94 feet. The floor of the house, which is made first, was 23 feet long and about 11 broad; a narrow verandah is left at each end, and the inside length of the house is 18 feet, the breadth 10 feet, the height to the ridge pole 6 feet. The floor was of bamboo matted, the roof and sides of palm-leaf thatch. The ladders were remarkable contrivances: a pole in the centre, from 4 to 6 inches in diameter, to which were lashed by vines cross pieces of wood, about two feet long. To steady these and hold on by were double shrouds of supple-jacks. The rungs of the ladder were at unequal distances, 42 upon the 50 feet ladder.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} {{needed to}} pump in the mixture caused the ground above to heave, causing the winding engine towers mounted above the shafts to tilt slightly.
