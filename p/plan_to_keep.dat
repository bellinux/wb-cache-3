Bill Hamid finished 3rd in voting for Goalkeeper of the Year, despite finishing first in voting among MLS club management. Although his save percentage made him the league leader, presumably the amount of time he missed for injuries played a factor in the voting, The team went into the offseason with a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the core together, announcing new deals for Saborio, Rolfe, Boswell and DeLeon, while discussions continued with Kitchen.|$|E
25|$|The {{format for}} the tournament will be a single group of ten teams, with each team playing the other nine teams, and the top four teams {{progressing}} to a knockout stage of semi-finals and a final.

The US alleged that the aviation elements should be in close proximity to the ground and logistics elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force, and the Japanese government of the time maintained the <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the replacement airbase within Okinawa.|$|E

25|$|Penn {{planned a}} {{city on the}} Delaware River {{to serve as a}} port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> houses and {{businesses}} spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the port, and subdivided and resold their lots. Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. It became an important trading center, poor at first, but with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{problems}} confronting Farley was that of personnel. Most of the officers and men who had joined the service during the war wished to leave {{as soon as possible}} after the war's end. Since much of the build-up of personnel numbers during the war were reservists, they were released from active duty quickly. This problem was helped somewhat by Waesche's <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> most permanent ranks one grade below the temporary wartime promotion ranks; this left the service with enough officers and petty officers but few men in the lower enlisted grades. Efforts to enlist new men into the lower ranks had to be made. With increased the responsibilities acquired during the war and a reduced number of personnel available, some missions had to be cut back severely or almost eliminated. Lifeboat stations were operated at bare minimum staffing levels, several cutters had to be put into the reserve fleet, and the Bering Sea Patrol was not operated in 1946 and 1947.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television pilot, {{a large portion of}} the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch's <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's version, however, television executives rejected it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch's characteristic style, has left the general meaning of the film's events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics, and cast members to speculate on what transpires. He gave the film the tagline [...] "A love story in the city of dreams".|$|E

500|$|Harry Flynn is a {{longtime}} business associate of Drake's and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Steve Valentine. In the second game, he approaches Drake, convincing him to [...] help steal an oil lamp from a Turkish museum for a wealthy client. The two, along with Frazer, <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the lamp for themselves, believing {{it will lead to}} the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and the treasures it holds. In reality, Flynn is working for Lazarevic, and betrays Drake, taking the location coordinates and landing Drake in prison. He then works with Lazarevic in searching for the Cintamani Stone. When Lazarevic apprehends Drake, he has Flynn force him to find the location of the entrance to Shambhala. [...] There, Lazarevic and his men, Flynn, Drake and company are attacked by the Guardians, where Flynn is gravely wounded due to a gunshot wound from Lazarevic, his employer having clearly grown tired of his failures. Flynn ultimately commits suicide while attempting to blow up Drake but severely wounds Fisher with a grenade. Naughty Dog used the dialog in the game to hint at the relationship between Drake and Flynn, but desired ambiguity regarding the exact nature of their past dealings, and to show what Drake could have become. Flynn mainly served to hint at the darker past where Drake performed less heroic activities. Flynn was not written as a British character; the casting of a British actor was mere coincidence.|$|E
