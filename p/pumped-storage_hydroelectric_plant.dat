25|$|Water {{is used in}} {{renewable}} power generation. Hydroelectric power derives {{energy from}} the force of water flowing downhill, driving a turbine connected to a generator. This hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. Significantly, hydroelectric power {{can also be used}} for load following unlike most renewable energy sources which are intermittent. Ultimately, the energy in a hydroelectric powerplant is supplied by the sun. Heat from the sun evaporates water, which condenses as rain in higher altitudes and flows downhill. <b>Pumped-storage</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>plants</b> also exist, which use grid electricity to pump water uphill when demand is low, and use the stored water to produce electricity when demand is high.|$|R

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{described in}} this paper were performed {{in order to determine}} whether the concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) in the Drava River, Slovenia, measured indirectly with optical sensors can be used to determine the amount and particle size of the suspended solids that can settle in stagnant water. The possibility of continuous monitoring of the TSS concentra-tions would allow a more reliable estimate of the amount of sediment in the accumulation lake of the planned, <b>pumped-storage,</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> power <b>plant</b> into which the water from the Drava River will be pumped. Therefore, during a period of one year, 90 water samples were taken di-rectly at the optical sensors. The amount of sediments and their mineral and chemical composi-tions were investigated, and particle size analyses were made in 15 samples. Microbiological pa-rameters, which included a determination of the amount of phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria, fungi and organic debris, were investigated in all the water samples, and the temperature and pH of the water were measured at the time when the samples were collected. The comparison of the parameters examined with the TSS concentrations showed that these concentrations can serve as a very good estimate of the amount of particles settled in the standing water, as well as of thei...|$|R
