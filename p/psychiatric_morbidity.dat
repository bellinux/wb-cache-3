40|$|Background: Short-term {{follow-up}} {{studies of}} {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) survivors suggested that their physical conditions continuously improved {{in the first}} year but that their mental health did not. We investigated long-term <b>psychiatric</b> <b>morbidities</b> and chronic fatigue among SARS survivors. Methods: All SARS survivors from the hospitals of a local region in Hong Kong were assessed by a constellation of psychometric questionnaires and a semistructured clinical interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) to determine the presence of psychiatric disorders and chronic fatigue problems. Results: Of 369 SARS survivors, 233 (63. 1 %) participated in the study (mean period of time after SARS, 41. 3 months). Over 40 % of the respondents had active psychiatric illnesses, 40. 3 % reported a chronic fatigue problem, and 27. 1 % met the modified 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Logistic regression analysis suggested that being a health care worker at the time of SARS infection (odds ratio [OR], 3. 24; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 12 - 9. 39; P = 3 D. 03), being unemployed at follow-up (OR, 4. 71; 95 % CI, 1. 50 - 14. 78; P = 3 D. 008), having a perception of social stigmatization (OR, 3. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 20 - 7. 60; P = 3 D. 02), and having applied to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2. 92; 95 % CI, 1. 18 - 7. 22; P = 3 D. 02) were associated with an increased risk of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>morbidities</b> at follow-up, whereas application to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2. 64; 95 % CI, 1. 07 - 6. 51; P = 3 D. 04) was associated with increased risk of chronic fatigue problems. Conclusions: <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>morbidities</b> and chronic fatigue persisted and continued to be clinically significant among the survivors at the 4 -year follow-up.

50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of any mental illness, even mild psychological distress {{is linked to}} {{an increased risk of}} illness and premature death. The majority of psychiatric illness' are also linked to lower intelligence. Thus it has been proposed that <b>psychiatric</b> <b>morbidity</b> may be another pathway through which intelligence and mortality are related. Despite this the direction of causation between Intelligence and mental health issues has been disputed. Some argue that mental health issues such as depression and schizophrenia may cause a decline in mental functioning and thus scores on intelligence tests whilst others believe that it is lower intelligence that effects likelihood of developing a mental health issue. Although evidence for both points of view has been found, most of the cognitive epidemiological studies are carried out using intelligence scores from childhood, when the psychiatric condition was not present, ensuring that it was not the condition which caused the lower scores. This link has been shown to explain part of the relationship between childhood intelligence and mortality, however the amount of variance explained varies from less than 10 percent to about 5 percent.|$|E

Children in foster care have a higher probability of having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and deficits in executive functioning, anxiety as well as other developmental problems. These children experience higher degrees of incarceration, poverty, homelessness, and suicide.Studies in the U.S. have suggested that some foster care placements may be more detrimental to children than remaining in a troubled home, but a more recent study suggested that these findings may have been affected by selection bias, and that foster care has little effect on behavioral problems.|$|E

Materials and methods: Patients with newly diagnosed HNC from a tertiary hospital were recruited into the study. They were assessed for <b>psychiatric</b> <b>morbidities</b> using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Their HRQL was simultaneously evaluated using {{the quality of life}} questionnaire of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer with a specific module for head and neck cancer; and depressed and nondepressed HNC patients were compared by using the generalized mixed-effect model for repeated measurements. Results: A total of 106 patients were recruited into this study. High rates of anxiety were found at pretreatment, but steadily declined over time (from 27. 3 % to 6. 4 %, and later 3. 3 %). A skew pattern of depression was observed, with prevalence rates from 8. 5 % at pretreatment to 24. 5 % and 14 % at 3 and 6 months, respectively, after treatment.

If left unchecked, the deteriorating health standards of these women and girls would have long-lasting negative effects on the Philippine society. Once the physical well-being of these women and girls has been compromised, the health of their potential offspring would also be adversely affected {{in one way or}} another.

Furthermore, the constant sexual exploitation and degradation these women and girls face may lead to various types of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>morbidity</b> and an impaired ability to form attachments and successful interpersonal personal relationships. Consequently, their poor health would prevent them from being competitive in the labor market and they cannot be as productive as the average, healthy worker.

This under-utilization of the nation's current human resources and the loss of future human capital would have long-term repercussions on the economic development of the Philippines.

Other psychological issues which obesity has been shown to trigger are low self-esteem, distorted body image, and body shaming.

Method Around one year after a super-cyclone, proportion of adolescents exhibiting post-traumatic psychiatric symptoms, prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, comorbidity and impairment of performance in school were studied in Orissa, India. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents was used for evaluation and diagnosis. The criteria for diagnoses were based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – IV. Results Post-disaster psychiatric presentation in adolescents was a conglomeration of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. The prevalences of PTSD, major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder were 26. 9 %, 17. 6 % and 12. 0 % respectively. Proportion of adolescents with any diagnosis was 37. 9 %. Comorbidity was found in 39. 0 % of adolescents with a psychiatric diagnosis. Adolescents from middle socioeconomic status were more affected.

40|$|Abstract Background Suicidality in HIV/AIDS is {{not only}} a {{predictor}} of future attempted suicide and completed suicide, it is also associated with poor quality of life and poor adherence with antiretroviral therapy. This paper examines the prevalence and correlates of suicidality in HIV/AIDS in the African nation of Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken among 618 respondents attending two HIV clinics in semi-urban Uganda. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on demographic, social, psychological and clinical factors. Correlates of suicidality were assessed using mulitvariable logistic regression. Results Prevalence of ‘moderate to high risk for suicidality’ (MHS) was 7. 8 % and that of life-time attempted suicide was 3. 9 %. Factors associated with MHS at univariate analysis were: female gender, food insecurity, increasing negative life events, high stress score, negative coping style, past psychiatric history, psychosocial impairment, diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Factors independently associated with MHS in multivariate models were female gender, increasing negative life events, a previous psychiatric history, and major depressive disorder. Conclusions These results are in agreement with the stress-vulnerability model where social and psychological stressors acting on an underlying diathesis (including previous and current <b>psychiatric</b> <b>morbidities)</b> leads to suicidality. These results identify potential targets to mitigate risk through treatment of psychiatric disorders and promoting greater adaptation to living with HIV/AIDS. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} how alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients with {{post-traumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) differed from those without PTSD in terms of demography, drinking patterns and C-reactive protein, inflammatory cytokines, tryptophan metabolism parameters, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Methods: A consecutive sample (N = 187) of treatment-receiving AUD individuals were recruited from Nepalese facilities. They underwent fully structured psychiatric interviews. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 1 Receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra), IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ] were determined by a multiplex assay, kynurenine and tryptophan levels by high-performance liquid chromatography, and BDNF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The prevalence of exposure to severe trauma and PTSD was 74 % and 17 %, respectively. PTSD comorbidity {{was not associated with}} age, gender, or socioeconomic status, but with co-occurring major depression, history of attempted suicide, earlier peak of drinking problems, higher drinking quantity and withdrawal symptoms, experiencing alcoholic blackouts, and drinking problems among parents.
