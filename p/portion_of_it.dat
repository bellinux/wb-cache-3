5|$|Aval Appadithan was {{released}} on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. Although the film received positive critical reception, {{it was not a}} box office success {{at the time of its}} release. However, the film began to develop an audience after directors P. Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen commented positively about it. The film was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay, and dialogue, a large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being in English.|$|E
5|$|Aval Appadithan {{is one of}} {{only two}} films ever {{directed}} by Rudhraiya; the other was Gramathu Athiyayam (1980). Aval Appadithan was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay and dialogue, a large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being in English. The dialogues were sharp and were considered almost vulgar. It also broke the style of filmmaking followed up until that time. It was the first film made by a graduate from the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute, facilitating Indian film technology students to achieve success in the film industry. Sripriya included it in her list of favourite films she had worked in. Rudhraiya's daughter, Ganga, noted that Aval Appadithan help her face life in the real world.|$|E

5|$|Before 1926, all {{of modern}} US491 existed as state routes. In New Mexico, US666 absorbed {{a portion of}} State Road 32 (NM32) from Gallup to Shiprock, and {{completely}} replaced NM121 from Shiprock to the Colorado state line. The portion in Colorado was numbered State Highway108 (SH108) from the New Mexico state line to Cortez, and SH10 from Cortez to Utah. At the time, SH10 traversed the southern portion of Colorado. While most of this route was absorbed by the U.S. Highway System, a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> still exists. In Utah, the route was originally numbered State Route 9 (SR9), which also included what is now US191 from Monticello to Crescent Junction. Utah has since re-used the SR9 designation for a different road.|$|E
5|$|Marie Louise Gardens is a {{relatively}} small park {{to the west of}} the centre of Didsbury. The park was originally owned by the Silkenstadt family as part of the grounds of their house. The land was bequeathed to the people of Manchester by Mrs Silkenstadt in 1904 in memory of her daughter, Marie Louise. The park was at the centre of controversy in 2007 after Manchester City Council proposed to sell a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to a private property developer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 19, 1845, a large {{earthquake}} resulted in a substantial mudflow. This mudflow flowed down {{the valley of the}} Lagunillas River for approximately , spilling out of the river channel and killing much of the local population. After reaching an alluvial fan, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000people were killed in the mudflows.|$|E

5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, {{the parking lot was}} flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major washout was reported in West Palm Beach at the intersection of State Roads 80 and 882. Also in West Palm Beach, a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in West Palm Beach after driving through the storm and crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95. Several major and minor roads were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E
5|$|In c. 1311, {{the sole}} {{surviving}} daughter of William II Villehardouin, Margaret, sought, {{by virtue of}} her descent, to claim the Principality, {{or at least a}} <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> including Chlemoutsi and Kalamata, from the Angevin Kings of Naples who had controlled it since 1278. To this end, in February 1314 she wedded her only daughter, Isabel of Sabran, to Ferdinand of Majorca, and passed her titles and claims to them. She then returned to Achaea, where she was imprisoned by the Angevin bailli at Chlemoutsi, where she died in February or March 1315. Ferdinand landed at Glarentza in June 1315, claiming the Principality from the Angevin nominee, Louis of Burgundy. Chlemoutsi and most of Elis fell rapidly under Ferdinand's control, but he was eventually defeated and killed in the Battle of Manolada in July 1316. The remaining Majorcan troops ceded the fortresses they held in Elis and set sail for home shortly after.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when Voltaire wrote Candide, but {{scholars}} estimate {{that it was}} primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire {{is believed to have}} written a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> while at his house in Ferney and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate at Schwetzingen, for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote Candide in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work La Vie intime de Voltaire aux Délices et à Ferney by Lucien Perey (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras. The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise Candide, but worked on it over a significant period of time, possibly even a whole year. Candide is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth might suggest.|$|E
5|$|Many comets and asteroids {{collided}} with Earth {{in its early}} stages. Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 billion years ago brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, {{or at least a}} significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Others have cast doubt on this idea. The detection of organic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth. In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis. In 2015, scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in the outgassings of comet 67P, suggesting that the molecule may occur more often than had been thought, and thus less an indicator of life as has been supposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} receives several surgical {{residents from}} Mercy West {{as they enter}} Seattle Grace, a repercussion of the recent merger. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is recovering from her liver transplantation surgery, after donating a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to her father. In the residents' lounge, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening to fight her. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are working in the emergency room, when Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams)' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act {{in the manner of}} Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy (Robert Baker). After months of the two not speaking, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez)'s father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|A social {{rational}} for the Hindu {{concept of}} rebirth in Hell {{is evident in}} the metric work of the Manusmrti: a written discourse focused on the “law of the social classes”. A large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. For this we turn to the Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences. An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise way in which a person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows (such as fasting, water purification rituals, chanting, and even sacrifices). These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in. These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior.|$|E
