5000|$|In 2015 a {{complaint}} {{was raised in}} Submission 134 to the Senate committee on the scrutiny of financial advice concerning six conversations between the Ombudsman and a consumer’s representative, who had recorded the telephone conversation. Submission 134 {{made it clear that}} there were differences between the telephone recordings and the working notes of those conversations made by the Ombudsman. Thereafter the Ombudsman was reported by media as having confirmed [...] "the <b>decision</b> to refer <b>the</b> matter to a court given the complexity of the dispute, the inability of the FOS to cross examine all relevant witnesses and compel the production of information from third parties, as well as the need to engage experts", even though in recordings of the conversations the same Ombudsman said the only reason to dismiss the complaint was lack of staff, that the complaint had merit and that if the FOS had staff they would have ruled the dispute inside jurisdiction. It was this decision that subsequently resulted in Supreme Court <b>proceedings</b> to <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> jurisdictional <b>decision</b> of <b>the</b> FOS not to handle the particular complaint.|$|R
