This burst of molten metal is called expulsion, and when this occurs the metal will be thinner and have less strength than a weld with no expulsion.

Because both tests are destructive in nature (resulting in the loss of salable material), non-destructive methods such as ultrasound evaluation are in various states of early adoption by many OEMs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a suitable procedure to prepare <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> specimens using coarse aggregates and compare the results with the established standard <b>peel</b> <b>test.</b> The newly developed composite substrate <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> (CSPT) was found to be effective in characterising the moisture sensitivity of the aggregate–bitumen bond and the results correlated well with the results from a standard <b>peel</b> <b>test.</b> The results from the CSPT and the standard <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> showed that the fracture energy after moisture damage was found to be aggregate type dependent. Limestone tends to have better resistance to moisture damage than granite when moisture adsorptions are similar. Furthermore, in terms of similar aggregates, lower moisture adsorption results in better moisture resistance. This phenomenon suggests that in a moisture susceptible asphalt mixture, the effect of aggregate may be more influential than the effect of bitumen. Strong correlations were found between the standard <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> and the CSPT in terms of moisture damage evaluation and suggest that the CSPT maybe a more practical procedure to test the aggregate–bitumen bond for actual aggregates used in asphalt mixtures...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of interface mechanical properties between {{an adhesive layer}} and a substrate is significant for optimization of a high-quality interface. A common method for measuring these properties is the <b>peel</b> <b>test.</b> While there are many interesting applications of peel {{in such areas as}} cell and gecko adhesion, the focus here is to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} fundamental mechanics underlying the problem. The mechanics of the <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> is examined through experiments, finite element simulations, and theoretical analysis with the aim of developing governing relations to describe the role of fracture in the <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> for elastic adhesive tapes. An inverse formulation is developed to extract a cohesive zone law from a set of experimental peel tests using a theoretical framework based upon non-linear beam theory. Through extracting a cohesive zone law, the adhesion energy during a <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> is determined along with the force distribution in the process zone. This local method of determining the adhesion energy is compared to a global method used by Rivlin in the context of finite deformations, showing good agreement. The effect of rate-dependency in the <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> is also examined experimentally, with the results used to derive a rate-dependent power-law for the adhesion energy in a <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> as a function of the peel rate. The effects of varying different geometrical parameters during the <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> and how they affect the force distribution and adhesion energy are also presented. Finally, a study of the stability in the <b>peel</b> <b>test,</b> including the role of compliance through several newly developed force-controlled experimental configurations is discussed. The stiffness of the system is varied by altering the magnitude and direction of the applied load during a test.

40|$|The present work {{considers}} the numerical simulation of the steady-state fracture of adhesively bonded joints in various <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> configurations. The model {{is based on}} a multiscale approach involving the simulation of the continuum elastoplastic response of the adherends and the adhesive layer, {{as well as of the}} fracture process taking place inside the adhesive layer using a cohesive zone formulation. The model parameters are firstly identified by comparison with experimental results obtained with the wedge-peel test. Secondly, the ability of the model to predict <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> results obtained with different <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> configurations (e. g. wedge-peel or fixed-arm <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> geometries and various adhesive layer or arm thicknesses) is critically assessed by comparison with experimental data. Thirdly, the results of the steady-state simulations are post-processed in order to: (i) evaluate the adhesive fracture energy, (ii) quantify and discuss the different contributions to plastic dissipation within the adhesive layer, and (iii) explain how these mechanisms affect the adhesive fracture energy as a function of the <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> configuration. The values of adhesive fracture energy, G(a), deduced from the numerical simulations proposed in the present paper, from all the various elastic-plastic <b>peel</b> <b>test</b> configurations, lie in the range of about 900 +/- 50 J/m(2); whilst the values from a previous analytical model and a node-release finite-element analysis model, for a cohesive fracture of the present adhesive, all lie in the range of about 1100 +/- 250 J/m(2). Thus, there is very good agreement between the different modelling methods.
