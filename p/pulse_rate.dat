5|$|The diving reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E

However, this laser has some limitations, including operation at low <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> and a multimode spatial beam profile which prohibits its use with smaller, more flexible optical fibers. Our laboratory is studying the Thulium fiber laser (λ = 1908 nm) as an alternative lithotripter. The TFL has several advantages, including lower stone ablation thresholds, use with smaller and more flexible fibers, and operation at arbitrary pulse lengths and <b>pulse</b> <b>rates.</b> Previous studies have reported increased stone ablation rates with TFL operation at higher <b>pulse</b> <b>rates,</b> however, stone retropulsion remains an obstacle to even more efficient stone ablation.

25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{of the effects of}} synephrine in humans, most of them {{focusing}} on its cardio-vascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that intramuscular injections (average effective dose = 200mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> without affecting the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given intravenously, doses of 25–50mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. Subcutaneous administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200mg had no effects on blood pressure or <b>pulse</b> <b>rate.</b> Oral doses of 500–1500mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting.|$|E

25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|E
40|$|Speech {{test results}} have {{indicated}} that improvements in speech comprehension {{can be achieved by}} means of coding strategies with high <b>pulse</b> <b>rates.</b> A possible effect of using high rates to encode speech information is that temporal information such as formant transitions could be better represented in the resulting electrode activity. A psychophysical study involving 4 cochlear implant users was carried out to observe the effect of various carrier <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> on the absolute identification of stimuli with a transient electrode trajectory. Also, the duration of the trajectory was varied. The results from this study indicated, first, that the trajectory identification became progressively more difficult as the duration of the trajectory was shortened. The identification score generally deteriorated much faster at a lower <b>rate</b> (100 <b>pulses</b> per second [pps]) than at higher rates (300 and 500 pps) with decreasing transient duration. The higher two <b>pulse</b> <b>rates,</b> 300 pps and 500 pps, yielded results similar to one another for longer (500 and 300 milliseconds) transient durations, but the identification of shorter (100 and 50 milliseconds) transient durations was better at 500 pps than at 300 pps. The implication is that higher carrier <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> are {{likely to be able to}} transmit short transient information better than lower ones.

40|$|Interaural time {{difference}} (ITD) arises whenever a sound {{outside of the}} median plane arrives at the two ears. There is evidence that ITD in the rapidly varying fine structure of a sound is most important for sound localization and for understanding speech in noise. Cochlear implants (CIs), neural prosthetic devices that restore hearing in the profoundly deaf, are increasingly implanted to both ears to provide implantees with the advantages of binaural hearing. CI listeners {{have been shown to}} be sensitive to fine structure ITD at low <b>pulse</b> <b>rates,</b> but their sensitivity declines at higher <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> that are required for speech coding. We hypothesize that this limitation in electric stimulation is at least partially due to binaural adaptation associated with periodic stimulation. Here, we show that introducing binaurally synchronized jitter in the stimulation timing causes large improvements in ITD sensitivity at higher <b>pulse</b> <b>rates.</b> Our experimental results demonstrate that a purely temporal trigger can cause recovery from binaural adaptation. Thus, binaurally jittered stimulation may improve several aspects of binaural hearing in bilateral recipients of neural auditory prostheses...|$|R

25|$|In angina {{patients}} momentarily {{not feeling}} any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless {{there have been}} other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> can lead to some conclusion regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in systolic blood pressure), dysrhythmia and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough {{for the purposes of the}} treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress Echocardiography.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation {{machines}} that utilize electric motor-driven pumps are also available. These irrigation devices pump salt water solution through a tube, {{in connection with}} a nasal adapter tip designed to seal against the nostril. Some of these machines allow adjustment of water volume/speed by use of an adjustment dial which regulates pump speed and volume per minute. Most of these motorized machines use a pulsatile or pulsating water pumping action at a relatively low, predetermined fixed pulse cyclic rate, designed to match the normal wave rate of healthy, unobstructed nasal cilia. This matched <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> is claimed to stimulate the nasal cilia hairs and promote better sinus health, while reducing the severity of allergic reactions. More sophisticated motorized irrigators have two or more pulse cycle settings that adjust the actual pulse cycle (as opposed to a simple volume/speed control, which does not alter the pulse cyclic rate). This design affords the user the option of using a higher pulse cyclic rate when suffering from partially closed sinuses, as in a typical case of acute sinusitis. The efficacy of all motorized pump irrigators has not yet been tested compared to simpler non-motorized mechanical pressure nasal irrigation methods.|$|E

The interbeat intervals of 70 healthy male subjects were measured in standing, sitting and supine positions. <b>Pulse</b> <b>rates</b> for various durations were calculated by objective-scoring simulation based on the heartbeat recordings of the subjects. The duration of pulse-counting continuously varied from 6 to 60 s in the simulation. Simulated <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> were compared with the rate calculated from the 60 s that includes the given duration, and the absolute difference between the two rates was defined as the error. Average errors of pulse-counting for 15 s were 1. 89, 1. 89 and 1. 80 bpm for standing, sitting and supine positions, respectively. No difference in error was observed between standing and sitting positions; however, smaller errors were observed in the supine position. Practitioner Summary: This study provides information on the degree of error that will occur when <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> are objectively scored for various durations, for example 10, 15 or 30 s, instead of a full minute.

The significant correlation could not be found between the time requied to 100 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running and the latter three. However, the time requied to 1500 m. 2 ̆ 7 s and 10000 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running had a certain relation to the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> after J. S. D.

From the results above mentioned, even though the merits and demerits of three kinds of tests can not easily be discussed, so far as the examination of bodily strength is concerned, however Harvard 2 ̆ 7 s step test and J. S. D. F. 2 ̆ 7 s method may be concluded to be more available than Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s test. The similarity of the results seen between Harvard 2 ̆ 7 s step test and J. S. D. F. 2 ̆ 7 s method can be attributable to the common feature of these tests which do not take up both the severity of the load and the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> before the load, but adopt the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> for their criterions. These two methods are fairly siutable to screen the bodily strength in mass population owing to the methodological simplicity and the relatively high reliance. Nextly, in order to study why Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s cardie-pulmonary index does not show any correlation to the scores obtained by the running test, the propriety of both estimation of every item of scoring and its synthetic descrimination was investigated. The cardio-pulmonary index showed the close correlation to the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> in recumbence Tab. 2 Correlation between Running and Simple Circulatory Function Test [table] which <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> come importantly into play (Tab. 1).

Therefore the cardio-pulmonary index may be said not to have any uniform degree of the correlation to every item of the scorings, that is, one might say that the overestimation of three items above mentioned is not quite fair. Tab. 3 Correlation between Each Constituent of Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s Index and Others (400 cases) [table] Level of Significance σr= 1 /√, 30 σr<r, 3 σr=± 0. 150 Furthermore these three items were not co-related to the scores obtained by 100 m 2 ̆ 7 s, 1500 m. 2 ̆ 7 s and 10000 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running tests respectively, so that the synthetic estimation with three sorts of scores may not, just as it is, be regarded as the criterion of the physical strength. Then, in order to examine whether any error may exist in the scoring of each item, the correlation was investigated among the scoring of each item. As shown in tab. 3 and fig. 4, the significant correlation could not be observed among the increase in the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> by recumbence and standing; so far as the range of the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> in recumbence adopted for samples is concerned (nig. 4), these may be no necessity to score the increasing <b>rate</b> of the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> by standing with regard to the extent of the <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> in recumbence as Schneider had already emphasized. The time required at 100 m. 2 ̆ 7 s 1500 m. 2 ̆ 7 s and 10000 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running test was used to the quantitative criterion of physical strength. J. S. D.
