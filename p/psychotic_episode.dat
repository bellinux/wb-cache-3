5|$|Prevention of {{schizophrenia}} is difficult {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia. While {{there is some evidence}} that early intervention in those with a <b>psychotic</b> <b>episode</b> may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years. Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{articles}} have appeared {{over the last}} years devoted to mental side effects during zonisamide (ZNS) treatment. In this study, we were particularly interested in <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes.</b> Seventy-four epileptic patients with a history of ZNS treatment were surveyed retrospectively over the period spanning 1 March 1984 to 30 June 1994. They were divided into two groups according to {{the presence or absence of}} <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> during ZNS treatment. We analysed various factors pertaining to <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> during ZNS treatment. Of the 74 patients 14 had <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes.</b> We found that the incidence of <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> during ZNS treatment was several times higher than the previously reported prevalence of epileptic psychosis, and that the risk of <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> was higher in young patients. In 13 patients, <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> occurred within a few years of commencement of ZNS. In children, obsessive-compulsive symptoms appeared to be related to <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes.</b> It is important to terminate ZNS as soon as possible if <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> develop and never restart, even if seizures become worse. It cannot definitely be proved that ZNS causes <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes,</b> as information on mental side effects during ZNS monotherapy is scant, but it does appear likely that ZNS contributes to <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> during polytherapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Psychosis {{is rare in}} {{untreated}} {{patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD) but the prevalence rises to 40 % during dopaminergic treatment. So far, no systematic comparison of the psychogenic potential of different dopaminergic drugs had been performed. Methods Eighty PD patients with <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> were compared to an age-matched control group of PD patients without <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> (n = 120) in a cross-sectional retrospective study. Results We found {{a positive correlation between}} <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> and dementia, number of concomitant medication, and pergolide intake. Odds ratio calculation confirmed the association with dementia. With respect to dopaminergic treatment, pergolide showed the highest odds ratio, levodopa the lowest. An adjusted logistic regression model confirmed the strong association with <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> and pergolide and no association with levodopa (adjusted odds ratio 2. 01 and 0. 11, respectively). Conclusion The analysis indicates that dementia and concomitant medication are factors in PD associated with psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, different dopaminergic drugs showed markedly different associations with psychotic symptoms</p...|$|R

If the parties are admitted to hospital separately, then the delusions in the person with the induced beliefs usually resolve without the need of medication.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Kees {{separated}} from his wife Ann, whose alcoholism led to a <b>psychotic</b> <b>episode</b> triggered by watching the Army–McCarthy hearings on television. After having her institutionalized, Kees divorced her around the time that his last book appeared, Poems, 1947–1954 (San Francisco, Adrian Wilson, 1954). He then focused on organizing a musical revue, Pick Up the Pieces, which eventually became a much more elaborate venue of literary burlesque, titled Poets Follies, which premiered in January 1955 and featured a stripper reading the poetry of Sarah Teasdale (sic).|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of parental expressed emotion (EE) is analysed over about 9 years, {{and related to}} course of illness in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. Families, who participated in a 15 -month intervention, were randomised over two intervention conditions. <b>Psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> were measured over 5 years after discharge, The Five Minute Speech Sample (FMSS) EE was elicited two times during the 12 -month outpatient intervention and two times over 8 years after discharge on average, EE is expressed as criticism/dissatisfaction (CRIT), emotional overinvolvement (EOI), and as the classical dichotomous index. EE is not stable over the years. Intervention condition had no differential effect on EE as measured with CRIT and the dichotomous index. For EOI, an interaction between intervention condition and time was found. EE as assessed during intervention does not predict <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> during follow-up, An association was found between <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> and CRIT as assessed at 34 months after discharge. Family intervention may inhibit the development of high EOI for a limited period.

25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the {{original}} investigation was not that of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a <b>psychotic</b> <b>episode.</b> Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards.

25|$|Several known {{deaths have}} been {{associated}} with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. Olson, a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe <b>psychotic</b> <b>episode.</b> The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.|$|E

Davies was the {{youngest}} of three children and their only son. Because he was born by C-section, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a <b>psychotic</b> <b>episode.</b> He described his mother's experience as [...] "literally ... like science fiction" [...] and an early inspiration for his writing career. As a child, Davies was almost always referred to by his middle name. He grew up in a household that [...] "never switched the TV off" [...] until after closedown, and he subsequently became immersed in dramas such as I, Claudius and Doctor Who. One of his first memories, at the age of three, was the 1966 Doctor Who serial The Tenth Planet. He was also an avid cartoonist and comics enthusiast, and purchased series such as Asterix and Peanuts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objectives: Although {{pharmacotherapy}} with antipsychotic {{medication is}} an effective intervention for early psychosis (EP), drop out from treatment and relapse rates appear still relatively high. In the last decade, there is growing interest in Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) as early intervention for EP. Some studies suggest that CBT may be an effective adjuvant to pharmacotherapy to reduce risk of development of chronic psychosis in individuals who experienced first episodes. Symptoms of depression and social anxiety are very common among patients experiencing first episode psychosis, thus impairing {{quality of life and}} functioning. This aspect may create a negative vicious cycle, that may reinforce feelings of learned helplessness and hopelessness with regard to psychosis diagnosis, thus increasing vulnerability to relapse in further episodes. However, there is little knowledge on the use of CBT to target both reoccurrence of <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> and symptoms of depression and social anxiety secondary to first <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes.</b> The current case report presents the administration of a modular CBT semi-manualized intervention to a young patient to enhance prevention of psychosis and target symptoms of social anxiety and depression following first <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes.</b> Methods: Treatment consisted in 21 individual weekly sessions, delivered in an outpatient setting, involving two phases. The first one targeted prevention of <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes.</b> Case formulation was developed according to cognitive behavioural model of psychosis. Psychoeducation on earl...|$|R

He continued treating her as an outpatient with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug. She was re-admitted to St Andrew's in March 1985, five months before the murders, after a <b>psychotic</b> <b>episode</b> in which she believed herself to be in direct communication with God and that people, including her boyfriend, were trying to hurt or kill her.

40|$|A {{tentative}} {{model of}} schizophrenic <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> is presented, {{based on the}} evidence that certain characteristics of individuals may serve as vulnerability factors and that environmental stressors may precipitate psychotic periods in vulnerable individuals. Certain information-processing deficits, autonomic reactivity anomalies, and social competence and coping limitations are viewed as potential vulnerability factors. Stressors in the form of discrete life events as well as the prevailing level of social environmental stress are seen as factors that interact with preexisting vulnerability characteristics to produce vicious circles, which lead, in turn, to <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes.</b> A distinction among stable vulnerability indicators, mediating vulnerability factors, and episode indicators is suggested to differentiate types of abnormalities that characterize individuals prone to or manifesting schizophrenic disorder. Some major areas of unresolved questions in relation to this view of schizophrenic <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> are discussed. The primary purpose of this concluding article in the present series is to integrate the major conclusions of the preceding five articles into a tentative vulnerability/stress model of schizophrenic <b>psychotic</b> <b>episodes</b> that might suggest possible interacting contributions of the individual factors. Due to the relatively broad nature of the constructs that presently need to be used to bridge the diverse possible vulnerability and stress factors, the model is a framework or schema for further developments rather than a formal hypothetico-deductive model. Equally as important as the tentative model is an attempt to identify unresolved issues that now preclude a clearer theoretical integration...|$|R
