25|$|Kelly {{writes that}} Stevenson became {{dissatisfied}} with the reductionism he encountered in biochemistry, and wanted to study the whole person. He became interested in psychosomatic medicine, psychiatry and psychoanalysis, and in the late 1940s, worked at New York Hospital exploring <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illness</b> {{and the effects of}} stress, and in particular why one person's response to stress might be asthma and another's high blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|According to Henry Krystal, {{individuals}} {{suffering from}} alexithymia think in an operative way and {{may appear to}} be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals lack imagination, intuition, empathy, and drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illness</b> or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958 and 1959, Stevenson contributed several {{articles}} and book reviews to Harper's about parapsychology, including <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illness</b> and extrasensory perception, and in 1958, he submitted the winning entry to a competition {{organized by the}} American Society for Psychical Research, {{in honor of the}} philosopher William James (1842–1910). The prize was for the best essay on [...] "paranormal mental phenomena and their relationship to the problem of survival of the human personality after bodily death." [...] Stevenson's essay, [...] "The Evidence for Survival from Claimed Memories of Former Incarnations" [...] (1960), reviewed forty-four published cases of people, mostly children, who claimed to remember past lives. It caught the attention of Eileen J. Garrett (1893–1970), the founder of the Parapsychology Foundation, who gave Stevenson a grant to travel to India to interview a child who was claiming to have past-life memories. According to Jim Tucker, Stevenson found twenty-five other cases in just four weeks in India and was able to publish his first book on the subject in 1966, Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{specific}} psychological aspects of the premenstrual syndrome, such as stress, attitudes towards menstruation, and past history of <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Thirteen PMS subjects, were compared with 8 control subjects, who reported only minimal or no premenstrual symptoms. In comparison to controls, PMS subjects regarded menstruation as significantly more debilitating. No significant differences were found between the groups in levels of stress. However, the PMS group evidenced a significantly greater tendency to react to emotional stress, with overcontrol, i. e. the need to control and suppress emotions. In addition, the PMS group evidenced a significantly greater history of <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illnesses,</b> than controls. Finally, there was a significant group reduction in symptom severity, within the PMS group, over the two month period of daily monitoring of symptoms. The results of this study suggest that certain psychological factors may be implicated in premenstrual symptom severity. PsychologyM. A. (Social Science (Psychology) ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{prevalence}} of psychosomatic disorders in psychiatric patients in India. The psychosomatic disorders studied were hypertension, peptic ulcer, bron-chial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, ischaemic heart disease and chronic pain. 21. 5 % of psychiatric patients had <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Fifty five cases had two <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Chronic pain (14. 4 %) and hypertension (9. 9 %) were the commonest. Patients with psychosomatic disorders were significantly more often older in age, females, married and from an urban habitat. Neurotic illness was the com-monest diagnosis in them. Psychosis was significantly and inversely associated with psychosomatic disorders. This report emphasises the need for as much attention on psychosomatic problems in developing countries as in affluent ones. Psychosomatic medicine shares some of its key assumptions with traditional medicine and could help salvage those aspects of the latter which would usefully complement scientific medicine (Lipowski & Brockway, 1980). Although modern psychosomatic medicine evolved in the developed and affluent countries of the western world, it is equally relevant to all nations (Chan-nabasavanna & Chaturvedi, 1987; Lipowski & Brockway, 1980) including developing coun...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the genesis of emotional and <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illnesses</b> {{is of paramount importance}} in medicine. This paper is an attempt to obtain a perspective of the problem as it presents itself to the general practitioner. It consists of (a), a study of the incidence of emotional and <b>psychosomatic</b> <b>illnesses</b> in general practice, and (b) of a study of the causes of such illnesses. 950 cases were studied consecutively in the month of November, 1969 as they attended the office. A case would be classified as psychosomatic on 3 conditions: (1) The condition must belong to one of those listed as possibly psychosomatic. (2) The patient must admit to an emotional disturbance. (3) The emotional disturbance must precede the somatic condition. In this study an attempt was made to trace the relationship between life events and emotional illness. According to this study the catastrophic events are: ill-health in a household member, bereavement, son or daughter leaving home, demotion or loss of a job, menopause, alcoholic spouse, and separation from parents or next of kin. peer-reviewe...|$|R
