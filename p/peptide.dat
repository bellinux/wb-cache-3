5|$|Carboxypeptidase cleaves <b>peptide</b> {{linkages}} during digestion of proteins. A coordinate {{covalent bond}} is formed between the terminal <b>peptide</b> and a C=O group attached to zinc, {{which gives the}} carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.|$|E
5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a <b>peptide</b> and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing <b>peptide</b> bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E
5|$|However, not all <b>peptide</b> {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This <b>peptide</b> is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a <b>peptide</b> bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
40|$|AbstractChloroplast transit <b>peptides</b> {{from the}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been {{analyzed}} and compared with chloroplast transit <b>peptides</b> from higher plants and mitochondrial targeting <b>peptides</b> from yeast, Neurospora and higher eukaryotes. In terms of length and amino acid composition, chloroplast transit <b>peptides</b> from C. reinhardtii are more similar to mitochondrial targetting <b>peptides</b> than to chloroplast transit <b>peptides</b> from higher plants. They also contain the potential amphiphilic α-helix characteristic of mitochondrial presequences. However, in similarity with chloroplast transit <b>peptides</b> from higher plants, they contain a C-terminal region {{with the potential to}} form an amphiphilic β-strand.

5|$|In chemistry, {{peptides}} are synthesized by {{a variety}} of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase <b>peptide</b> synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing <b>peptide</b> chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made <b>peptide</b> synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.|$|E

5|$|The words protein, polypeptide, and <b>peptide</b> are {{a little}} {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally {{used to refer to}} the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas <b>peptide</b> is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation.|$|E

This review covers the extension of that research from 2004 to 2012, and includes membrane-active <b>peptides</b> (including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal and antiviral <b>peptides)</b> together with the mechanisms by which these <b>peptides</b> interact with model membranes, <b>peptides</b> that may be classified as "neuropeptides" (including smooth muscle active <b>peptides,</b> opioids and immunomodulators) and <b>peptides</b> which inhibit the formation of nitric oxide from neuronal nitric oxide synthase.

50|$|The {{specificity}} of TAP proteins was first investigated by trapping <b>peptides</b> in the ER using glycosylation. TAP binds to 8- to 16-residue <b>peptides</b> with equal affinity, while translocation is most efficient for <b>peptides</b> that are 8 to 12 residues long. Efficiency reduces for <b>peptides</b> longer than 12 residues. However, <b>peptides</b> {{with more than}} 40 residues were translocated, albeit with low efficiency. <b>Peptides</b> with low affinity for the MHC class I molecule are transported out of the ER by an efficient ATP-dependent export protein. These outlined mechanisms may represent a mechanism for ensuring that only high-affinity <b>peptides</b> are bound to MHC class I.|$|R
40|$|<b>Peptides</b> {{from the}} three type I repeats of human endothelial cell thrombospondin, {{containing}} the consensus sequence-Trp-Ser-Xaa-Trp-, bind to sulfated glycoconjugates including heparin and sulfatide. The <b>peptides</b> are potent inhibitors for the binding of thrombospondin, laminin, or apolipoprotein E to these ligands. The thrombospondin <b>peptides</b> that inhibit heparin binding, but not adjacent <b>peptides</b> from the thrombospondin sequence containing the previously identified adhesive motif Val-Thr-Cys-Gly, promote melanoma cell adhesion when immobilized on plastic. Melanoma cell adhesion to the immobilized <b>peptides</b> is inhibited by soluble recombinant heparin-binding fragment of thrombospondin. The <b>peptides</b> also inhibit heparin-dependent binding of thrombospondin or laminin to human melanoma cells. The active <b>peptides</b> lack any previously identified heparin-binding consensus sequences and most do not contain any basic amino acids. Studies with homologous <b>peptides</b> showed that the tryptophan residues are required for binding. Adjacent basic residues in the second type I repeat enhance binding to heparin but not to sulfatide. Thus the type I <b>peptides</b> of thrombospondin define a distinct class of heparin-binding <b>peptides...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractSpecies {{right across}} the {{evolutionary}} scale from insects to mammals use <b>peptides</b> {{as part of their}} host-defense system to counter microbial infection. The primary structures {{of a large number of}} these host-defense <b>peptides</b> have been determined.

The secondary structures of many of the host-defense <b>peptides</b> have been determined by a variety of techniques. The acyclic <b>peptides</b> tend to adopt helical conformation, especially in media of low dielectric constant, whereas <b>peptides</b> with more than one disulfide bridge adopt β-structures.

25|$|When {{methionine}} {{is followed}} by serine or threonine, side reactions can occur that destroy the methionine without <b>peptide</b> bond cleavage. Normally, once the iminolactone is formed (refer to figure), water and acid can react with the imine to cleave the <b>peptide</b> bond, forming a homoserine lactone and new C-terminal <b>peptide.</b> However, if the adjacent amino acid to methionine has a hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group, this group can react with the imine to form a homoserine without <b>peptide</b> bond cleavage.

40|$|Most {{antigenic}} <b>peptides</b> {{presented on}} MHC class I molecules are generated by proteasomes during protein breakdown.

In cytosolic extracts, most antigenic <b>peptides</b> are degraded by the metalloendopeptidase, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP). We therefore examined whether TOP destroys antigenic <b>peptides</b> in vivo. When TOP was overexpressed in cells, class I presentation of antigenic <b>peptides</b> was reduced. In contrast, TOP overexpression didn 2 ̆ 7 t reduce presentation of <b>peptides</b> {{generated in the}} endoplasmic reticulum or endosomes.

25|$|Sulfatide is also {{involved}} in the clearance of amyloid-β <b>peptide.</b> Amyloid-β peptides {{are one of the}} hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. When they are not degraded properly, these peptides accumulate and create plaques, which are clumps of amyloid-β <b>peptide</b> pieces, and they are highly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β <b>peptide</b> clearance is important so that this accumulation does not occur. Sulfatide facilitates amyloid-β <b>peptide</b> removal through an endocytotic pathway, so when there are high levels of sulfatide, there are lower amounts of amyloid-β peptides. Since subjects with Alzheimer's disease have lower sulfatide levels, the clearance of amyloid-β peptides is lower, which allows the peptides to accumulate and create plaques in the brain.|$|E
