5|$|Mark Antony was {{amassing}} <b>political</b> <b>support,</b> but Octavian {{still had}} opportunity to rival {{him as the}} leading member of the faction supporting Caesar.

The Vajpayee administration also offered <b>political</b> <b>support</b> to the US War on Terror, {{in the hope of}} better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir.

The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute.

5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into <b>political</b> <b>support</b> that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} new {{generation}} of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a <b>political</b> <b>support</b> for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the <b>political</b> <b>support</b> that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing. The Attorney General of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny's {{relationship}} with Kwame Nkrumah, {{the leader of}} neighboring Ghana, degraded considerably following Guinea's independence, due to Nkrumah's financial and <b>political</b> <b>support</b> for Sékou Touré. After Sékou Touré convinced Nkrumah to support the secessionist Sanwi in Côte d'Ivoire, Houphouët-Boigny began a campaign to discredit the Ghanaian regime. He accused Nkrumah of trying to destabilise Côte d'Ivoire in 1963, and called for the Francophone states to boycott the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) conference scheduled {{to take place in}} Accra. Nkrumah was ousted from power in 1966 in a military coup; Houphouët-Boigny allowed the conspirators to use Côte d'Ivoire as a base to coordinate the arrival and departure of their missions.|$|E
5|$|Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave Ludlow Castle {{and most}} of the {{surrounding}} estates to Hugh's niece, Sybil, marrying her to Pain fitzJohn, one of his household staff.

Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering a struggle for the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who had been planning to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy's son.
