5000|$|Throughout the centuries, pigmeat {{invariably}} {{featured in}} any {{description of the}} Irish life and the Irish diet, particularly among ordinary people. Town bye-laws frequently regulate the keeping of pigs. In 1382, the citizens of Waterford agreed that any pig found wandering of the streets could be immediately killed by the specially appointed pig wardens. Writing in the 17th century one English observer commented of the [...] "wild…mere Irish" [...] that [...] "they devour great morsels of beef unsalted, and they eat commonly swine’s flesh, seldom mutton."Over the period 1500 to 1800, the Irish landscape gradually underwent a process of deforestation [...] which, among other consequences, eliminated the natural habitat of the wild boar. Although pork remained important to the Irish diet, from the 18th century onwards, a new political climate saw the export of food become a significant economic priority. [...] "Much Irish pork and bacon did not enter the Irish market, but was exported. Shipments of pork and bacon soared after 1760, probably {{at the expense of}} domestic consumption."Evidence of domestic records from households in Ireland in the late 18th century also confirms that pigmeat, previously cheap and plentiful, had become more expensive than other meats at this time, and that meat in general was a considerably more expensive commodity in Ireland than in Britain.In 1841, {{on the eve of the}} famine, the number of pigs in Ireland was put at 1.4m and the link between pigs and the small farmer and the poor was demonstrated by the collapse in <b>pig</b> <b>numbers</b> to just over half a million by 1848.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Samples {{of stomach}} {{contents}} {{were collected from}} 104 feral pigs (Sus scrofa) shot in the Urewera Ranges between December 1982 and June 1985. These were sorted into food items which were dried, weighed, and combined to give estimates of their annual and seasonal diets. Overall 51. 80 / 0 of the pigs ' food was obtained by foraging on the ground, 30. 6 % by rooting, and 17. 6 % by browsing and grazing. Their annual diet comprised 71. 9 % plant material and 28. 1 % animal material, the proportions being similar in all seasons. The fruits of tawa (Beilschmiedia tawa), hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), and supplejack (Ripogonum scandens) together made up one-third of the pigs ' diet. These were taken seasonally, comprising 60 % of their food in autumn, 42 % in winter, and 25 % in summer. The other major plant foods were the roots of supplejack, the fronds and stems of tree ferns (Cyathea spp.), and the rhizomes and roots of bracken (Pteridium esculentum); the first two foods were taken mainly in spring and summer. Earthworms and vertebrate carrion, especially the carcasses of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), were the main animal foods eaten.

40|$|Pigs {{are large}} {{omnivorous}} mammals with powerful bodies and coarse hairy coats.

Ecological characteristics of feral pig activity, group size and home range size {{should be considered in}} any management strategy aimed to control <b>pig</b> <b>numbers</b> or reduce their negative impact. Feral pig activity varies between different habitats and climates. High activity has been reported to occur in early morning and late afternoon in tropical climates (Diong 1982). However, in India pigs have been reported to feed nocturnally to raid croplands (Sekhar 1998, in Wolf and Conover 2003). On Santa Cruz Island (California) the milder weather of fall and late winter causes pigs to be more active in the morning and evening, while the short cool and often rainy days of winter causes midday activity. Pigs on the island were active at night mostly when conditions were warm and dry (Van Vuren 1984, in Wolf and Conover 2003). In terms of group structure, in North-western Australia mob sizes are generally about 12 or less, although occasionally mobs of 30 pigs are seen. Adult boars are mostly solitary. Estimated litter size is 4. 5 viable young per sow (Twigg et al 2005).

Pigs are not a traditional livestock species to Uganda and {{little is known about}} the occurrence of parasitic diseases that reduce growth performance and may have implications for public health. An initial systematic literature review conducted by Ocaido et al. (forthcoming), revealed huge data gaps as most zoonotic pig parasites have never been researched in East Africa. As part of comprehensive smallholder pig value chain assessments carried out by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in three administrative districts of Uganda, the presence and importance of pig parasites along the food chain was investigated. Thirty-five focus group discussions with more than 300 pig farmers showed that parasites are perceived to be a big production constraint with intestinal worms and sarcoptic mange ranking second and third after swine fever (Dione et al., 2014). Knowledge about zoonotic pig parasites is limited and practices such as free-ranging and tethering, erratic treatment and self-medication as well as lack of good hygiene on farm are common.

40|$|This {{abstract}} summarises {{this article}} which relies on available official statistics to outline salient features of Vietnam’s pig industry {{and changes in}} its structure occurring between 1996 and 2006. However, coverage of the latter aspect {{is limited by the}} availability of data. The focus of the article is on primary supplies of the quantity of pork. Between 1996 and 2006, Vietnam’s volume of production of pork more than doubled and its availability of pork per capita (from its own stock) approximately doubled. This was an outstanding achievement. In 2006, however, growth rates in pork supplies and its availability per capita slowed. Both increased <b>pig</b> <b>numbers</b> and rising pork yields contributed to the increased supply of pork in Vietnam between 1996 and 2006. When the whole of the period 1996 - 2006 is considered, increased <b>pig</b> <b>numbers</b> made the major contribution to Vietnam’s increased pork supplies. However, during this period increasing yields rose in relative importance as a contributor to expanding pork supplies and {{towards the end of the}} period, became the major influence on growth of pork supplies. In fact, increased yields were solely responsible for the continuing increase in pork supplies in 2006. This implies that the intensification of Vietnam’s pig sector has accelerated in recent years and that it has become more market dependent. Nevertheless, the latest available statistical evidence indicates that Vietnam’s pork production is still highly dependent on its household sector. In 2001, this sector accounted for over 90 % of Vietnam’s pigs and over 90 % of these were held by households having 10 pigs or fewer. The continuing importance of households as suppliers of pork in Vietnam is underlined further by the fact that there were only 10, 811 registered pig farms in Vietnam in 2006. These specialized farms (which have higher average holdings of pigs than household) are located mainly in three regions (the Red River Delta, the South East and the Mekong River Delta). The Red River Delta accounts for just over half of these farms. Insufficient data were available to me to provide much evidence of changes in the scale of pig production by individual households and farms and to specify the relative growth of the household versus the farm component of pork supplies. However, some evidence emerged of a slight increase in scale. The regions of Vietnam contribute unevenly to the supply of its pork. In 2006, the largest volume of supply was from the Red River Delta (31. 72 %) and the Mekong Delta (19. 57 %) followed by the North East, South East and North Central Coast, each of which supplied about 12 % of Vietnam’s pork. The remaining three regions were relatively minor contributors to Vietnam’s supply of pork. No major changes occurred in the relative suppliers of pork by Vietnam’s regions between 1996 and 2006, and all increased their supplies of pork. Pork yield in relation to pig stocks is found to vary substantially between Vietnam’s regions. For example, in 2006, the lowest yield of pork was in the North West (39. 18 kgs) and the highest was in the Mekong River Delta (123. 11 kgs), a difference of 83. 93 kgs. Average pork yields in all the regions of Vietnam rose between 1996 and 2006 and a large increase was recorded in average pork yields in Vietnam. The absolute disparity in pork yields between Vietnam’s regions magnified. For instance, the difference between yields in the Mekong Delta and the North West (the regions with highest and lowest yields respectively) was 65. 07 kgs in 1996 and rose to 83. 93 kgs in 2006. When all regions are taken into account, the hypothesis is confirmed that absolute differences in yields between Vietnam’s regions have risen although a small decline occurred in relative differences in regional yields. Therefore, the extent of intensification of pork production and market dependence shows considerable regional variation in Vietnam and the variation has probably risen. Those regions surrounding or near Vietnam’s two major cities appear to be engaged in greatest intensification of pork production and have more market dependence than more distant regions. It should not, however, be automatically concluded that the economic efficiency of the pork production is greater in regions that have higher productivity than in those with lower productivity. This is because economic conditions are not the same in all regions, and there are environmental variations that affect productivity. In those regions having high productivity, pork producers seem to face higher economic risks because of their greater exposure to market volatility than in regions with lower productivity. Since 2006 Vietnam has begun to face the challenge of increased pork imports. This is a new source of competition for its pig industry. A few comments are provided on this subject.

40|$|In {{the last}} couple of years Hungarian {{economic}} policy has been concerned with reinforcing the transition to a market economy begun in 1989 as well as dealing with some of the consequences of transition. Despite the fact that Hungary was closer to a market economy than other centrally planned economies it still suffered the pains of transition, including: a sharp fall in output, high inflation and severe financial difficulties. Following a difficult period, macroeconomic indicators in 1993 were beginning to show signs of a turnaround. The negative rate of economic growth of- 12 percent in 1991 fell to - 4. 5 percent in 1992 and a growth rate around zero is expected for 1993. The rate of inflation, which peaked in 1991, declined to 23 percent in 1992 and is expected to remain the same level for 1993. The unemployment rate was around 13 percent in 1993. The agriculture sector and food industry are important for the Hungarian economy. In general, agriculture and food accounts for approximately 20 percent of GDP, 19 percent of total employnment and 25 percent of export. For example, in 1992, the agriculture sector accounted for 17 percent of GDP and employed 13 percent of the active population. The agricultural output increased in nominal terms in 1990 and 1991 but fell in 1992 and 1993 largely due to drought conditions. Input costs have been rising much more sharply that output prices. Because of this fact agriculture and food industries have been making losses in aggregate terms since 1991. This is reflected in the large number of bankruptcies occuring. The loss of the COMECOM markets was a major factor contributing to these difficulties. The financial situation of the agriculture and food industry is a serious constraint on the process of restructuring. The number of bankruptcies has increased sharply as dept has accumulated and a shortage of credit led to cash flow difficulties. The livestock sector also declined in 1992 and 1993. Due to the rise in feed grain prices resulting from the 1992 and 1993 drought along with the continuing decline in both domestic and export market demand for livestock products over recent years, farmers have been decreasing the size of herds. Compared to 1991 <b>pig</b> <b>numbers</b> declined by 10. 5 percent to 5. 4 million head and pigs supplied for slaughter declined by 29 percent.

40|$|Civilizations {{throughout}} the world continue to depend on pig meat as an important food source. Approximately 40 % of the red meat consumed annually worldwide (94 million metric tons) is pig meat. <b>Pig</b> <b>numbers</b> (940 million) and consumption have increased consistent with the increasing world population (FAO 2002). In the past 50 years, research guided genetic selection and nutrition programs have had {{a major impact on}} improving carcass composition and efficiency of production in swine. The use of artificial insemination (AI) in Europe has also had a major impact on pig improvement in the past 35 years and more recently in the USA. Several scientific advances in gamete physiology and/or manipulation have been successfully utilized while others are just beginning to be applied at the production level. Semen extenders that permit the use of fresh semen for more than 5 days post-collection are largely responsible for the success of AI in pigs worldwide. Transfer of the best genetics has been enabled by use of AI with fresh semen, and to some extent, by use of AI with frozen semen over the past 25 years. Sexed semen, now a reality, has the potential for increasing the rate of genetic progress in AI programs when used in conjunction with newly developed low sperm number insemination technology. Embryo cryopreservation provides opportunities for international transport of maternal germplasm worldwide; non-surgical transfer of viable embryos in practice is nearing reality. While production of transgenic animals has been successful, the low level of efficiency in producing these animals and lack of information on multigene interactions limit the use of the technology in applied production systems. Technologies based on research in functional genomics, proteomics and cloning have significant potential, but considerable research effort will be required before they can be utilized for AI in pig production. In the past 15 years, there has been a coordinated worldwide scientific effort to develop the genetic linkage map of the pig with the goal of identifying pigs with genetic alleles that result in improved growth rate, carcass quality, and reproductive performance. Molecular genetic tests have been developed to select pigs with improved traits such as removal of the porcine stress (RYR 1) syndrome, and selection for specific estrogen receptor (ESR) alleles. Less {{progress has been made in}} developing routine tests related to diseases. Major research in genomics is being pursued to improve the efficiency of selection for healthier pigs with disease resistance properties. The sequencing of the genome of the pig to identify new genes and unique regulatory elements holds great promise to provide new information that can be used in pig production.

Control strategies comprise trypanocidal drug use and reduction of vector populations (Glossina spp) by various methods. Vector control methods are successful but unsustainable resulting in rapid reversal of achievements after external support termination. This study evaluates an innovative approach to control Glossina palpalis palpalis using deltamethrin-treated mosquito fences protecting pig pens, finally reducing trypanosome prevalence in Ghana. Two villages comparable in <b>pig</b> <b>numbers,</b> husbandry practices, vegetation, surface water and climate (tropical rain forest zone) were selected. While one village (Zorh) served as unprotected control, the pig pens of the other village (Kwesi Konfo) were protected with 100 cm high insecticide-treated mosquito fences (polyester, 150 denier, 100 - 120 mg/m 2 deltamethrin) which were attached to the timber poles and planks surrounding each pig pen in May 2007. Apparent tsetse densities were monitored for six months by using geo-referenced biconical traps. The reduction of fly numbers in Kwesi Konfo (netted pig pens) exceeded 90 % within two months. A further decline of the population during the following months led to reductions of more than 95 % until termination. This contrasted clearly with the tsetse numbers in the control village, which remained stable apart from their usual seasonal variations. Captured tsetse flies were identified and separated according to sex and age. Non teneral and parous female flies were dissected for ovarian age grading. Net samples were taken at monthly intervals and stored for further evaluation of their bio-cidal activity through bioassays. To monitor {{the persistence of the}} insecticide treated netting material it was tested in the laboratory before and throughout the installation using house flies (Musca domestica). The rates of paralysis five, ten and fifteen minutes after exposure decreased markedly in the six months trial corresponding with the time passing. The rates of paralysis 30 minutes, six hours and 24 hours after exposure remained at comparable levels until termination of the project. Blood samples were collected three times from about 50 % of the respective pig populations during the trial: at the onset, after three months, {{and at the end of}} experiment (six month after intervention). After the first sampling all pigs were treated with a trypanocidal drug (diminazene aceturate, Berenil®, Intervet) at a dose of 3. 5 mg/kg. Initially, thin blood smears revealed a trypanosome (Nannomonas) prevalence of 76 % and 72 %, respectively, in pigs from Kwesi Konfo and Zorh. The examination of the second blood samples showed a prevalence reduction to 16 % in Kwesi Konfo whereas the infection rate in pigs of the control village had increased to 84 %; this effect was well confirmed by the results of the third examination with 8 % trypanosome prevalence in protected pigs as opposed to 60 % in the control pigs. The study confirmed that insecticide treated netting material leads into a significant reduction of tsetse flies even in dense vegetation of tropical rain forest zone and therefore considerably improves livestock industries in sub-Saharan Africa. A successful local vector control method has proven its feasibility. High practicability, easy handling and low cost of material as well as a confirmed persistence of more than six months allows independent and individual use of insecticide treated nets by farmers themselves. Future improvement of quality characteristics, concerning persistence, heat and UV-resistance of the net material is recommended...|$|E
40|$|This thesis, {{entitled}} “Modelling {{the distribution}} of pig production and diseases in Thailand”, presents many aspects of pig production in Thailand including the characteristics of pig farming system, distribution of pig population and pig farms, spatio-temporal distribution and risk of most important diseases in pig at present, and the suitability area for pig farming. Spatial distribution and characteristics of pig farming in Thailand were studied using time-series pig population data to describe the trend of pig productions in relation to <b>pig</b> <b>numbers,</b> holder numbers, and number of pigs per holder. In more detailed analyses, pig census data in 2010 were used to describe farming systems including type of pig (native, breeding, and fattening pigs), farm scales (extensive and intensive farming systems), type of farming systems (farrow-to-finish, nursery, and finishing systems) and to quantify the association between the geographical distribution of those and several predictor variables by using Random Forest models. The results show {{that over the last}} decades, the pig population has gradually increased over time, with a marked cyclical pattern corresponding to what has been termed the “pork cycle”. The spatial distribution of large-scale pig farms corresponds with that of commercial pig breeds, which are concentrated in lowland urban or peri-urban areas, and are close to means of transportation, facilitating supply to major markets such as provincial capitals and the Bangkok Metropolitan region. Conversely the smallholders are distributed throughout the country, with higher densities located in highland, remote, and rural areas, whence they supply local, rural markets. It is proposed that intensive pig production should be integrated with crop farming within a specific “pig zone”, designated for establishment of intensive farming, which includes the necessary input and output facilities and enhanced bio-security. For smallholder pig farmers, integration of pig-farming with crop production should be promoted and combined with capacity development for farm management, including enhancing the bio-security. Spatial epidemiology of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in Thailand was studied by providing a first description of the spatio-temporal pattern of PRRS in Thailand and to quantify the statistical relationship between the presence of PRRS at the sub-district level and a set of risk factors using two modelling approaches: autologistic multiple regression and boosted regression trees. An atypical and more virulent PRRS (HP-PRRS) emerged in China and spread to many countries, including Thailand, causing a lot of damage to pig production. The results indicated that farms with breeding sows may be an important group for targeted surveillance and control. However, these findings obtained at the sub-district level should be complemented by farm-level epidemiological investigations in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the factors affecting PRRS presence. In this study, the outbreaks of PRRS could not be differentiated from the potential novel HP-PPRS form, which was recently discovered in the country. Spatial characterization of colonies of the flying fox bat, a carrier of Nipah Virus in Thailand was studied. We conducted field observation, remote sensing, and ecological niche modelling to characterize flying fox colonies and their ecological neighbourhoods. A Potential Surface Analysis was applied to map contact zones among local epizootic actors. Results showed that flying fox colonies were found mainly on Thailand’s Central Plain, particularly in locations surrounded by bodies of water, vegetation, and safe havens such as Buddhist temples. High-risk areas for Nipah zoonosis in pigs include the agricultural ring around the Bangkok metropolitan region where the density of pig farms is high. It is suggested that passive and active surveillance programs should be prioritized around Bangkok, particularly on farms with low biosecurity, close to water, and/or on which orchards are concomitantly grown. Integration of human and animal health surveillance should be pursued in these same areas. Such proactive planning would help conserve flying fox colonies and should help prevent zoonotic transmission of Nipah and other pathogens. Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to identify suitability of pig farming in Thailand was studied. The suitability maps were generated according to the three objectives obtained from decision making process including; i) pig producers’ profit is maximized, ii) public and environmental health are protected, and iii) pig health is protected and rural areas are developed. The maps showed that the areas surrounding the major consuming centres (Bangkok) were highly suitable for objective 1, the large areas in the Northeast were highly suitable for objective 2, and the areas with rather isolation including in the East and the South were highly suitable for objective 3. The final suitability maps were presented in 6 scenarios based on the level of trade-off and risk, which these can be applied for the appropriate situations. It is suggested that establishment of pig zoning, policy makers should take all aspects into consideration in order for sustainable development in all farm levels. The cost effectiveness should be further analyzed to evaluate the zoning plan before they are developed. Additionally, the plans to scale-up support to sustainable smallholder farmers and environmental management such as manure action plan should be developed. Bringing all these results together, this thesis are discussed into three parts, namely, 1) situation and distribution of pig farming, 2) epidemiology of major pig diseases, and 3) sustainable development of pig farming.

However, winter temperatures in some areas are too low to enable enough biogas production in small unheated digesters to meet the energy requirements of households. Low-cost, high yield reactors adapted to the local climate are needed in those situations. A decision-support model was developed {{to assist in the}} design of biogas reactors capable of meeting households’ year-round energy needs. Monthly biogas production relative to household energy needs was calculated for the scenario of suburban Hanoi, Vietnam. Calculations included <b>pig</b> <b>number,</b> slurry (manure water mixture) dilution, retention time and biogas/solar heating. Although using biogas to heat the digester increased biogas production, it did not lead to an energy surplus, particularly with the 1 : 9 slurry dilution rate commonly used on pig farms. However, at a 1 : 3 slurry dilution, the use of solar heating to provide 90 % and biogas 10 % of the heat required to heat the digester to 35 °C improved the biogas production by 50 % compared to psychrophilic production. The energy needs of an average five-person family throughout the year required 17 fattening pigs. This model can establish the best solution for producing sufficient energy throughout the year...|$|R
