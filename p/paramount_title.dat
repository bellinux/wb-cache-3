50|$|Tui Manu’a Elisara Alalamua {{attended}} the London Missionary Society seminary in Malua on 'Upolu island {{and returned to}} his native village where he served as the Congregationalist minister of Fitiuta. When the Faletolu (chiefly assembly) of Ta'u approached Elisara about taking the Tui Manu'a throne the request was initially denied on the grounds of his ministry. However, when the Berlin Act placed the Manu'a islands under the protection of the United States, he was petitioned zealously by the people of Manu'a. He accepted the leadership role and was bestowed the <b>paramount</b> <b>title</b> of Tui Manu'a on the island of Ta'u on 25 October 1899.|$|E
50|$|After {{the death}} of Tui Manu'a Alalamua, the <b>paramount</b> <b>title</b> was left vacant and disputed.

The anoalo led by Arthur Paʻu Young weighed in in favor of Matelita.

She was crowned in a traditional ceremony consisting of feasting, offering of food, kava drinking in the days before and after July 13, 1891.|$|E

50|$|The {{state funeral}} {{was a rare}} {{occasion}} when ancient rituals and exchanges {{were made to the}} Sa Malietoa (the national political 'family' or clan from which the Malietoa title belongs). Traditional cultural presentations (or Si'i Fa'atupu) from other districts and clans from within Samoa were made and ancient funeral rites were performed. The delegation (or auala) from Lufilufi, representing the TuiAtua, circled the Maota of Malietoa at Faatoialemanu where the late Malietoa lay in state, chanting the ancient funeral chants associated with the district of Atua and its relationship with the district of Tuamasaga (where the Malietoa is the <b>paramount</b> <b>title).</b> Traditional delegations representing the Tongan Royal Family and the Fijian Great Council of Chiefs also made cultural presentations to reflect the ancient genealogical ties between Samoa and her southern neighbours Tonga and Fiji.|$|E

40|$|Kurier Łódzki”, boasting a rich {{publishing}} tradition, {{was one of}} {{the most}} important daily newspapers in the Interwar period. Thanks to, among others, “Kurier’s” owner, Jan Stypułkowski and his activities, Łódź soon stopped being regarded as a mere provincial publishing centre. Spreading over the country, Łódź's daily papers won a readership in many regions of Poland. Stypułkowski's publications, including “Kurier Łódzki”, the <b>paramount</b> <b>title,</b> exerted a significant influence on the development of press in Łódź. Stypułkowski's daily newspaper consistently followed its editorial policy, as the newspaper evolved. Nonetheless, “Kurier” continued to present the national and Catholic values. Its attitude towards national minorities, especially to the Jewish one, was unequivocal. The anti-Semitic rhetoric was the most pronounced in the first years of the Second Polish Republic. Although it was gradually becoming more substantive and factual, it could hardly be defined as objective. Publikacja dofinansowana przez Wydział Filologiczny U...|$|E
