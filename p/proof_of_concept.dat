5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and {{had been thinking about}} adapting it long before he met the creators. A two-minute <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E
5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept.</b> In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E

5|$|The Itanium {{processors}} show {{a progression}} in capability. Merced was a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept.</b> McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with {{the shift to}} a 130nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667MHz.|$|E
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature. This was inspired {{in part by the}} retraction of a high-profile paper from 2004 which originally described the computational design of a protein with improved enzymatic activity relative to its natural form. The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> for this protein design method. This type of protein design could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} {{to enable the}} verification of the technical feasibility of the proposal and give the first results about its acceptance, the three <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> helped the formulation of the questionnaire used as an evaluation tool in the case study. From the prototype used for the <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept,</b> {{it was possible to}} set some parameters for the evaluation step, solve technical problems and define some issues that could take part in a case study.|$|R
40|$|Language-based {{modelling}} {{of biological}} systems {{is a growing}} field <b>of</b> research. Many <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> {{have been published in}} the last decade.

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept,</b> BackupHDDVD is severely limited in its ability to produce fully functional copies of commercial discs. Early versions were unable to properly decrypt discs which used the in-movie experience technology. New versions work around this limitation by excluding interactive content from decrypted copies. The utility cannot process HD DVD navigation functionality which enables menus, chapters, secondary audio tracks and subtitles, so these features are inaccessible in copies created by BackupHDDVD. Most versions provide no validation for keys and will still attempt to decrypt a disc's contents with an incorrect key, resulting in corrupt files.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dave Raggett, then at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Bristol, England {{devoted his}} spare time to {{developing}} Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications. Development of the browser was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP, which like many other computer corporations at the time, was unconvinced that the Internet would succeed and thus did not consider investing in web browser development. Raggett demonstrated the browser at the first World Wide Web Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 ISOC conference in Prague to show text flow around images, forms, {{and other aspects of}} HTML later termed as the HTML+ specification. Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN, to develop Arena further as a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> browser for this work. Using the Arena browser, Dave Raggett, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions, resizable tables, image backgrounds, HTML math, and other features. At the Web World conference in Orlando, in early 1995, Raggett demonstrated the different new features of Arena.|$|E
5|$|These {{simulations}} {{showed the}} basic idea of how a single large planet can shepherd the smaller extreme trans-Neptunian objects into similar types of orbits. It was a basic <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> simulation that did not obtain a unique orbit for the planet as they state there are many possible orbital configurations the planet could have. Thus they did not fully formulate a model that successfully incorporated all the clustering of the extreme objects with an orbit for the planet. But {{they were the first}} to notice there was a clustering in the orbits of extremely distant objects and that the most likely reason was from an unknown massive distant planet. Their work is very similar to how Alexis Bouvard noticed Uranus' motion was peculiar and suggested that it was likely gravitational forces from an unknown 8th planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by Bushnell and Dabney during 1970–71 to be a coin-operated version of Spacewar. After the pair were {{unable to find a}} way to economically run the game on a minicomputer such as the Data General Nova, they hit upon the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom-designed hardware created just to run that game. After they built an early <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> and founded Syzygy Engineering, Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. Working in partnership with Nutting, the pair ran their first location test in August 1971, a few months prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game, also based on Spacewar. After encouraging initial results, though mixed responses from distributors, Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units with the anticipation of a hit game. While the game was successful and validated Syzygy's belief in the future of arcade video games, selling over 1,000 cabinets by mid-1972 and ultimately 1,300–1,500 units, it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for. The game spawned one clone game, Star Trek (1972), and Nutting produced a two-player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from Syzygy before closing in 1976. Syzygy went on to be incorporated as Atari, with their next arcade game the successful Pong (1972). Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release marked the initial start of the commercial video game industry.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNanosciences have {{recently}} proposed a lot <b>of</b> <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> innovative nanocomponents and especially nanosensors. Going {{from the current}} <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> on this scale to reliable industrial systems requires {{the emergence of a}} new generation of manufacturing methods able to move, position and sort micro-nano-components. We propose to develop 'No Weight Robots-NWR' that use non-contact transmission of movement (e. g. dielectrophoresis, magnetophoresis) to manipulate micro-nano-objects which could enable simultaneous high throughput and high precision. This paper focuses on developing a 2 D robotic control of the trajectory of a microobject manipulated by a dielectrophoresis system. A 2 D dynamic model is used to establish an open loop control law by a numerical inversion. Exploiting this control law, a high speed trajectory tracking (10 Hz) and high precision positioning can be achieved. Several simulated and experimental results are shown to evaluate this control strategy and discuss its performance...|$|R
