2500|$|Within {{days of the}} Nano's release, some users {{reported}} {{damage to}} the Nano, suggesting that the LCD screen had become so scratched that it was unreadable, even when the backlight was on. Many reported fine scratches on Nanos, caused by microfiber cloths. Other owners reported that their Nano's screen cracked without use of excessive force. On September 27, 2005, Apple confirmed that a small percentage ("less than 1/10 of 1 percent") of iPod Nanos shipped with a faulty screen and agreed to replace any that had cracked screens, but denied the iPod Nano was more susceptible to scratching than prior iPods. Apple started shipping iPod Nanos with a <b>protective</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{to protect them from}} scratches. In October 2005 a class action lawsuit was filed against Apple, with the plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for the device, legal fees, and [...] "unlawful or illegal profits" [...] from sales of the iPod Nano. Lawyers for the plaintiffs claimed that the devices [...] "scratch excessively during normal usage, rendering the screen on the Nanos unreadable, and violating state consumer protection statutes". Similar lawsuits were later filed in Mexico and the United Kingdom. In early 2009, Apple {{was in the process of}} settling a court case over the scratched iPod Nano screens. It was suggested that Apple should set aside $22million to refund users. At the time, it required a Judge's sign-off on the terms by April 28, 2009. Some commentators such as BusinessWeek's Arik Hesseldahl have criticized the lawsuits. Hesseldahl dismissed them as [...] "stupid" [...] and suggested that they benefitted [...] "no one but the trial lawyers," [...] but also suggested that Apple could have avoided litigation by offering [...] "full refunds on unwanted Nanos" [...] instead of charging a re-stocking fee and lengthening the return period from 14 days (when purchased through Apple retail or online) to 30 or 60 days.|$|E

2500|$|... iPods {{have been}} criticized for alleged short {{lifespan}} and fragile hard drives. A 2005 survey conducted on the MacInTouch website found that the iPod line had an average failure rate of 13.7% (although they note that comments from respondents indicate that [...] "the true iPod failure rate may be lower than it appears"). It concluded that some models were more durable than others. In particular, failure rates for iPods employing hard drives was usually above 20% while those with flash memory had a failure rate below 10%. In late 2005, many users complained that the surface of the first generation iPod Nano can become scratched easily, rendering the screen unusable. A class-action lawsuit was also filed. Apple initially considered the issue a minor defect, but later began shipping these iPods with <b>protective</b> <b>sleeves.</b>|$|R
40|$|Comparisons {{of traits}} of outbreaking and nonoutbreaking leaf-eating Lepidoptera and Symphyta {{have shown that}} spring-feeding species {{are more likely to}} have {{outbreaks}} than are summer-feeding species. It has been suggested that variable synchrony with host budburst causes the population sizes of spring-feeding species to be more variable primarily because of the negative effects of older leaves on insects. While much evidence exists that leaf age can directly affect survival and reproduction of insects, few studies have looked at the population-level effects of variable phenology, and especially the potential for complex direct and indirect interactions with natural-enemy effects. To examine the consequences of variable phenology for population growth of an outbreaking insect, we manipulated the timing of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) egg hatch in the field. We released large numbers of gypsy moth larvae into replicate plots in the field at three times relative to budburst. Survival of larvae in <b>protective</b> <b>sleeves</b> was high unless they were released very long before host budburst, and leaf age had a direct negative effect on fecundity: the later the release, the lower was the fecundity of insects reared on white oak and black oak. The later the release, however, the greater was the dispersal by ballooning, which had the effect of reducing local densities. Because the most important natural enemies impose density-dependent mortality, dispersal had the effect of raising survival rate for later release dates. The direct host-plant effect and natural-enemy effects exhibited opposing influences on population processes, because fecundity decreased with release date but survival increased. The survival advantage of the late release outweighed the loss in fecundity, so that the expected population growth rate was highest for the latest release. The net effects of phenology on insect population growth thus depend largely on natural-enemy effects. Very different conclusions would have been drawn had we measured mortality only in <b>protective</b> <b>sleeves</b> and not in the presence of natural enemies. The strong natural-enemy effects may explain the large variability in outcome of plant–herbivore interactions and contribute to the high variability in population size of spring-feeding species...|$|R
40|$|This report covers an {{investigation}} of the nature and cause of failure in Nitinol brachytherapy sourcewires. The investigation was initiated after two clinical incidents in which sourcewires failed during or immediately after a treatment. The investigation determined that the two clinical Nitinol sourcewires failed in a brittle manner, which is atypical for Nitinol. There were no material anomalies or subcritical flaws to explain the brittle failures. The bend tests also demonstrated that neither moist environment, radiation, nor low-temperature structural transformation was a likely root cause of the failures. However, degradation of the PTFE was consistently evident, and those sourcewires shipped or stored with PTFE sleeves consistently failed in laboratory bend tests. On the basis of the results of this study, it was concluded that the root cause of the in-service failures of the sourcewires was environmentally induced embrittlement due to the breakdown of the PTFE <b>protective</b> <b>sleeves</b> {{in the presence of the}} high-radiation field and subsequent reaction or interaction of the breakdown products with the Nitinol alloy...|$|R

The foil also serves as a decorative element of the bottle's label. Foils were historically made of lead; however, because of research showing that trace amounts of toxic lead could remain on the lip of the bottle and mix with the poured wine, lead foil bottleneck wrapping was slowly phased out, and by the 1990s, most foils were made of tin, heat-shrink plastic (polyethylene or PVC), or aluminium or polylaminate aluminium.|$|E

Following baseline, treatment was implemented in a multiple baseline across subjects design, and the effects of NCR and EXT were compared in a multielement format. During NCR sessions, participants had continuous access to a highly preferred item. During EXT sessions, participants wore equipment (gloves or <b>protective</b> <b>sleeves)</b> that seemed to attenuate stimulation directly produced by their SIB, while still allowing the behavior to occur. Results indicated that both procedures were effective in reducing SIB, although NCR was associated with either more rapid or greater overall response suppression...|$|R

40|$|Smart geogrids {{embedded}} with fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for reinforcement {{as well as}} measurement of geotechnical structures have been developed. After the fabricating process of the geogrids is detailed, finite element (FE) simulations are conducted to analyze the strain distribution of geogrids and the strain transfer characteristics from geogrids to fiber optic. Results indicate that FBG should be deployed {{in the middle of}} the geogrids rib to make sure that uniform strain distribution along the FBG. Also, PVC <b>protective</b> <b>sleeves,</b> which are used to protect fiber optic when integrated with geogrids, have smaller strain transfer loss than nylon sleeves. Tensile experiments are conducted to test strain measurement performance of proposed geogrids, and the results demonstrate that proposed smart geogrids have good linearity and consistency. Temperature experiments show that FBG embedded in geogrids has higher temperature sensitivity, and the temperature induced error can be compensated by an extra FBG strain-independent sensor. Furthermore, designed smart geogrids are used in a geotechnical model test to monitor strain during tunnel excavation. The strain tendency measured by smart geogrids and traditional strain sensor agree very well.
