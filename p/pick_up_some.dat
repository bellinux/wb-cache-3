Collier took notes and hoped to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> football knowledge he could use when he returned to Paris. Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E

25|$|Leslie Wright (20 January 1903 – 6 January 1956) was an English cricketer {{who played}} 193 {{first-class}} matches between 1925 and 1933, {{every one of}} them for Worcestershire. He was primarily an opening batsman, although he did <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> useful (if expensive) wickets with his medium-pacers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{adventure}} games {{make use}} of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode. Players are only able to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> objects in the game, so the player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important. Because {{it can be difficult}} for a player to know if they missed an important item, they will often scour every scene for items. For games that utilize a point and click device, players will sometimes engage in a systematic search known as a pixel hunt. Games try to avoid this by highlighting the item, or by snapping the player's cursor to the item.|$|E

25|$|The 1981 festival {{village was}} {{designed}} around a central rotunda with a maypole, where spontaneously, poets, buskers and ravers alike featured. Nambassa vigorously promoted handcrafts, {{not only because}} of their therapeutic qualities, but because they had {{the potential to be a}} source of revenue to lifestyle proponents looking towards self-sufficiency and economic independence. From the festival village one could attend any number of craft workshops, pick up a copy of the daily Nambassa Waves newspaper, go buy fresh bread cooked in the wood-fired oven bakery constructed in a converted hay shed, go do some shopping, check out Radio Nambassaland, <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> information from the mother centre, or just simply chill out and absorb the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|John Connolly gave Shapiro {{from his}} most recent output, and Patrick Connolly {{said they had been}} able to make three pounds of meth since May of that year. Shapiro also {{observed}} an empty P2P bottle at the house. Two days later, he returned with 100 g of P2P. While he mostly watched as the trio made their meth, at one point, according to later court testimony, he and Russell helped <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> pieces of dropped aluminum foil and put it into a flask. Patrick Connolly finished the rest of the process, and Shapiro stopped by the next morning to pick up his half of the meth. He also bought a portion of the remainder for $60.|$|E
25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house {{the next day to}} <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and waited for him to surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E

25|$|As T-Bird and Skank {{stop at a}} {{convenience}} store to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> supplies, Eric arrives and kidnaps T-Bird. Skank follows the pair to the docks and witnesses Eric kill T-Bird by tying him to the driver's seat {{of his car and}} forcing him to drive it {{off the edge of the}} pier where it explodes and sinks into the harbour. Skank escapes and goes to Top Dollar, a top-level criminal who controls all the street gangs in the city. Top Dollar and his lover/half-sister Myca have become aware of Eric's actions through various reports from witnesses (including Gideon, whom Top Dollar killed afterward). Top Dollar holds a meeting with his associates where they discuss new plans for their Devil's Night criminal activities. Eric arrives looking for Skank. A gun fight ensures the deaths of nearly all present, and Eric kills Skank by throwing him out of a window. Top Dollar, Myca, and Grange (Top Dollar's right-hand man) escape.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E

500|$|Ken Watanabe as Mr. Saito, a Japanese {{businessman}} who employs Cobb for the team's mission. Nolan wrote the role with Watanabe in mind, {{as he wanted}} to work with him again after Batman Begins. Inception is Watanabe's first work in a contemporary setting where his primary language is English. Watanabe tried to emphasize a different characteristic of Saito in every dream level: [...] "First chapter in my castle, I <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> hidden feelings of the cycle. It's magical, powerful and then the first dream. And back to the second chapter, in the old hotel, I pick up [...] sharp and more calm and smart and it's a little bit [...] different process to make up the character of any movie".|$|E
500|$|Since late 2008, MOBA {{has been}} experimenting with {{allowing}} the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be [...] "interpreted". The [...] "Guest Interpretator's Collection" [...] is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and one is added every two months. A professor at Boston University offered his thoughts: [...] "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests {{a commitment to the}} abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!" ...|$|E
500|$|Coming at {{the tail}} end of the giallo cycle, Tenebrae does not appear to have been as {{influential}} as Argento's earlier films. Douglas E. Winter, however, has commented that Tenebraes Louma crane sequence has been stylistically influential, pointing to its use in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables (1987). In addition, towards the end of the film, with Neal supposedly dead, the camera faces Detective Giermani directly. When he stoops to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> evidence from the floor, Neal is revealed to be stood behind him, their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot. Alan Jones cited Tenebrae as the first film to use this specific type of camera blocking, and believes it to have been copied and referenced deliberately by later filmmakers. One such example, discussed as an unacknowledged [...] "steal" [...] from Tenebrae, is De Palma's [...] "surprise reveal" [...] of John Lithgow standing behind a victim in Raising Cain (1992). Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath (2000) also contains a similar moment, although Zemeckis has denied a familiarity with Italian movies.|$|E

500|$|Davil Balls of Digital Spy {{described}} the music video as being [...] "cheeky, seductive {{and more than}} a little bit ridiculous" [...] and said that Spears [...] "delivers some killer dance routines". Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly compared the dance in the chair with the music video of [...] "Stronger" [...] and added that [...] "best of all, she actually looks animated in this video and appears to be having fun". James Montgomery of MTV said that after watching the video [...] "you are overcome with the sudden urge to go to the Big Apple Circus. Or <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> Curious perfume. Or you know, possibly both". The music video won the category of Best Moves at the MTV Australia Awards 2009. It was also nominated for four VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Art Direction, Best Choreography, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, but lost of all them. It was also nominated for Best Video in the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009, but lost to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies". The video won Best Video of 2009 in Fuse TV, making Spears the only artist to win two years in a row.|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Richard Dyer {{highlights}} several intelligent devices used by Argento in {{the editing}} of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by [...] "shots of pills {{and the sound}} of running water." [...] Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts {{in the latter part of}} the film are among cinema's [...] "most brutal and stylized", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism. Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of Tenebrae make it as much an example of art cinema as anything else. The initial murders are shot in a [...] "clipped montage style", which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene. Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.|$|E
500|$|Without the {{education}} or connections that a university education {{would have provided}} he was almost entirely unemployed for several years. Kenyon instead lived off an £80 allowance from his father, and money from his richer relatives, spending the time watching Lord Mansfield conduct cases at the Court of King's Bench. His early business was almost entirely conveyancing, and to make extra money he began to attend the Welsh Circuit, where Tomlinson's contacts allowed him to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> small cases. After several years of this he also began attending quarter sessions at Oxford, Stafford and Shrewsbury, [...] "where he was more successful". While his work slowly began to increase, his main rise was due to his friendship with John Dunning, {{at the time a}} similarly near-unemployed barrister. In 1762 {{one of the leaders of}} the Northern Circuit died, and his work was given to Dunning; as he found himself with too many cases, he gave many to Kenyon. In 1767, for example, Kenyon dealt with 20 of Dunning's cases. As a result of his speedy and efficient work attorneys began to employ him directly, and within 10 years he was making £3,000 a year just from opinions.|$|E
