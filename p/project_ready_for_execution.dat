50|$|This {{is known}} as {{activating}} or firing the instruction. Once an instruction is completed by an execution unit, its output data is sent (with its tag) to the CAM. Any instructions that are dependent upon this particular datum (identified by its tag value) are then marked as <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>execution.</b> In this way, subsequent instructions are executed in proper order, avoiding race conditions. This order may differ from the sequential order envisioned by the human programmer, the programmed order.|$|R

50|$|The {{programming}} language used in LabVIEW, named G, is a dataflow {{programming language}}. Execution {{is determined by}} the structure of a graphical block diagram (the LabVIEW-source code) on which the programmer connects different function-nodes by drawing wires. These wires propagate variables and any node can execute as soon as all its input data become available. Since this might be the case for multiple nodes simultaneously, G can execute inherently in parallel. Multi-processing and multi-threading hardware is exploited automatically by the built-in scheduler, which multiplexes multiple OS threads over the nodes <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>execution.</b>|$|R

5000|$|To make {{concurrent}} programs repeatable, {{an external}} scheduler is used. The program under test is instrumented to add calls to this scheduler.

This scheduler selectively blocks threads of execution by maintaining a semaphore associated with each thread, such that only one thread is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>execution</b> at any given time. Thus, it converts parallel non-deterministic application into a serial execution sequence in order to achieve repeatability. The number of scheduling decisions made by the serializing scheduler is given by - ...|$|R

30|$|IDLE IDLE {{represents}} a state when a vCPU is not executing any code, and thus voluntarily yields the physical CPU. This state is reached when the QEMU thread emulating a vCPU is scheduled {{out of a}} pCPU, and if no thread other than the idle idle task is scheduled to run on this vCPU in the guest OS (transition 4). On Linux, the purpose of swapper swapper (the idle idle task) is to invoke the scheduler to choose potential threads <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>execution,</b> or to halt the CPU in case no thread is ready to run.
