5|$|When established, {{the company}} was based at Tananger in Sola outside Stavanger and had its main {{operative}} base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. The head office was later moved to Fornebu in Bærum outside Oslo, and the main base moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. At its peak the company had 196 employees, of which 144 were based in Norway. At the time of bankruptcy, the company had 120 employees, of which 78 were flight staff. Air Europe's CEO Rod Lynch stated that Air Europe, and in extension Norway Airlines, had forty <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> operating costs than Lufthansa and twenty <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> than British Airways. Lynch emphasized the lack of trade unions {{as a key to}} holding costs down. Air Europe claimed a thirty-four percent market share on passengers between Oslo and London.|$|E

Starting 1August, Teddy Air started serving Fagernes Airport, Leirin, with routes to Oslo and Bergen. The contract gave a subsidy of NOK23.7 million for three years, and was 15 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> than what Coast Air had been receiving. On 20May 1997, Teddy Air started its first international route, from Stavanger to Gothenburg in Sweden.|$|E

FIS President Gian Franco Kasper commented at the closing ceremonies of the 15 nations earning medals at these championships, along with the successes of the television coverage by Czech TV {{and the success of}} the women's ski jumping at these championships would pave the way for inclusion into the 2014 Winter Olympics.

5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E
5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} {{to address the}} problem of waste PVC is also through the process called Vinyloop. It is a mechanical recycling process using a solvent to separate PVC from other materials. This solvent turns in a closed loop process in which the solvent is recycled. Recycled PVC is used in place of virgin PVC in various applications: coatings for swimming pools, shoe soles, hoses, diaphragms tunnel, coated fabrics, PVC sheets. This recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> than conventional produced PVC. So the use of recycled material leads to a significant better ecological footprint. The global warming potential is 39 <b>percent</b> <b>lower.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{early success}} in the {{recycling}} of plastics is Vinyloop, an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This {{makes it possible to}} recycle composite PVC waste, which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> than conventionally produced PVC. The global warming potential is 39 <b>percent</b> <b>lower.</b> This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome. This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled. In this way, the PVC Policy could be fulfilled, which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane bagasse {{is used to}} produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO2 emissions can be 90 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> than conventional gasoline.|$|E

25|$|The NP's {{desire to}} burn low grade {{semi-bituminous}} coal from company-owned mines at Rosebud, Montana, {{played a part}} {{in the development of the}} 4-8-4 wheel arrangement for steam locomotives. With a BTU fifty <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> than anthracite coal, the NP's locomotive design called for a much larger firebox, and thus an additional axle on the trailing truck. This led locomotive designers from the 4-8-2 Mountain to the 4-8-4 Northern, first produced by Alco for the NP in 1926 and designated the Class A by the railway.|$|E

40|$|The {{employment}} rate {{of black men}}, and particularly of low-skill black men, fell precipitously from 1960 to 2000. At the same time, the incarceration rate of black men rose markedly. This paper examines the relation between immigration and these trends in black employment and incarceration. Using data drawn from the 1960 - 2000 U. S. Censuses, we find {{a strong correlation between}} immigration, black wages, black {{employment rate}}s, and black incarceration rates. As immigrants disproportionately increased the supply of workers in a particular skill group, the wage of black workers in that group fell, the employment rate declined, and the incarceration rate rose. Our analysis suggests that a 10 -percent immigrant-induced increase in the supply of a particular skill group reduced the black wage by 2. 5 <b>percent,</b> <b>lowered</b> the employment rate of black men by 5. 9 percentage points, and increased the incarceration rate of blacks by 1. 3 percentage points. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{countries}} where the black market premium on foreign exchange is exceptionally high, often more than 100 <b>percent,</b> <b>lowering</b> the black market rate to a level close to the market determined official rate will improve the balance of payments and increase exports. Floating the currency to depreciate the real exchange rate and make exports more competitive can raise inflation substantially, however, as governments replace the lost revenue from exports. Inflation will occur even if real government spending remains constant unless there are new taxes or spending cuts {{to compensate for the}} loss of implicit tax revenues. To avoid costly surges in inflation, exchange rate reform may have to proceed slowly, otherwise the depreciation is likely to meet with considerable political and social opposition as inflation rises. Once the government closes the spread between the official and black market rates, it faces a decision on whether to continue with a float permanently. Evidence from developing countries {{over the next few years}} should give some insights into this issue.
