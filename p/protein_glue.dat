40|$|Hagfish produce {{vast amounts}} of slime when under attack. The slime is the most dilute {{hydrogel}} known to date, and is a highly interesting material for biomaterial research. It forms from a glandular secrete, called exudate, which deploys upon contact with seawater. To study slime formation ex vivo and to characterize its material properties, stabilization of the sensitive slime exudate is crucial. In this study, we compared the two main stabilization methods, dispersion in high osmolarity citrate/PIPES (CP) buffer and immersion in oil, and tested the influence of time, temperature and pH on {{the stability of the}} exudate and functionality of the slime. Using water retention measurements to assess slime functionality, we found that CP buffer and oil preserved the exudate within the first 5  hours without loss of functionality. For longer storage times, slime functionality decreased for both stabilization methods, for which the breakdown mechanisms differed. Stabilization in oil likely favored temperature-sensitive osmotic-driven swelling and rupture of the mucin vesicles, causing the exudate to gel and clump. Extended storage in CP buffer resulted in an inhibited unraveling of skeins. We suggest that a water soluble <b>protein</b> <b>glue,</b> which mediates skein unraveling in functional skeins, denatures and gradually becomes insoluble during storage in CP buffer. The breakdown was accentuated when the pH of the CP buffer was raised from pH 6. 7 to pH 8. 5, probably caused by increased denaturation of the <b>protein</b> <b>glue</b> or by inferior vesicle stabilization. However, when fresh exudate was mixed into seawater or phosphate buffer at pH 6 - 9, slime functionality was not affected, showing pH insensitivity of the slime formation around a neutral pH. These insights on hagfish exudate stabilization mechanisms will support hagfish slime research at a fundamental level, and contribute to resolve the complex mechanisms of skein unraveling and slime formation...|$|E

Of particular note, the <b>protein</b> <b>glue</b> secreted by marine mussels delivers high adhesion in wet and dynamic environments owing to existence of catechol moieties.

In vitro studies, in a lap-shear configuration, revealed that the catechol-modified components were able to enhance adhesion to both the denture base and hydrated, functional oral tissue mimic, with the resulting mode of failure prominently being adhesive rather than cohesive. These characteristics are desirable in prosthodontic fixative applications, for which temporary adhesion must be maintained, with ultimately an adhesive failure from the mucosal tissue surface preferred. These insights provide an experimental platform {{in the design of}} future biomimetic adhesive systems. Statement of Significance: Mussel adhesive proteins have proven to be promising biomimetic adhesive candidates for soft tissues and {{here for the first time}} we have adapted marine adhesive technology into a denture fixative application.

Silks are highly expressed proteins produced by all spiders and many insects. We compared the metabolic costs of silks spun by arthropods by calculating the amount of ATP required to produce their component amino acids. Although a definitive conclusion requires detailed information on the dietary pools of amino acids available to arthropods, {{on the basis of}} the central metabolic pathways, silks spun by herbivorous, Lepidoptera larvae require significantly less ATP to synthesize than the dragline silks spun by predatory spiders. While not enough data are available to draw a statistically based conclusion, comparison of homologous silks across ancestral and derived taxa of the Araneoidea seems to suggest an evolutionary trend towards reduced silk costs. However, comparison of the synthetic costs of dragline silks across all araneomorph spiders suggests a complicated evolutionary pattern that cannot be attributed to phylogenetic position alone. We propose that the diverse silk-producing systems of the araneoid spiders (including three types of <b>protein</b> <b>glues</b> and three types of silk fibroin), evolved through intra-organ competition and that taxon-specific differences in the composition of silks drawn from homologous glands may reflect limited or fluctuating amino acid availability.

Today, many conservators find the information about the long term sustainability of these binding mediums to be incomplete. Evaluation of synthetic materials is mostly done through clinical research, sometimes artificial aging is simulated. The correlation between artificial and natural aging is however not established, useful information can therefore be gained through evaluations of actual conservation treatments. The intention of this study is to find out more about how the mentioned products perform over time in normal museum conditions. 104 Objects treated 10 - 35 years ago were examined non-invasively, in order to determine their current state. In most cases these binding mediums perform well. Since the chemical stability of acrylates – judging from the previous research – is proven to be good, and reasonably good in the case of Beva 371, it is the mechanic properties that are likely to fail over time. No correlation between the time passed and long term sustainability could be found. Sustainability seems to be highly dependent on the original properties of the object. Also important, in order to perform a sustainable conservation, is the method applied during the treatment. This study is also a survey of 16 painting conservators view on these binding mediums and methods. Here it can be concluded that these products are all in use, although 9 out of 16 wouldn’t use Plexisol P 550.

In the first series of experiments, it is shown that there is a more rapid disappearance of 68 C RNA transcripts from salivary glands cultured in the presence of ecdysterone than from glands cultured in its absence. The second set of experiments, in which 68 C transcripts were pulse-labeled in salivary glands cultured in the presence or absence of hormone, demonstrates that one effect of ecdysterone is to cause a sharp reduction in the rate at which newly synthesized 68 C transcripts accumulate. The final experiments follow the time required for ecdysterone to produce this effect, and show that it occurs in salivary glands exposed to the hormone for as little as 15 min.

Spindle positioning is mediated through a cortical machinery by capturing astral microtubules, thereby generating pushing/pulling forces at the cell cortex.

While it is generally accepted that gap junctions form via lateral diffusion of hemichannels following microtubule-mediated delivery to the plasma membrane, we provide evidence for direct targeting of hemichannels to cell-cell junctions through a pathway that is dependent on microtubules; through the adherens-junction proteins N-cadherin and beta-catenin; through the microtubule plus-end-tracking protein (+TIP) EB 1; and through its interacting <b>protein</b> p 150 (<b>Glued).</b> Based on live cell microscopy that includes fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), deconvolution, and siRNA knockdown, we propose that preferential tethering of microtubule plus ends at the adherens junction promotes delivery of connexin hemichannels directly to the cell-cell border. These findings support an unanticipated mechanism for protein delivery to points of cell-cell contact...|$|R
40|$|This report places {{outer limits}} {{on the size of}} the DNA region {{required}} for expression of a Drosophila gene. This region, termed the unit of expression, includes not only the structural gene but also any cis-acting sequences that modulate its activity. The locus we have chosen, Sgs- 4, codes for one of the <b>glue</b> <b>proteins</b> secreted by larval Drosophila salivary glands. Cytological deficiencies have been identified that eliminate sequences on one side or the other of Sgs- 4 without affecting its expression. The ends of these deficiencies have been localized accurately with respect to restriction endonuclease sites in and near the locus. These endpoints limit the Sgs- 4 structural gene and essential flanking sequences to a 16 - to 19 -kilobase region of the X chromosome. The results also show that there is no DNA sequence rearrangement in the Sgs- 4 region during development of either the polytene larval salivary glands or adult flies...|$|R
40|$|Surface-spread {{polytene}} (SSP) chromosomes of {{salivary glands}} from late third-instar larvae {{were used for}} the construction of an electron microscopic (EM) photo map of the entire genome of D. melanogaster Oregon Q₂. The SSP chromosomes were spread by surface tension, according to the method of the Kalisch group, show more additional bands and interbands than the squashed chromosomes. Recent advances in the molecular mapping of Drosophila DNA have raised the necessity for the fine chromosome map. In this investigation we drew the computerized SSP EM map by using our original computer program, and localized DNaseⅠ-gold binding sites on SSP 3 L chromosome. The subdivision 68 C and 71 C, including <b>glue</b> <b>protein</b> genes, were markedly bound with DNaseⅠ-gold, and the most of DNaseⅠ-gold were found peculiarly to the approximately 30 nm chromatin fiber. This suggested that the DNaseⅠ-gold binding fibers retain the loosened solenoid structure, which is different three-dimensionally from the conventional solenoid type...|$|R
