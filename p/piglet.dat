40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the behaviour, pre-weaning survival rate and growth performance of low birth weight (BW) <b>piglets</b> cross-fostered with <b>piglets</b> of higher weights. <b>Piglets</b> were transferred to 60 foster sows, and divided in three groups (G; n= 20) : G 1 - 12 low BW <b>piglets</b> (0. 80 - 1. 25 kg); G 2 - six low BW <b>piglets</b> and six intermediate BW <b>piglets</b> (1. 40 - 1. 60 kg), and G 3 - six low BW <b>piglets</b> and six high BW <b>piglets</b> (> 1. 70 kg). For the analysis, groups G 2 and G 3 were subdivided in LG 2 (six G 2 light piglets); IG 2 (six G 2 intermediate <b>piglets),</b> LG 3 (six G 3 light <b>piglets),</b> and HG 3 (six G 3 heavy <b>piglets).</b> Behavioural observations were carried out on days 1, 2, 4 and 6 (visual direct observation) and on days 3 and 5 (video recording) after birth. The percentage of missed nursings was higher in LG 3 <b>piglets</b> than in LG 1, IG 2 and HG 3 <b>piglets,</b> on days 1 and 2. On day 4, light <b>piglets</b> (LG 1, LG 2 and LG 3) missed more nursings than IG 2 and HG 3 <b>piglets.</b> On day 3, video recording showed a higher percentage of missed nursings in LG 1, LG 2, and LG 3 <b>piglets</b> as compared to HG 3 <b>piglets.</b> On day 1, the number of fights during nursing was higher in IG 2 than in LG 1 and LG 3 <b>piglets.</b> Also on day 1, number of fights and percentage of <b>piglets</b> engaged in fights, during 15 min after nursing, were higher in LG 1, LG 3 and HG 3 than in LG 2 <b>piglets.</b> More playful behaviours were observed on day 2 in IG 2 and HG 3 <b>piglets</b> compared to LG 1, LG 2 and LG 3 <b>piglets.</b> Light <b>piglets</b> (LG 1, LG 2, and LG 3) presented similar body weight on days 4, 8, 12 and 16 after birth, regardless of being mixed with <b>piglets</b> of higher weights or not; however, the survival rate until day 16 was most compromised in LG 3 <b>piglets</b> compared to the other groups.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} was to analyze selected reproductive characteristics in sows and losses of <b>piglets</b> according to their age and to evaluate the effect of sex on survivability of <b>piglets</b> before weaning. The experimental observation involved 80 sows with their second litters (40 sows of genotye I and 40 sows of genotype II). The sows were mated with a boar of Danish Duroc. No {{significant difference was found}} between the evaluated genotypes of sows in numbers of live‑born <b>piglets</b> and reared <b>piglets,</b> however it is evident that better results were reached by the sows of the genotype II. Also the losses of <b>piglets</b> per litter were lower, by 0. 65 piece (P ≤ 0. 05). In sows of the genotype I a high correlation (P ≤ 0. 01) was confirmed between the number of live‑born <b>piglets</b> and the number of reared <b>piglets</b> per litter (r = 0. 750). Another correlation was found between the number of live‑born <b>piglets</b> and their losses before weaning (r = 0. 716). Similar trend was observed in the genotype II, however without significant correlation between the number of live‑born <b>piglets</b> and the losses of <b>piglets</b> before weaning. The results also revealed that the <b>piglets</b> died mostly before the 14 th day of age, while the losses of male <b>piglets</b> were more frequent than of female <b>piglets.</b> Losses of female <b>piglets</b> of the genotype I before the 14 th day of age were 6. 82 %, in the genotype II they were 3. 01 %.

40|$|During weaning, <b>piglets</b> {{are under}} strain {{from the loss}} of their dam, the change in feed, and a new {{microbiological}} environment. How much this strain influences the <b>piglets</b> depends mostly on their immune system. <b>Piglets</b> from organic production are weaned later (at least 40 days) than <b>piglets</b> from conventional rearing, but the performance and health status of organic <b>piglets</b> are often not satisfying. Therefore, it was the aim to investigate whether a prolonged suckling period of 63 days results in better immune status of <b>piglets</b> than with weaning at day 42. To answer that question we vaccinated <b>piglets</b> at different times with a “known” (by vaccination of dam) and an “unknown” antigen and analysed the plasma for immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration and the antigen-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA. Two farrowing cycles of 36 sows were recorded. Time of vaccination did not influence IgG concentration. In contrast, early weaned <b>piglets</b> showed a higher IgG concentration on day 49 than late weaned <b>piglets.</b> During the first farrowing cycle a significant immune response against both antigens was present in <b>piglets</b> vaccinated on day 42. Such a response was not found in <b>piglets</b> vaccinated on day 63 and in <b>piglets</b> of the second farrowing cycle. In conclusion, the results did not show an improved immune status of <b>piglets</b> undergoing a suckling period of 63 days...|$|R

After euthanasia, <b>piglets</b> were necropsied for evaluation of euthanasia on pulmonary lesions. No significant difference in number of pulmonary lesions was found between health groups (P = 0. 88). Healthy <b>piglets</b> had higher concentrations of glucose, ionized calcium and sodium, and greater pCO₂ than unthrifty <b>piglets</b> (P ≤ 0. 05).

The average treatment times were 27. 4 ± 6. 7 minutes for HH and 13. 8 ± 5. 1 minutes for CO 2. <b>Piglets</b> euthanized via CO 2 reached an isoelectric state faster than <b>piglets</b> euthanized via HH (P = 0. 009). Behavioral observations revealed gasping in 100 % of CO 2 euthanized <b>piglets</b> during the first five minutes of treatment and only 28. 6 % of HH euthanized <b>piglets</b> during the same period. During HH, 57. 1 % of <b>piglets</b> became ataxic in the first five minutes while 76. 9 % of CO 2 ¬ <b>piglets</b> became ataxic during the same period. Results of this trial indicate that HH may be a lower stress alternative to CO₂ as it causes fewer incidences of aversive behaviors in early stages of treatment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the {{reproductive}} performance of sows on two farms within a selected company, which is engaged in breeding pigs. There were observed phenotypic level of selected reproductive parameters, namely {{the total number of}} <b>piglets</b> born, number of <b>piglets</b> born alive and number of weaned <b>piglets.</b> These reproductive performance were also compared depending on the order of litters and the length of pregnancy. The evaluation of the results we can say that the best reproduction performance were achieved in 2014 on a farm A, namely 15, 00 pcs of all born <b>piglets</b> per litter. Live born and weaned <b>piglets</b> per litter were found most in 2015 on a farm B, namely 12. 56 pcs / litter of live born <b>piglets</b> and weaned <b>piglets</b> - 11. 67 pcs / litter. In comparison reproductive performance in the sequence of litter in the number of live born <b>piglets</b> were the best third and subsequent litters on the farm A - 14. 66 <b>piglets</b> per litter. The most live born <b>piglets</b> were found in the third and subsequent litters on the farm B - 12. 58 <b>piglets</b> per litter. The highest number of weaned <b>piglets</b> were found again in third and subsequent litters, namely 11. 64 <b>piglets</b> per litter on the farm B. The evaluation of influence of the length of pregnancy on the reproductive performance is obvious that the best results in all parameters was achieved at a length of pregnancy in the interval from 111 to 113 days. All born <b>piglets</b> per litter were found 15. 2 pcs / litter on the farm A and live born <b>piglets</b> per litter were the most on the farm B - 12. 55 pcs / litter. The most weaned <b>piglets</b> were found on the farm B - 11, 70 pcs / litter. Losses of <b>piglets</b> from birth to weaning were recorded at least on the farm A in 2015 - 5. 73 % of <b>piglets</b> born alive and on the farm B in 2014 - 6. 69 %. Depending on the order of litter was the best result achieved at the farm and for sows in the second litter, when losses were recorded only 0. 09 % of <b>piglets</b> born alive. The best result of losses in relation to the length of pregnancy was achieved on farms A 3. 24 % at the length of pregnancy in the interval from 117 to 119 day...|$|R
25|$|The most {{noticeable}} trait {{of the early}} entremets was the focus on vivid colors. Later on, the entremets would take the shape of various types of illusion foods, such as peacocks or swans that were skinned, cooked, seasoned and then redressed in their original plumage (or filled with the meat of tastier fowl) or even scenes depicting contemporary human activities, such as a knight {{in the form of}} a grilled capon equipped with a paper helmet and lance, sitting on the back of a roast <b>piglet.</b> Elaborate models of castles made from edible material was a popular theme. At a feast in 1343 dedicated to Pope Clement VI, one of the Avignon popes, one of the entremets was a castle with walls made from roast birds, populated with cooked and redressed deer, wild boar, goat, hare and rabbit.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare physiological characteristics between Meishan and Yorkshire <b>piglets</b> in their early lives. Six healthy purebred Meishan sows and Yorkshire sows with close farrowing dates were used in this research. The <b>piglets</b> sucked their respective sow's milk for 14 days, then they were slaughtered to collect samples of blood, pancreas, contents of stomach, jejunum, cecum, colon as well as feces for analysis of blood biochemical parameters, digestive enzymes, and volatile fatty acid (VFA). The results showed that Yorkshire <b>piglets</b> had higher concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) (P <  0. 05). Gastric lipase activity was higher in Meishan <b>piglets</b> but Yorkshire <b>piglets</b> had higher lactase activity (P <  0. 05). The total VFA together with acetate and propionate in cecum and colon were higher in Meishan <b>piglets</b> than in Yorkshire <b>piglets</b> (P <  0. 05), but acetate in jejunum and ratio of acetate to propionate in colon were lower in Meishan <b>piglets</b> than in Yorkshire <b>piglets</b> (P <  0. 05). In conclusion, in early suckling period, significant differences exist in host metabolism and intestinal microbial metabolism between Meishan and Yorkshire <b>piglets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relation between erythrocyte parameters of <b>piglets</b> and their mortality during parturition. Erythrocyte count, haematocrit volume, blood haemoglobin concentration, mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were determined in 80 live-born and 109 stillborn <b>piglets.</b> In both live-born and stillborn <b>piglets</b> the investigated parameters were evaluated with respect to sex and birth mass. Blood samples of all <b>piglets</b> were collected immediately after birth. Stillborn <b>piglets</b> had lower erythrocyte values (P< 0. 01), haemoglobin (P< 0. 05) and haematocrit (P< 0. 01) than live-born <b>piglets.</b> The results suggest that the incidence of stillbirth in <b>piglets</b> is associated with reduced levels of erythrocytes and haemoglobin in their blood. There are no significant influences of sex and birth mass on any of the investigated erythrocyte parameters in either live-born or stillborn <b>piglets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis was the analysis of reproductive traits of sows. Data from the years 2009 ? 2011 were obtained in the company conducting production herds. The highest number of <b>piglets</b> born alive per one sow a year (26. 8) was reached in 2011. The highest number of weaned <b>piglets</b> (25. 6) per a sow was obtained in 2010. By shortening farrowing index in a monitored three-year period the number of births increased from 2. 29 to 2. 35. We found out that sows covered at older age gave birth to more <b>piglets</b> born alive. Concerning total number born <b>piglets</b> the difference between sows covered in more than 246 days and sows covered in the age interval of 225 ? 246 days was 0. 14 <b>piglets,</b> or, {{as the case may}} be, with sows covered in 203 ? 224 days the difference was 0. 18 <b>piglets.</b> Sows covered in less than 203 days gave birth only to 10. 67 total number born <b>piglets.</b> Most total number born <b>piglets</b> were found at the sixth litter (13. 14), followed by the fourth litter. The fourth litter brought most alive-born <b>piglets</b> (12. 58) and differed from the third litter only slightly. Most <b>piglets</b> survived at the third litter (11. 61). The relation between all <b>piglets</b> and those alive-born was statistically highly conclusive 0. 859 +++. The highest number of total number born <b>piglets</b> was reached with sows which were covered 5 (12. 84) or 6 days (12. 79) after weaning...|$|R
