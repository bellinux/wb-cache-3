He started the 1/5 favourite against eight opponents and won by {{three and a half}} lengths and a head from Les Planches and Leukerbad. In the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 17 April Satono Diamond was made the 1.7/1 favourite ahead of the Japanese champion two-year-old colt Leontes in an eighteen-runner field. Before the race Ikee commented on the colt's <b>physical</b> <b>progress</b> and added [...] "he’s very stable mentally and he can handle any kind of race". After racing in mid-division the favourite made a forward move in the straight but was slightly hampered in the closing stages and finished third behind Dee Majesty and Makahiki. Ikee later said that the tactics employed had been [...] "a mistake", commenting [...] "this colt is big and has long limbs and he’s not able to take small steps". On 29 May, in front of a 140,000 crowd at Tokyo Racecourse, Satono Diamond was one of eighteen colts to contest the 83rd running of the Tokyo Yushun and started second favourite behind Dee Majesty. He was positioned several lengths behind the early leaders before moving up to dispute the lead in the straight but in a very close finish he was beaten a nose by Makahiki with Dee Majesty half a length away in third place.|$|E

Now when {{a nation}} with mimetic {{instinct}} and imaginative longing is also thus occupied earnestly in the discovery of Ethic law, that effort gradually brings precision and truth into all its manual acts; and the <b>physical</b> <b>progress</b> of sculpture as in the Greek, so in the Tuscan, school, consists in gradually limiting what was before indefinite, in verifying what was inaccurate, and in humanizing what was monstrous. I might perhaps content you by showing these external phenomena, and by dwelling simply on the increasing desire of naturalness, which compels, in every successive decade of years, literally, in the sculptured images, the mimicked bones to come together, bone to his bone; and the flesh to come up upon them, until from a flattened and pinched handful of clay, respecting which you may gravely question whether it was intended for a human form at all;--by slow degrees, and added touch to touch, in increasing consciousness of the bodily truth,--at last the Aphrodite of Melos stands before you, a perfect woman. But all that search for physical accuracy is merely the external operation, in the arts, of the seeking for truth in the inner soul; it is impossible without that higher effort, and the demonstration of it would be worse than useless to you, unless I made you aware {{at the same time}} of its spiritual cause.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{regeneration}} in the Republic of Ireland {{takes place}} {{in the context of the}} rapid, 'Celtic Tiger' economic growth of the 1990 s. The boom transformed Irish society and led to greater affluence for many people, along with continuing and arguably worsening inequality for those excluded from its opportunities. In particular, Ireland's small social rented sector has become the focus of the country's most concentrated poverty and social exclusion. The Ballymun regeneration programme in North Dublin aims to facilitate physical, social and economic change in order to integrate the area more closely with the more affluent surrounding suburbs. This article reviews the issues involved in restructuring such a large area of social exclusion within a rapidly changing European capital city, using a framework that disaggregates the concept of integration into three elements: market, citizenship and reciprocity. With just over half the <b>physical</b> refurbishment complete, <b>progress</b> has been made but some fundamental issues remain. The article concludes that although substantial advancement has been made with <b>physical</b> regeneration, <b>progress</b> with wider economic and social integration has been uneven and in some cases flawed...|$|R

5000|$|Shotover made {{excellent}} <b>physical</b> <b>progress</b> in {{the winter}} of 1881-2 and was described as [...] "one of the most improved" [...] of her owner's three-year-olds. She also impressed her trainer with her performance in a private trial in early April, persuading him that she had Classic potential. Although the classic generation of 1882 contained few top-class colts, there were some outstanding fillies, including St Marguerite, Dutch Oven, and Shotover’s stable companion Geheimness. It was therefore decided that Shotover’s three-year-old debut would be against colts in the 2000 Guineas. Five days before the race, she appeared in the betting {{for the first time and}} was quickly backed down from odds of 25/1, attracting the attention of the sporting papers such as Bell's Life and The Sportsman.|$|E

Before the season began, Lord Falmouth decided to retire from the turf and sell all of his horses at a public auction. As a leading Derby fancy, Harvester was expected to attract considerable interest, and it was predicted that he would fetch at least £5,000. At Newmarket on 28 April Harvester was sold for 8,600 guineas to Sir John Willoughby, a young Guards officer who had also bought Queen Adelaide. Although some felt that Willoughby had paid far too much, others noted that the colt's trainer Mathew Dawson, who presumably knew him best, had bid up to £7,000 before dropping out of the auction.|$|E
50|$|WFA is {{a method}} of trying to equal out the <b>physical</b> <b>progress</b> which the average {{thoroughbred}} racehorse makes as it matures. The thoroughbred matures extremely quickly compared to the human being. By {{the age of two}} the horse has achieved 95% of its mature height and weight, {{and by the end of}} its third year it will be fully mature. To allow for this variation in maturity in the context of racing, it is necessary to express it as a function of the weight a horse will carry in a race. It is also necessary to take into account the race distance because stamina comes with maturity, and younger horses are at a greater disadvantage the further they have to run. If no allowance was made, a mature older horse would always beat a younger one.|$|E
