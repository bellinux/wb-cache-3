5|$|The Great Plague {{epidemic}} of 1665 {{is believed to}} have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is sometimes suggested that the fire saved lives in the long run by burning down so much unsanitary housing with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the plague, as plague epidemics did not recur in London after the fire. Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection, while historian Roy Porter points out that the fire left the most insalubrious parts of London, the slum suburbs, untouched.|$|E

5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> {{has been suggested that}} it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production {{in the latter half of}} the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E

25|$|On 7 July 2005 three bombs {{exploded}} on underground trains, {{two on the}} Circle line at Aldgate and Edgware Road and the third on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross and Russell Square.

Four suicide bombers had killed themselves and fifty-two other <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> took over a month before underground services had been restored. In 2007 the East London line, operated as an isolated shuttle since 1939, closed {{so that it could}} be converted into a London Overground line. In December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London {{on the north side of}} the River Thames to a spiral serving Hammersmith. On the Jubilee line a seventh car was added to all trains, in 2006 and a new signalling system allowing automatic operation was commissioned in 2011. On the Victoria line, new trains were introduced between July 2009 and June 2011, and a new signalling system has allowed 33 trains per hour from January 2013. The sub-surface (Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith & City) lines are being upgraded, with new air-conditioned S Stock in use on the Metropolitan and due to replace the current C and D stock trains on the other lines by 2017. Also, the sub-surface track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme designed to increase peak-hour capacity by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface network is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s.|$|E
