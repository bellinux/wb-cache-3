Anhydride modification also enhanced the fiber smoothness, as demonstrated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis.

40|$|Transesterification of (±) -menthol using <b>propionic</b> acid <b>anhydride</b> and Candida rugosa lipase was {{performed}} in chloroform and water at different pressures (1, 10, 50, and 100 bar) to study the pressure dependence of enantioselectivity E. As a result, E significantly decreased with increasing pressure from E = 55 (1 bar) to E = 47 (10 bar), E = 37 (50 bar), and E = 9 (100 bar). To rationalize the experimental findings, molecular dynamics simulations of Candida rugosa lipase were carried out. Analyzing the lipase geometry at 1, 10, 50, and 100 bar revealed a cavity in the Candida rugosa lipase. The cavity leads from {{a position on the}} surface distinct from the substrate binding site to the core towards the active site, and is limited by F 415 and the catalytic H 449. In the crystal structure of the Candida rugosa lipase, this cavity is filled with six water molecules. The number of water molecules in this cavity gradually increased with increasing pressure: six molecules in the simulation at 1 bar, 10 molecules at 10 bar, 12 molecules at 50 bar, and 13 molecules at 100 bar. Likewise, the volume of the cavity progressively increased from about 1864 Å 3 in the simulation at 1 bar to 2529 Å 3 at 10 bar, 2526 Å 3 at 50 bar, and 2617 Å 3 at 100 bar. At 100 bar, one water molecule slipped between F 415 and H 449, displacing the catalytic histidine side chain and thus opening the cavity to form a continuous water channel. The rotation of the side chain leads to a decreased distance between the H 449 -Nɛ and the (+) -menthyl-oxygen (nonpreferred enantiomer) in the acyl enzyme intermediate, a factor determining the enantioselectivity of the lipase. Although the geometry of the preferred enantiomer is similar in all simulations, the geometry of the nonpreferred enantiomer gets gradually more reactive.

40|$|Proteolytic {{processing}} {{events are}} essential to physiological processes such as reproduction, development, and host responses, as well as regulating proteins in cancer; therefore, {{there is a significant}} need to develop robust approaches for characterizing such events. The current mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics techniques employs a “bottom-up” strategy, which does not allow for identification of different proteolytic proteins since the strategy measures all the small peptides from any given protein. The aim of this development is to enable the effective identification of specific proteolytic fragments. The protocol utilizes an acetylation reaction to block the N-termini of a protein, as well as any lysine residues. Following digestion, N-terminal peptides are enriched by removing peptides that contain free amines, using amine-reactive silica-bond succinic anhydride beads. The resulting enriched sample has one N-terminal peptide per protein, which reduces sample complexity and allows for increased analytical sensitivity compared to global proteomics. 1 We initially compared the peptide identification and efficiency of blocking lysine using acetic anhydride (a 42 Da modification) or <b>propionic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (a 56 Da modification) in our protocol. Both chemical reactions resulted in comparable peptide identifications and ∼ 95 percent efficiency for blocking lysine residues. However, the use of <b>propionic</b> <b>anhydride</b> allowed us to distinguish in vivo acetylated peptides from chemically-tagged peptides. 2 In an initial experiment using mouse plasma, we were able to identify > 300 unique N-termini peptides, as well as many known cleavage sites.
