50|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that rats are able to be trained to press one lever after hearing two bursts of white noise, then press another lever after four bursts of white noise. The interburst {{interval}} is varied between trials so the discrimination is based on number of bursts and not time duration of the sequence. Studies show that rats as well as pigeons learned to make different responses to both short and long durations of signals. During testing, rats exhibited a pattern called break-run-break; {{when it came to}} responding after a stint of little to no response, they would suddenly respond in high frequency, then return to little or no response activity. Data suggests that rats and pigeons are able to process time and number information at the same time.

40|$|In {{a spatial}} {{attention}} paradigm, Fischer, Castel, Dodd, & Pratt (2003) showed that merely perceiving a number shifted attention {{according to the}} magnitude of the number. Low numbers shifted attention to the left and high numbers shifted attention to the right. This suggests that numbers are represented by the mental number line - a spatial image schema that is ordered from left to right with increasing magnitude. In six experiments, we used the spatial attention paradigm of Fischer et al. to investigate if and when such mental representations are activated. Participants detected visual targets that were preceded by low and high numbers. Between experiments we manipulated how participants <b>processed</b> the <b>number.</b> Participants either merely perceived the number, as in the experiments by Fisher et al., <b>processed</b> the <b>number’s</b> parity, or <b>processed</b> the <b>number’s</b> magnitude. Our results provide little support for the idea that numbers shift spatial attention. Only in one of the two experiments in which participants <b>processed</b> <b>number</b> magnitude did participants respond faster to targets in congruent locations (left for low magnitudes and right for high magnitudes) than in incongruent locations. In the other five experiments number magnitude did not affect spatial attention. This shows, in contrast to Fischer et al. ’s results, that the mental number line is not activated automatically but at best only when it is contextually relevant. Furthermore, these results suggest that image schemas in general may be context dependent rather than fundamental to mental concepts...|$|R

This second algorithm requires O(D) steps, an overall computation time of O(D log(n)), and O(D) messages of size log_ 3 (n) + 3, where D is {{the diameter of the}} modified connected component.
