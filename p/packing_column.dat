Hydrodynamics and mass transfer in gas and liquid phases in a packed columnhave significant influences on absorber design {{especially for the}} design of packing height. In this paper, the sensitivity study has been conducted to investigate the impacts of gas phase density, viscosity and diffusivity on the hydrodynamics and mass transfer and further the total packing height of a counter-current flow with random <b>packing</b> <b>column,</b> using reactive absorption process and integral rate-based models.

Sometimes, fusel oil is accidently mixed with liquid waste {{from the bottom}} of alcohol rectifying column. This mixture is called lutter washer. Fusel oil contains isoamyl alcohol, n-amyl alcohol, and other alcohols. Isoamyl alcohol is the raw material of organic ester.

In this study, the composition of isoamyl alcohol and n-amyl alcohol in the residue in the distillation process as a function of distillation time in a <b>packing</b> <b>column</b> was evaluated.

Introduction presents {{advantages and disadvantages of}} thermal processing of waste and production of undesired pollutants. Following parts comprise facts about main pollutants produced from incineration. Legislation providing for emission of gaseous pollutants from incinerators is also given. Chapter concerning methods of pollutants elimination is mostly focused on absorption (wet and/or semidry scrubber) and adsorption methods. Several up-to-date technological procedures are mentioned; they have a multifunctional effect such as elimination of acidic components, heavy metals, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxines and dibenzo-furanes from flue gas using single injection of suspense. Elimination of mercury (Hg) is among the technologies for heavy metal elimination which is described in detail. Main part of the thesis is related to experiments at two-stage flue gas cleaning equipment. Function of this experimental unit is described along with methods for measurement of individual quantities and detailed description of all the equipment and its components. Experimental measurements carried out at this equipment are explicated and assessed.
