[...] "I'm just glad <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> songs, really. I think they're really good. The only problem is with people who don't know I wrote them.

500|$|Eve {{accepted}} the {{role as a}} way to showcase a different side of her personality that was unexplored in her music. Her co-star Jason George commented that the show allowed the audience to see Eve as more than a hardcore rap artist, saying: [...] "The part that <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> least about her comes across most in this show: There's a seriously girlie girl side to her." [...] DeLoach emphasized the difference between Eve and her character Shelly Williams by saying: [...] "She's bringing so much of herself to the role of Shelly but she's playing a character. Some of the things Shelly does aren't necessarily what Eve would do." [...] To further distinguish herself as an actor, Eve decided against singing the show's theme song.|$|E
500|$|Many {{homophobic}} slurs {{have caught}} the attention of media outlets. Many adolescents have emulated The Bad Girls Club.

'" [...] She also commented that the show gives a [...] "distorted picture" [...] of how to live the good life, calling the cast [...] "wannabes" [...] who are [...] "sleeping in a mansion they can't pay for". Mitchell believes that most <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> cast are living [...] "a bogus lifestyle", and assesses the message of the Bad Girls Club as [...] "disturbing".|$|E

500|$|In 2004, the African American Historical and Cultural Society Museum in San Francisco {{assembled}} a Queen Califia exhibit, curated by John William Templeton, featuring works by {{artists such as}} TheArthur Wright and James Gayles; artistic interpretations of Calafia. The show displayed a 1936 treatment of Lucille Lloyd's [...] "California Allegory" [...] triptych, with Queen Califia as the central figure. Templeton said that [...] "Califia {{is a part of}} California history, and she also reinforces the fact that when Cortes named this place California, he had 300 black people with him." [...] Templeton pointed out that Columbus had a black navigator and that Africans were seen by Europeans as being culturally advanced in the 15th century. William E. Hoskins, director of the museum, said that very few <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> story of Queen Califia. He said, [...] "One of the things we're trying to do is let people have the additional insight and appreciation for the contributions of African Americans to this wonderful country and more specifically to the state of California", adding that [...] "the Queen Califia exhibit is particularly poignant." ...|$|E
500|$|A 2006 review asserted: [...] "Many are the {{knowledgeable}} and discriminating {{people for whom}} Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific, brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." [...] In 1987, however, John Rockwell of The New York Times reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while South Pacific had been innovative for 1949, [...] "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, South Pacific epitomized {{the concerns of the}} day– America's responsibilities {{in the world and the}} dangers of racism.... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with M*A*S*H having contemporized this same setting". [...] A 2008 Huffington Post review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on [...] "exotic background roles" [...] in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she [...] "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." [...] South Pacific is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, Helmet for My Pillow, after he walked out of a performance: [...] "I have to tell the story of how it really was. I have to let <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> war wasn't a musical." ...|$|E
500|$|After O'Leary's {{revelation that}} {{producers}} had rehearsed {{what would happen}} if Cole abstained in week 5, allegations were made that the result was rigged for Waissel to stay, given that her outlandish performances and growing unpopularity with the public resulted in better ratings and sensational press for the show. Cowell denied this claim, saying he would never want to defraud viewers and said the situation had [...] "been blown out of proportion". O'Leary defended himself and the show on Twitter, saying [...] "We never know which way the judges are going to vote. Ever. The only thing I know is who's in the bottom two when I'm given the card. I don't know which judge to go to until I'm called and the judges, including , don't know the vote or who we're coming to next. It's that simple." [...] The following week, Heat magazine printed a report claiming that Cowell was aware of the public votes before the judges make their votes, and several other media reports contained rumours of the show being fixed. The X Factor bosses instructed their lawyers to file a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission against Heat, saying that the article was a lie, that very few <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> actual public voting results and conspiracy theories being printed in the media are [...] "total and utter rubbish". Heat printed an apology in their 1 January 2011 issue and accepted that Cowell was unaware of the votes cast until after the final.|$|E

The Whadjuk themselves were one of a larger group of fourteen tribes that formed the south-west socio-linguistic block known as the Noongar (meaning [...] "the people" [...] in their language), also sometimes called the Bibbulmun.

2500|$|UP 844 is a 4-8-4 Northern type express {{passenger}} {{steam locomotive}} (class FEF-3). [...] It {{was the last}} steam locomotive built for UP {{and has been in}} continuous service since its 1944 delivery. Many <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> engine as the No. 8444, since an extra '4' was added to its number in 1962 to distinguish it from a diesel numbered in the 800 series. It regained its rightful number in June 1989, after the diesel was retired and donated to the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum in Boulder City, Nevada. A mechanical failure occurred on June 24, 1999, in which the boiler tubes from the 1996 overhaul, being made of the wrong material, collapsed inside the boiler and put the steam locomotive out of commission. The UP steam crew successfully repaired it and returned it to service on November 10, 2004. It was rebuilt and returned to service in 2016. It is the only steam locomotive to never be officially retired from a North American Class I railroad.|$|E
