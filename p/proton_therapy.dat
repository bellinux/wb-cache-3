40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} 20 years, several proton beam {{treatment}} {{programs have been}} implemented throughout the United States. Increasingly, {{the number of new}} programs under development is growing. <b>Proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> has the potential for improving tumor control and survival through dose escalation.

25|$|Radiotherapy - The {{ophthalmologist}} decides {{in conjunction}} with the radiation oncologist which type of radiation therapy is most suitable, based on size and location of the tumour. Today, modern radiation treatment modalities, as <b>proton</b> <b>therapy,</b> are likely to be chosen, for providing superior accuracy in dose delivery, helping to spare healthy tissue and the sensible optic nerves.|$|E
25|$|In {{particle}} therapy (<b>proton</b> <b>therapy</b> {{being one}} example), energetic ionizing particles (protons or carbon ions) are {{directed at the}} target tumor. The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum (the Bragg peak) that occurs {{near the end of}} the particle's range, and it then drops to (almost) zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.|$|E

25|$|Matter–antimatter {{reactions}} have {{practical applications}} in medical imaging, such as {{positron emission tomography}} (PET). In positive beta decay, a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a neutrino is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to {{have the potential to}} treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (<b>proton)</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
25|$|External beam {{radiation}} therapy uses a linear accelerator to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) {{may be used}} to adjust the radiation beam to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. External {{beam radiation}} therapy is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. Eleven centers in the United States are now using <b>proton</b> <b>therapy</b> for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|Treatments where <b>proton</b> <b>therapy's</b> {{increased}} precision reduces unwanted {{side effects}} by lessening the dose to normal tissue.

Instead, the emphasis is on reducing the integral dose to normal tissue, thus reducing unwanted effects.|$|R

25|$|Charged {{particles}} such as {{protons and}} boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (linear energy transfer) {{and have an}} antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See <b>proton</b> <b>therapy</b> for {{a good example of}} the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers).|$|E

40|$|Recently, several {{articles}} {{have been published}} in the Journal of Clinical Oncology 1 and other 2 - 4 journals reviewing and comment-ing on the record of <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy,</b> as well as an analysis including some critical commentary by Brada et al. 5 All of these articles make the uncontested point that there are almost no ran-domized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> with conventional x-ray therapy.

In brief, the arguments for the use of <b>protons</b> in radiation <b>therapy</b> are as follows.

2500|$|Protons {{may also}} be used in {{radiosurgery}} in a procedure called Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) or <b>proton</b> <b>therapy.</b> Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical synchrotron or cyclotron, and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the Bragg peak of ejected protons gives <b>proton</b> <b>therapy</b> advantages over other forms of radiation, {{since most of the}} proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the [...] "depth charge effect" [...] by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the optic chiasm or brainstem. The development of [...] "intensity modulated" [...] techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.|$|E

40|$|<b>Proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> is an {{emerging}} technology with promise of revolutionizing {{the treatment of}} cancer. While {{nearly half of all}} patients diagnosed with cancer in the US receive radiation therapy, the majority is delivered via electron accelerators, where photons are used to irradiate cancerous tissue. Because of the physical properties of photon beams, photons may deposit energy along their entire path length through the body. On the other hand, a proton beam directed at a tumor travels in a straight trajectory towards its target, gives off most of its energy at a defined depth called the Bragg peak, and then stops. While photons often deposit more energy within the healthy tissues of the body than within the cancer itself, protons can deposit most of their cancer-killing energy within the area of the tumor. As a result, in the properly selected patients, <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> has the ability to improve cure rates by increasing the dose delivered to the tumor and simultaneously reduce side-effects by decreasing the dose to surrounding tissue. The benefits of <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> in delivering a lethal hit to the target while sparing surrounding normal tissues from radiation are becoming applicable to an increasing number of patients and a growing list of conditions. In this book, the author will guide the reader through existing evidence supporting <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> for pediatric cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, brain tumors, spinal tumors, and several other conditions.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{survival and}} ocular outcome in recurrent uveal melanoma treated with <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> as salvage therapy. Design Retrospective, interventional case series. Methods We evaluated 48 patients with local recurrence of uveal melanoma after primary treatment with brachytherapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy,</b> laser photocoagulation, CyberKnife radiation, or photodynamic therapy. All patients received <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> as a salvage therapy at the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin between July 2000 and December 2010.

Results The Kaplan Meier estimator for local tumor control was 92. 1 at 10 years after secondary treatment with <b>proton</b> beam <b>therapy.</b> Local recurrence developed in 3 patients; 1 of them underwent enucleation. During follow up, 20. 8 of the patients died 16. 7 of metastasis, 4. 1 of other causes or not specified. The most frequent surgical interventions were phacoemulsification 20. 8 and pars plana vitrectomy 10. 4. The Kaplan Meier estimators were 77. 4 for survival and 70. 1 for the absence of metastasis 10 years after the primary treatment. Conclusions <b>Proton</b> beam <b>therapy</b> as a salvage treatment resulted in high local tumor control rates in recurrent uveal melanoma, especially if the primary therapy was transpupillary thermotherapy or plaque brachytherapy. Preservation of the globe was possible in most patients. Enucleations were indicated only in case of re recurrences of uveal melanoma, but not because of secondary complications like intractable pain or secondary glaucoma.
