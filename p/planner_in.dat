40|$|Abstract — This paper {{extends the}} concept of “probabilistic {{completeness}} ” defined for motion <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> state space (or configuration space) to {{the concept of}} “probabilistic complete-ness under uncertainty ” for motion <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> belief space. Accordingly, an approach is proposed to verify the probabilistic completeness of the sampling-based <b>planners</b> <b>in</b> belief space. Finally, through the proposed approach, it is shown that under mild conditions the sampling-based methods constructed based on the abstract framework of FIRM (Feedback-based Information Roadmap Method) are probabilistically complete under uncertainty.

5|$|Turley {{began working}} as a {{financial}} <b>planner</b> <b>in</b> 1957, by selling life insurance. He also operated a bowling alley in Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore.

25|$|I-278 {{was opened}} in {{pieces from the}} 1930s through the 1960s. Some of its {{completed}} segments predated the Interstate Highway System and are thus not up to standards, and portions of I-278 have been upgraded over the years. In New York, the various parts of I-278 were planned by Robert Moses, an urban <b>planner</b> <b>in</b> New York City. The segments proposed tore through many New York City neighborhoods, causing controversy. Despite its number, I-278 does not connect to I-78. There were once plans to extend I-278 west to I-78 east of the Route24 interchange in Springfield, New Jersey. This was canceled because of opposition from the communities along the route. The segment that does exist in New Jersey was opened in 1969. There were also plans to extend I-78 east across Manhattan and into Brooklyn via the Williamsburg Bridge; {{this would have been}} a second location where the two highways would have interchanged, but these plans were also thwarted.|$|E
