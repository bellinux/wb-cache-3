5|$|Rozrolimupab is a <b>polyclonal</b> {{antibody}}. Broken {{down into}} rozro-lim-u-pab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a human <b>polyclonal</b> antibody acting on the immune system. The suffix -pab shows it is a <b>polyclonal</b> antibody.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>polyclonal</b> {{response}} confers advantages on {{the immune}} system, in particular, greater probability of reacting against pathogens, it also increases chances of developing certain autoimmune diseases {{resulting from the}} reaction of the immune system against native molecules produced within the host.|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} are structurally identical immunoglobulin molecules with identical epitope-specificity (all of them bind {{with the}} same epitope with same affinity) as against their <b>polyclonal</b> counterparts which have varying affinities for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polyclonal</b> B cell {{response}} {{is a natural}} mode of immune response exhibited by the adaptive immune system of mammals. It ensures that a single antigen is recognized and attacked through its overlapping parts, called epitopes, by multiple clones of B cell.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains <b>polyclonal</b> antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of <b>polyclonal</b> antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. <b>Polyclonal</b> and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
5|$|Responses are <b>polyclonal</b> {{in nature}} as each clone {{somewhat}} specializes in producing antibodies against a given epitope, and because, each antigen contains multiple epitopes, {{each of which}} in turn can be recognized {{by more than one}} clone of B cells. To be able to react to innumerable antigens, as well as multiple constituent epitopes, the immune system requires the ability to recognize a very great number of epitopes in all, i.e., there should be a great diversity of B cell clones.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes <b>polyclonal</b> antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E
25|$|In {{immunostaining}} methods, an antibody is used {{to detect}} a specific protein epitope. These antibodies can be monoclonal or <b>polyclonal.</b> Detection of this first or primary antibody can be accomplished in multiple ways.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyclonal</b> equine {{intravenous}} antivenom {{is produced}} in Brazil, and no commercial product is available in North America. Results have been discouraging. Retrospective data are limited because they lack a definition of time to antivenom administration {{and its relation to}} outcome.|$|E
25|$|The innate {{system works}} with the {{adaptive}} immune system to mount a response against the DNA encoded protein. CpG-S sequences induce <b>polyclonal</b> B-cell activation and the upregulation of cytokine expression and secretion. Stimulated macrophages secrete IL-12, IL-18, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ, while stimulated B-cells secrete IL-6 and some IL-12.|$|E
25|$|Besides, {{measuring}} the methylation (inactivation) {{status of the}} polymorphic human androgen receptor (HUMARA) located on X-chromosome is considered the most accurate method to assess clonality in female cancer biopsies. A great variety of tumors was tested by this method, some, such as renal cell carcinoma, found monoclonal while others (e.g. mesothelioma) were reported <b>polyclonal.</b>|$|E
25|$|For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae and {{coxsackievirus}} B {{have been}} strongly correlated with ankylosing spondylitis and diabetes mellitus type 1, respectively. This has been {{explained by the}} tendency of the infecting organism to produce super-antigens {{that are capable of}} <b>polyclonal</b> activation of B-lymphocytes, and production of large amounts of antibodies of varying specificities, some of which may be self-reactive (see below).|$|E
25|$|By contrast, superantigens do {{not require}} {{processing}} by antigen-presenting cells but instead interact directly with the invariant region of the class II MHC molecule. In patients with TSS, up to 20% of the body's T-cells can be activated at one time. This <b>polyclonal</b> T-cell population causes a cytokine storm, followed by a multisystem disease. The toxin in S. aureus infections is TSS Toxin-1, or TSST-1. The TSST-1 is secreted as a single polypeptide chain.|$|E
25|$|T-Cell Bypass – A normal {{immune system}} {{requires}} the activation of B-cells by T-cells before the former can undergo differentiation into plasma B-cells and subsequently produce antibodies in large quantities. This requirement of a T-cell can be bypassed in rare instances, such as infection by organisms producing super-antigens, which {{are capable of}} initiating <b>polyclonal</b> activation of B-cells, or even of T-cells, by directly binding to the β-subunit of T-cell receptors in a non-specific fashion.|$|E
25|$|In both TSS (caused by S. aureus) and TSLS (caused by S. pyogenes), disease {{progression}} {{stems from a}} superantigen toxin that allows the nonspecific binding of MHC II with T-cell receptors, resulting in <b>polyclonal</b> T-cell activation. In typical T-cell recognition, an antigen is taken up by an antigen-presenting cell, processed, expressed on the cell surface in complex with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in a groove formed by the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC, and recognized by an antigen-specific T-cell receptor.|$|E
25|$|Superantigens (SAgs) are a {{class of}} antigens that cause {{non-specific}} activation of T-cells resulting in <b>polyclonal</b> T cell activation and massive cytokine release. SAgs are produced by some pathogenic viruses and bacteria most likely as a defense mechanism against the immune system. Compared to a normal antigen-induced T-cell response where 0.0001-0.001% of the body’s T-cells are activated, these SAgs are capable of activating up to 20% of the body’s T-cells. Furthermore, Anti-CD3 and Anti-CD28 Antibodies (CD28-SuperMAB) have also shown to be highly potent superantigens (and can activate up to 100% of T cells).|$|E
25|$|People with SLE have intense <b>polyclonal</b> B-cell activation, with a {{population}} shift towards immature B cells. Memory B cells with increased CD27+/IgD—are less susceptible to immunosuppression. CD27-/IgD- memory B cells are associated with increased disease activity and renal lupus. T cells, which regulate B-cell responses and infiltrate target tissues, have defects in signaling, adhesion, co-stimulation, gene transcription, and alternative splicing. The cytokines B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLys), interleukin 6, interleukin 17, interleukin 18, type I interferons, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) {{are involved in the}} inflammatory process and are potential therapeutic targets.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (mAb or moAb) are antibodies {{that are}} made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody). In contrast, <b>polyclonal</b> antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different plasma cell (antibody secreting immune cell) lineages. Bispecific monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one single monoclonal antibody to two epitopes.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the titres of {{specific}} antibodies raised by DNA vaccination {{are lower than}} those obtained after vaccination with a recombinant protein. However, DNA immunization-induced antibodies show greater affinity to native epitopes than recombinant protein-induced antibodies. In other words, DNA immunization induces a qualitatively superior response. Antibodies can be induced after one vaccination with DNA, whereas recombinant protein vaccinations generally require a boost. DNA immunization {{can be used to}} bias the TH profile of the immune response and thus the antibody isotype, which is not possible with either natural infection or recombinant protein immunization. Antibody responses generated by DNA are useful as a preparative tool. For example, <b>polyclonal</b> and monoclonal antibodies can be generated for use as reagents.|$|E
25|$|Staining and {{labeling}} {{techniques are}} often used in microscopy to help identify specific structures in a cell. Staining usually {{involves the use of}} dyes that are absorbed by various cell structures at different rates. Labeling involves the use of fluorescence to identify specific molecules. Fluorophores, fluorescent molecules, may be directly attached or attached to an antibody in order to detect a specific target. In the case of dendritic spikes, staining and labeling are used to identify and quantify the presence of certain voltage-gated channels. For example, rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> antibodies raised against synthetic peptide sequences have been used to identify the presence of Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 sodium channels in dendrites of the globus pallidus neuron.|$|E
25|$|Prediction and {{validation}} of the immunodominant epitope/s of HSP90 beta protein has been demonstrated using sera from infertile women having anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The decapeptide EP6 (380-389)is a major immunogenic epitope of HSP90 followed by EP1 (1-12) and EP8 (488-498). Knowledge of binding epitopes on the autoantigen is necessary to understand the subsequent pathologic events. Predicted 3D structures of these peptides demonstrated that they exist in the loop conformation, {{which is the most}} mobile part of the protein. Also, analysis of the sequences of HSP90 beta across several species reveals that EP6 peptide forms a part of a well-conserved motif. A <b>polyclonal</b> antibody generated to the immunodominant epitope- EP6 confirms similar biochemical and cellular immunoreactivity as seen with the patients' sera with anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic intervention.|$|E
500|$|Antiserum, a <b>polyclonal</b> {{antibody}} preparation used {{to treat}} envenomation ...|$|E
500|$|Antigens can {{be large}} and complex substances, and any single {{antibody}} can only bind to a small, specific {{area on the}} antigen. Consequently, an effective immune response often involves the production of many different antibodies by many different B cells against the same antigen. Hence the term [...] "polyclonal", which derives from the words poly, meaning many, and clones ("Klon"=Greek for sprout or twig); a clone {{is a group of}} cells arising from a common [...] "mother" [...] cell. The antibodies thus produced in a <b>polyclonal</b> response are known as <b>polyclonal</b> antibodies. [...] The [...] <b>polyclonal</b> antibodies are distinct from monoclonal antibody molecules, which are identical and react against a single epitope only, i.e., are more specific.|$|E
500|$|If an antigen can be {{recognized}} {{by more than one}} component of its structure, it is less likely to be [...] "missed" [...] by the immune system. Mutation of pathogenic organisms can result in modification of antigen—and, hence, epitope—structure. If the immune system [...] "remembers" [...] what the other epitopes look like, the antigen, and the organism, will still {{be recognized}} and subjected to the body's immune response. Thus, the <b>polyclonal</b> response widens the range of pathogens that can be recognized.|$|E
500|$|They {{are usually}} not {{produced}} in a natural immune response, but only in diseased states like multiple myeloma, or through specialized laboratory techniques. Because of their specificity, monoclonal antibodies are used in certain applications to quantify or detect the presence of substances (which act as antigen for the monoclonal antibodies), and for targeting individual cells (e.g. cancer cells). [...] Monoclonal antibodies find use in various diagnostic modalities (see: western blot and immunofluorescence) and therapies—particularly of cancer and diseases with autoimmune component. But, since virtually all responses in nature are <b>polyclonal,</b> it makes production of immensely useful monoclonal antibodies less straightforward.|$|E
500|$|Many viruses undergo {{frequent}} mutations {{that result}} in changes in amino acid composition of their important proteins. Epitopes located on the protein may also undergo alterations in the process. Such an altered epitope binds less strongly with the antibodies specific to the [...] unaltered epitope that would have stimulated the immune system. This is unfortunate because somatic hypermutation does give rise to clones capable of producing soluble antibodies that would have bound the altered epitope avidly enough to neutralize it. But these clones would consist of naive cells which {{are not allowed to}} proliferate by the weakly binding antibodies produced by the priorly stimulated clone. This doctrine is known as the original antigenic sin. This phenomenon comes into play particularly in immune responses against influenza, dengue and HIV viruses. This limitation, however, is not imposed by the phenomenon of <b>polyclonal</b> response, but rather, against it by an immune response that is biased in favor of experienced memory cells against the [...] "novice" [...] naive cells.|$|E
500|$|Memory and naïve B cells {{normally}} {{exist in}} relatively small numbers. [...] As the body {{needs to be}} able to respond to a large number of potential pathogens, it maintains a pool of B cells with a wide range of specificities. Consequently, while there is almost always at least one B (naive or memory) cell capable of responding to any given epitope (of all that the immune system can react against), there are very few exact duplicates. However, when a single B cell encounters an antigen to which it can bind, it can proliferate very rapidly. Such a group of cells with identical specificity towards the epitope is known as a clone, and is derived from a common [...] "mother" [...] cell. [...] All the [...] "daughter" [...] B cells match the original [...] "mother" [...] cell in their epitope specificity, and they secrete antibodies with identical paratopes. These antibodies are monoclonal antibodies, since they derive from clones of the same parent cell. A <b>polyclonal</b> response is one in which clones of multiple B cells react to the same antigen.|$|E
2500|$|Anti-XRCC4 {{antibodies}} include Alexa Fluor anti-XRCC4 mouse {{monoclonal antibody}} ab118008 (4H9), anti-XRCC4 rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> antibody ab157147 (N-terminal), and rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> anti-XRCC4 antibody ab145 (ChIP Grade) (all available from Abcam; Cambridge, MA, USA); phosphospecific antibodies to pS260 and pS318 in XRCC4, raised in sheep against the phosphopeptides: Ser260: SIISSLDVTD and Ser318: AENMSLETLR (phosphoserines underlined); and SAB2102728 (Sigma) anti-XRCC4 rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> antibody (available from Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA). [...] Antibodies to XRCC4 {{can have a}} variety of uses, including use in immunoassays to conduct research in areas such as DNA damage and repair, non-homologous end joining, transcription factors, epigenetics and nuclear signaling.|$|E
2500|$|Autoimmunity {{can thus}} be defined simply as {{exceptions}} to the tolerance [...] "rules." [...] By doing this, an immune response is generated against self-tissue and cells. These mechanisms are known {{by many to be}} intrinsic. However, there are pathogenic mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune disease. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity by <b>polyclonal</b> activation of B or T cells, or increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II molecules. There are several ways in which a pathogen can cause an autoimmune response. A pathogen may contain a protein that acts as a mitogen to encourage cell division, thus causing more B or T cell clones to be produced. Similarly, a pathogenic protein may act as a superantigen which causes rapid <b>polyclonal</b> activation of B or T cells. Pathogens can also cause the release of cytokines resulting in the activation of B or T cells, or they can alter macrophage function. Finally, pathogens may also expose B or T cells to cryptic determinants, which are self antigen determinants that have not been processed and presented sufficiently to tolerize the developing T cells in the thymus and are presented at the periphery where the infection occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Michael Gartler used X {{chromosome}} inactivation {{to demonstrate}} the clonal origin of cancers. [...] Examining normal tissues and tumors from females heterozygous for isoenzymes of the sex-linked G6PD gene demonstrated that tumor cells from such individuals express only one form of G6PD, whereas normal tissues are composed of a nearly equal mixture of cells expressing the two different phenotypes. [...] This pattern suggests that a single cell, and not a population, grows into a cancer. However, this pattern has been proven wrong for many cancer types, suggesting that some cancers may be <b>polyclonal</b> in origin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} seen as a metaphor in many disciplines, being pressed into service as an analogy in fields well beyond the traditional. In physics, it has been seen as an analogy for the wave–particle duality. In biology, the way the blind men hold onto {{different}} parts of the elephant has been seen as a good analogy for the <b>Polyclonal</b> B cell response.The fable is {{one of a number of}} tales that cast light on the response of hearers or readers to the story itself. Idries Shah has commented on this element of self-reference in the many interpretations of the story, and its function as a teaching story: ...|$|E
2500|$|Manipulation of CpG-S and CpG-N {{sequences}} in the plasmid {{backbone of}} DNA vaccines can ensure {{the success of}} the immune response to the encoded antigen and drive the immune response toward a TH1 phenotype. This is useful if a pathogen requires a TH response for protection. CpG-S sequences have also been used as external adjuvants for both DNA and recombinant protein vaccination with variable success rates. Other organisms with hypomethylated CpG motifs have demonstrated the stimulation of <b>polyclonal</b> B-cell expansion. [...] The mechanism behind this may be more complicated than simple methylation – hypomethylated murine DNA has not been found to mount an immune response.|$|E
5000|$|Rozrolimupab is a <b>polyclonal</b> {{antibody}}. Broken {{down into}} rozro-lim-u-pab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a human <b>polyclonal</b> antibody acting on the immune system. The suffix -pab shows it is a <b>polyclonal</b> antibody.|$|E
50|$|Persistent <b>polyclonal</b> B-cell {{lymphocytosis}} (PPBL) is {{an anomaly}} {{of the human}} immune system characterized by mildly elevated levels of white blood cells (called leukocytosis), chronic, stable absolute <b>polyclonal</b> B-cell lymphocytosis, elevated <b>polyclonal</b> IgM and binucleated cells.|$|E
50|$|Rheumatoid factor {{can also}} be a {{cryoglobulin}} (antibody that precipitates on cooling of a blood sample); it can be either type 2 (monoclonal IgM to <b>polyclonal</b> IgG) or type 3 (<b>polyclonal</b> IgM to <b>polyclonal</b> IgG) cryoglobulin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polyclonal</b> Gammopathy - A [...] "swell-like" [...] {{elevation}} in the gamma zone {{indicates a}} <b>polyclonal</b> gammopathy, which typically indicates a non-neoplastic condition (although is not exclusive to non-neoplastic conditions).
