25|$|The name {{silicosis}} (from the Latin silex, or flint) {{was originally}} used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), prosector in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances {{in the lungs}} of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer</b> drill was introduced in 1897 and sandblasting was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of silicosis.|$|E

In 1902 a Mr Noden, employed as a riveter, had an accident at work which resulted in the amputation of a finger. He resumed work at the company in 1903 as a caulker, which involved using a light hammer, but in 1910 was instructed to use a heavy <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer.</b> The vibration from this heavier hammer caused his hand to become inflamed and he sought compensation, based on his injury of 1902. A lower court awarded him this compensation but the judgment was overturned on appeal by the Law Lords, who directed that {{there was no evidence that}} the 1902 accident was a contributory cause of his injury of 1910 and that, in any event, the latter incident was not actually an accident at all and therefore there was no entitlement to compensation under the terms of the 1897 Workmen's Compensation Act.|$|E
2500|$|A jackhammer, {{also known}} as a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer,</b> is a {{portable}} percussive drill powered by compressed air. It is used to drill rock and break up concrete pavement, among other applications. It jabs with its bit, not rotating it. A jackhammer operates by driving an internal hammer up and down. The hammer is first driven down to strike the back of the bit and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle. The bit usually recovers from the stroke by means of a spring. The earliest form of a jackhammer, a [...] "percussion drill" [...] was invented in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model.|$|E
40|$|Cooling during {{drilling}} Kirschner wires is {{not always}} effective in preventing thermal related damage. In this study, we used a human in vitro model and compared temperature elevation, insertion time, and extraction force between three Kirschner wire insertion methods—drilling with and without irrigation and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammering.</b> Forty five Kirschner wires were inserted into 15 fresh human cadaver metacarpals. All three insertion methods were applied in each metacarpal. Drilling without irrigation resulted in a temperature elevation of 67. 25 [*]±[*] 5. 4 [*]ºC with significantly lower values for drilling with irrigation (4. 15 [*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]ºC) and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammering</b> (31. 52 [*]±[*] 3. 4 [*]ºC).

40|$|The {{annular space}} between bell and spigot joints for cast iron pipes {{installed}} between 1850 {{and the early}} 1960 s in North America was typically caulked with lead. Lead was caulked unto place using hand-held or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammers</b> and special chisels. Historical anecdotal evidence suggests that some bells may have cracked during caulking, especially if the jointer was over zealous in hammering the lead in place or used <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammers</b> with excessive pressure to produce a tight joint. This paper examines two mechanistic models, one linear and another non-linear, to estimate the levels of hoop stress induced in the bell {{as a consequence of}} lead caulking. Illustrative analyses of lead caulking joints in 16 " and 48 " diameter pipes show that the linear model tends to predict unrealistic high stresses while the non-linear model produced more realistic stresses.

50|$|An English {{wheel is}} a better tool for a skilled {{craftsman}} for low-crown applications than manually hammering. Planishing manually using dollies and slapper files or planishing hammer, after hammer forming is very labour-intensive. Using a pear shaped mallet and sandbag to stretch the sheet metal (sinking), or by raising on a stake, speeds up the fabrication of higher crown sections. A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer</b> or power hammer is faster still. The English wheel is very effective when used for planishing, (for which it was originally patented in England), to a smooth final finish after these processes.|$|E
40|$|When bending {{sharp and}} Jagged edges of {{materials}} and riveting different components of the cars structures, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammers</b> generate noise and vibration. The severity of the noise as a potential operator hazard {{should be considered in}} light of the following data. The noise produced by the six studied hammers is impact noise with more than 20 impulses per second. The average peak pressure level is 131. 9 dB with the standard deviation of 2. 1 dB. The equivalent level during a shift work, 8 hours per day, is 114 dB. Hand-arm vibration has also been measured in each applicable direction (x,y,z). The Z direction is the principal direction that vibration enters the hand. The average effective acceleration is 23. 5 m/s 2 and the standard deviation is 15. 2 m/s 2. The total exposure time during a shift is about 6 - 30 minutes which intermittently included 30 - 60 seconds. The measured levels correlate with operator exposures exceeding the allowable exposure time and the permissible values.

5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The rivet warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs to remove individual rivets and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The catcher (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy rivet set or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the round head of the rivet, while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a <b>hammer</b> or <b>pneumatic</b> rivet <b>hammer</b> to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter sunk hole.

40|$|In the {{limestone}} quarries of Indiana, USA, <b>pneumatic</b> percussive <b>hammers</b> replaced the mallet and hammer around 1900. By 1917 the air hammer {{was being used}} exclusively for periods of eight to ten hours a shift. In 1918 Alice Hamilton investigated an unusual "disease" in these stonecutters of Bedford, Indiana, who complained of "attacks of numbness and blanching of the fingers coming on suddenly {{under the influence of}} cold and then disappearing. " The prevalence of vibration induced white finger (VWF) found in this population of 38 stonecutters was 89 %, with decreased light touch, pain, and temperature appreciation in advanced cases. In 1978 a VWF research team revisited these limestone quarries. During the 60 year interval the stonecutting industry had contracted from 4000 workers in 40 quarries in 1918 to 3 - 400 in 10 quarries in 1978, with only 50 employees remaining in the Bedford area. In a population of 30 stonecutters the prevalence of VWF in 1978 was 80 %, with similar sensory loss in light touch, pain, and temperature appreciation. Between 1918 and 1978 no change had taken place {{in the design of the}} air hammers used for stonecutting. Vibration levels of 4859 metres/s 2 on the chisel, and 2010 metres/s 2 on the barrel were measured over a frequency range 6. 3 to 1000 Hz. The fundamental frequency was 75 Hz. These measured vibration levels are outside the ISO/DIS/ 5349 (1979) recommended limits for human exposure to vibration transmitted to the hand. The VWF data presented in this paper, and those originally reported by Hamilton in 1918, call for an immediate redesign of stonecutting <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammers</b> in order to remove one cause of Raynaud's phenomenon of occupational origin...|$|R

50|$|A rivet gun, {{also known}} as a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer,</b> is a type of tool used to drive rivets. The rivet gun is used on the {{manufactured}} head side of the rivet and a bucking bar is used on the buck-tail side of the rivet. The energy from the hammer in the rivet gun drives the work and the rivet against the inertia of the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the rivet is deformed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the rivet head and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all rivet guns are pneumatically powered. Those rivet guns used to drive rivets in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A rivet gun differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Body {{reactions}} during {{chain saw}} work were studied in 14 subjects. The subjects {{divided into three}} groups (control, sulpiride, and propranolol) successively cut down logs with a chain saw for seven minutes. The start of the sawing led to a pronounced increase in heart rate which persisted during the sawing. The groups taking sulpiride and propranolol showed a smaller increase in heart rate compared with the controls. Hormonal values (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, adrenaline (Ad), noradrenaline (NA), and dopamine) were increased by the operation. A com-parison of these values {{before and after the}} operation showed that the increase of cortisol, Ad, and NA values was highest in the controls, intermediate in the propranolol group, and lowest in the sulpiride group. The increase in ACTH, however, was greatest in the sulpiride group, intermediate in the controls and correct in the propranolol group. These findings provide some evidence that chain saw work may have an influence on the whole body, including the hypothalamus and the limbic lobe of the brain. The habitual use of vibrating tools such as chain saws, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammers,</b> or electric hammers has resulted in injury to the peripheral blood vessels and nerves...|$|R
