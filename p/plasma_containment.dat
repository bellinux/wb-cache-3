40|$|Pulsed {{inductive}} plasma thrusters [1 - 3] are spacecraft propulsion {{devices in}} which electrical energy is capacitively stored and then discharged through an inductive coil. The thruster is electrodeless, with a time-varying current in the coil interacting with a plasma covering {{the face of}} the coil to induce a plasma current. Propellant is accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity (O(10 - 100 km/s)) by the Lorentz body force arising from the interaction of the magnetic field and the induced plasma current. While this class of thruster mitigates the life-limiting issues associated with electrode erosion, pulsed inductive plasma thrusters can su er from both high pulse energy requirements imposed by the voltage demands of inductive propellant ionization, and low propellant utilization efficiencies. The Microwave Assisted Discharge Inductive Plasma Accelerator (MAD-IPA) [4], shown in Fig. 1 is a pulsed inductive plasma thruster that is able to operate at lower pulse energies by partially ionizing propellant with an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) discharge inside a conical inductive coil whose geometry serves to potentially increase propellant and <b>plasma</b> plume <b>containment</b> relative to at coil geometries.

Sanderson [3] has pointed out that a further contribution to this shift may arise from radiative corrections. Although, even for the most intense, focussed laser beams presently available, the frequency shift is very small it is not beyond the bounds of possible experimental observation. Consequently, there is much current interest [4 - 61 in the experimental verification of the theoretical predictions. A very serious difficulty [7] in any experiment is that the thermal drifts of the electrons carry them out of the beam before significant interaction has taken place.

40|$|The {{results of}} a study of non-thermal Carbon and Fluorine plasmas in an {{electromagnetic}} acceleration device are presented, the plasmas being created by ablation {{from the surface of}} a solid dielectric. The dielectric is close to a steady discharge through which ablated material, on entry, is heated and accelerated, and it is concluded that the high level of radiative power loss, which consists mainly of optically thick resonance line radiation, is in part responsible for the uniformity and stability of the plasma plume. Plasma velocities around 1 - 2 x 10 6 cm/s. are attained. In addition to conventional electrical and spectroscopic diagnostic methods, several new spectroscopic techniques are described, providing greater accuracy in the measurement of particle temperatures and densities in non-thermal, non-hydrogenic plasmas. In order to make these methods possible, as well as allowing estimates of the radiation losses, a model describing the papulation distribution among the bound ionic states was constructed and solved {{for a wide range of}} plasma conditions. From these results new values of collisional-radiative ionization and recombination coefficients are obtained, which are in broad agreement with experimental values. A model was developed which described the rate of ablation from the solid and which formed part of a larger numerical scheme for calculating the temperature, density and velocity of the plasma plume. This model gives results which are in good agreement with the observations and is used to predict the plasma behaviour under different operating conditions and with different dielectric materials.

High-performance mathematical software libraries developed through this program have contributed as much or more to the performance of modern scientific computer codes as the high-performance computers on which these codes run. The combination of these mathematical advances and the resulting software has enabled high-performance computers to be used for scientific discovery in ways that could only be imagined at the program's inception. Our nation, and indeed our world, face great challenges that must be addressed in coming years, and many of these will be addressed through the development of scientific understanding and engineering advances yet to be discovered. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) will play an essential role in providing science-based solutions to many of these problems, particularly those that involve the energy, environmental and national security needs of the country. As the capability of high-performance computers continues to increase, the types of questions that can be answered by applying this huge computational power become more varied and more complex. It will be essential that we find new ways to develop and apply the mathematics necessary to enable the new scientific and engineering discoveries that are needed. In August 2007, a panel of experts in applied, computational and statistical mathematics met for {{a day and a half}} in Berkeley, California to understand the mathematical developments required to meet the future science and engineering needs of the DOE. It is important to emphasize that the panelists were not asked to speculate only on advances that might be made in their own research specialties. Instead, the guidance this panel was given was to consider the broad science and engineering challenges that the DOE faces and identify the corresponding advances that must occur across the field of mathematics for these challenges to be successfully addressed. As preparation for the meeting, each panelist was asked to review strategic planning and other informational documents available for one or more of the DOE Program Offices, including the Offices of Science, Nuclear Energy, Fossil Energy, Environmental Management, Legacy Management, Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, Electricity Delivery & Energy Reliability and Civilian Radioactive Waste Management as well as the National Nuclear Security Administration. The panelists reported on science and engineering needs for each of these offices, and then discussed and identified mathematical advances that will be required if these challenges are to be met. A review of DOE challenges in energy, the environment and national security brings to light a broad and varied array of questions that the DOE must answer in the coming years. A representative subset of such questions includes: (1) Can we predict the operating characteristics of a clean coal power plant? (2) How stable is the <b>plasma</b> <b>containment</b> in a tokamak? (3) How quickly is climate change occurring and what are the uncertainties in the predicted time scales? (4) How quickly can an introduced bio-weapon contaminate the agricultural environment in the US? (5) How do we modify models of the atmosphere and clouds to incorporate newly collected data of possibly of new types? (6) How quickly can the United States recover if part of the power grid became inoperable? (7) What are optimal locations and communication protocols for sensing devices in a remote-sensing network? (8) How can new materials be designed with a specified desirable set of properties? In comparing and contrasting these and other questions of importance to DOE, the panel found that while the scientific breadth of the requirements is enormous, a central theme emerges: Scientists are being asked to identify or provide technology, or to give expert analysis to inform policy-makers that requires the scientific understanding of increasingly complex physical and engineered systems. In addition, as the complexity of the systems of interest increases, neither experimental observation nor mathematical and computational modeling alone can access all components of the system over the entire range of scales or conditions needed to provide the required scientific understanding...|$|E
