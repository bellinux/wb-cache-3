In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change must be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss {{the building of a}} new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose the other <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion.</b> Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the consultation between Kerr, Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and the British Parliament were not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion.</b> Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen in 1975, Sir William Heseltine, who along with Charteris informed her of the dismissal, has maintained that it came as a surprise to all three of them; that he considered Kerr's actions imprudent; and that he believed that this opinion was shared by Charteris. A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion, and that disillusionment with Kerr's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation. The Queen's opinion is unknown, but Heseltine has stated: [...] "I think she is an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine what she felt, I think she felt the same ... I’m reasonably confident myself that she thought it could have been handled better.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Through {{the years}} some Israeli-Arab {{politicians}} have requested a reevaluation of the Israeli flag and Israeli national anthem, arguing that they cannot represent all citizens of Israel, including the Arab citizens of Israel.

Scaliger's discussion also contains the first known attestation of the name [...] "san pi" [...] (sampi) in the western literature, and the first attempt at explaining it. The passage in question is a scholion on two rare words occurring in the comedies of Aristophanes, koppatias (...) and samphoras (...) [...] Both were names for certain breeds of horses, and both were evidently named after the letter used as a branding mark on each: [...] "koppa" [...] and [...] "san" [...] respectively. After explaining this, the anonymous scholiast adds a digression that appears to be meant to further explain the name and function of [...] "san", drawing some kind of link between it and the numeral sign of 900.

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] [...] Copyright Elsevier B. V. This paper {{addresses}} various issues involved in sub-band based text-dependent speaker verification. <b>The</b> first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> {{is concerned with the}} classification methods. An important issue addressed in this <b>part</b> is <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> a set of weights which emphasises the sub-bands that are specific to the target speaker while de-emphasising or removing the contaminated ones. In particular, techniques for determining these weights dynamically according to <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> contamination in <b>the</b> sub-bands are described. Furthermore, <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> these methods is experimentally analysed through a set <b>of</b> comparative studies. <b>The</b> second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> focuses on <b>the</b> feature extraction process. Analytically, it is shown that for a sub-band system <b>of</b> S bands, <b>the</b> cepstral coefficients with <b>the</b> quefrency <b>of</b> p have a strong linear relationship to the (S??p) th full-band cepstral parameter. With <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> a set of experimental results, it is demonstrated that this means the conventional classification methods adapted to work with sub-band cepstral parameters {{may not be able to}} capture all the useful spectral information contained in the full-band cepstral parameters. In order to tackle this problem, two methods are described and their relative effectiveness is experimentally examined. The experimental investigations also include an examination of speaker discrimination abilities of different sub-bands and an analysis of different possible recombination levels...|$|R
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} human-Jesus is {{a central}} piece in {{analyzing}} Pilgrim's eventual struggle with fate and free will. By establishing a Christian figure that is not initially divine in nature sets a completely different tone to the overall understanding of humanity's placement with God. In David Vanderwerken's piece [...] "Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five at Forty: Billy Pilgrim - Even More a Man of Our Time," [...] Vanderwerken states that the narrator may be calling for a [...] "humanly centered Christianity in which Jesus is a ‘nobody’ (94), a ‘bum’ (95), a man."What Vonnegut suggests here is that Christ’s divinity {{stands in the way}} of charity. If the [...] "bum" [...] is Everyman, then we are all adopted children of God; we are all Christs and should treat each other accordingly. If Jesus is human, then He is imperfect and must necessarily be involved in direct or indirect evil. This Jesus participates fully in the human condition.There is some question of Christ’s divinity and how that plays a part in Christian principles and it is suggested that the voice in the novel desires a form of collectivism where humanity looks at one another as equal parts and equal heirs of God. This human-Jesus argument within the novel stands as an effort to make humanity, whom Trout may consider to be [...] "bums" [...] and [...] "nobodies," [...] have more importance.The narration's call for a more human-Jesus and Christianity is seen in the last <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> on Trout’s novel where God speaks from heaven stating, [...] "From this moment on, He [...] will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has not connections!" [...] Trout’s novel attempts to make everybody somebody, as well as to emphasize the supposed cruelty of original Christian thinking, and how it ought to be changed.|$|E
