2500|$|Microphones {{containing}} active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require {{power to}} operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical {{to use the same}} cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as [...] or T-power and DIN 45596 for phantom power. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, [...] "plug-in power" [...] is more common, for microphones using a 3.5mm phone <b>plug</b> <b>connector.</b> Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.|$|E

5000|$|Modern phone {{connectors}} {{are available}} in three standard sizes. The original [...] in (6.35 mm) version dates from 1878, when it was used for manual telephone exchanges, making it the oldest electrical connector standard still in use, to this day being the most prominent <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> on mainstream musical equipment, especially on standard electric guitars models.|$|E

50|$|Barrel <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{commonly}} used to interface the secondary side of a power supply with the device. Some of these jacks contain a normally closed switch; the switch can disconnect internal batteries whenever the external power supply is connected.|$|R
5000|$|IEC 60320-1 {{defines a}} cord set as an [...] "assembly {{consisting}} of one cable or cord fitted with one plug and one connector, {{intended for the}} connection of an electrical appliance or equipment to the electrical supply". It also defines an interconnection cord set as an [...] "assembly consisting of one cable or cord fitted with one <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> and one connector, intended for the interconnection between two electrical appliances".|$|E
50|$|Cables with a C13 {{connector}} {{at one end}} and a type E <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> at {{the other}} are commonly available. They have a variety of common uses including connecting power between older PCs and their monitors, extending existing power cords, connecting to type F outlets strips (commonly used with rack-mount gear to save space and for international standardization) and connecting computer equipment to the output of a uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Type J outlets are used in a similar way.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Base" [...] Camera Link {{configuration}} carries signals over {{a single}} connector/cable. The cable used is a MDR ("Mini D Ribbon") 26-pin Male <b>Plug</b> <b>Connector,</b> optimized by 3M for the LVDS signal. In {{addition to the}} 5 LVDS pairs transmitting the serialized video data (24 bits of data and 4 framing/enable bits), the connector also carries 4 LVDS discrete control signals and 2 LVDS asynchronous serial communication channels for communicating with the camera. At the maximum chipset operating frequency (85 MHz), the base configuration yields a video data throughput of 2.04 Gbit/s (255 MB/s).|$|E

50|$|SMC (SubMiniature version C) {{connectors}} are coaxial RF connectors {{developed in}} the 1960s. They use a #10-32 UNF threaded interface (screw type). They offer excellent electrical performance from DC to 10 GHz. Female (a.k.a. <b>plug)</b> SMC <b>connectors</b> have a socket for the center contact, and male (a.k.a. jack) SMC connectors have a pin for the center contact. SMC jack connectors have an external thread while SMC <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> have the mating hex nut. Available in 50-Ohm and 75-Ohm characteristic impedance, they provide an interconnect means for small form factor coaxial cables (e.g. 50-Ohm RG-174, 75-Ohm RG-179) and printed circuit boards where small footprint is important.|$|R
50|$|Polybutylene {{terephthalate}} is {{used for}} housings in electrical engineering, but also in automotive construction as <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> and in households for example in showerheads or irons. It is also found processed into fibers in toothbrushes, false eyelashes and {{is used in the}} keycaps of some high end computer keyboards because the texture is highly resistant to wear and discoloration due to UV radiation.|$|R
5000|$|A casual {{glance at}} a USB [...] "Type A" [...] <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> may give the false {{impression}} that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB [...] "Type A" [...] cables with each other reveals {{the fact that the}} connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical graph theory, USB buses are directed trees, whereas FireWire buses have a true bus network topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.|$|E
50|$|Opto-isolator sensors are {{completely}} encased to prevent ingress {{from the outside}} environment. The only exposed parts are a sealed <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> and a drive fork, which {{is attached to a}} slotted disk internally through a bearing and seal. The slotted disk is typically sandwiched between two circuit boards containing a photo-diode, photo-transistor, amplifier, and filtering circuits which produce a square wave pulse train output customized to the customers voltage and pulses per revolution requirements. These types of sensors typically provide 2 to 8 independent channels of output that can be sampled by other systems in the vehicle such as automatic train control systems and propulsion/braking controllers.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{ambiguous}} situation arises {{with the}} connectors used for USB, FireWire (IEEE-1394), HDMI, and Thunderbolt serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors {{reveals that the}} contact [...] "pins" [...] are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> {{as if it were}} a connector pin. By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are [...] "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are [...] "female jacks".|$|E
50|$|Increasing use of {{photovoltaic}} systems {{and integration of}} photovoltaic power into existing structures and techniques of supply and distribution increases the value of general standards and definitions for photovoltaic components and systems. The standards are compiled at the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and apply to efficiency, durability and safety of cells, modules, simulation programs, <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> and cables, mounting systems, overall efficiency of inverters etc.|$|R
5000|$|The 8P8C modular plugs and jacks {{look very}} similar to the plugs and jacks used for FCC's {{registered}} jack RJ45 variants, although the specified RJ45 socket is not compatible with 8P8C modular <b>plug</b> <b>connectors.</b> It neither uses all eight conductors (but only two of them for wires plus two for connecting a programming resistor) nor does it fit into 8P8C because the true RJ45 is [...] "keyed".|$|R
50|$|Polycyclohexylenedimethylene {{terephthalate}} {{has good}} dimensional stability at excess temperatures (short-term up to 493 °F (256 °C)) making this material suitable for injection molding of thin-walled parts. PCT {{is used for}} electronics components like <b>plug</b> <b>connectors.</b> PCT is also processed into filaments, fibers, and fabrics {{that are used in}} industry as filters. The color stability and lower density are of advantage in other applications, especially in the LED reflector application.|$|R
50|$|The PICMG {{subcommittee}} {{drafting the}} standard {{has proposed a}} new, denser backplane connector type with a 2 mm x 1.4 mm pitch that supports higher transfer rates of up to 12 Gbit/s without a need for bridges or switches. It offers up to 184 pin pairs on a 3U board.A major difference compared to CompactPCI is that with CompactPCI Serial the <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> is on the board, while the receptacle is on the backplane. This approach is intended to make the standard more robust by avoiding twisted pins on the backplane: If a pin fails, only the plug-in board must be exchanged.The system slot of CompactPCI Serial has six connectors: P1 to P6.On peripheral boards only P1 is mandatory, while P2 to P6 are optional.|$|E
5000|$|IEC 60320-3: Standard {{sheets and}} gauges. [...] This part {{includes}} the standard sheets for both appliance couplers and interconnection couplers. For appliance couplers the various coupler outlines are designated {{using a combination}} of letters and numbers, e.g., [...] "C14". The female part connector supplies power to the male appliance inlet. The male part is designated by the even number one greater than the number assigned to the female part, so a C1 connector mates with a C2 inlet, and a C15A mates with a C16A. Interconnection couplers have single letter designators, e.g., [...] "F". They consist of two parts: a <b>plug</b> <b>connector,</b> which is the part integral with, or intended to be attached to, the cord, and an appliance outlet, which is the part integrated or incorporated in the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it, and from which the supply is obtained.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the rear}} of the machine the most obvious change was a three-prong AC <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> and power switch where the voltage {{converter}} had once been, an Apple security port at the far left corner, and the standardization of the serial port connectors (changed from DIN-5 to mini DIN-8, but still providing an identical signal). All the same built-in Apple II peripheral equivalents and port functionality of the IIc remained, with the one exception being the floppy port. Whereas the previous IIc could only support one external 5.25-inch floppy drive and (in later models) [...] "intelligent" [...] storage devices such as the UniDisk 3.5, the Apple IIc Plus offered backwards port compatibility and more. Support for the external Apple 3.5 Drive used by the Apple IIGS and Macintosh was now present, and up to two external 5.25-inch floppy drives could be added as well.|$|E
50|$|Special modular plugs {{have been}} {{manufactured}} (for example, the Siemon UP-2468) which have extra slots beyond their standard contacts, {{to accommodate the}} wider jack's outermost contacts without damage. These special <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> can be visually identified by carefully looking for the extra slots molded into the plug. The molded plastic bodies of the special plugs may also be colored with a light blueish tinge, to aid in quick recognition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coupling}} system is usually made of two bayonet ramps machined on the external {{side of the}} receptacle connector and 2 stainless steel studs mounted inside the <b>plug</b> <b>connector’s</b> coupling nut. Several classes of electrical cable connectors, including audio, video, and data cables use bayonet connectors. Examples include BNC, C, and ST connectors. (The BNC connector is not exactly as described in this article, as the male, not female, connector has the slots and spring.) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>connectors</b> {{that are}} not made by MC but can may be mated with MC {{elements}} and are sometimes also described by their manufacturers as [...] "MC compatible", do NOT conform to the requirements for a safe electrical connection with long term stability and for safety reasons may not be plugged together with MC elements. MC therefore accept no liability if these connectors which are not approved by MC are mated with MC elements.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the aircraft onboard cables design made by the authors has shown that it is most expedient to reduce {{the weight of the}} bonding of electrical connectors through replacing a molded housing of the <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> by a lightweight one, while keeping to the requirements of shielding the cable bonding assembly from radio interference. 0. 15 ÷ 0. 2 mm thick aluminum foil was chosen as a material for the tubular lightweight housing. To obtain lightweight tubular products for space engineering it was suggested to use magnetic impulse welding-forming (MIWF), which applies integrated force and thermal action on the workpiece. We described the physical nature of MIWF process and defined the ranges of energy parameters affecting the quality of welded joints: operating voltage of the battery charge of capacitors, capacity of the equipment storage unit, inductance of the working tool - inductor - characterized by a number of turns. The combination of these parameters determines the energy and the duration of the action to the workpiece. The results of the experimental studies are provided. The industrial technology has been developed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of data presentation formats on technician performance when maintenance procedures are presented on a monocular, head-mounted display (HMD). The maintenance task was a continuity check performed by identifying, selecting, and testing pairs of cannon <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> pins. Two formats were used to present ask procedure information to the subject: a format hat mimicked the standard technical procedure manual, including the textual and graphical characteristics; a format which provided the same information as the first, while adding visual cues to the graphical portion of the technical information. Two types of cannon plugs were used: ‘few-pin ’ plugs (12 and 13 pins) and ‘many-pm ’ plugs (55 and 79 pins). United States Air Force (USAF) avionics maintenance t chnicians tationed atBarksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana served as subjects. Dependent measures were: task completion time, task error rate, and subjective reports on the usability of the information presentation structure and the HMD.
