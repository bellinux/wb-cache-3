25|$|Ingo Haar who is {{currently}} {{on the faculty of}} the University of Vienna said on 14 November 2006 in Deutschlandfunk that about 500,000 to 600,000 victims are realistic, based on a German governmental studies initiated in the 1960s. Haar said these numbers were compiled from actually reported deaths, while higher figures of about two million deaths were estimated with the <b>population</b> <b>balance</b> method in a German governmental study of 1958. Haar said the higher estimates must be seen in the historical context of the 1950s, when the government of West Germany needed high numbers for political reasons. During the Cold War West Germany wanted to revert to prewar borders in Central Europe. Military historian Rüdiger Overmans said on 6 December 2006 in Deutschlandfunk that only the about 500,000 registered deaths could be counted, and that the unaccounted cases calculated with the <b>population</b> <b>balance</b> method need be confirmed by further research. However, on 29 November 2006 State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Christoph Bergner, reaffirmed the position of the German government that 2 million civilians perished in the flight and expulsion from Central and Eastern Europe. The German Red Cross in 2005 maintained that death toll in the expulsions is 2,251,500 persons.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{accurate}} records listing confirmed deaths, {{estimates of}} German population transfers from 1945–1950 and associated deaths depended upon a <b>population</b> <b>balance</b> methodology. West German government official figures derived during the 1950s using the <b>population</b> <b>balance</b> method put the death toll at about 2 million. Recently some German historians believe the death toll is closer to 500,000 based on recently disclosed documentation that listed only confirmed deaths. The wide range of estimates stems from a number of factors. First, the ethnic German population in 1939 was by no means certain because bilingual persons were of dubious German ethnic identity. Second, Civilian losses were overstated because German military casualties in 1945 were poorly documented. Third, After the war it was difficult to gather reliable population data; post war census data in Central and Eastern Europe did not breakout the ethnic German population and during the Cold War {{there was a lack of}} cooperation between West Germany and communist bloc countries in the effort to locate persons reported missing. Persons reported missing may have been living in Eastern Europe after having been assimilated into the local population. Estimates of total populations expelled and deaths often include figures from the evacuation, because these people were not allowed to return, thus making it difficult to arrive at an accurate and undisputed estimate of population movements and deaths due solely to the expulsions. Some of the differences may arise from political bias, as the expulsion of Germans was widely utilized as political weapon during the Cold War.|$|E

40|$|Gas {{dispersion}} in {{stirred vessels}} {{has been investigated}} numerically. In {{order to make the}} fiow tractable for simulations, various modelling assumptions have to be made. Starting point is a liquid flow field from a steady-state k-e simulation of the flow in the vessel. The action of the impeller is mimicked by imposing measured velocity data at the impeller tip. In the tank, bubbles are released in a Eulerian manner. To keep track of the bubble size distribution in the tank, <b>population</b> <b>balances</b> containing break-up and coalescence terms are solved The bubbles are considered to only alter the liquid flow turbulence, not the average velocity field, i. e. the flow is assumed one-way coupled. In the course of the project, the formulation and implementation of the <b>population</b> <b>balances</b> have been improved significanfly. Computational results relate to local gas fractions, bubble size distributions, and the transition to flooding, where the code proved to be able to predict trends correctly.

25|$|Humans {{were already}} reliant on {{domestic}} {{plants and animals}} when they imagined the domestic versions of wild animals. Although horses, donkeys, and Old World camels were sometimes hunted as prey species, they were each deliberately brought into the human niche for sources of transport. Domestication was still a multi-generational adaptation to human selection pressures, including tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved. For example, {{despite the fact that}} hunters of the Near Eastern gazelle in the Epipaleolithic avoided culling reproductive females to promote <b>population</b> <b>balance,</b> neither gazelles nor zebras possessed the necessary prerequisites and were never domesticated. There is no clear evidence for the domestication of any herded prey animal originating in Africa.|$|E

The calculation of Yugoslav losses {{is not an}} exact accounting listing of the dead, but is based on demographic calculations of the <b>population</b> <b>balance</b> which estimate births {{during the war and}} natural deaths.

500|$|Along {{with other}} territories {{inhabited}} by Ukrainians, the Donbass {{was incorporated into}} the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic {{in the aftermath of}} the 1917–22 Russian Civil War. Ukrainians in the Donbass were greatly affected by the 1932–33 Holodomor famine and the Russification policy of Joseph Stalin. As most ethnic Ukrainians were rural peasant farmers (called [...] "kulaks" [...] by the Soviet regime), they bore the brunt of the famine. According to the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, the population of the area that is now Luhansk Oblast declined by 25% as a result of the famine, whereas it declined by 15–20% in the area that is now Donetsk Oblast. According to one estimate, 81.3% of those who died during the famine in the Ukrainian SSR were ethnic Ukrainians, whilst only 4.5% were ethnic Russians. During the reconstruction of the Donbass after the Second World War, large amounts of Russian workers arrived to repopulate the region, further altering the <b>population</b> <b>balance.</b> In 1926, 639,000 ethnic Russians resided in the Donbass. By 1959, the ethnic Russian population had more than doubled to 2.55 million. Russification was further advanced by the 1958–59 Soviet educational reforms, which led to the nigh elimination of all Ukrainian language schooling in the Donbass. By the time of the Soviet Census of 1989, 45% of the population of the Donbass reported their ethnicity as Russian.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, product design has gained {{increasing}} importance, {{due to the fact}} that solid products have to meet an ever larger number of demands. Crystallization processes differ from other processes where materials have merely to be separated from each other in the way that not only separation is required but also the final shape of the solid particles is significant. Crystals often have to be produced with high purity, specific mean diameter and narrow particle size distribution, spherical shape and specific internal structure. For the production of nanoparticles, agglomeration of primary nuclei is very important. In order to give a more detailed description of particle formation processes, <b>population</b> <b>balances</b> have to be solved. They are the mathematical tool to calculate crystal size distributions as a function of space and time. At given process parameters, the particle size distribution and other important characteristics of a solid product may be calculated. Alternatively, optimized process parameters for meeting specific demands put on the single solid product (almost dustless powders, high filtrability) may be found. This contribution outlines the theory of <b>population</b> <b>balances.</b> Three mathematical methods to solve such equations will be presented, and, finally, the application of population-balances for product design will be discussed for crystallization processes in disperse phases...|$|R
