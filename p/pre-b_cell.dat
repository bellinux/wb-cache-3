The molecular events that mediate the transition from cycling pre-B to small, resting pre-B have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that interferon regulatory factors 4 and 8 (IRF 4, 8) suppress surrogate light chain expression and down-regulate pre-BCR in <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells.</b> Our studies further reveal that IRF 4, 8 induce the expression of Ikaros and Aiolos in <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells,</b> and reconstitution of expression of either one is sufficient to suppress surrogate light chain expression and down-regulate pre-BCR in <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> lacking IRF 4, 8. Interestingly, our results also indicate that <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> undergo growth inhibition and cell-cycle arrest in the presence of IRF 4, 8.

5000|$|During the {{development}} of B cells, the immunoglobulin gene undergoes sequences of rearrangements that lead to formation of the antibody repertoire.

A large fraction of the CpGs differentially methylated in cancers are dynamically methylated during normal B cell differentiation.

50|$|X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} (XLA) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, {{it is much more}} common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells, which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor BCR. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent infections, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated bacteria. XLA is deemed to have a relatively low incidence of disease, with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000 male newborns. It has no ethnic predisposition. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody. Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.|$|E

Assuming that the L chain commitment is a random process, the low frequency of X producers could be attributable to the lower number of the variable region (V) genes of X chain (Vx) than that of V ~ (4). Recent studies on the L chain gene organization, however, suggest the existence of a more complicated process than the simple probabilistic process in L chain expression. In both human and mouse, it was shown that almost all ~ producers possess rearranged K genes, while a majority of K producers retained ~ genes unrearranged (5, 6). These findings led to a model postulating that rearrangement of ~, gene in <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> started only after nonproductive rearrangements in both ~ alleles (an ordered model of the L chain rearrangement). In this model, the frequency of B ceils bearing activated X gene depends primarily on the frequency of the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> that have committed the nonproductive rearrangements in both x alleles (the frequency of K-/K-). Since the frequency of K-/K- type <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> was recently suggested to be more than 25 % (7, 8), the frequency of ~, gene activation could be much higher than the frequency of ~,-bearing B cells in peripheral lymphoid organs.

In virtually all cases, B cell lineage ALL cells are arrested at the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> stage or before.

Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukemia carrying the t(9; 22) (q 34;q 11) translocation {{is defined by the}} constitutively active oncogenic tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL 1. In addition, in > 80 % of cases deletions of IKAROS gene are found in Ph+ ALL. We have recently shown that Ph+ ALL can also be defined by deficiency of a functional <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor.; During normal B cell development, <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor signaling first induces proliferation of the B cell precursors (large cycling pre-B cells, Fraction C’) and then causes cell cycle arrest at the time of Ig light chain gene rearrangement to initiate differentiation (small pre-B cells, Fraction D). Here we show that expression of µ chain (immunoglobulin heavy chain) in BCR-ABL 1 transformed cells or reconstitution of SLP 65 (a major adaptor protein in <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor signaling complex) in Slp 65 -/- BCR-ABL 1 cells induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.; Dissecting the mechanism of tumor suppression by the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor in BCR-ABL 1 ALL, we studied Stat 5 signaling, a central mediator of survival and proliferation downstream of the BCR-ABL 1 kinase. Forced expression of <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor or Ikaros resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of Stat 5 Y 694 and concomitant upregulation of BCL 6. Upregulation of BCL 6 is causally linked with <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor induced cell cycle arrest. By genome wide ChIP-on-chip analysis we observed direct recruitment of BCL 6 transcriptional repressor to promoters of MYC and CCND 2, two key mediators of cell cycle progression in Ph+ ALL. Forced expression of BCL 6 induced a cell cycle arrest in BCR-ABL 1 transformed ALL and in addition Bcl 6 -deficient BCR-ABL 1 transformed pre-B cells were more resistant than the Bcl 6 +/+ cells to the tumor suppression by the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor. Further overexpression of Myc could rescue the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor mediated cell cycle arrest.; In the process of studying how the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor results in dephosphorylation of Stat 5, we found Ikaros as key mediator. We have recently shown that <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor signaling leads to upregulation of Ikaros. In addition, reconstitution of Ikaros resulted in significant Stat 5 dephosphorylation and this event required the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor associated adapter molecule SLP 65. Further dominant negative Ikaros isoform IK 6 prevents the cell cycle arrest induced by the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor. As a consequence of Stat 5 dephosphorylation Ikaros indirectly resulted in Bcl 6 upregulation and subsequent cell cycle arrest.; BCR-ABL 1 driven ALL is defined by deletions of Ikaros and absence of a functional <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor. However the mechanism of this tumor suppression by Ikaros/pre-B cell receptor still remained elusive. We here elucidate the mechanism of Ikaros mediated tumor suppressor, namely Stat 5 dephosphorylation. In conclusion, we identify Stat 5 dephosphorylation and BCL 6 upregulation as the key events in the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor / IKAROS mediated tumor suppression in Ph+ ALL...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> {{receptor}} triggers {{expansion and}} differentiation of pre-B cells (the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> transition), {{as well as}} inhibition of VH to DJH recombination (allelic exclusion). The latter also accounts for counter-selection of pro-B cells expressing Dμ protein (Dμ selection). However, the signaling pathways responsible for these events remain poorly defined. Here we show complete arrest of B cell development at the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> transition in BASH/CD 19 double mutant mice, indicating partial redundancy of the two B cell-specific adaptors. Allelic exclusion remained intact in the double mutant mice, whereas Dμ selection was abolished in BASH mutant mice. Thus, distinct signals are required for these events. In addition, both mutant mice succumbed to <b>pre-B</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia, indicating that BASH and CD 19 contribute to tumor suppression...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in {{a variety}} of genes can cause {{congenital}} agammaglobulinemia and a failure of B cell development. The currently known genes encode components of the <b>pre–B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor or proteins that are activated by cross-linking of the <b>pre–B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor. Defects in these genes result in a block in B cell differentiation at the pro–B to <b>pre–B</b> <b>cell</b> transition. A patient with a translocation involving a previously unknown gene, LRRC 8, demonstrated a block at exactly the same point in B cell differentiation (see the related article beginning on page 1707). It will be interesting to determine whether the protein encoded by this gene interacts with the <b>pre–B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor signal transduction pathway or is involved in a new pathway...|$|E

Detailed analysis of RNA and cDNA clones derived from these transcripts reveals that they originate from the distinct immunoglobulin lambda-like genes 14. 1 / 16. 1. Sequence analysis of these clones reveals a long open reading frame, beginning with an ATG, capable of encoding a protein of 214 amino acids with an unprocessed molecular weight of 22, 944. The C-terminal half of this predicted protein is highly homologous to immunoglobulin lambda light-chain joining and constant region protein sequence, while the amino-terminal end does not share homology with variable regions. Unlike immunoglobulin genes, these genes do not undergo rearrangement prior to expression. Analysis of a panel of 26 hematopoietic cell lines reveals that expression of 14. 1 / 16. 1 is limited to <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> and one B-cell line, which, like the <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells,</b> is surface immunoglobulin negative. Antisera raised against a peptide whose sequence was predicted from the 14. 1 cDNA sequence identifies a 22 -kDa protein in human <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunoprecipitation of immunoglobulin mu-chain from these <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> with anti-immunoglobulin mu antibody coprecipitates a 22 -kDa protein, which {{is a candidate for}} the human immunoglobulin omega light-chain protein and may be the protein product of the 14. 1 / 16. 1 genes...|$|R
40|$|NF-kappa B {{activation}} is {{a crucial}} late step in the induction of immunoglobulin kappa light-chain gene expression in <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have analyzed NF-kappa B activation in three independent mutant lines of 70 Z/ 3 <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> which are unresponsive to LPS. All three variant cell lines failed to activate NF-kappa B when induced with LPS or the phorbol ester 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate. However, all three cell lines contained functional NF-kappa B, as revealed by detergent treatment of cytoplasmic extracts. Moreover, cycloheximide induced limited activation of NF-kappa B comparable to that in wild-type 70 Z/ 3 <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> {{in two of the}} three variant lines. These results indicate that the mutations blocking kappa gene induction in these variant 70 Z/ 3 pre-B-cell lines affect NF-kappa B activation...|$|R
40|$|Phospholipase Cγ 2 (PLCγ 2) is a {{critical}} signaling effector of the B-cell receptor (BCR). Here we show that PLCγ 2 deficiency impedes early B-cell development, resulting in an increase of B 220 + CD 43 + BP- 1 + CD 24 hi pre-BCR+ large <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells.</b> PLCγ 2 deficiency impairs pre-BCR-mediated functions, leading to enhanced interleukin- 7 (IL- 7) signaling and elevated levels of RAGs in the selected large <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells.</b> Consequently, PLCγ 2 deficiency renders large <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells</b> susceptible to transformation, resulting in dramatic acceleration of Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. PLCγ 2 −/− Eμ-Myc transgenic mice mainly develop lymphomas of B 220 + CD 43 + BP- 1 + CD 24 hi pre-BCR+ large pre-B-cell origin, which are uncommon in wild-type Eμ-Myc transgenics. Furthermore, lymphomas from PLCγ 2 −/− Eμ-Myc transgenic mice exhibited a loss of p 27 Kip 1 and often displayed alterations in Arf or p 53. Thus, PLCγ 2 {{plays an important role}} in pre-BCR-mediated early B-cell development, and its deficiency leads to markedly increased pools of the most at-risk large <b>pre-B</b> <b>cells,</b> which display hyperresponsiveness to IL- 7 and express high levels of RAGs, making them prone to secondary mutations and Myc-induced malignancy...|$|R
