5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a <b>pressurised</b> keg using a lever-style {{dispenser}} and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is <b>pressurised</b> with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen is {{commonly}} used during sample preparation in chemical analysis. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples. Directing a <b>pressurised</b> stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind.|$|E
40|$|To produce thick-walled, tubular {{components}} economically, {{the forming}} configuration {{in which a}} <b>pressurising</b> medium is used in injection forging has been simplified. FE and experimental analysis has been conducted to study {{the performance of the}} polymers that were used as the <b>pressurising</b> medium and to examine process design and component-quality issues. A testing method which uses a compound cylinder was also introduced to test the polymers under nearly confined conditions. Both material testing and forming experiment results showed that several polymers may function well as the <b>pressurising</b> medium for the configuration examined. The process can be effected by using a stepped punch, rather than using two punches (which need to be controlled independently), if the compressibility of the <b>pressurising</b> material can be compensated for sufficiently...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016, Amec Foster Wheeler Infrastrucure Ltd {{stated that}} the overall {{environmental}} impacts from low volume hydraulic fracturing to local air quality and global warming are low. Local air quality is impacted by dust and SO2 and NOx emissions [...] "from equipment and vehicles used to transport, <b>pressurise</b> and injection fracturing fluids, and process flowback", while [...] "Emissions of CO2 from the equipment used to <b>pressurise</b> and injection fracturing fluids, and process flowback." [...] contributes to global warming.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{difference}} between pressurisation and smoke exhaust ducting {{is that one}} <b>pressurises</b> an area, while the other reduces the pressure through exhausting smoke.|$|R
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of <b>pressurised</b> water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a <b>pressurised</b> water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{regulations}} cover {{transportation of}} gas cylinders {{in a vehicle}} in a commercial environment. Transportation of <b>pressurised</b> diving gas cylinders with a combined water capacity of less than 1000 litres on a vehicle for personal use is exempt from ADR.|$|E
5|$|When <b>pressurised,</b> a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. <b>Pressurised</b> diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E

5|$|Geneva and {{the nearby}} French {{department}} of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN, dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the <b>pressurised</b> balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and <b>pressurised</b> heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E
5|$|The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the world's first {{commercial}} jetliner. Developed and manufactured by de Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters, the Comet1 prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines {{buried in the}} wings, a <b>pressurised</b> fuselage, and large square windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable passenger cabin and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are <b>pressurised.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was <b>pressurised.</b> During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was <b>pressurised</b> with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E

5|$|During {{tests with}} the Ju 87 A-2, new {{technologies}} were tried out {{to reduce the}} effects of g forces. The <b>pressurised</b> cabin was of great importance during this research. Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. When the United States Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the Ju 87.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (<b>pressurised</b> reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Device Forts {{played a}} role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II. The townsfolk of Deal seized their local castle in support of William of Orange, and took steps to defend the Downs against a feared Irish {{invasion}} which never materialised. Southsea Castle was held by the King's illegitimate son, James FitzJames, the Duke of Berwick, who was <b>pressurised</b> into surrendering as his father's cause collapsed. Yarmouth was controlled by Robert Holmes, a supporter of James, but was prevented from actively supporting the loyalist cause by the local inhabitants and his garrison, who sided with William.|$|E

50|$|The MkIII massively {{improves}} on the MarkII again; {{this time}} {{by a factor of}} five. Around 15,000 kg of thrust could be achieved from this engine; making it the most powerful engine Starchaser have. The <b>pressurising</b> gas was this time Helium.|$|R
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A <b>pressurised</b> refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force as an {{interceptor}} aircraft. It {{was the first}} jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF. From the outset {{it was clear that}} the type had exceptional performance, being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber. The Hunter also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records. The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time, enabled by features such as its removable gun pack, <b>pressurised</b> fuelling system, and easy handling in flight.|$|E
5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is <b>pressurised</b> by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Torpedoes may use {{a working}} gas {{produced}} by high test peroxide or Otto fuel II, which <b>pressurise</b> without combustion. The 230 kg Mark 46 torpedo, for example, can travel 11 km underwater at 74 km/h fuelled by Otto fuel without oxidant.|$|R

50|$|High {{pressure}} electrolysis is the electrolysis {{of water with}} a compressed hydrogen output around 120-200 Bar (1740-2900 psi). By <b>pressurising</b> the hydrogen in the electrolyser, {{the need for an}} external hydrogen compressor is eliminated; the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%.|$|R
