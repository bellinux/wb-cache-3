5|$|Finally, on October 11, 1968, the Thousand Islands Bypass opened. This final <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> commemorated with {{a plaque}} to signify the {{completion}} of Highway401.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October the 'Concrete Confessional' <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> done on 7th Street {{near the}} Cooper Union, {{depicting}} a religious figure {{framed by a}} hole in the concrete wall standing in front of it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} made in {{wood and}} sometimes in ivory. The height of the <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> varied by class. The official colors of the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> red and black.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{captured}} {{when two}} enemy <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> on adjacent sides of it, {{in a straight}} line. The player whose <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> captured must use his next turn to relocate the captured piece: ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> said {{to attack}} (or threaten) an opponent's piece if, {{in the next}} move, it could capture that <b>piece.</b> A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> said to defend (or protect) {{a piece of the}} defender's color if, in case the defended <b>piece</b> <b>were</b> taken by the opponent, the defender could {{immediately}} recapture. Attacking a piece usually, but not always (see Sacrifice), forces the opponent to respond if the attacked <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> undefended, or if the attacking <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> of lower value than the one attacked.|$|R
5|$|A 1942 piece, The Old Checkered House, 1862 was {{appraised}} at the Memphis 2004 Antiques Roadshow. It was not {{as common}} as her winter landscapes. Originally purchased in the 1940s for under $10, the <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> assigned an insurance value of $60,000 by the appraiser, Alan Fausel.|$|E
5|$|A {{painting}} of the band by John Byrne was at an earlier point under consideration {{to be used as}} the album's cover. The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> later used for the sleeve of the compilation album The Beatles' Ballads, released in 1980. In 2012 the original artwork was put up for auction.|$|E
5|$|Between 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic {{work for}} full orchestra. The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> first heard in 1873 when Fauré and Saint-Saëns {{performed}} it in a two-piano version, but that transcription has not survived. Léon Boëllmann {{made a new}} transcription of the first movement in 1893.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{total of}} 12 pieces of which 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> black and 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> white.|$|R
5000|$|The five {{movements}} are tonally {{organized by the}} three notes in the D major triad: D, F-sharp, and A. The first, second, and fifth <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> in D major; the fourth <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> in F-sharp minor; and the third <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> in A major.|$|R
5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{inspired}} a 1920 painting by Octav Băncilă, which shows Creangă listening to Eminescu reading his poems. Two busts {{of the author}} were erected in Iași, respectively at his grave site and, in 1932, the gardens of Copou neighborhood. After 1943, another such <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> unveiled in Bucharest's Cișmigiu Gardens, as part of Rotunda Scriitorilor monument.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
50|$|Whichever {{player has}} more <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> the winner (a Mandarin <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> equal to ten or five citizen pieces).|$|R
50|$|In Murray's variant, {{the pieces}} have {{different}} colors with different point values. The number of <b>pieces</b> per color <b>are</b> divided as follows: 1 green for every 2 red, for every 3 yellow, for every 4 white. In a 15 x 15 square board {{that would be}} 22 green, 45 red, 68 yellow, and 90 white <b>pieces.</b> Green <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 4 points, red <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 3 points, yellow <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 2 points, and white <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 1 point.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the players}} {{agree that they}} have no more moves they wish to (or CAN) make, points are scored based on the total pieces in the towers players control. Large <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 3 points, medium <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 2, and small <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 1.|$|R
5|$|In early 2013, the Recess Gallery in New York City's SoHo {{neighbourhood}} presented We Buy White Albums, {{an installation}} by artist Rutherford Chang. The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{in the form}} of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. Chang created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the LP were overlaid.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the works}} {{that make up the}} Better Out Than In series were defaced, some just hours after the <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, {{the tower}} for Falcon's Fury was shipped from Spain in nine sections, {{arriving}} at the park {{near the end of}} October; the ride's smaller parts had been delivered earlier from several European countries. Installation of one of the nine tower pieces was planned for every other night, with the last piece in place by New Year's Eve. Construction was done by the Adena Corporation, and on November 18 the first <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> installed. The ride's second <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> installed on December 2, and two more were installed by December 6. The fifth section was placed by December 21, and the sixth was erected by New Year's Day. The seventh tower <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> installed by January 3, 2014, and the eighth by January 5, reaching a height of about , and Falcon's Fury's gondola was seen at the park on January 12. The ride's counterweight was installed on January 22, and the tower was capped during the weekend of February 1. Work on the ride's electrical components then began. Assembly of the gondola was completed by the end of March. Testing was originally scheduled to begin in February, but due to construction delays the first drop tests were not made until April 15. Tower painting began in June, with its sunset motif estimated to take 60 hours over a three-week period.|$|E
5000|$|If {{a player}} can trap an enemy piece between two {{friendly}} pieces, the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> blocked and cannot be moved. Such a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> called alligatus or, according to Isidore, incitus. To {{make it clear}} that a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> an alligatus, it is turned upside down.|$|R
25|$|The two players' <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> usually colored red and black. <b>Pieces</b> <b>are</b> flat {{circular}} disks labeled or {{engraved with}} a Chinese character identifying the piece type, {{and in a}} color indicating which player has ownership. The black <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> marked with somewhat different characters from the corresponding red pieces.|$|R
50|$|Rook: Tank (pusher). Can move one {{square in}} any {{direction}} even if the square is currently occupied. If it moves into an occupied square it pushes against the other piece and forces it into the next square in the line. If {{there is more than}} one piece in a line, then the whole line of <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> moved. If a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> moved off the board it is destroyed. If a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> moved into a coordinated field, it is destroyed. If a tank pushes against an immobilized field, then all immobilized <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> moved including the immobilizer (remember that only opponent <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> immobilized).|$|R
5|$|Production of {{the coins}} did not {{commence}} until March11, {{more than a}} week after the passage of the Bland–Allison Act. The first acceptable strike, after adjustments to the press, was coined at 3:17p.m. at the Philadelphia Mint. This <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> given to President Hayes; the second and third were given to Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman and to Mint Director Henry Linderman.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 1,000,528 of {{the half}} dollars {{at the behest of}} the Commission in May and June 1926, with the excess over the {{authorized}} mintage reserved for inspection and testing at the 1927 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. They also had the mint strike 200,226 quarter eagles in May and June, with the excess also set aside for the Assay Commission. The gold <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> the second quarter eagle to be a commemorative, after the Panama–Pacific issue of 1915. No further gold commemoratives, of any denomination, would be issued by the Mint Bureau until 1984, when a $10 <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> issued for the Los Angeles Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The first {{identification}} of Plymouth Rock as the actual landing site was in 1741 by 90-year-old Thomas Faunce, whose father {{had arrived in}} Plymouth in 1623, {{three years after the}} supposed event. The rock was later covered by a solid-fill pier. In 1774, an attempt was made to excavate the rock, but it broke in two. The severed <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> placed in the Town Square at the center of Plymouth. In 1880, the intact half of the rock was excavated from the pier, and the broken <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> reattached to it. Over the years, souvenir hunters have removed chunks from the rock, but the remains are now protected as part of the complex of living museums. These include the Mayflower II, a recreation of the original ship; Plimoth Plantation, a historical recreation of the original 1620 settlement; and the Wampanoag Homesite, which recreates a 17th-century Indian village.|$|E
25|$|As if this {{mosaic of}} {{unrelated}} <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> not complex enough, {{some of the}} assembled <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> uplifted, eroded by streams, and then locally buried in their own eroded debris; other <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> forced deep into the Earth to be heated and squeezed, almost beyond recognition, and then raised again to view.|$|R
2500|$|Wooden White chess <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} {{made of a}} light wood, boxwood, {{or sometimes}} maple. Black wooden <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of a dark wood such as rosewood, ebony, red sandalwood, or walnut. Sometimes they are made of boxwood and stained or painted black, brown, or red. Plastic white <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of white or off-white plastic, and plastic black <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of black or red plastic.

5000|$|Ambuscade: If two pieces' sum {{is equal}} to an enemy <b>piece</b> that <b>is</b> placed between the two (i.e. the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> within a move of both attacking pieces), the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{captured}} and removed from the board.|$|R
5|$|The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} by sopranos such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (from 1948), Maria Stader (1959), Elly Ameling (1970), Edith Mathis (1972), Edita Gruberova (1979), Lucia Popp (1980), Helen Donath (1983), Elizabeth Parcells (1983), Monika Frimmer (1984), Barbara Hendricks (1989), Christine Schäfer (1999), Siri Thornhill (2007).|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} six {{pieces were}} recorded at the Medinah Temple in Chicago, {{performed by the}} Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine. Pines of Rome was re-arranged in 1993 by Bruce Coughlin, who reduced the four-movement piece by cutting the second movement and trimming sections of {{the third and fourth}} movements. The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> recorded on March 28, 1994. The second recording involved Symphony No. 5, Carnival of the Animals, and Pomp and Circumstance, on April 25, 1994. Carnival of the Animals, Finale uses two pianos played by Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky. Pomp and Circumstance was arranged by Peter Schickele and features the Chicago Symphony Chorus and soprano soloist Kathleen Battle. The next recording took place on April 24, 1995 for Piano Concerto No. 2 with pianist Yefim Bronfman. On September 28, 1996, The Firebird was the final piece to be recorded; its session lasted for three hours. The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> arranged using four sections from Stravinsky's 1919 revision of the score.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was finally}} completed on August 28, 2005, and officially unveiled on May 15, 2006. The {{cost for the}} <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> first estimated at $6million; this had escalated to $11.5million {{by the time the}} park opened in 2004, with the final figure standing at $23million in 2006. No public funds were involved; all funding came from donations from individuals and corporations.|$|E
