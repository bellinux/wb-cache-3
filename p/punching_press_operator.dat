40|$|This study {{presents}} the information required {{to describe the}} machine and device resources in the turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> environment which are needed {{for the development of}} the analysing method for automated production. The description of product and device resources and their interconnectedness is the starting point for method comparison the development of expenses, production planning and the performance of optimisation. The manufacturing method cannot be optimized unless the variables and their interdependence are known. Sheet metal parts in particular may then become remarkably complex, and their automatic manufacture may be difficult or, with some automatic equipment, even impossible if not know manufacturing properties. This thesis consists of three main elements, which constitute the triangulation. In the first phase of triangulation, the manufacture occuring on a turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> is examined in order to find the factors that affect the efficiency of production. In the second phase of triangulation, the manufacturability of products on turret <b>punch</b> <b>presses</b> is examined through a set of laboratory tests. The third phase oftriangulation involves an examination of five industry parts. The main key findings of this study are: all possible efficiency in high automation level machining cannot be achieved unless the raw materials used in production and the dependencies of the machine and tools are well known. Machine-specific manufacturability factors for turret <b>punch</b> <b>presses</b> were not taken into account in the industrial case samples. On the grounds of the performed tests and industrial case samples, the designer of a sheet metal product can directly influence the machining time, material loss, energy consumption and the number of tools required on a turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> by making decisions in the way presented in the hypothesis of thisstudy. The sheet metal parts to be produced can be optimised to bemanufactured on a turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> when the material to be used and the kinds of machine and tool options available are known. This provides in-depth knowledge of the machine and tool properties machine and tool-specifically. None of the optimisation starting points described here is a separate entity; instead, they are all connected to each other...|$|R

So, {{the motion of the}} punch is controllable through the rotation of the servomotor. Then, the inverse kinematics analysis is studied in detail, and the corresponding motion of the servomotor can be gotten, for different punch motion curves, according to the production requirement. For example, when we design a motion of the punch for a particular stamping process, the motion of servomotor can be obtained through the inverse kinematics analysis. Finally, Output force is acquired by static force analysis, which decides the working capability of the mechanism...|$|R
