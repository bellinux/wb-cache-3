40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of internet technologies, social networks, {{and other related}} areas, user authentication {{becomes more and more}} important to protect the data of the users. <b>Password</b> authentication is one of the widely used methods to achieve authentication for legal users and defense against intruders. There have been many <b>password</b> cracking methods developed during the past years, and people have been designing the countermeasures against <b>password</b> cracking all the time. However, we find that the survey work on the <b>password</b> cracking research has not been done very much. This paper is mainly to give a brief review of the <b>password</b> cracking methods, import technologies of <b>password</b> cracking, and the countermeasures against <b>password</b> cracking that are usually designed at two stages including the <b>password</b> design stage (e. g. user education, dynamic <b>password,</b> use of tokens, computer generations) and after the design (e. g. reactive <b>password</b> checking, proactive <b>password</b> checking, <b>password</b> encryption, access control). The main objective of this work is offering the abecedarian IT security professionals and the common audiences with some knowledge about the computer security and <b>password</b> cracking, and promoting the development of this area.

However, modern cracking software allows removing such a <b>password</b> very quickly – a persistent cracking process takes one week at most. Use of rainbow tables reduces <b>password</b> removal time to several seconds. Some <b>password</b> recovery software {{can not only}} remove a <b>password,</b> but also find an actual <b>password</b> that was used by a user to encrypt the document using brute-force attack approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the <b>password</b> depends on the <b>password</b> strength.|$|R
50|$|S/KEY is a {{one-time}} <b>password</b> system developed for authentication to Unix-like operating systems, especially from dumb terminals or untrusted public computers on which {{one does not}} want to type a long-term <b>password.</b> A user's real <b>password</b> is combined in an offline device with a short set of characters and a decrementing counter to form a single-use <b>password.</b> Because each <b>password</b> is only used once, they are useless to <b>password</b> sniffers.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} can negotiate {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be fused together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which take inspiration from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main alignments govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, neutral and dark alignments; and one representing law, neutral and chaos alignments. The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether they will remain loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. Fused demons can be shared between players using thirty-two character <b>passwords</b> generated when a new demon is fused. These <b>passwords</b> can be traded between different players.|$|E
