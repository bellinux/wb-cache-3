40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to suggest {{practical}} criteria for the clinical translucency evaluation of direct esthetic restorative materials, and to review the translucency with these criteria. For the evaluation of reported translucency values, measuring instrument and method, specimen thickness, background color, and illumination should be scrutinized. Translucency parameter (TP) of 15 to 19 could {{be regarded as the}} translucency of 1 mm thick human enamel. Visual <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> for translucency difference in contrast ratio (ΔCR) of 0. 07 could be transformed into ΔTP value of 2. Translucency differences between direct and indirect resin composites were perceivable (ΔTP > 2). Universal and corresponding flowable resin composites did not show perceivable translucency differences in most products. Translucency differed significantly by the product within each shade group, and by the shade group within each product. Translucency of human enamel and <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> for translucency difference may be used as criteria for the clinical evaluation of translucency of esthetic restorative materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to review the changes in {{translucency}} of direct esthetic restorative materials after curing, aging and treatment. As a criterion for the evaluation of clinical translucency changes, visual <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> in translucency parameter difference (ΔTP) of 2 was used. Translucency changes after curing were perceivable depending on experimental methods and products (largest ΔTP in resin composites = 15. 9). Translucency changes after aging were reported as either relatively stable or showed perceivable changes by aging protocols (largest ΔTP in resin composites = - 3. 8). Translucency changes after curing, aging and treatment were perceivable in several products and experimental methods. Therefore, shade matching of direct esthetic materials should be performed considering these instabilities of translucency in direct esthetic materials...|$|E
40|$|Translucency {{of dental}} ceramics, {{esthetic}} posts and orthodontic brackets was reviewed. Translucency parameter (TP) and contrast ratio (CR) are generally used for translucency evaluation. For {{the evaluation of}} translucency, two criteria such as the translucency of human teeth (TP = 15 – 19, 1 mm thick) and the visual <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> for the translucency difference (∆CR > 0. 07 or ∆TP > 2) were used. In ceramics, translucency differences were in the perceptible range {{depending on the type}} of material and the thickness. However, variations caused by the difference in the required thickness for each layer by the material and also by the measurement protocols should be considered. As to the translucency of esthetic posts, a significant difference was found among the post systems. Translucency was influenced by the bracket composition and brand, and the differences by the brand were visually perceptible...|$|E
40|$|So {{that the}} {{analysis}} of the large amount of information yielded by an echogram of the impulse response may be restricted by comparing different points of the room, investigations have been performed with the object of determining the absolute <b>perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> for audibility of: (1) Discontinuities in reverberant decays, (2) deviations from regularity of a flutter echo, (3) later echos (delayed >or= 70 ms after the direct sound). For investigation 1, the decay of a large room (broadcasting studio, church) stimulated by the report of a starting pistol and recorded on magnetic tape was used. For investigations 2 and 3 the reverberation-free report was used for the electroacoustic synthesis of an impulse response. Very small thresholds occur for deviations from regularity of a flutter echo and for late echos whilst discontinuities in a reverberant decay are very hard to perceive...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the quantification of image quality in lossy compressed images, exploring the impact of digital artefacts and scene characteristics upon image quality evaluation. A subjective paired comparison test was implemented to assess perceived quality of JPEG 2000 against baseline JPEG over a range of different scene types. Interval scales were generated for both algorithms, which indicated a subjective preference for JPEG 2000, particularly at low bit rates, and these were confirmed by an objective distortion measure. The subjective results did not follow this trend for some scenes however, and both algorithms {{were found to be}} scene dependent {{as a result of the}} artefacts produced at high compression rates. The scene dependencies were explored from the interval scale results, which allowed scenes to be grouped according to their susceptibilities to each of the algorithms. Groupings were correlated with scene measures applied in a linked study. A pilot study was undertaken to explore <b>perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> of JPEG 2000 of the same set of images. This work was developed with a further experiment to investigate the <b>thresholds</b> of <b>perceptibility</b> and acceptability of higher resolution JPEG 2000 compressed images. A set of images was captured using a professional level full-frame Digital Single Lens Reflex camera, using a raw workflow and carefully controlled image-processing pipeline. The scenes were quantified using a set of simple scene metrics to classify them according to whether they were average, higher than, or lower than average, for a number of scene properties known to affect image compression and perceived image quality; these were used to make a final selection of test images. Image fidelity was investigated using the method of constant stimuli to quantify <b>perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> and just noticeable differences (JNDs) of <b>perceptibility.</b> <b>Thresholds</b> and JNDs of acceptability were also quantified to explore suprathreshold quality evaluation. The relationships between the two thresholds were examined and correlated with the results from the scene measures, to identify more or less susceptible scenes. It was found that the level and differences between the two thresholds was an indicator of scene dependency and could be predicted by certain types of scene characteristics. A third study implemented the soft copy quality ruler as an alternative psychophysical method, by matching the quality of compressed images to a set of images varying in a single attribute, separated by known JND increments of quality. The imaging chain and image processing workflow were evaluated using objective measures of tone reproduction and spatial frequency response. An alternative approach to the creation of ruler images was implemented and tested, and the resulting quality rulers were used to evaluate a subset of the images from the previous study. The quality ruler was found to be successful in identifying scene susceptibilities and observer sensitivity. The fourth investigation explored the implementation of four different image quality metrics. These were the Modular Image Difference Metric, the Structural Similarity Metric, The Multi-scale Structural Similarity Metric and the Weighted Structural Similarity Metric. The metrics were tested against the subjective results and all were found to have linear correlation in terms of predictability of image quality...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Data on {{acceptability}} (AT) and <b>perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> (PT) for colour differences vary in dental literature. There is {{consensus that}} the determination of ΔE* is appropriate to define AT and PT, however {{there is no consensus}} regarding the values that should be used. The aim of this clinical review was to provide a systematic approach to the topic of colour science of high clinical relevance to dental research. Materials and methods MEDLINE/PubMed, WoS and EBSCO databases were searched up to January 7, 2013; the outcome was restricted to English, and to clinical studies were spectrophotometers were used for measurement. Results Forty-eight studies were eligible and met the inclusion criteria. Of the 48 studies there appeared to be a trend in their source references: 44 % referred to the same study for the PT (ΔE* = 1); and 35 % referred to the same article for the AT (ΔE* = 3. 7). Conclusions More than half the studies defined PT as ΔE* = 1, and one third of the studies referred to ΔE* = 3. 7 as the threshold at which 50 % of observers accepted the colour difference. Most clinical studies refer to the same few in vitro literature that have attempted to determine PT and AT from decades ago...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} a robust method that protects owner rights against {{unintended}} or malicious stealing, which has arisen because of the rapid increase of Internet data exchange and multimedia use, in addition to international electronic commercial services and the multimedia that it contains, has become a substantial constraint to the research in this domain. This paper proposes a novel method for image watermarking based on embedding multiple identical watermarks in different domains of the image representation: i. e. spatial and DCT domains, without any distortion of the watermarked image. In the spatial domain, the processing method uses a non-linear neural network segmentation to output the different zones of watermark embedding {{with respect to the}} image characteristics. Basing on this study, we compute the appropriate variable embedding gain factors chosen within the limit of the <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold.</b> However, in the DCT domain, different DC...|$|E
40|$|Crown {{discoloration}} can {{be induced}} by root canal sealer remnants following root canal treatment. Objective: The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate chromatic alterations in human tooth crowns induced by a Mineral Trioxide Aggregate-based sealer (MTA Fillapex&# 174;) and a commonly used ZnOE-based sealer (Roth- 811). The tested null hypothesis was that the application of the materials did not induce clinically perceptible crown discoloration (Ho: CIE color difference &# 916;E< 3. 7). Material and Methods: Forty five fully developed, intact, mandibular third molars were sectioned 1 mm below the cemento-enamel junction. The pulp chambers were chemomechanically debrided via the cervical access. The specimens were randomly assigned into three groups Group 1 : MTA Fillapex, Group 2 : Roth 811, Group 3 : Negative control (unfilled) and immersed in individually marked vials containing distilled water up to the cervix (37 &# 177; 1 &# 176;C). The spectral reflectance lines were recorded by utilizing a UV-VIS spectrophotometer equipped with integration sphere in the visual spectrum at baseline, 1 week, 1 and 3 months after material placement. Data were transformed into values of the CIE L*a*b* color system and the corresponding &# 916;E values were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way mixed ANOVA models, at p= 0. 05 level of significance. Results: A statistically significant increase in a* and b* chromatic parameters of the MTA Fillapex Group was measured. However, &# 916;E values did not exceed the human eye <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> (set at &# 916;E< 3. 7) during the experimental period (&# 916;Et 3 = 2. 88). In Roth- 811 Group, a statistically significant decrease in L* and a statistically significant increase in a* and b* chromatic parameters was measured, during all observation periods. Resultant &# 916;E values exceeded the human eye <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> after 1 week (&# 916;Et 1 = 5. 65). Conclusions: Application of MTA Fillapex in tooth crowns resulted in minimal color alterations, while Roth 811 induced severe discoloration, in vitro. It could be suggested that, in terms of aesthetics, the use of MTA Fillapex appears to be favorable...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examines the}} relationships between image fidelity, acceptability thresholds and scene content for images distorted by lossy compression. Scene characteristics of a sample set of images, {{with a wide range}} of representative scene content, were quantified, using simple measures (scene metrics), which had been previously found to correlate with global scene lightness, global contrast, busyness, and colorfulness. Images were compressed using the lossy JPEG 2000 algorithm to a range of compression ratios, progressively introducing distortion to levels beyond the threshold of detection. Twelve observers took part in a paired comparison experiment to evaluate the <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> compression ratio. A further psychophysical experiment was conducted using the same scenes, compressed to higher compression ratios, to identify the level of compression at which the images became visually unacceptable. Perceptibility and acceptability thresholds were significantly correlated for the test image set; both thresholds also correlated with the busyness metric. Images were ranked for the two thresholds and were further grouped, based upon {{the relationships between}} perceptibility and acceptability. Scene content and the results from the scene descriptors were examined within the groups to determine the influence of specific common scene characteristics upon both thresholds...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Nearly all {{flat panel}} video display {{monitors}} have luminance and colour variations as {{the angle of}} view varies from the monitor’s perpendicular. The new MicrotileTM displays developed by Christie Digital are no exception to this general finding. A review of any book on colour science will {{show that there is}} substantial amount of literature on just noticeable colour differences within various colour spaces. Despite the wealth of data on the topic, there is no general consensus across different industries as to which colour space and colour difference equations are appropriate. Several factors like the background colour, object size, texture of the stimulus are different for different studies; these factors make it very difficult to determine precisely the effect of viewing angle on the perception of coloured images on the Microtiles display based on previous research. Hence, the objective of this thesis was to quantify the measured colour shifts of a Microtile display at different viewing angles, in steps of perceptible thresholds and to evaluate the acceptability of distortions at different viewing angles for complex scenes. Methods A preliminary experiment was setup to study the behaviour of Microtile display primaries as a function of viewing angle. The aim was to measure the shift in hue and luminance of the three primaries at different eccentricities (from 0 o to 40 o). The measured trend was used to simulate Microtile shifts on complex images for the rating task. 	In {{the first part of the}} perceptibility experiment, three reference colours were picked and 12 vectors heading towards the blue-yellow region of the L*a*b* colour space (pertaining to the colour shifts noticed with the Microtile displays). A uniform reference colour was presented in three of the four quadrants on the CRT monitor and one quadrant changed colour in the direction of the sampled vector. An adaptive, four alternate forced choice procedure was employed to determine thresholds for each of the 3 reference colours. The adaptive technique used was a ZEST paradigm. In the second part of the perceptibility experiment, eighteen directions were sampled around each reference colour. 	The rating task was based on simulating the measured attenuations of the Microtile primaries on complex scenes. Subjects rated the images both in terms of acceptability/unacceptability and as percentage image degradation. The simulation was presented on three static complex images, car, landscape and portrait. A total of 60 subjects participated in the study, 20 subjects for each experiment. All subjects were between the age group of 15 to 35 years of age and underwent battery of colour vision tests before being included in the study. All subjects included had average to superior colour discrimination as categorized using the FM- 100 Hue discrimination test. Results Study 1 : The preliminary study on Microtile display characteristics as a function of viewing angle showed that all the three primaries decreased in luminance with change in viewing angle. The red primary decreased at a faster rate compared to the other two primaries. The trend presents as a decrease in luminance with the hue shifting towards the blue-green region of the CIE 1974 L*a*b* space. 	Study 2 : Results from both the first and second parts of the perceptibility experiment showed that the vectors sampled in different directions approximated to ellipsoids in the L*a*b* colour space. This finding was consistent with the colour discrimination literature. Vectors on the equi-luminance plane were significantly longer than the vectors on the non equi-Luminance plane. Results showed that the average <b>perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the non equi-luminance direction were lower than 1 ∆ELab¬¬¬¬. 	Study 3 : Results from the rating experiments showed that irrespective of the complexities in the images, distortions greater than five times thresholds were less than 50 % acceptable and were rated to be at least 30 % degraded. This corresponds to a viewing angle greater than 10 o for a Microtile display. The relationship between the stimulus (ΔE) and subjective Image degradation judgements followed a linear relationship, with the portrait and landscape having similar functions, whereas the car was rated more degraded at lower ΔEs and less degraded at higher ΔEs compared with the other two scenes. Conclusion <b>Perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> for different reference colours showed that the conventionally used calibration precision of 1 ΔELab is a lenient criterion. <b>Perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> are at least 25 % less for the Microtile display reference condition. From the results of the rating data a distortion greater than five times thresholds is less than 50 % acceptable and appears to be at least 30 % degraded for static complex images. However, the image quality judgments appear to be related to scene context, which requires further study...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{scientific}} literature shows that background color and luminance affect color perception, previous measurements of tooth color difference thresholds have not taken the effects of viewing context into account. The present study tested the hypothesis that differences in skin/gingival color influence individuals’ judgments of tooth color differences. <b>Perceptibility</b> and acceptability <b>thresholds</b> were determined in 10 individuals using a signal detection paradigm. They evaluated 500 pseudo-random presentations of two facial portraits: an African-American and a Caucasian. These portraits varied trial-to-trial only in the direction (CIELAB +L*, +a*, or +b*) or magnitude of the color difference between a portrait’s two central incisors. The individuals were significantly less sensitive to tooth color differences in the +L* direction in the Caucasian portrait than for any other combination of color direction or portrait type. Furthermore, comparable <b>perceptibility</b> and acceptability <b>thresholds</b> were generally not statistically significant from each other...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the tooth whiteness <b>perceptibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{of the average}} observer {{to changes in the}} CIELAB values and an optimised whiteness Index for dentistry (WIO) based on psychophysical studies. Methods: A psychophysical experiment based on visual assessments of digital images of teeth on a calibrated display with a group of observers (n = 32) has been conducted to determine the perceptual thresholds in tooth whiteness. Digital simulations of a tooth that is identical in shape to the left incisor in the image of teeth were superimposed on to images. The colour of the simulated tooth was varied and observers were asked to respond whether there was a difference in whiteness between the left incisor and the simulated tooth. Thresholds for detection of differences in whiteness were independently determined in four conditions: ΔL*, Δa*, Δb* and a blue optical whitening direction. Raw data were fitted using a non-parametric approach and thresholds of CIELAB and WIO for each conditions were calculated. Results: Estimates of the threshold of the four conditions of ΔL*, Δa*, Δb* and a blue covarine optical tooth whitening direction were 1. 14, 3. 24, 1. 11 and 1. 51 respectively, with the corresponding WIO thresholds of 2. 77, 6. 52, 3. 09 and 1. 99 respectively. Conclusions: The thresholds for tooth whiteness perception in CIELAB space and WIO space were determined. The findings demonstrate that for a whitening treatment with a blue covarine optical technology, a colour change of about 2 WIO units would be noticeable. Clinical significance: This study gives {{a better understanding of the}} tooth whiteness perception threshold, and will help clinicians identify perceivable differences in tooth colour during matching and whitening procedures...|$|R
40|$|The {{visibility}} analysis examined potential {{impacts of}} the Healy Clean Coal Project (HCCP), a proposed 50 -MW coal-fired power plant to be built adjacent to the existing 25 -MW Healy Unit 1 (a conventional pulverized-coal unit) in Healy, Alaska, about 6 km north of Denali National Park. The analysis used the PLUVUE I visibility model to calculate ambient concentrations of species in the plume with potential to cause visible effects. The optical effects were determined in separate calculations when the sun was within about 10 {degree} of the horizon, in the winter. Results indicated that almost all the potential impact would be caused by NO{sub x}. Analysis {{of the number of}} daytime hours per year that the HCCP plume would be perceptible from the Visitor Access Center, shows that the predicted number of hours is extremely low for the base case: 2 hours for the north sight path, 2 hours for the south sight path, and a total of 2 hours. Sensitivity analysis shows more sensitivity to changing the <b>perceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> than extending the sight paths. Cumulative visibility impacts of air emissions resulting from the simultaneous operation of the HCCP and Healy Unit No. 1 were also evaluated; results show that the percentage of hours affected is much less than 1 % of daytime hours during the year...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The spectral radiance of 63 monochromatic ceramic specimens was determined using a non-contact spectroradiometer. A total of 60 specimen pairs, divided into 3 sets of 20 specimen pairs (medium to light shades, medium to dark shades, and dark shades), were selected for psychophysical experiment. The coordinating center and seven research sites obtained the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals prior the beginning of the experiment. Each research site had 25 observers, divided into five groups of five observers: dentists-D, dental students-S, dental auxiliaries-A, dental technicians-T, and lay persons-L. There were 35 observers per group (five observers per group at each site x 7 sites), for a total of 175 observers. Visual color comparisons were performed using a viewing booth. Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy approximation was used for fitting the data points. The 50 : 50 % PT and 50 : 50 % AT were determined in CIELAB and CIEDE 2000. The t-test was used to evaluate the statistical significance in thresholds differences. RESULTS: The CIELAB 50 : 50 % PT was DeltaEab = 1. 2, whereas 50 : 50 % AT was DeltaEab = 2. 7. Corresponding CIEDE 2000 (DeltaE 00) values were 0. 8 and 1. 8, respectively. 50 : 50 % PT by the observer group revealed differences among groups D, A, T, and L as compared with 50 : 50 % PT for all observers. The 50 : 50 % AT for all observers was statistically different than 50 : 50 % AT in groups T and L. CONCLUSION: A 50 : 50 % perceptibility and ATs were significantly different. The same is true for differences between two color difference formulas DeltaE 00 /DeltaEab. Observer groups and sites showed high level of statistical difference in all thresholds. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Visual color difference thresholds can serve as a quality control tool to guide the selection of esthetic dental materials, evaluate clinical performance, and interpret visual and instrumental findings in clinical dentistry, dental research, and subsequent standardization. The importance of quality control in dentistry is reinforced by increased esthetic demands of patients and dental professionals...|$|E
40|$|Perceptibility and {{acceptability}} are {{the most}} often used threshold units {{in the field of}} color science. The former refers to a just perceptible difference and the latter evokes a tolerable color difference.

However, their merits and traits are far less understood in the literature.

40|$|Objectives: This thesis {{aimed to}} the {{evaluation}} of different digital intraoral radiographic systems, partly by defining objective measures of their physical properties, namely their resolution, signal and noise characteristics, and partly by employing methods to measure their psychophysical properties including viewer performance, such as the Perceptibility Curve test. In a next step, a mathematical model was developed to predict Perceptibility Curves without employing viewers. An additional aim was to compare data on objective calculations of theoretically perceptible limit frequencies with viewer performance. Methods: Specially designed computer programs were used {{in order to determine}} physical and psychophysical properties of several digital intraoral radiographic systems, namely the Sens-A-Ray® the Dixel®, the CDR®, the Digora®, and the Dixi®. The physical properties that define resolution, modulation transfer, noise, signal-to-noise ratio and efficiency of the system to detect x-ray photons were calculated. The psychophysical properties of some of the above named systems were determined by means of the Rose model and the <b>Perceptibility</b> Curve test. <b>Threshold</b> SNRs were determined according to the Rose model, and perceptible frequency limits were theoretically calculated and compared with experimentally obtained data employing viewers. Perceptibility curves were constructed for the Sens-A-Ray system using the conventional technique. A simplified method to construct Perceptibility Curves was tested. Additionally, a method to predict Perceptibility Curves without directly involving viewers was developed and tested and then compared with the conventional technique. Results: The measurements of the physical properties of all digital systems returned results that indicated that they are suitable for intraoral radiography, especially when considering their sensitivity and the efficiency of the systems to detect x-ray photons. Experimentally obtained data on the performance of the systems with respect to their limit resolution were in agreement with the theoretically calculated perceptible frequency limits. A very good agreement was observed between theoretically constructed Perceptibility Curves and curves obtained using the conventional techniques. Conclusions: The physical properties of digital intraoral radiographic systems tested in this study show that these systems have such features that they are considered suitable for clinical intraoral radiography. The agreement between experimentally obtained perceptible frequency limits employing viewers and theoretical calculations shows that the former may be applied as a practical test of the performance of digital radiographic systems with respect to their limit resolution where both signal contrast and frequency are taken into account. The agreement between the predicted Perceptibility Curves and the ones obtained with the conventional technique shows {{that it is possible to}} predict psychophysical properties of digital intraoral radiographic systems as defined by the Perceptibility Curve employing a limited number of system parameters together with predetermined data on the performance of an average observer...|$|R
