40|$|We place {{observational}} likelihood {{constraints on}} braneworld and non-commutative inflation {{for a number}} of inflaton potentials, using Planck, WMAP polarization and BAO data. Both braneworld and non-commutative scenarios of the kind considered here are limited by the most recent data even more severely than standard general-relativity models. At more than 95 % confidence level, the monomial potential V(φ) φp is ruled out for p 2 in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) braneworld cosmology and, for p > 0, also in the high-curvature limit of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) braneworld and in the infrared limit of non-commutative inflation, due to a large scalar spectral index. Some parameter values for natural inflation, small-varying inflaton models and Starobinsky inflation are allowed in all scenarios, although some tuning is required for natural inflation in a non-commutative spacetime. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a series of bench-scale experiments utilizing the so-called "cementation " reaction (i. e. electrochemical reduction by contact with a metal of higher oxidation potential) for the precipitation of copper and the reduction of hexavalent chromium in industrial waste streams such as brass mill and metal finishing discharges Reductants studied included soft iron shot approximately 4. 37 mm dia (0. 172 in.), particulate iron (- 325 mesh and- 400 mesh), and silicon alloys in granular form. The bulk of the work was done utilizing the iron shot as a reductant. Studies were carried out by both a batch process and a continuous process (back-mix reactor). Results were evaluated in terms of percent reduction, dissolution of excess iron and change in pH vs time. The particulate Iron was studied utilizing batch processes only.

40|$|A small Florida lake {{has been}} {{receiving}} a regimen of nutrient addition equivalent to 500 mg/m 3 -yr N and 43 mg/m 3 -yr P since 1967. Data has been accumulated through 1969. The {{effect on the}} lacustrine ecosystem of various biogenes includes production by primary producers, species diversity of plankton and certain production estimates at the secondary trophic level using natural populations of planktivorous fish. Plankton production using isotopic carbon is ca. 58 grms/m 2 -yr; Species diversity is slowly changing to a mixed chlorophycean and yellow-green. Biomass of benthic green filamentous types has increased slightly. Nutrient addition has had little influence on zooplankton production. Related studies on 53 other regional lakes have been done using a multi-dimensional hybrid concept as defined by several trophic state indicators. This trophic state index has provided a means for ranking the lakes on an arbitrary scale. Cluster analysis utilizing pertinent characteristics resulted in classification of other lakes. Land use patterns and population characteristics were determined photographically and N and P budgets estimated, Using multiple regression and canonical analysis, several significant relationships were found between lake trophic state, lake basin, land use, and population characteristics. In general, trophic state of lakes can be expressed as a simple relationship incorporating N and P influx rates.

40|$|A {{suitable}} sampler {{for taking}} undisturbed sediment samples was developed. Techniques were {{worked out for}} measuring (a) oxygen uptake by intact sediment cores, (b) dehydrogenase activity of sediment bacteria, and (c) their actual metabolic heat release. Dehydrogenase activity as a relative measure of anaerobic metabolism was calibrated by direct calorimetry for use in determining natural rates of sediment metabolism. The concentration of reduced end products of anaerobic metabolism was determined by an iodometric and dichromate method. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the equivalents between rates of oxygen consumption {{on the one hand}} and loss of organic carbon of sediments and liberation of nutrient salts, e. g. nitrates, phosphates, silicates, and ammonia, on the other. Seasonal measurements of oxygen consumption at 33 stations in Puget Sound provided benchmark information for an area that may be subject to worsening conditions due to the impact of increasing human population. In situ oxygen uptake by the sediment can be estimated by shipboard measurements with sufficient accuracy. The original working hypothesis, however, that total oxygen uptake represents a measure of total metabolism, aerobic plus anaerobic, in the sediment column appears erroneous, at least in organically rich sediment. The rate of total oxygen uptake by intact cores represents aerobic plus part of the anaerobic metabolism in a surface layer of indeterminate thickness. At present the only practical way to estimate total aerobic and total anaerobic metabolism in sediments is to combine the rates of respiratory oxygen uptake by undisturbed sediment cores with estimates of anaerobic metabolism derived from dehydrogenase assay of subsurface sediment layers. The rate of oxygen uptake by the sediment, however remains a useful index of equilibrium conditions among the various factors that affect this rate: oxygen tension, temperature salinity turbulence, available metabolizable energy, size and composition of the community, compactness and porosity of sediments and perhaps more. As sedimentation rate of oxidizable organic matter increases, e. g. in cases of organic population and eutrophication, anaerobic metabolism becomes a relatively more important process in the mineralization of organic matter in sediments. In this situation, the estimation of anaerobic metabolism by the dehydrogenase assay technique is particularly desirable.

40|$|Despite the {{intentions}} of the State of Bahrain to implement significant economic and social changes, and their full, or <b>partial,</b> <b>sponsorship</b> of intensive training programmes, neither have the human resources available been exploited to their full potential, nor have the vocational training programmes managed to equip unemployed workers with the skills needed to compete effectively in the labour market. Indeed, the picture is hardly encouraging for future generations, and cries out for fundamental changes. Bahrain has poured investments into projects aimed at reaping the benefits of its relative advantages, into exploring and transforming its oil and gas resources, into developing value added products, and human resources. But changes since have created a whole new world, with no market to speak of but a global one. Any decisions on investment should now be guided by the notion that geographical location is no longer a real issue, and that competition is won more by conceptual than by material advantage. A worker's personal opinion of his job has as much impact on competition as the extent and quality of his training. An entirely new system is therefore needed, one that provides social incentives and traditional rewards for the creation of new concepts, ideas and perspectives. The aim of this thesis, is firstly, to investigate labour supply in Bahrain in a dynamic setting {{in the light of the}} neoclassical theory which is based mainly on that labour supply is largely a function of real wage. Secondly, to diagnose the problems and finally to suggest solutions. An econometric model of labour supply for different groups: Bahrainis and non-Bahrainis, primary and secondary workers is introduced. Use is made of cross-section time series data. The econometric contribution of this thesis is the testing of relative wage theory besides the estimation and the identification of labour supply elasticities that can serve as the basis for policy decisions. Unemployment as the most serious economic problem facing Governments is considered in this thesis. Unemployment model is presented and analysed as a function of specific factors that may cause structural unemployment in the economy of Bahrain. Use is made of secondary data. Then unemployment policies are discussed and finally the conclusion of this thesis with prospects is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and extent of}} volatile organic emissions from hazardous waste land treatment systems were evaluated in laboratory and field studies using complex petroleum refining hazardous wastes. Laboratory experiments were conducted using two soils and a intert construction sand to investigate the emission flux rates of seven volatile constituents, i. e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-, m-, o-xylene, and naphthalene, from API Separatory Sludge and Slop Oil Emulsion Solids wastes in column and flask laboratory units {{as a function of}} waste application rate, application method (surface versus subsurface), soil type and soil physical characteristics. Field experiemtns were conducted at an active petroleum refinery hazardous waste land treatment site to which a combined API Separator Sludge/DAF bottom sludge was surface applied. The emission rates of the sevel pure volatile constituents evaluated in the laboratory studies were quantified in the field study. Pure constituent collection and quantification in both laboratory and field studies were carried out using a surface isolation emission flux chamber and a split stream Tenax sorbent tube concentration system. Laboratory and field sampling train evaluation indicated that the system is best quited for high emission rate measurements, i. e., just following waste application, and requires diligent QA/QC procedures to minimize background contamination and to assure representativeness of measured data. Suggested operating procedures in terms of purge flow rates, split stream sampling rates, sample collection volumes for minimal contaminant sorbent tube breakthrough, etc., are presented. Measured laboratory and field data were comapred to the Thibodeaux-Hwang Air Emission Release Rate (AERR) model in an effort to validata this state-of-the-art land treatment air emission model. Data generally confirm the validity of the diffusion based on modeling approach for land treatment air emissions, especially for emission rates immediately following sruface waste application. Both field and laboratory surface application measured data correlated with Thibodeaux-Hwang AERR model predictions within a factor of two to ten. Laboratory subsurface application experiments were within one to two orders of magnitude of predicted values. The dynamics of the geometry of the subsurface contaminated zone following subsurface application, along with the hypothesis of concentration gradient development in the soil zone above the application plane, indicate that the simple diffusion based model does not adequately describe the unsteady-state diffusion process occurring following subsurface application events. The variability observed in point waste loading, and soil physical and temperature conditions observed during the field study suggest that detailed waste loading data (using a pan method described in the report) and site and time specific soil data are required for accurate correlations between measured and predicted waste constituent emission flux rates. Once specific data are collected which describe the physical environment of the land treatment system, the accurate prediction of pure constituent air emissions from surface application and tilling can be provided by the Thibodeaux-Hwang AERR model even for complex hazardous wastes applied to complex soil systems.
