50|$|He {{was born}} in Holland Landing in Upper Canada in 1840, the son of George Lount. He was educated at the University of Toronto, studied law and was called to the bar in 1863. Lount practiced law in Barrie and, later, in Toronto. He was named Queen's Counsel in Ontario in 1876 and in the Dominion of Canada in 1881. He {{resigned}} his seat in the House of Commons in 1897.

5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts with the King's Bench, the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload, in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary. Reaching an acceptable medium with the King's Bench and Exchequer <b>of</b> <b>Pleas</b> proved to be the downfall of all three courts; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction, there was little need for separate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880, the Common <b>Pleas</b> <b>Division</b> <b>of</b> the High Court ceased to exist, marking the end of the Court <b>of</b> Common <b>Pleas.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court <b>of</b> Common <b>Pleas</b> thus ceased to exist, except as the Common <b>Pleas</b> <b>Division</b> <b>of</b> the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for the abolition <b>of</b> the Common <b>Pleas</b> <b>Division</b> and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice <b>of</b> the Common <b>Pleas</b> becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> [...] "autrefois convict" [...] (Law French for [...] "previously convicted") is one {{in which}} the {{defendant}} claims to have been previously convicted of the same offence and that he or she therefore cannot be tried for it again. In the instance where a defendant has been summonsed to both criminal and civil proceedings, a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> autrefois convict is essentially an application to 'merge' proceedings, giving rise to res judicata or a cause of action estoppel in civil proceedings. This means that the secondary proceedings should not go ahead and the complaint stopped. A <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> autrefois convict can be combined with a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty.|$|R
