5000|$|Pedal feel - Brake {{pedal feel}} {{encompasses}} subjective perception of brake power output {{as a function}} of <b>pedal</b> <b>travel.</b> <b>Pedal</b> <b>travel</b> is influenced by the fluid displacement of the brake and other factors.|$|E
50|$|Brake fluids must {{maintain}} {{a low level}} of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake pedal feel. As compressibility increases, more brake <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> is necessary for the same amount of brake caliper piston force.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} caliper stiffness, the calipers are machined {{from one}} single solid piece (in {{contrast to the}} more common being bolted together from two halves). <b>Pedal</b> <b>travel</b> is slightly over one inch. Activation of the rear spoiler will allow the air pressure generated {{at the back of}} the vehicle to force air into the cooling ducts located at either end of the spoiler which become uncovered upon application of it.|$|E
50|$|A {{new form}} of gearbox was {{announced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1934, preselective with a finger-operated lever below the steering wheel. By the driver's left hand was a small additional lever which selected forward neutral or reverse. A standard type of clutch was operated by {{the first part of the}} <b>pedal's</b> <b>travel.</b> The rest of the travel changed the gears as preselected. A freewheel was provided on the indirect ratios though it could be locked out on second gear to provide engine-braking.|$|R
25|$|Hudson {{automobiles}} used {{an unusual}} hybrid hydraulic-mechanical dual-brake system which operated the rear brakes through the otherwise conventional mechanical emergency-brake system when {{a failure of}} the hydraulic system allowed the <b>pedal</b> to <b>travel</b> beyond its normal limit.|$|R
50|$|A pedelec {{is defined}} as meeting EU {{standard}} EN15194, has a motor {{of no more than}} 250w of continuous rated power and which is only to be activated by <b>pedalling,</b> when <b>travelling</b> at speeds of between 6kph and 25kph.|$|R
50|$|The system {{employs a}} travel sensor and a {{pressure}} sensor at the pedal {{to measure the}} speed and force of the driver's command. The control unit processes this information and generates the control signals for the wheel pressure modulators. Normally, the master brake cylinder is detached from the brake circuit. A <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> simulator creates normal pedal feedback. If ESP intervenes, the high-pressure reservoir supplies the required brake pressure quickly and precisely to selected wheels, without any driver involvement.|$|E
50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic brake hose {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> for a given braking effort.|$|E
5000|$|Semi-active {{suspension}} with Four-C (a {{short name}} for [...] "Continuously Controlled Chassis Concept") allows {{the user to}} select from three modes: Comfort, Sport, and Advanced. [...] "Comfort" [...] attempts to soften the car over bumps, while [...] "Advanced" [...] firms the suspension considerably and gives more aggressive throttle response - a setting Volvo implies is for use on the race track. This is accomplished through a drive by wire throttle, allowing the same <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> to result in different performance when the appropriate mode is selected, electronically controlled shock absorbers that can adjust themselves 500 times a second, and a complex series of sensors throughout {{the body of the}} vehicle. Volvo collaborated with high-tech system developer Ohlins Racing AB and shock absorber manufacturer Monroe for the self-adjusting shock absorbers.|$|E
5000|$|On October 22, 2014 PA {{house bill}} 573 passed into law, which is Act 154, which changes the {{definition}} of [...] "pedalcycle" [...] (bicycle) in the PA state vehicle code. [...] "Pedalcycle" [...] is now defined as a vehicle propelled solely by human-powered pedals or a [...] "pedalcycle" [...] (bicycle) with electric assist( [...] a vehicle weighing not more than 100 pounds {{with two or three}} wheels more than 11 inches in diameter, manufactured or assembled with an electric motor rated no more than 750 watts and equipped with operational <b>pedals</b> and <b>travels</b> at speeds less than 20 mph). This bill allows the usage of pedal assisted bicycles in PA that follow the adopted state guidelines.|$|R
40|$|NoBraking system characteristics, {{brake system}} {{performance}} and {{brake system component}} design parameters that influence brake pedal `feel¿ in a passenger car have been studied using the simulation modelling package AMESim, in particular to model the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components. A passenger car hydraulic brake system simulation model incorporating the brake pedal, booster, master cylinder, brake lines and calipers has been developed to predict brake system response {{to assist in the}} design of braking systems with the desired brake <b>pedal</b> force / <b>travel</b> characteristic characteristics to create good brake pedal `feel¿. This has highlighted the importance of system components, in particular the master cylinder and caliper seal deformation, and the operating characteristics of the booster in determining the brake <b>pedal</b> force / <b>travel</b> characteristic. The potential contribution of these 3 components to brake pedal `feel¿ improvement has been investigated, and the results of the AMESim model have been verified using experimental measurement data. The model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of brake system response at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a Swedish national experiment with different types of Intelligent Speed Adaptation, 300 vehicles are being equipped with an active gas pedal in the city of Lund. The active gas pedal provides drivers with counter-force whenever they try to exceed the pre-set speed limit. During the experiment the equipment will be continuously set on the actual speed limit. The vehicles will also be equipped with digital maps with all the speed limits within the city limit and a GPS system. Both private- and company cars, including professional drivers will participate in the trial. All vehicles will be equipped with data logging facilities. The selection of the test drivers is made by age groups, gender and attitude to the active gas pedal (positive and negative). An extensive evaluation will be carried out in order to study driver behaviour, acceptance and effects on safety, travel time and the environment. In {{order to be able to}} observe any attitude changes in the city, surveys with 750 citizens are carried out before the start of the project and after the project has been realised. In order to study driver reactions and behaviour, in-car observations with the help of “Wiener fahrprobe” will be carried out. In order to see any changes in the attitude and acceptance of the test drivers, they will be interviewed when recruited, during the test drives and after the trial. A number of drivers will also be asked to fill in a diary every day on their driving. Driving data will be logged in the test cars and speed profiles, gas <b>pedal</b> activity, <b>travel</b> time and exhaust emissions will be analysed. In order to measure possible system effects, a number of studies will be carried out in the field: traffic counting, speed measurements, observations of interactions between road-users, observation of frequency in driving against red. Accidents in the city also will be analysed. Similar studies will be carried out in a control city in order to be able to see if possible changes in Lund are due to the ISA-equipped cars...|$|R
50|$|Because manual {{transmissions}} {{require the}} operation of an extra pedal, and keeping {{the car in the}} correct gear at all times, they require a bit more concentration, especially in heavy traffic situations. The automatic transmissions, on the other hand, simply require the driver to speed up or slow down as needed, with the car doing the work of choosing an appropriate gear. Manual transmissions also place a greater workload on the driver in heavy traffic situations, when the driver must operate the clutch pedal quite often. Because the clutch pedal can require a substantial amount of force, especially on large trucks, and the long <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> compared to the brake or accelerator requires moving the entire leg, not just the foot near the ankle, a manual transmission can cause fatigue, and is more difficult for weak or injured people to drive. Additionally, because automatic transmissions can be driven with only one foot, people with one leg that is missing or impaired can still drive, unlike the manual transmission that requires the use of two feet at once. Likewise, manual transmissions require the driver to remove one hand periodically from the steering wheel while the vehicle is in motion, which can be difficult or impossible to do safely for people with a missing or impaired arm, and requires increased coordination, even for those with full use of both hands.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Brake By Wire is replacing the traditional mechanical control systems with ECUs and it is raising the need to reproduce feelings of eliminated static mechanical components (i. e. hydraulic fluids, pumps and cylinders). Thanks to electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces (i. e. active pedal) {{it is possible to}} reproduce such feelings and, therefore, arbitrarily change their features. In this way {{it will be possible to}} customize the pedal feelings and the vehicle deceleration needed depending on several factors (i. e. surrounding braking scenario, driver characteristics, race vs day-by-day driving condition). Since braking maneuvers are typically critical and involve the driver, the design and development of brake by wire system must start from the consideration of human factors in order to increase acceptance and braking effectiveness. The objective of this research was to redesign the pedal feelings, making them adaptable to the surrounding. Driver acceptance and braking effectiveness could be highly improved by means of adaptive pedal feelings. The starting points of this research were humans factors in the braking domain. Literature and relevant studies have been taken into consideration to put into evidence human mechanisms and behaviors during braking phases. On such basis, two main results have been found out: braking use cases and pedal feeling curves. With regard to the pedal feelings curves, 4 different pedal curves which describe both force on brake <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> and acceleration on brake <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> are designed. The pedal feeling depends on several factors like the <b>pedal</b> <b>travel,</b> the pedal idle travel, the effort, responsiveness, deceleration perceived, ease of balance (i. e. ease of modulation), gradual braking and so on. Regarding braking use cases, they are described by vehicle data as speed, acceleration, angles and relevant rates, engine rpm, gas and brake pedal position/speed and so on. These use cases have been clustered in order to meet the 4 pedal curves. The research continued on the implementation of a Matlab/Simulink/Stateflow model for the use case recognition. Basing on the vehicle data, the model is able to find out in which use case the vehicle is (parking, low speed maneuvers, emergency, downhill, and so on). Once it finds out the scenario, the model applies the most appropriate pedal feeling curve (both force feedback and deceleration needed). In the end, the model commands an EC brushless motor which is responsible of the changing of static springs force feedback of the pedal. The scenario recognition model has been validated through vehicle data on real road whereas the pedal feeling and relevant motor behaviors have been validate on bench tests...|$|E
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study has}} been conducted in a fixed-base research simulator to assess the directional handling qualities for various rudder pedal feel characteristics for commercial transport airplanes. That is, the effects of static pedal force at maximum <b>pedal</b> <b>travel,</b> breakout force, and maximum <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> on handling qualities were studied. An artificial maneuver with a severe lateral wind shear and requiring runway tracking {{at an altitude of}} 50 feet in a crosswind was used to fully exercise the rudder pedals. Twelve active airline pilots voluntarily participated in the study and flew approximately 500 maneuvers. The pilots rated the maneuver performance with various rudder pedal feel characteristics using the Cooper- Harper rating scale. The test matrix had 15 unique combinations of the 3 static pedal feel characteristics. A 10 -term, second-order equation for the Cooper-Harper pilot rating {{as a function of the}} 3 independent pedal feel parameters was fit to the data. The test matrix utilized a Central Composite Design that is very efficient for fitting an equation of this form. The equation was used to produce contour plots of constant pilot ratings as a function of two of the parameters with the third parameter held constant. These contour plots showed regions of good handling qualities as well as regions of degraded handling qualities. In addition, a numerical equation solver was used to predict the optimum parameter values (those with the lowest pilot rating). Quantitative pilot performance data were also analyzed. This analysis found that the peak values of the cross power spectra of the pedal force and heading angle could be used to quantify the tendency toward directional pilot induced oscillations (PIO). Larger peak values of the cross power spectra were correlated with larger (degraded) Cooper-Harper pilot ratings. Thus, the subjective data (Cooper-Harper pilot ratings) were consistent with the objective data (peak values of the cross power spectra) ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION In the Netherlands {{pedestrian}} and <b>pedal</b> cycle <b>travel</b> {{are important}} transport modes for the population. However, given the particularly vulnerable {{nature of these}} modes of transport, pedestrians and cyclists {{are involved in a}} large number of accidents and suffer a particularly high proportion of the fatalities and serious injuries. Technical measures to improve safety and efficiency focus almost exclusively on motorized traffic, disregarding the needs of the non-motorized traffic participants. In order to determine how technical measures, such as Road Tr&c Informatics (RTI) applications, can be used to increase the safety and mobility of pedestrians and cyclists, more information is needed about the causes of accidents to these groups. This report deals with a first analysis of the problems of cyclists and pedestrians in the Netherlands. Similar reports are being produced for Britain and Sweden which together will serve as a basic information source from which decisions can be made about which type of measures have potential to improve the situation of vulnerable road users. This report examines the nature and causes of accidents involving vulnerable road users (VRU's), their mobility patterns and their risk. It is intended to serve as a tool in subsequent stages of this project, and thus is not a general survey of safety and mobility problems for vulnerable road users, but rather a review of those issues that are related to the RTI measures envisaged by the project. The project is aimed at improving VRU safety and mobility both directly, through the enhancement of signalized junctions and pedestrian crossings, and indirectly, through the creation of a model of the traffic system incorporating vulnerable road users. It is intended that this model will permit the routing and guidance of motorized vehicles {{in such a way as}} to enhance VRU safety and reduce VRU annoyance and delay from traffic. Both the direct and the indirect measures envisaged will only be relevant to VRU safety and mobility on main roads in urban areas; they are unlikely to be applicable to residential streets or minor roads unless these have substantial VRU flows. The report therefore concentrates (in so far as existing information permits) on VRU safety and mobility on main roads and on VRU use of facilities that are intended to be upgraded through the planned RTI measures. The report covers both the national level for the Netherlands (about 14. 5 million inhabitants) and the local level for the City of Groningen (about 160, 000 inhabitants). Section 2 of this report seeks to define a number of the terms which are used throughout, and provides a basis for comparison between the findings from this report and those for Sweden and Britain. Section 3 identifies the sources of information from which the analyses of accident and mobility data have been derived. Sections 4 and 5 identify the safety and mobility situations of vulnerable road users at the national and local levels respectively. Section 6 examines the risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and finally Section 7 provides some conclusions and recommendations for RTI-measures...|$|R
40|$|A {{helicopter}} {{tail rotor}} {{is required to}} provide yaw control and essentially that alone. However, {{it is expected to}} achieve that role when placed in an aerodynamically difficult location on the aircraft and to operate in a severe aerodynamic environment. This paper describes the <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> behaviour caused by aerodynamic interaction between the main rotor wake, the sideways velocity and subsequent forces generated by the tail boom noticed in Sea King helicopters, operating in extreme conditions during the Falklands war. Using earlier research which showed the effectiveness of a modification – a strake – to interrupt the air flow over the tail boom, conducts tests to examine the flow, the effects of the modification, and the side suction force. It also finds that the strake provides a simple and cost-effective solution to the problem...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{the vehicle}} braking {{efficiency}} road test rules in GB 7258, the braking efficiency on-line monitoring index, parameter, method and threshold are studied. Mean fully developed deceleration (MFDD) is selected as the evaluation index. Pitch angle {{which is used to}} monitor the road slope(less than 1 %) is collected by gyroscope. Vehicle maximum deceleration is collected at the period of ABS working, which {{is to make sure that}} the road adhesion coefficient is more than 0. 7. Vehicle maximum braking deceleration is analyzed, and it is used to exclude driving on pit, decelerating band, road step, even crash and so on. The rapid stop is identified with brake <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> senor. MFDD is calculated with braking deceleration and wheel speed, and wheel speed is collected from ABS with can bus. MFDD threshold is determined with passenger capacity monitoring with card reader. Finally, the method of vehicle braking efficiency on-line monitoring and evaluation with MFDD is given...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{researched}} the vehicle braking sense in three aspects of human, vehicle and environment and analysed their impacts on brake feeling. Through the real vehicle test we analysed {{the relationship among}} pedal force, <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> and deceleration. We used dynamometer test method to study the brake noise question. We designed a fixture which could imitate the suspension and made the test more close to the true level. Moreover we discussed how to establish the evaluation system of vehicle braking condition. Through real vehicle test of braking, we can test and record the brake system parameters in the braking process under urban working conditions. We recorded the brake frequency, the change of brake speed and brake disc temperature. Meanwhile, based on the analysis of braking condition, we put forward the index of brake load to reflect the city’s traffic conditions. Experiment show that the braking condition and brake feel are related, braking condition also provides theoretical support {{for the design of}} brake system...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of mechanised logging and log skidding on some components of farm tractors used under the Tractor Hiring Units (THU) of the Ministry of Agriculture in Ondo State, Nigeria. Thirty tractors of various makes and models were examined after a period under logging operations based on a template of eight key criteria and thirty four sub criteria related to vital tractor systems and components. Data collected were analysed to determine {{the percentage of the}} components that are good, damaged but repairable or damaged or missing parts. The results show that the highest occurrence of failure are with worn out tyres (80 %), followed by broken rear work lights, headlamps and road warning lights (60 %) and broken lateral stabilizers (53. 3 %). Similarly, the least damaged components of tractors under the study were the tyre rims (66. 7 % good), wheel hubs and axle arms (56. 7 %) and hydraulic linkage arms and forks as well as brake <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> and release (46. 7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the active safety driving vehicle and {{alleviate}} the intension of driving fatigue, an intelligent control strategy of automobile cruise is put forward based on the throttle or braking pedal combined control adopting the fuzzy control theory. A fuzzy logic controller is presented, which consists of the two input variables, the deviation of the theoretical safe distance and relative distance and the relative velocity between the preceding vehicle and the cruise vehicle, and the single output variable, that is, the throttle opening or the braking <b>pedal</b> <b>travel.</b> Taking the test data of 1. 6 [*]L vehicle with auto-transmission as an example, the function on the intelligent cruise control system is simulated adopting MATLAB/Simulink aiming at different working conditions on the city road.

The research results can offer the theory and technology reference for setting dSPACE type and developing the integrated control product of automobile cruise system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{material}} selection and design selection of high performance floating brake calliper. The main function of brake {{system is to}} decelerate or stop a car. Disc brake system consist of brake rotor, brake pads and brake calliper. Most of the commercial vehicles use brake calliper made of Gray cast iron which possess heavy weight results in high fuel consumption. Another major problem is calliper being deflection during clamping action, known as “bending of bridge” will results in extended <b>pedal</b> <b>travel</b> since additional braking fluid volume is required to compensate for deflections, reduce comfort, driving feelings and safety of vehicle. The demand of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) is greatly increased in automotive industry since it having a lower density, higher strength and comparable modulus of elasticity as compared to Gray cast iron. The objective of this thesis is to study the advantages of Magnesium hybrid MMC to replace conventional brake calliper and proposed few innovative design alternatives for automotive industry. This is done by creating an original brake calliper and validate for appropriate material using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), followed by select optimum design. In design selection, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach was used to rank the design parameters, few alternative designs were created using CatiaV 5 R 17 and analyzed for static structural analysis using FEA. In the end, best floating brake calliper design among those alternative designs was selected using Super Decision software. For further research, these fresh designs could be act as benchmark for further developed and tested for automotive applications...|$|E
