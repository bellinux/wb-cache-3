40|$|The {{choice of}} a Paleocene/Eocene (P/E) Global Standard Stratotype-section and Point (GSSP) is {{complicated}} by the fact that there exists confusion on the exact denotation of the Paleocene and Eocene Series and their constituent lower rank (stage) units. While we can now resolve this problem by recourse to rigorous historical analysis, actual placement of the GSSP is further exacerbated by an embarrassment of riches (in regards to 7 criteria suitable for characterising and correlating a PIE GSSP but which span a temporal interval of greater than 2 my). Following the precept that the boundaries between higher level <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> are to be founded upon the boundaries of their lowest constituent stages in a nested hierarchy, we note that one of the criteria providing global correlation potential (a stable isotope excursion in marine and terrestrial stratigraphies) lies at a stratigraphic level more than !my older than the base of the stratotypic Ypresian Stage to which the base of the Eocene Series has been subordinated until now. Lowering a <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>unit</b> by this extent risks a significant modification to the original geohistorical denotation of the Ypresian Stage and the Eocene Series. We discuss here four options that are open to Voting Members of the Paleogene Subcommission. One solution consists in adjusting slightly the base of the Ypresian Stage (and, thus, the Eocene Series) so as to be correlatable on the basis of the lowest occurrence/First Appearance Datum (LO/FAD) of the calcareous nannofossil species Tribrachiatus. digitalis. Another solution would be to decouple series and stages so that the Ypresian Stage remains essentially unaltered but the base of tbe Eocene is relocated so as to be correlated on the basis of the Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE). Two (compromise) solutions consist in erecting a new stage for the upper/terminal Paleocene (between the Thanetian [sensu Dollfus] and Ypresian Stages) characterised at its base by the global stable isotope excursion. The P/E GSSP may then be placed at the base of the stratotypic Ypresian Stage (thus preserving historical continuity and conceptual denotation and stability) or at the base of the newly erected stage (facilitating correlation of the base of the Eocene series, at least in principle). Both GSSPs should be placed in suitable marine stratigraphic sections yet to be determined but upon which there is considerable current investigative activity...|$|R

More or less effective recognition of such a unit today (with annual/decadal resolution) is facies-dependent and variably compromised by the disturbance of stratigraphic superposition that commonly occurs at geologically brief temporal scales, and that particularly affects soils, deep marine deposits and the pre- 1950 parts of current urban areas. The Anthropocene, thus, {{more than any other}} geological time unit, is locally affected by such blurring of its chronostratigraphic boundary with Holocene strata.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of <b>chronostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> such as geological Systems and Series depends upon {{an ability to}} equate succession in rock strata {{with the passage of}} time, and upon a pervasive Law of Superposition. These assumptions hold true at a gross scale. But, at fine scales of stratigraphic resolution, they commonly break down. Thus, bioturbation in Phanerozoic marine deposits typically homogenizes sedimentary packages spanning millennia, affecting biostratigraphic, isotopic and paleornagnetic signals, and post-burial mass transport phenomena such as large-scale sedimentary slumps and intra-stratal diapirs locally disrupt superpositional relationships on a larger scale. Furthermore: the multi-stage transport of microfossils prior to final burial complicates the relationship between depositional and biostratigraphic ages; paleomagnetic signals, imposed at shallow burial depths, may be distinct from depositional ages; and high precision zircon U-Pb dates from tuff layers determine time of crystallization in the magma, rather than depositional age. In such circumstances, depositional units cannot be unambiguously equated with time units: because they include multiple temporal components, they cannot be subdivided precisely into time-rock units. By contrast, the different phenomena which have contributed to constructing sedimentary deposits, pre-, syn- and post-depositional, may be effectively accommodated within a unitary geological time framework...|$|R
