Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females).

5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as <b>premenstrual</b> <b>syndrome</b> in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E

40|$|Several {{forms of}} {{depression}} {{are unique to}} women because of their apparent association with changes in gonadal hormones, which in turn modulate neuroregulatory systems associated with mood and behavior.

The serotonergic antidepressants consistently show efficacy for severe <b>premenstrual</b> <b>syndromes</b> (PMSs) and <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and are the first-line treatment for these disorders. The use of antidepressants for postpartum depression is compromised by concerns for effects in the infants of breast-feeding mothers, but increasing evidence suggests the relative safety of the antidepressant medications, and the risk calculation should be made on an individual basis. Estradiol may be effective for postpartum depression and for moderate-to-severe major depression in the perimenopause.

The specific term <b>premenstrual</b> <b>syndrome</b> appears to date from an article published in 1953 by Dalton and Green in the British Medical Journal. Since then, PMS has been a continuous presence in popular culture, occupying a place that is larger than the research attention accorded it as a medical diagnosis. It has been argued that women are partially responsible for the medicalization of PMS. [...] By legitimizing this disorder, women have contributed to the social construction of PMS as an illness. [...] It has also been suggested that the public debate over PMS and PMDD was impacted by organizations who had a stake in the outcome including feminists, the American Psychiatric Association, physicians and scientists. Until the 1950s, there was little research done surrounding PMS and it was not seen as a social problem. [...] By the 1980s, however, viewing PMS in a social context had begun to take place.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the risk of}} antepartum depression (APD) among pregnant women. In particular stress before pregnancy, stress during pregnancy, marital relationship, social support, husband’s mental status and monthly expenditure. The subjects consisted of 580 pregnant women in the third trimester, who attended antenatal care at the Department of Obstetrics of the Persahabatan Hospital Jakarta from November 1, 1999 to August 15, 2001. Antepartum depression was screened by a psychiatrist using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Information on demographic and personal characteristics were collected from fill-in form. Through this form, the respondent gave information on stress before and during pregnancy, and from questionnaires Kuestioner Dukungan Sosial (KDS), Kesesuaian Hubungan Suami Istri (KHSI) and the Symptom Check List- 90 (SCL- 90) information about social support, marital relationship, and husband’s mental status were collected respectively. The prevalence of APD was 18 %. Antepartum depression and non-antepartum depression were similar in terms of age groups, level of education, occupations, monthly expenditures, number of pregnancies, number of children, number of deliveries, physical health condition, and history of <b>premenstrual</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Pregnant women with stress before pregnancy had a two-fold risk of APD [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2. 04; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1. 12 – 3. 74] compared to pregnant women without stress before pregnancy. In addition, when compared to pregnant women without stress during pregnancy, those with stress during pregnancy had 2. 2 -fold risk of developing APD (adjusted OR= 2. 13, 95 % CI: 1, 27 - 3, 74). In conclusion, stress before and during pregnancy increased the risk antepartum depression. Therefore, attention should be paid to pregnant women with these risk factors.
