25|$|Crystallization is {{a complex}} and extensively-studied field, because {{depending}} on the conditions, a single fluid can solidify into many different possible forms. It can form a single crystal, perhaps with various possible phases, stoichiometries, impurities, defects, and habits. Or, it can form a <b>polycrystal,</b> with various possibilities for the size, arrangement, orientation, and phase of its grains. The final form of the solid {{is determined by the}} conditions under which the fluid is being solidified, such as the chemistry of the fluid, the ambient pressure, the temperature, and the speed with which all these parameters are changing.|$|E
40|$|Taylor {{orientation}} {{factors for}} strain hardening in textured and random <b>polycrystals</b> of magnesium {{were derived from}} {{the ratio of the}} strain hardening rates of <b>polycrystals</b> to that of single crystals deforming by equivalent polyslip. For <b>polycrystals</b> with textures that inhibit basal and prismatic slip while favouring pyramidal polyslip, the Taylor factor is estimated to be between 2. 1 and 2. 5, increasing to about 4. 5 for randomly textured <b>polycrystals.</b> The micromechanics of strain hardening in <b>polycrystals</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} grain {{segmentation}} by { 10 (1) over bar 2 } mechanical twinning on the strain-hardening behaviour of textured and random <b>polycrystals</b> is assessed using the Kocks-Mecking method of analysis. Profuse twinning {{in the first}} 6 - 8 % strain in textured <b>polycrystals</b> has relatively small strengthening effects despite the large volume fraction of grains undergoing twinning. This {{is due to the}} small value of the Hall-Petch constant in textured <b>polycrystals.</b> For random <b>polycrystals,</b> the Hall-Petch constant is much larger but the overall hardening effect is reduced due to the Small volume fraction of grains undergoing twinning. Additional hardening effects due to the twinning crystallographic transformation on dislocation mobility are deemed small in cast <b>polycrystals</b> due to their low dislocation density, but may be more important in textured <b>polycrystals</b> with higher dislocation densities. Grain size-independent storage of dislocations accounts for the strain hardening at large strains...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} friction of magnesium single crystals, bicrystals and <b>polycrystals</b> {{has been studied}} between room temperature and 450 °C. There is no {{internal friction}} peak in the single crystals, but a prominent relaxation peak appears at around 160 °C in <b>polycrystals.</b> The activation energy of the peak is 1. 0 eV, {{which is consistent with}} the grain boundary self-diffusion energy of Mg. Therefore, the peak in <b>polycrystals</b> can be attributed to grain boundary relaxation. For the three studied bicrystals, the grain boundary peak temperatures and activation energies are higher than that of <b>polycrystals,</b> while the peak heights are much lower. The difference between the internal friction peaks in bicrystals and <b>polycrystals</b> is possibly caused by the difference in the concentrations of segregated impurities in grain boundaries...|$|R

500|$|Diamond {{can be one}} single, {{continuous}} crystal {{or it can be}} made up of {{many smaller}} crystals (<b>polycrystal).</b> Large, clear and transparent single-crystal diamonds are typically used in gemstones. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) consists of numerous small grains, which are easily seen by the naked eye through strong light absorption and scattering; it is unsuitable for gems and is used for industrial applications such as mining and cutting tools. Polycrystalline diamond is often described by the average size (or grain size) of the crystals that make it up. Grain sizes range from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers, usually referred to as [...] "nanocrystalline" [...] and [...] "microcrystalline" [...] diamond, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Not all solids are {{crystals}}. For example, when {{liquid water}} starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a polycrystalline structure. In the final block of ice, {{each of the}} small crystals (called [...] "crystallites" [...] or [...] "grains") is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole <b>polycrystal</b> {{does not have a}} periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the grain boundaries. Most macroscopic inorganic solids are polycrystalline, including almost all metals, ceramics, ice, rocks, etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as glass, are called amorphous solids, also called glassy, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the latent heat of fusion, but forming a crystal does.|$|E

40|$|Summary A central open {{problem in}} the study of shape memory <b>polycrystals</b> is the {{prediction}} of their recoverable strains. Solving this problem requires an understanding of the possible stress and strain fields that arise in such <b>polycrystals.</b> For <b>polycrystals</b> made of materials undergoing cubic-tetragonal transformations, we show that the strains fields associated with macroscopic recoverable strains are related to the solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations. We explore consequences of this relationship and connections to previous conjectures characterizing <b>polycrystals</b> with non-trivial recoverable strains. We also show that stress fields in shape memory <b>polycrystals</b> could be concentrated on lower-dimensional surfaces (planes and lines). We do this by proving a dual variational charac-terization of recoverable strains and presenting several examples. Implications of this characterization for effective properties and the development of numerical methods are discussed. THE SHAPE MEMORY EFFECT IN POLYCRYSTALS Shape memory (SM) effect is the ability of a solid to recover on heating apparently plastic deformation sustained below a critical temperature. Many alloys (e. g. NiAl, FeNiC) exhibit good SM behavior as single crystals but little or none as <b>polycrystals</b> while others (e. g. CuAlNi, NiTi) are good SM materials both as single crystals and as <b>polycrystals.</b> Since the utility of SM alloys critically depends on their polycrystalline behavior, this issue is of both scientific interest and technological importance. Thus we desire (a) to know the reason for this difference in the behavior of SM polycrystals; (b) to predict which materials generically exhibit good polycrystalline SM behavior; and (c) to characterize, for a give...|$|R

A phase field model is employed for BaTiO 3 <b>polycrystals,</b> {{coupled with the}} time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau theory and the oxygen vacancies diffusion, to demonstrate the interaction between oxygen vacancies and domain evolutions. To generate grain structures, the phase field model for grain growth is also used. The hysteresis loop and butterfly curve are predicted at room and high temperatures.

A computer simulation which generates thermodynamically consistent microstructures for arbitrary interfacial energies has been utilized to investigate microstructural evolution in such <b>polycrystals</b> when phase volume is not conserved. Since grain shapes, phase volume, and phase arrangements are dictated by interfacial energies, clustered-, alternating-, isolated-, and single-phase microstructures occur in different interfacial energy regimes. Despite great differences in microstructure, <b>polycrystals</b> which contain only three-grain junctions evolve with normal grain growth kinetics. In contrast, structures containing flexible four-grain junctions eventually stop evolving. We conclude that two-dimensional <b>polycrystals</b> continually evolve when grain junction angles are thermodynamically fixed, while grain growth ultimately ceases when grain junction angles may vary. Predictions concerning three-dimensional and phase-volume conserved systems are made...|$|R
