40|$|The muon {{spectrometer}} of the ATLAS experiment {{makes use}} of the Resistive Plate Chambers detectors for particle tracking in the barrel region. The level- 1 muon trigger system has to measure and discriminate muon transverse momentum, perform a fast and coarse tracking of the muon candidates, associate them to the bunch crossing corresponding to the event of interest, measure the second coordinate in the non-bending projection. The on-detector electronics first collects front-end signals coming from the two inner RPC stations on the low-pT <b>PAD</b> <b>boards,</b> each one covering a region of ∆η×∆φ= 0. 2 × 0. 2, and hosting four Coincidence Matrix ASICs. Each CMA performs the low-pT trigger algorithm and data readout on a region of ∆η×∆φ= 0. 2 × 0. 1. Data coming from the four CMAs are assembled by the low-pT PAD logic. Each low-pT <b>PAD</b> <b>board</b> sends data to the corresponding high-pT <b>PAD</b> <b>boards,</b> located on the outer RPC station. Four CMA on each board {{make use of the}} low-pT trigger result and of the front-end signals coming from the outer RPC stations to perform the high-pT algorithm. The overall results are assembled by the high-pT PAD logic and sent via optical fibre to the off-detector electronics. Each optical receiver board collects data from six or seven fibres, covering a region of ∆η×∆φ= 1. 0 × 0. 1. Trigger data are sent to the local Sector Logic, which elaborates trigger data and sends them to the Muon Central Trigger Processor Interface via dedicated copper links. Readout data are sent to the Read-Out Driver...|$|R

50|$|In churches with a {{tradition}} of public kneeling prayer, pews are often equipped with kneelers {{in front of the}} seating bench so members of the congregation can kneel on them instead of the floor. These kneelers essentially have long, usually <b>padded</b> <b>boards</b> which run lengthwise parallel to the seating bench of the pew. These kneeler boards may be 15 cm or so wide and elevated perhaps 10-15 cm above the floor, but dimensions can vary widely. Permanently attached kneelers are often made so they can be rotated or otherwise moved up out of the way when the congregation members are not kneeling.|$|R

50|$|Cranial {{modification}} was {{a procedure}} that occurred when an individual was still young, usually during infancy because the cranial bones are still soft at this stage and capable of morphing. An infant would be bound between <b>padded</b> <b>boards</b> to make cause a tabular effect {{in the growth of}} the skull. Another method was to wind a band tightly around the head for an annular effect. Both of these methods produced an elongated shape of the head. This practice was seen as a desirable trait and often practiced in the upper classes; however it could be common on women in working positions because they would often carry children on their back for elongated periods of time.|$|R

40|$|A triple-gas {{electron}} multiplier (GEM) detector, operated with the gas mixture Ar/CO 2 /CF 4 (45 / 15 / 40), {{is going to}} equip station M 1, region RI of the LHCb muon system. A Module- 0 of this detector, with full area (20 cm x 24 cm) GEM foils, was recently built and tested. In this paper, new measurements of efficiency and pad multiplicity are presented. These new measurements were very important to select of the final <b>pad</b> <b>board</b> configuration. The sensitivity to discharges {{is a very important}} issue in this type of detector; we discuss here new measurements of the maximum number of discharges that a triple-GEM detector can stand before breakdown, and we show that detector operation in LHCb is safe from this point of view. We also discuss new measurements of the time performance of the detector in the presence of background radiation, indicating that no significant deterioration of the performances is expected in the LHCb environment...|$|R
