5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. <b>Pharmacological</b> <b>data</b> on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E

This replaces and expands upon the original 2009 IUPHAR Database (standard abbreviation IUPHAR-DB) [...] The Guide to PHARMACOLOGY aims to provide a concise overview of all pharmacological targets, accessible to all members of the scientific and clinical communities and the interested public, with links to details on a selected set of targets.

50|$|Data from {{epidemiological}} studies additionally propose {{that there is}} an affiliation between kleptomania and substance use disorders along with high rates in a unidirectional manner. Phenomenological data maintain that there is a relationship between kleptomania and drug addictions. A higher percentage of cases of kleptomania has been noted in adolescents and young adults, and a lesser number of cases among older adults, which imply an analogous natural history to that seen in substance use disorders. Family history data also propose a probable common genetic input to alcohol use and kleptomania. Substance use disorders are more common in kin of persons with kleptomania than in the general population. Furthermore, <b>pharmacological</b> <b>data</b> (e.g., the probable efficacy of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, in the treatment of both kleptomania and substance use disorders) could present additional support for a joint relationship between kleptomania and substance use disorders. Based on the idea that kleptomania and substance use disorders may share some etiological features, it could be concluded that kleptomania would react optimistically to the same treatments. As a matter of fact, certain nonmedical treatment methods that are successful in treating substance abuse are also accommodating in treating kleptomania.|$|E

40|$|Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{a chronic}} {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically {{defined in terms}} of motor symptoms. These are preceded by prodromal non-motor manifestations that prove the systemic nature of the disease. Identifying genes and pathways altered in living patients provide new information on the diagnosis and pathogenesis of sporadic PD. Methods: Changes in gene expression in the blood of 40 sporadic PD patients and 20 healthy controls ("Discovery set") were analyzed by taking advantage of the Affymetrix platform. Patients were at the onset of motor symptoms and before initiating any <b>pharmacological</b> treatment. <b>Data</b> analysis was performed by applying Ranking-Principal Component Analysis, PUMA and Significance Analysis of Microarrays. Functional annotations were assigned using GO, DAVID, GSEA to unveil significant enriched biological processes in the differentially expressed genes. The expressions of selected genes were validated using RT-qPCR and samples from an independent cohort of 12 patients and controls ("Validation set"). Results: Gene expression profiling of blood samples discriminates PD patients from healthy controls and identifies differentially expressed genes in blood. The majority of these are also present in dopaminergic neurons of the Substantia Nigra, the key site of neurodegeneration. Together with neuronal apoptosis, lymphocyte activation an...|$|R

Macrolides and aminoglycosides have a lower activity. The β-lactams and tetracyclines—alone or combined with imidazoles–macrolides or aminoglycosides are the antibiotics advised to treat pasteurellosis and infections after bites or scratchs.

40|$|Current {{treatment}} {{strategies have}} dramatically improved outcome of treatment of HIV- 1 in both adults and children. Meanwhile, {{when compared to}} adults, rates of successful suppression of HIV are lower in children.

For this purpose, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships and drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral agents were investigated.
