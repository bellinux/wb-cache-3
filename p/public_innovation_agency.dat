The building Neapolis <b>Public</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Agency</b> for ICT and multimedia, was built in 2006. Located 46 km from Barcelona and 44 km from Tarragona, it has the third largest port of Catalonia and is a major fishing port. The Brotherhood of Pescadors of Vilanova derives from the powerful and ancient Brotherhood of Sant Elm (founded in 1579). In 1921 the new Pòsit de Pescadors (Fishermen's Archive) was founded. Today fresh fish may be purchased directly on the Internet fish auction. Vilanova i la Geltrú has a estació Nàutica which hosts major sailing competitions at the national and international levels.|$|E
40|$|How {{to design}} {{national}} programmes that can increase innovativeness among existing companies {{is a challenge}} for <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>agencies.</b> Therefore Vinnova, the Swedish Governmental <b>Agency</b> for <b>Innovation</b> Systems, commissioned this study to get an overview of interesting initiatives globally to learn from. Among issues covered are how to initiate sustained change processes in companies and how to scale programmes from pilot projects to broad national impact. Initially 200 programmes globally were surveyed and through a step-wise process finally seven programmes were identified for in-depth analysis. These seven were selected based on that they could provide different and complementary insights into how to design dissemination processes in practice. The seven programmes were: IMP³rove in Europe, Innovation Engineering System in the USA, Stage-Gate® in Canada, CENTRIM and GrowthAccelerator in the UK, TYKES/Liideri in Finland, and Production Leap in Sweden. The programmes were in themselves organisational innovations that had been continuously refined and re-invented due to learning processes among stakeholders in the programmes. Most programmes had standardised their work methods and tools but provided flexibility in the detailed outlining of the solution delivered to client firms. Programmes designed to scaling up accomplished this trough training of consultants combined with accreditation for quality assurance. Almost all programmes also used some kind of learning networks with peer-to-peer mechanisms for learning, but the outcome varied, {{partly due to the}} availability of experienced facilitators. Most programmes followed a standard design of dissemination steps by first creating an awareness activity which also served to identify potential candidates. The impact of interventions in the Innovation Management field are difficult to measure and analyse and programmes are usually measured in terms of fulfilment of program goals supplemented by qualitative perception data from participants...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{object of}} this {{research}} is <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support in European Economic Area and its effectiveness assessment. The main aim is to propose a new model for <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support effectiveness assessment, adjusted to contemporary needs and based on practice of <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support development. Research Design & Methods: The methods of comparative, cluster, regression, modelling analysis, multi-criteria evaluation, analogy search, logical abstraction and impact evaluation have been applied for the research presented in this paper. Findings:  The paper conceptualizes a new model for the assessment of <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support. It is based on theoretical argumentation and practical verification. Its structure is based on new solutions and quantitative assessment methods. Implications & Recommendations: The analysis of the proposed model applicability revealed important patterns for the <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support impact assessment. Findings suggest that the increase of <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support index is a necessary but insufficient condition for the growth of the countries innovation index. The impact of <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support occurs only in the long run, as the delay of the effect exists. Contribution & Value Added: The proposed system of quantitative and qualitative indicators that characterize any <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support system (<b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support index) enables the creation and implementation of measures devoted to the <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support impact improvement at EU and national level. The practical application of the suggested model is significant for the effectiveness improvement of <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support at EU institutions...|$|R

40|$|In the European Union (EU), twenty Member States offer <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> {{support for}} private {{research}} and development (R&D) activities through either subsidies {{or a combination of}} tax cuts and subsidies. Existing studies show ambiguous results regarding the effectiveness of <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support in different countries. Accordingly, following a description of the current <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> framework in Europe, this paper analyses data from the European Community Innovation Survey concerning the effectiveness of public support. The measures chosen relate to changes in turnover as well as the number of employees and labour productivity (measured as turnover per employee) between 2006 and 2008. The paper finds a positive influence of <b>public</b> <b>innovation</b> support on labour productivity in an innovating company, a negative influence on turnover changes and a negative yet not significant influence on the development of employment. The influences of these factors are very weak, whereas other coefficients such as the money spent on innovative activities clearly show positive effects for all three indicators...|$|R

40|$|Towards a localised, {{comprehensive}} EU {{innovation policy}} This paper argues that EU policy makers must draw together market, social and <b>public</b> <b>innovation,</b> often already supported {{at the local}} level, if contemporary and future challenges are to be successfully addressed. Innovation has increased in importance for European policy making over many years, particularly as the post-recession search for economic growth gathers pace. Yet until now the focus has emphasised market actors and economic outcomes, ignoring the potential of social and <b>public</b> <b>innovation.</b> A new bottomup approach based on a comprehensive understanding of innovation will have local authorities at its core, due to the existing excellence displayed at this level in supporting and delivering innovation today.

40|$|The role of farming, {{previously}} dedicated {{mainly to}} food production, changed with an increasing {{recognition of the}} multifunctionality of agriculture and rural areas. It seems obvious to expect that farmers and rural actors adapt themselves to these new conditions, wich are innovative and redefine their job.

Often, however, there is {{a gap between the}} need for change and farmers' willingness to adjust, and the insufficient capacities of <b>innovation</b> <b>agencies</b> and advisory services to effecively support changes.
