Operating the ion mobility drift tube at elevated <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> (expressed in V cm− 1 torr− 1) reduces separation times and increases ion transmission efficiencies. Several accounts in the literature suggest that performing ion mobility separation at elevated <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> can change the selectivity of ion separation.

The reduction of high electric <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> for increasing the threshold voltage for partial discharge has been studied in several publications based on experiments as well as on simulations. Simulations allow the localization of the critical spots and the quantification of the maximum electric <b>field</b> <b>strength.</b> However, a systematic study of the singularities of the electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> at the sharp edges is lacking. Such singularities are investigated in this article. The calculation of an absolute electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> value is only possible for finite edge radii. For sharp edges, however, the maximum electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> returned by simulation depends on the grid size: Through the finite grid size a virtual edge radius is induced that suppresses the singularity {{at the edge}}. To get around this problem, a mesh-independent evaluation procedure is introduced. With this procedure it is possible to quantitatively evaluate the electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> in the vicinity of the sharp edge.
