50|$|A {{constant}} west wind {{keeps the}} island largely grass-covered, {{but it is}} also home to <b>Painted</b> <b>Maple</b> and Mongolian Oak. The waters around the island are rich in aquafauna, namely Arabesque greenling and righteye flounder in spring, Hexagrammos otakii (a Japanese species of greenling) in summer, mackerel and Japanese amberjack in autumn, and Arabesque greenling and octopus in winter.|$|R
50|$|Also {{found on}} the island are the grey-sided vole and harbour seal. Trees include the green alder, <b>painted</b> <b>maple,</b> and Erman's birch; other plants, Sakhalin {{knotweed}} and Parasenecio hastatus. At the southwest tip of the island at an elevation of approximately 105 metres is Akkeshi Lighthouse (厚岸灯台), which began operations on 25 November 1890. Of the island's 107 hectares, 64 are owned by the state, 42 by the municipality, and 1 is in private hands.|$|R

40|$|The <b>maple</b> <b>aphid,</b> Periphyllus californiensis, {{lives on}} maple trees {{the whole year}} round. We {{observed}} populations of this aphid in Tanashi wood, a suburb of Tokyo, and tried to analyze the factors in determining the density. Four study plots were established in the wood, and five branches were chosen as sample branches {{from each of the}} 4 - 6 sample trees in each plot. Numbers of the aphid and its natural enemies were counted on the part of 40 cm long {{from the top of the}} sample branch. 1. Larvae hatched from overwintered eggs in early March. Winged aphids dispersed in mid-April, and aestivating dimorphs were reproduced from April to May. The aestivating dimorphs monlted in mid-October. Winged aphids appeared again in mid-November, and produced wingless females that deposited eggs mostly in December. 2. The population had two peaks in a year; once in spring and once in autumn. The peak in spring was realized after the dispersal of winged aphids, but the populations suffered high mortality due to syrphids, mostly Epistrophe balteata, soon after the population reached to high levels. Syrphid larvae consumed a large number of aphids in a short time, and almost all the aphids on a sample tree disappeared soon after the syrphids appeared on the tree. The mortality due to syrphid larvae was caused density-dependently, and syrphids were considered to have played an important role in decreasing the aphid population to lower density levels. 3. The mortality of aestivating dimorphs in summer, reproduction after the dispersal of winged aphids, and the decrease in population density after the reproduction in autumn were all caused density-independently. The mortality of aestivating dimorphs in summer was especially high and the aphid populations in three out of the four study plots decreased to zero. However, after the dispersal of winged aphids in autumn, populations were restored again in all the plots. 4. The aphid lived mostly on inflorescences or key fruits during the period from dispersal of winged aphid in spring to just before the dispersal of winged aphid in autumn, and the aphid lived on leaves in autumn and lived on buds or young shoots in spring before dispersal. Thus, though the <b>aphid</b> infests <b>maple</b> trees the whole year round, it utilized different parts of the host tree at different stages in its life-cycle. This suggests that the best reproduction and development of the aphid is realized on some certain part of the tree which changes seasonelly. The dispersal of winged aphids seems to contribute to find the most suitable place for reproduction and development. モミジニタイケアブラムシ（Periphyllus californiensis）はカエデ類に寄生するアブラムシで，寄主交代はしない。本種の個体群を野外で観察し，その生活史を追跡するとともに，密度が決定される過程を解析した。調査は東京都下，東京大学演習林田無試験地内に設定した 4 調査区で行なった。このうち 2 調査区はオオモミジに，他の 2 調査区はイロハモミジに設定したものである。アブラムシと天敵類の個体数は，調査区を構成する 4 ～ 6 本のカエデについて，各 5 本の枝の枝先 40 cmの部分にいるものを直接観察で数えた。その結果である。 1 ．本種は 3 月上旬にふ化し， 4 月中旬に有翅虫による分散が見られ， 4 ～ 5 月に越夏型 1 齢幼虫が産みつけられた。越夏型 1 齢幼虫は 10 月中旬に脱皮し，発育を再開したが， 11 月中旬に有翅虫が分散し，有性虫による産卵は主として 12 月に見られた。 2 ．本種は 4 月と 11 月にピークをもつ 2 山型の発生経過をとり， 4 月のピークは有翅虫の分散後に見られた。しかし，主としてホソヒラタアブ（Epistroph balteata）による捕食によって，個体数は急激に減少した。ホソヒラタアブなどのヒラタアブ類幼虫はアブラムシ密度の高い木に多く見られ， 1 頭あたりの捕食量が大きく，かつ短かい期間に発育を完了することもあり，ほとんどすべてのアブラムシを食いつくした。この死亡は密度依存的にひき起こされており，ヒラタアブ類はモミジニタイケアブラムシの密度を制御するうえで重要なものであると判断された。 3 ．越夏型 1 齢幼虫の死亡，秋の有翅虫の分散後の増殖とその後の個体数の減少はアブラムシの密度に依存しない経過をとっていた。越夏型 1 齢幼虫の死亡率は高く， 3 調査区では絶滅するほどに密度が低下したが，秋の分散を経て再び個体群が形成された。 4 ．春の分散後，秋の分散が始まるまでの間は本種は主として花序や翅果上に，秋の分散後，春の分散までの間は芽や葉に多く寄生しているのが観察された。このように本種は 1 年間を通してカエデ樹上に生活するとはいえ，発育に応じて主たる寄生部位を変更しており，したがってその増殖と発育に適した部位は樹体内の限られた部分であり，しかもその部位はアブラムシの生活史に応じて季節的に変化することが示唆された。有翅虫の飛行分散はこのような好適な寄生の場を求めて行なわれていると考えられる...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 March 1911, the RCN was {{authorized}} {{the use of}} the White Ensign, which remained the main identifying flag of the navy for the next 54 years. At the same time, the Canadian Blue Ensign was designated the jack of the RCN. However, because naval tradition dictates that the jack is worn at the ship's bow only when moored or on [...] "dress ship" [...] occasions, HMC ships normally had no distinctly Canadian flags when under way, the White Ensign being identical to the Royal Navy's ensign. Because of this, a tradition developed of <b>painting</b> a green <b>maple</b> leaf on ships' funnels to mark the ship as Canadian.|$|R
5000|$|During the Mughal era, its use was {{extended}} to include many items of home furniture that were made in Kashmir. Many notable objects of this type are exhibited in museums {{in many parts of}} the world. The basic method followed was to apply the papier-mâché on wood work, and one such work can be seen in Kashmir at the Madin Sahib Mosque built in 1444, the ceiling of the Shah Hamdan Mosque and the Shalimar Garden, a Mughal garden in Srinagar. This tradition of using papier-mâché or pulp on wood work to be colourfully painted with different designs is very much in practice even today. Some of the older designs involved intricate <b>painting</b> of kingfishers, <b>maple</b> leaves and other designs, such as [...] "Arabesque", [...] "Yarkand" [...] and [...] "Hazara".|$|R
50|$|She was {{encouraged}} by her daughter-in-law, who brought pieces of cardboard and paint from her son's (professional painter) studio. Petronele was amazed that she could paint so quickly and effortlessly. She always had a clearly formed idea of the painting, its composition and combinations of colours in her head. She painted fast, hurrying as if in oblivion, without sketches, dabbing paint directly from the tube, mixing the colours right on the cardboard or canvas. First, with a dry brush, with its stem (“why stroke and daub needlessly”), Petronele would outline {{the place of the}} main character. She only used a palette for putting paint tubes on it. Like this, in one fell swoop, she created her first <b>painting,</b> “Under the <b>Maple,</b> Under the Green One…”: “This is after the song “under the maple, under the green one, there’s a young lad lying…” and, of course, a young girl is handing her heart to him. The girl’s heart is always bigger than the boy’s.|$|R
40|$|Acoustical {{effects can}} be created in the {{recording}} studio either authentically or by digitally emulating them over recorded sound. This paper provides preliminary analysis of sound data in {{the first step to}} creating a piece of software that would digitally emulate the presence of a reflecting surface in an environment. This project profiles drywall, cedar paneling, solid <b>maple,</b> <b>painted</b> brick, and carpeting. Various sound samples—in particular an acoustic guitar, a snare drum hit, and a kick drum hit—were played through a loudspeaker directed toward a surface of the material in question, and a microphone directed at the surface was used to digitally capture the reflected sound. The sound files were analyzed in several steps, including actually listening back as well as running spectral analysis to determine the degree of effect of the material on frequency. This was compared with what should be the expected results, based on known absorption coefficients, and in all cases the data was consistent and differences in frequency response were observable and measurable. 1...|$|R
