Applying Hallin and Mancini’s Comparative Framework {{outside the}} Western World, Katrin Voltmer {{discussed}} and criticised Hallin and Mancini’s work with special regards to methodology and its inapplicability to non-Western countries.

30|$|Homophily {{and group}} {{polarization}} are important concepts where like-minded individuals seek {{each other out}} and further strengthen their mindsets and even take them to more extreme levels [24]. A key dynamic of group <b>polarization</b> is group <b>identity</b> where individuals categorize themselves and others as in-group or out-of-group [24]. Group identification is particularly salient in political and ideological contexts [24]. For terrorist or extremist groups, this group identity is particularly important where individuals continually compare themselves against group categorizations and norms. Furthermore, threats to group identity tend to strengthen the homogeneity of the group [24]. This is particularly the case with terrorist groups, many of which highlight threats to their identity such as war crimes and maltreatment, bombing of civilians, as well as cases of discrimination and prejudice. Equally dangerous to strengthening group identity is the publication of victories against terrorists who are subsequently turned into heroes and martyrs [9]. Therefore, a strong group identity is imperative within the virtual institution.|$|R
50|$|Early {{criticisms of}} the concept raised the {{question}} of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity. Many men who hold great social power do not embody an ideal masculinity. Martin criticizes the concept for leading to inconsistent applications sometimes referring to a fixed type and other times to whatever the dominant form is. Wetherell and Edley contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and sexuality, rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social <b>polarization,</b> new class <b>identities</b> and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.|$|R

The thesis deals with the regional {{identity of}} the inhabitants of the Šumava foothills. The main goal of the thesis is to identify and evaluate the factors forming regional identity in the Šumava foothills which could be considered as a base for discussions on the possibilities of future regional development of this region. The thesis is based on general assumptions of study of territorial identities and border peripheries, which are based on heuristics of literature discussing the process of forming regional <b>identity,</b> <b>polarization</b> of space, and the problematics of the areas of peripheral and border regions. The assessment of differences of regional identity in continuously inhabited, partly relocated, and resettled areas is component objective which is focused on the definition and assessment categories determining the potential formation of regional identity.

Overall, he concludes that recent events have strengthened democracy in Taiwan. Dennis Hickey analyzes President Ma 2 ̆ 7 s responses to the central challenges facing Taiwan. He finds that Ma has stabilized relations with Beijing and Washington, although there is room for substantial improvements. in contrast, there has been little change in the political <b>polarization</b> on fundamental <b>identity</b> issues. John Hsieh charts the changes in the party system: from the two-party competition to the multi-party competition, and now back to the two-party competition He develops an explanatory model for this evolution based on social cleavages and electoral institutions in Taiwan. Steven Chan explains the growing economic integration between China and Taiwan, in the face of several important inhibiting factors.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{research}} of sociocultural integration {{as a tool for}} resolving regional conflicts. The modern theory of conflict resolution focuses on the ability of the sociocultural integration in the transformation of destructive identity-based conflicts into conflicts of interest. The author considers the systemic factors of the identity-based conflicts and emphasizes destabilizing role of the politicization of ethnicity. Ethnic mobilization, social inequalities, economic <b>polarization</b> and civic <b>identity</b> crisis are structural factors that determine the acuity of ethnic tension and escalation of regional identity conflicts as a result. Contradictions between the modernization system and social disintegration are the primary source of identity conflicts in theNorth Caucasus. Regionalization takes conflictogenic form in this case, i. e. the specifics of regional conflicts is associated with a conflict of static (traditionalization) and dynamic (modernization) types of social propagation. Structurally, escalation of violence in regional conflicts is determined by the intensity and scope of ethnic mobilization and social dissatisfaction as necessary conditions of a collision. Regional conflicts affect existentially meaningful collective values and group identities, that is why the participants are involved emotionally into identification conflicts; due to their emotional charge and irrationality, identity conflicts are no longer a means of overcoming social frustrations, but a destructive goal in itself, i. e. ethnicity polarization and negative cultural stereotypes in perceiving “the others” {{play a key role in}} initiating such conflicts. The following must be considered for discussing anti-conflict mechanisms of sociocultural integration in theNorth Caucasus. First, sociocultural integration is a political project with its content determined to a wide extent by defense challenges of the polyethnic Russian society. Second, development of the North Caucasian region after armed conflicts shows unacceptability and inability of orientation on isolationism of one or another ethno-social system within the Russian political space. Integration tasks of ensuring regional safety and overcoming ethnic contradictions in their most destructive form, which is the conflict of identities, are of systemic all-Russian nature. Sociocultural integration must serve as a conflict-preventive tool in this context, i. e. a pro-active action on the conflict environment by way of providing structural solutions for regional problems, transforming and rationalizing ethnic contradictions.  </p...|$|R
