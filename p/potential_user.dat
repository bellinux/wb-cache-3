500|$|Once Angband was {{released}} to the public via USENET, there were efforts to have code maintainers (the [...] "devteam") to fix bugs, clean up the code and implement suggestions into the code. Due to numerous shifts in those maintaining the code (due to other obligations), and the number of <b>potential</b> <b>user</b> suggestions to include, Angband would become highly forked, leading to a number of Angband variants; at least sixty known variants exist with about a half dozen still under active development. One significant fork was ZAngband (1994) (short for Zelazny Angband), which expanded on Angband and altered the theme towards Roger Zelazny's The Chronicles of Amber. The ZAngband codebase would be used to create Tales of Middle Earth (TOME) in 2002, which later swapped out the Tolkien and Zelazny fiction setting for a new original one to become Tales of Maj'Eyal (2009). The vanilla Angband remains in development today by the devteam.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Danmarks Rockmuseum (The Danish Rock Museum) has {{launched}} a beta version of what hopefully soon shall be a finished homepage, called Rockensdanmarkskort. dk. The site allows private people to upload stories or experiences from their own life in the Danish music environment. The stories will {{be a part of}} an online exhibition but the site is also {{to be seen as a}} community for the persons sharing their stories. This study investigates how to tell what the exact purpose from Danmarks Rockmuseum has been with this homepage and what the <b>potential</b> <b>users</b> will think of such a page. To get there I have used qualitative method by making interviews with both Danmarks Rockmuseum and a group of people that I argue is to be seen as the <b>potential</b> <b>users.</b> In an attempt to see the <b>potential</b> <b>users</b> as more than individuals, I have used Michel Maffesolis theory of neo tribalism and tried to regard the <b>potential</b> <b>users</b> as a tribe, based on the site Rockensdanmarkskort. dk...|$|R

50|$|In {{real estate}} appraisal, the cost {{approach}} {{is one of}} three basic valuation methods. The others are market, or sale comparison, and income.

The cost of construction minus depreciation, plus land, therefore is a limit, or at least a metric, of market value.|$|E

50|$|QBlade is an {{open source}} wind turbine {{calculation}} software, distributed under the GNU General Public License. The software is seamlessly integrated into XFOIL, an airfoil design and analysis tool. The purpose of this software is the design and aerodynamic simulation of wind turbine blades. The integration in XFOIL allows for the user to rapidly design custom airfoils and compute their performance curves, Extrapolating the performance data {{to a range of}} 360°Angle of attack, and directly integrate them into a wind turbine rotor simulation. The integration of QBlade into XFLR's sophisticated graphical user interface makes this software accessible to a large <b>potential</b> <b>user</b> community.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the general}} outline is completed, {{the next step}} is to {{describe}} the behavior of the system visible to the <b>potential</b> <b>user</b> of the system. While internal behaviors can be described as well, this is more related to designing a system rather than gathering requirements for it. The benefit of briefly describing internal behaviors would be to clarify with potential users that the system is not missing a vital component externally due to it being completed internally. The overall goal of this step is to provide just enough detail to understand what classes are required for the system. Too much detail can make it difficult to change the system later on.|$|E
