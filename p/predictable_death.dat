500|$|Seeds of Evil was {{originally}} designed to fit in a 12MB Nintendo 64 cartridge. Nevertheless, when cartridges prices fell, the storage was increased to 16MB, allowing the development team to add a multiplayer mode. The multiplayer levels were designed so that players could have all sort of mobility, including running, jumping, climbing and swimming. According to Dienstbier, this freedom of movement [...] "means that [...] have a lot less <b>predictable</b> <b>death</b> match play because [...] have far more possible escape routes within each level." [...] Unlike the single-player levels, the multiplayer maps feature more basic geometry. This choice was made to ensure a smooth frame rate. The cartridge size was ultimately increased to 32MB, which was the largest size for a Nintendo 64 game at the time. The actual development of the game took overall 21 months to complete and over 10,000 hours of game testing were reportedly conducted.|$|E

Other exclusion criteria included imminent and <b>predictable</b> <b>death,</b> active neurological condition such as status epilepticus, encephalopathy, chronic substance abuse (chronic alcohol use defined as ≥ 2 drinks per day and/or ≥ 14 drinks per week for men and ≥ 9 drinks per week for women, regular use of heroin, γ-hydroxybutyric acid, cocaine or amphetamines), chronic use of opioids prior to ICU admission (defined as regular use for a chronic medical reason reported by next of kin or per home medication list), spinal cord injury, and extubation during the first 72  h.|$|E
5000|$|Risk can {{be defined}} as the {{likelihood}} or probability of a given hazard of a given level causing a particular level of loss of damage (Alexander, 2000). David Alexander outlined the elements of risk as populations, communities, the built environment, the natural environment, economic activities and services which are under threat of disaster in a given area. Risk can be equated with a simple equation, although it is not mathematical. The total risk according to UNDRO 1982 is the [...] "sum of <b>predictable</b> <b>deaths,</b> injuries, destruction, damage, disruption, and costs of repair and mitigation caused by a disaster of a particular level in a given area or areas.|$|R
40|$|<b>Predictable</b> <b>deaths</b> from {{diseases}} like cancer account for approximately 83 % of deaths in China. Despite the {{growing numbers of}} terminally ill people from all diseases, palliative care is in its infancy. Factors that have slowed the development of palliative care include cultural values that encourage efforts to cure (even when such treatment {{is likely to be}} futile) over the alleviation of suffering, limited public policies and funding for palliative care, and poor education of healthcare professionals about end-of-life care. To improve the palliative care of people in China who are terminally ill, efforts should be made to integrate best practice into the healthcare system, while being sensitive to, and preserving cultural values. In this paper, suggestions are made for the future development of palliative care in China. Based on the World Health Organisation's public health model for integrating palliative care into existing healthcare services, these suggestions focus on public policy, education and training of healthcare professionals, lobbying of policy makers, and public education and information campaigns. Through working on the issues highlighted in this paper, China has an opportunity to improve the end-of-life care of people who are terminally ill...|$|R

[...] He added, [...] "The sibling rivalry/resolution meant {{to give the}} movie its sweet, heartfelt thread is weak, and there are stretches in which the comedy sags or settles for the <b>predictable.</b> But <b>Death</b> provides an adult tonic in a season typically abandoned to the comic book cocktail. There are worse ways to escape the August heat." ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Despite the {{identification}} of a small population of cells residing in the ciliary body (CB) of the adult mammalian eye that {{have the capacity to}} generate retina-like cells in vitro, their activity in vivo remains quiescent. The authors sought to identify whether the <b>predictable</b> and time-dependent <b>death</b> of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) results in activation of progenitorlike cells within the CB. METHODS. RGC injury was induced by optic nerve axotomy in adult mice. Thymidine-analogue lineage tracing and immunocytochemistry were used to identify dividing cells and the phenotype of newly generated progeny. RESULTS. Two populations of nestin-expressing cells are present in the CB of the uninjured eye. One population resides in periendothelial cells of blood vessels, and a second resides in the ciliary epithelium. Axotomy increases proliferation in th...|$|R
50|$|Yet {{this is not}} a {{conventional}} fantasy. It is set in a wholly barbaric land, where the ruling Masters are truly masters of their art of inflicting suffering. The whole story is told from the perspective of Carnelian, who in the first book has {{to come to terms with}} violence, maiming and death being visited on his family and those he has grown up with, having been raised by his father in exile and thus been sheltered from the casual violence of the society he has inherited to rule. In the second, he experiences the lot of a slave, being cast out together with Osidian (who was brought up at court so is thoroughly versed in the best of Masterly sadistic intrigue) before building a following amongst the plains people, leaving a steadily growing wake of death as they go. In the third the massed armies of the guarded land, together with all the weapons of destruction the Masters could devise are brought together with <b>predictable</b> results of <b>death</b> on an even greater scale than before.|$|R
40|$|The aim the study. Assess the {{severity}} of status, aggressiveness and invasiveness of treatment, and <b>predictable</b> risk of <b>death</b> in newborns with respiratory disorders in critical conditions and to identify the main factors of aggression, {{which can lead to}} higher mortality rates and aggressive treatment of children in the intensive care unit. Material and methods. The study group included newborns with monitoring respiratory distress (84 children) due to different neonatal pathology. A control group of comparison consisted of 15 healthy newborns. To assess the invasiveness and aggressiveness of treatment, we used a scale NTISS (Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring). Assessment of {{the severity}} of the newborn was evaluated on a scale Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP II and SNAPPE II) followed by calculation of the alleged risk of death. Adaptation abilities of the newborn evaluated using Apgar score at the first and fifth minutes after birth. The evaluation in lungs expirates state of prooxidant system. Results. Average NTISS score was 22. 4 ± 0. 2 points, resulting in a core group of newborns were attributed to monitoring class III severity and aggressiveness of treatment. Average on a scale of SNAP II and SNAPPE II among newborns with respiratory failure was 21. 4 ± 2. 55 points (prospective fatality rate of 3. 8...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{awareness}} of secondary insulin resistance and alterations in myocardial glucose utilization in congestive heart failure. Whether therapies that directly target these changes would be beneficial is unclear. We previously demonstrated that acute blockade of the insulin responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT 4 precipitates acute decompensated heart failure in mice with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy. Our current objective {{was to determine whether}} pharmacologic enhancement of insulin sensitivity and myocardial glucose uptake preserves cardiac function and survival in the setting of primary heart failure. Methodology/Principal Findings: The GLP- 1 agonist exenatide was administered twice daily to a murine model of dilated cardiomyopathy (TG 9) starting at 56 days of life. TG 9 mice develop congestive heart failure and secondary insulin resistance in a highly <b>predictable</b> manner with <b>death</b> by 12 weeks of age. Glucose homeostasis was assessed by measuring glucose tolerance at 8 and 10 weeks and tissue 2 -deoxyglucose uptake at 75 days. Exenatide treatment improved glucose tolerance, myocardial GLUT 4 expression and 2 -deoxyglucose uptake, cardiac contractility, and survival over control vehicle-treated TG 9 mice. Phosphorylation of AMP kinase and AKT was also increased in exenatide-treated animals. Total myocardial GLUT 1 levels were not different between groups. Exenatide also abrogated the detrimental effect of the GLUT 4 antagonist ritonavir on survival in TG 9 mice...|$|R

5000|$|To Joss Whedon, {{the tumor}} {{represented}} {{nothing more than}} cancer. He planned to kill Joyce {{as early as the}} third season, and he wrote the episode to reflect what he experienced when he lost his own mother to a brain aneurysm. In 2001, Whedon told an interviewer, [...] "I knew I was going to kill Joyce, and I knew that what I wanted to capture — because I had lost my own mother — was that weird dumb grief and the various reactions that people have to death." [...] "The Body" [...] begins with a Christmas dinner scene presided over by Joyce as the head of her chosen family. At the table are Buffy, Dawn, Giles, Willow, her girlfriend Tara (Amber Benson), Xander, and his ex-demon girlfriend Anya (Emma Caulfield). Pragmatically, the scene was included so the credits would not roll over the dramatic moments of Buffy finding her dead mother and trying to revive her. Whedon did not want to include any element that broke the illusion presented in the episode. In a realm where the main adolescent characters, who are becoming adults, must regularly face horrors and evils, Joyce represents a stable and <b>predictable</b> life. Her <b>death</b> crushes the illusion that real or normal life — which Buffy frequently says she wants but cannot have — is trouble-free. Joyce is mourned by all of the characters in the series. Even the amoral vampire Spike (James Marsters) expresses his condolences. In an earlier episode he had confided in a very sympathetic Joyce about his equally amoral and insane lover Drusilla (Juliet Landau) leaving him. Likewise, Anya, who has very little experience with human emotions and frailties, is confused and unexpectedly saddened by Joyce's death.|$|R
