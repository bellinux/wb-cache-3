5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{scholars}} divided inference {{into three}} types. The {{first is the}} expression of the connection existing between one proposition and another without any specific effective cause. Next, inference could mean <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> a state of things, which is not proved to have ceased, still continues. The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a toll {{was paid}} for each {{direction}} of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways. In 1997, the northbound toll was doubled (from 40p to 80p) and the southbound toll abolished on the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge, and that {{the removal of the}} southbound toll would result in a reduction of congestion without reducing revenue.|$|E
50|$|The Criminal Code {{gives the}} police {{a number of}} powers {{to assist in the}} {{enforcement}} of the offences, {{and there are a number}} of <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> assist in the prosecution of the offences.|$|R
50|$|So, {{why is this}} {{situation}} not arisen? The details are explored below but the basic <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> a patient will simultaneously contact the mains, with a catheter inserted, using equipment that grounds the catheter, is very, very unlikely.|$|R
60|$|After leaving {{upon your}} minds <b>that</b> <b>presumption,</b> not to operate without proof, but to operate {{along with the}} proof, (though, I take it, there are some <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> go {{the full length of}} proof,) I shall not press it to the length to which I think it would go, but use it only as auxiliary, assisting, and compurgatory of all the other evidences that go along with it.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} approach to Arctic exploration had relied on large-scale forces, with a <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> European techniques could be successfully transplanted into the hostile polar climate. Over the years this strategy had brought little success, and {{had led to}} heavy losses of men and ships. By contrast, Nansen's method of using small, trained crews, and harnessing Inuit and Sami expertise in his methods of travel, had ensured that his expedition was completed without a single casualty or major mishap.|$|E
5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E
50|$|Presumptions of {{the natural}} law are those <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> are not stated in the {{positive}} canon law, and as such do not constitute legal presumptions. Some presumptions {{of the natural}} law have been incorporated into the Rules of Law. Sometimes judges use natural law presumptions as their basis for judicial presumptions.|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{were often}} skeptical of Bartram's {{sympathetic}} {{description of the}} Creek, Seminole, Cherokee, and Choctaw Indians, which challenged <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> the Indians were primitive [...] "savages." [...] In addition to the Travels Bartram wrote other documents concerning his impressions of the southern Indians {{and the necessity of}} a humane public policy toward them.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{research}} into media audiences {{was dominated by}} the debate about [...] "media effects", in particular the link between screen violence and real-life aggression. Several moral panics fuelled the claims, such as the incorrect <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> Rambo had influenced Michael Robert Ryan to commit the Hungerford massacre, and that Child's Play 3 had motivated the killers of James Bulger.|$|R
5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following {{over the next}} few months. Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of The Web of Fear was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly. Episode 3 {{had been part of the}} same find, but by the end of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode had disappeared from the cache, with the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> it was sold to a private collector.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} have historically blocked residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington {{from participating in}} paid games, under a <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> DFS is illegal in these states due to the strictness of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions could easily be circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players in the five states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5000|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1982, halocins {{have been demonstrated}} to be diverse in a similar ways as the other bacteriocins. [...] Some are large proteins, some small polypeptides (microhalocins). This diversity is surprising {{for a number of}} reasons, including the original <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> Archaea, particularly extremophiles, live at relatively low densities under conditions that may not require antagonistic behavior.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, it also {{agreed with the}} Quebec Court of Appeal in {{concluding}} that the CEO of France Animation could not be held personally liable for copyright infringement {{on any of the}} grounds argued. The trial judge established Davin’s liability by presumption, but courts may only rely on <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> are [...] "serious, precise and concordant". In that respect, he erred.|$|R
5000|$|.....We need {{first to}} get clear on the {{character}} of Grice's maxims. They are not sociological generalizations about speech, nor they are moral prescriptions or proscriptions on what to say or communicate. Although Grice presented them in the form of guidelines for how to communicate successfully, I think they are better construed as presumptions about utterances, <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> we as listeners rely on and as speakers exploit (Bach 2005).|$|R
5|$|When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with {{currency}} {{notes on the}} occasion of the party's silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram’s birth anniversary on March 15, 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‘scandal’ on the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and declaring that the garland of {{currency notes}} was made from money through corrupt means and not from donations of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed.|$|E
5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western neighbors of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hearing was}} held {{the next day}} and González's uncle, Domingo Collazo, and her brother, Luis González, joined her (her fiancé was not {{permitted}} to miss his job). During the hearings, the family focused on the question of preserving González's honor and bringing her to New York. Inspectors weighed proof of legitimate family relations against <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> certain kinds of women were inadequate mothers and certain kinds of men were insufficient fathers and husbands. Williams said: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{historian}} John W. Dower {{comments that}} the film [...] "was a potpourri {{of most of the}} English speaking world's dominant clichés about the Japanese enemy, excluding the crudest, most vulgar, and most blatantly racist." [...] The film thus [...] "captured the passions and <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> underlay not only the ferocity of clash in Asia and the Pacific, but also the sweeping agenda of reformist policies that the Allied powers subsequently attempted to impose upon defeated and occupied Japan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. Concerning {{the birth}} of this person, the nobility and gentry of England who invited over the prince, as may {{be seen by the}} {{memorial}} they presented to his highness, alleged, that there were violent <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> he was not born of the queen's body, which, however, they desired to leave to examination in a free parliament; which also the said prince expressed in his declaration, and {{that he was willing to}} leave the same to a free parliament.|$|R
5|$|Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) {{are used}} on the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> they reduce PE, {{although}} their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established. In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios. The ACCP recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter are suggested. NICE recommends caval filters in settings where someone with an acute proximal DVT or PE cannot receive anticoagulation, and that the filter is removed when anticoagulation can be safely started. While IVC filters themselves {{are associated with a}} long-term risk of DVT, they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E
5|$|The fateful {{encounter}} between Margaðr and Guthormr is sometimes dated to 1052 on the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> Margaðr {{is identical to}} Echmarcach, and that the event must have taken place {{at the conclusion of}} Echmarcach's second reign in Dublin. In fact, the Old Norse personal name Margaðr is a form of the Gaelic personal name Murchad; and the aforesaid accounts of Margaðr likely refer to Echmarcach's nemesis Murchad, rather than Echmarcach himself. Although the saga claims that a thankful Guthormr donated a portion of his looted silver to the shrine of his saintly uncle at Niðaróss, it is unlikely that any church would have accepted property known to have been looted from Christians. Instead, it is possible that Guthormr's hoard of silver was actually the tax that Murchad which had collected from Mann in 1061 during the expulsion of Echmarcach. Such a date corresponds to the implied date of about 1061 given by Heimskringla.|$|E
40|$|We {{identify}} and debate all possibilities {{and challenges of}} assuming a critical vision of mathematics education within the reflective context of Bogota, Colombia. In order to reflect this idea, we create a narrative of a research professor who gradually decides to follow a critical perspective {{for the education of}} mathematics. With this narrative, we strive to exhibit interests and theoretical <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> we consider relevant when we committe to the idea of consolidating our concerns within the subject of mathematics education...|$|R

2500|$|Perhaps {{the strongest}} {{criticism}} {{lies in its}} disregard for the physical limits of the Earth and its ecosphere which are the physical container of all human economies. [...] This disregard becomes hot denial by Neoclassical economists when limits are asserted, since to accept such limits creates fundamental contradictions with the foundational <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> growth in scale of the human economy forever is both possible and desirable. [...] The disregard/denial of limits includes both resources and 'waste sinks,' the capacity to absorb human waste products and man-made toxins.|$|R
5|$|The <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, like Megalosaurus, were quadrupeds {{was first}} {{challenged by the}} find of Compsognathus in 1859. That, however, was a very small animal, the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied. In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of Eustreptospondylus was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal. Shortly afterwards, John Phillips created the first public display of a theropod skeleton in Oxford, arranging the known Megalosaurus bones, held by recesses in cardboard sheets, in {{a more or less}} natural position. During the 1870s, North American discoveries of large theropods, like Allosaurus, confirmed that they were bipedal. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can see her. As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E
