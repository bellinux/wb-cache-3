25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall <b>performance</b> <b>characteristic</b> (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{hydraulic}} transient analysis of hydro-power plants with particular emphasis {{being placed on}} the turbine and pump-turbine boundary conditions. A lack of suitable data, {{in the form of}} the machine <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics,</b> during the early stages of a hydro-power station's development led to the investigation of alternative sources of <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics,</b> not based on the testing of a hydraulically similar model turbine. Two methods of obtaining turbine <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> were developed, one based on the published <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> of typical reaction turbines and the second based on <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> from a turbine of similar specific speed. The problems particular to the unit parameter representation of four quadrant reversible pump-turbine <b>performance</b> <b>characteristics</b> for use in hydraulic transient analyses were investigated. A review of alternative forms of representation led to the solution of the pump-turbine boundary based on a modified unit parameter representation. The method reduces the multi-variable problem of the pump-turbine boundary condition to that of a single variable. The solution algorithm is equally successful for use with standard turbines. A computer program for the analysis of hydraulic transients in hydro-power plants was developed and comparisons with site recordings, taken during a full load rejection at a typical pumped storage scheme, made in order to verify the operation of the computer program. Further simulations demonstrate the combined boundary condition of turbine and relief valve...|$|R
