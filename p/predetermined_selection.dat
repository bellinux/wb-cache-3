50|$|Fowler {{comments}} that different fields produce different language, most obviously {{at the level}} of vocabulary (Fowler. 1996, 192) The linguist David Crystal points out that Hallidays tenor stands as a roughly equivalent term for style, which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal. 1985, 292). Hallidays third category, mode, is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the genre of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that <b>predetermines</b> the <b>selection</b> of textual meanings. The linguist William Downes makes the point that the principal characteristic of register, no matter how peculiar or diverse, is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes. 1998, 309).|$|R

In this paper, {{we consider the}} problem of estimating a preselected unknown deterministic parameter chosen from a parameter set based on observations according to a <b>predetermined</b> <b>selection</b> rule, Ψ. The data-based parameter selection process may impact the subsequent estimation by introducing a selection bias and creating coupling between decoupled parameters. This paper introduces a post-selection mean squared error (PSMSE) criterion as a performance measure. A corresponding Cramér-Rao-type bound on the PSMSE of any Ψ-unbiased estimator is derived, where the Ψ-unbiasedness is in the Lehmann-unbiasedness sense. The post-selection maximum-likelihood (PSML) estimator is presented. It is proved that if there exists an Ψ-unbiased estimator that achieves the Ψ-Cramér-Rao bound (CRB), i. e. an Ψ-efficient estimator, then it is produced by the PSML estimator. In addition, iterative methods are developed for the practical implementation of the PSML estimator.

We summarize recent developments in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia. Methods. The Medline database was searched for articles published within the past 10 years on the prevention and treat-ment of postirradiation xerostomia. Proceedings of recent impor-tant national meetings and government Web registries of clinical trials and therapeutic agents were also consulted. Priority was given to randomized controlled trials but, because of the scar-city of such trials, small open trials were included in this review.

40|$|This Environmental Assessment (EA) {{addresses}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposed action regarding an upgrade of the Pantex Plant Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF). Potential environmental consequences {{associated with the}} proposed action and alternative actions are provided. DOE proposes to design, build, and operate a new WWTF, consistent {{with the requirements of}} Title 30 of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC), Chapter 317, ''Design Criteria for Sewage Systems,'' capable of supporting current and future wastewater treatment requirements of the Plant. Wastewater treatment at Pantex must provide sufficient operational flexibility to meet Pantex Plant's anticipated future needs, including potential Plant mission changes, alternative effluent uses, and wastewater discharge permit requirements. Treated wastewater effluent and non-regulated water maybe used for irrigation on DOE-owned agricultural land. Five factors support the need for DOE action: (1) The current WWTF operation has the potential for inconsistent permit compliance. (2) The existing WWTF lies completely within the 100 -year floodplain. (3) The Pantex Plant mission has the potential to change, requiring infrastructure changes to the facility. (4) The life expectancy of the existing facility would be nearing its end by the time a new facility is constructed. (5) The treated wastewater effluent and non-regulated water would have a beneficial agricultural use through irrigation. Evaluation during the internal scoping led {{to the conclusion that the}} following factors are present and of concern at the proposed action site on Pantex Plant: (1) Periodic wastewater effluent permit exceedances; (2) Wetlands protection and floodplain management; (3) Capability of the existing facility to meet anticipated future needs of Pantex (4) Existing facility design life; and (5) Use of treated wastewater effluent and non-regulated water for irrigation. Evaluation during the internal scoping led to the conclusion that the following conditions are not present, nor of concern at the proposed site on Pantex Plant, and no further analysis was conducted: (1) State or national parks, forests, or other conservation areas; (2) Wild and scenic rivers; (3) Natural resources, such as timber, range, soils, minerals; (4) Properties of historic, archeological, or architectural significance; (5) Native American concerns; (6) Minority and low-income populations; and (7) Prime or unique farmland. In this document, DOE describes the proposed action and a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed action, including the ''No-Action'' alternative. The proposed action cited in the ''U. S. Department of Energy Application for a Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Modifying Permit to Dispose of Waste, No. 02296,'' December 1998, included the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility, a new irrigation storage pond, and the conversion of the current wastewater treatment facility into an irrigation storage pond. Although a permit modification application has been filed, if a decision on this EA necessitates it, an amendment to the permit application would be made. The permit application would be required for any of the alternatives and the filing does not preclude or <b>predetermine</b> <b>selection</b> of an alternative considered by this EA. This permit change would allow Pantex to land-dispose treated wastewater by irrigating agricultural land. This construction for the proposed action would include designing two new lagoons for wastewater treatment. One of the lagoons could function as a facultative lagoon for treatment of wastewater. The second lagoon would serve as an irrigation storage impoundment (storage pond), with the alternative use as a facultative lagoon if the first lagoon is out of service for any reason. The new facultative lagoon and irrigation water storage pond would be sited outside of the 100 -year flood plain. The existing WWTF lagoon would be used as a storage pond for treated wastewater effluent for irrigation water, as needed. The two new lagoons would be linked by pipeline. This proposed construction would disturb approximately 8 acres. Potential environmental consequences of each action have been identified and evaluated.

30|$|Cluster {{analysis}} {{is a group}} of multivariate techniques whose primary purpose is to assemble objects based on the characteristics they possess. Cluster analysis classifies objects, so that each object is similar to the others in the cluster with respect to a <b>predetermined</b> <b>selection</b> criterion. The resulting clusters of objects should then exhibit high internal (within-cluster) homogeneity and high external (between-cluster) heterogeneity. Hierarchical clustering is the most common approach, which provides intuitive similarity relationships between any one sample and the entire data set, and is typically illustrated by a dendrogram (tree diagram) (McKenna 2003). The dendrogram provides a visual summary of the clustering processes, presenting a picture of the groups and their proximity, with a dramatic reduction in dimensionality of the original data. The Euclidean distance usually gives the similarity between two samples and a distance can be represented by the difference between analytical values from the samples (Otto 1998). A classification scheme using the Euclidean distance for similarity measures and the between-groups linkage method was performed on the normalized data to produce the most distinctive classification where each member within a group is more similar to its fellow members than to any member outside of the group (Guler and Thyne 2004).|$|E

Titles and abstracts were screened using <b>predetermined</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. Critical appraisal was conducted based on standard criteria for relevance, validity, and levels of evidence. Results: Based on relevance, only four out of twelve selected articles can be used; one is a systematic review and three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Several methodological problems which could lead to over-estimation of the effect were found in the studies including poor randomization and selective drop-out. Risk of under-estimation of report due to small number of participants and in-adequate duration of intervention was also found. Small to moderate improvement were found in some outcome measured including overall autistic traits, social isolation, and the ability in communication and interaction. However, insignificant differences also found in some area such as individual’s behavior, cognitive and motor function.

40|$|THE {{selection}} of {{items for the}} measurement of attitudes and the objective quantification of such measurement {{has been a problem}} which has been subject to considerable research and investigation. In recent years, several statistical methods have been developed for the purpose of selecting and scaling attitude measuring items. It is {{the purpose of this study}} to investigate and compare two of these methods, the Reciprocal Averages Scaling Technique and Guttman’s Cornell Scale Analysis. History and Background The early work of attitude scaling was done by Thurstone (14) who used the method of equal appearing intervals. Scale values are determined by finding the median values of items as they are placed on a continuum by a number of judges. The interquartile range of judgments is used as a measure of ambi-guity. Items are chosen in terms of equal spacing on the con-tinuum, the least amounts of ambiguity and greatest amounts of relevance. Likert (I I) departs from this method in that the alternatives in the items are assigned <b>predetermined</b> weights. Final <b>selection</b> is on a basis of internal consistency. The technique developed by Guttman (6, 8) is used to inves-tigate a set of items in order to ascertain whether or not the items as such are attributes of a universe of qualitative data or content.

40|$|Volume {{visualization}} of photographic data {{is a relatively}} new domain for medical visualisation. In photographic volumes, voxel colour is <b>predetermined,</b> making colour <b>selection</b> through transfer functions less important, or even unnecessary. However, voxel classi?cation from photographic data is more complex than classi?cation from scalar datasets. Materials and structures in the human body overlap in the colour-space, and are therefore not separable solely by their colour values. In addition, low contrast between some of the adjacent materials and structures in the data complicates the use of boundary-based classi?cation techniques. In the ?rst half of this work we investigate the differences between volume {{visualization of}} scalar datasets and volume visualization of photographic datasets. We study a broad range of techniques which could be extended for photographic data, or replace traditional techniques in the volume render pipeline. In addition we study normal estimation for photographic data, which suffers from the non-linear colour spaces and previously mentioned low contrast. In the second half of this work we present an example-based visualization system which does not require its user to understand the mechanics of volume visualization. Our target group are non-visualization experts who want to use volume visualization to provide insight into their data. The system uses live rendered style previews which can be combined to form a composite render style.

We systematically reviewed the literature and assessed the evidence on genetic association studies of aggression and related outcomes {{in order to provide}} a field synopsis. We searched PubMed and Huge Navigator databases and sought additional data through reviewing reference lists and correspondence with investigators. Genetic association studies were included if outcome data on aggression or violent behavior either as a binary outcome or as a quantitative trait were provided. From 1331 potentially relevant investigations, 185 studies constituting 277 independent associations on 31 genes fulfilled the <b>predetermined</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. Data from variants investigated in three or more samples were combined in meta-analyses and potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analyses. In the primary analyses, which used relaxed inclusion criteria, we found no association between any polymorphism analyzed and aggression at the 5 % level of significance. Subgroup analyses, including by severity of outcome, age group, characteristics of the sample and ethnicity, did not demonstrate any consistent findings. Current evidence does not support the use of such genes to predict dangerousness or as markers for therapeutic interventions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{systematically}} review and analyse the available peer-reviewed literature {{reporting on the}} results of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and click auditory brainstem responses (c-ABRs) in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM and T 2 DM). Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across three electronic databases to identify English; peer-reviewed articles that included results of OAEs (DPOAEs and TEOAEs) and c-ABR tests in adult subjects with DM. Articles were selected according to <b>predetermined</b> <b>selection</b> criteria and critically reviewed independently by two researchers. Results: 15 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review while nine articles qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. DPOAE studies reported significantly reduced amplitudes with only one study reporting larger amplitudes. Abnormal TEOAEs were reported in all TEOAE studies, although these abnormalities were not always significant. Significantly delayed c-ABRs were reported in all ABR studies. Analysis of c-ABR mean wave latencies identified longer latencies for DM subjects, particularly for wave III and V, as well as for IPL I-III and I-V. Conclusions: Subjects with T 1 DM and T 2 DM may present with clinical or subclinical impairment of the cochlear outer hair cells and both the peripheral and central auditory pathway.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are {{professional}} antigen presenting cells uniquely {{equipped for}} initiating primary immune responses. The injection of DC loaded with cancer antigens stimulates potent immune and clinical responses; a key {{step in this}} process is the efficient delivery of the relevant antigens. The use of mRNA is a promising approach for antigen delivery as it encodes for epitopes presented by multiple (class I and II) MHC molecules obviating the need for <b>predetermined</b> patient antigen <b>selection.</b> While immune responses have been induced with mRNA loaded DC, the currently available systems will greatly benefit with improved delivery not compromising cell viability and compliant with regulatory requirements. We investigated a receptor-mediated transfection system for DNA utilising oxidised-mannan (OxM) covalently linked to polyethylenimine (PEI). We have demonstrated that DNA bound to the OxM-PEI complex can be efficiently delivered into mouse DC; in addition, the complex induced cellular responses and subsequent tumour protection when injected into mice. We applied this technology to mRNA and optimised the delivery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) into mouse DC and the macrophage cell line, J 774. We observed {{a high level of}} transfection of DC (44 2 %GFP+) and J 774 cells (94 3 %GFP+) after 48 hrs using OxM-PEImRNA at low mRNA concentrations (2 mg/ 1 106 cells) at which cell viability was not significantly impaired. GFP expression was detectable at high levels after 24 hours and stable for at least 48 hours. When compared with OxM-PEI-DNA, transfection with OxM-PEI-mRNA induced significantly higher percentages of GFP+ DC (p < 0. 01). We have now adapted this delivery strategy for human monocyte-derived DC with similar transfection efficiencies (83. 89 0. 25 %GFP+Mo-DC) and are currently investigating the delivery of the influenza matrix protein mRNA {{as a model for the}} further development of mRNA-loaded DC for tumour immunotherapy.

40|$|According to the {{hierarchy}} of models (HoM) account of scientific experimentation developed by Patrick Suppes and elaborated by Deborah Mayo, theoretical considerations about the phenomena of interest are involved in an experiment through theoretical models that in turn relate to experimental data through data models, via the linkage of experimental models. In this paper, I dispute the HoM account {{in the context of}} present-day high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. I argue that even though the HoM account aims to characterize experimentation as a model-based activity, it does not involve a modeling concept for the process of data acquisition and thus fails to provide a model-based characterization of the theory-experiment relationship underlying this process. In order to characterize the foregoing relationship, I propose the concept of a model of data acquisition and illustrate it {{in the case of the}} ATLAS experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, where the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012. I show that the process of data acquisition in the ATLAS experiment is performed according to a model of data acquisition that specifies and organizes the experimental procedures necessary to select the data according to a <b>predetermined</b> set of <b>selection</b> criteria. I also point out that this data acquisition model is theory-laden, in the sense that the underlying data selection criteria are determined in accordance with the testable predictions of the theoretical models that the ATLAS experiment is aimed to test. I take the foregoing theory-ladenness to indicate that the relationship between the procedures of the ATLAS experiment and the theoretical models of the phenomena of interest is first established, prior to the formation of data models, through the data acquisition model of the experiment, thus not requiring the intermediary of other types of models as suggested by the HoM account. I therefore conclude that in the context of HEP experiments, the HoM account does not consistently extend to the process of data acquisition so as to include models of data acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Background: Observational {{epidemiological}} {{studies have shown}} that higher intakes of vitamins or antioxidants were inversely associated with the risk of esophageal cancer. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported no preventive efficacy of vitamin or antioxidant supplements on esophageal cancer. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of vitamin and antioxidant supplements in the prevention of esophageal cancer as reported by RCTs. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in May 2013. Two authors independently reviewed and selected eligible articles based on <b>predetermined</b> <b>selection</b> criteria. Results: Of 171 articles searched from three databases and relevant bibliographies, 10 RCTs were included in the final analyses. In a fixed-effect meta-analysis of 10 trials, there was no efficacy of vitamin and antioxidant supplements in the prevention of esophageal cancer (relative risk [RR], 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 86 - 1. 25; I 2 = 0. 0 %). Also, subgroup meta-analyses showed that vitamin and antioxidant supplements had no preventive efficacy on esophageal cancer both in the high risk (RR, 1. 04; 95 % CI, 0. 85 - 1. 28; n= 4) and non-high risk (RR, 1. 01; 95 % CI, 0. 65 - 1. 56; n= 6) groups for esophageal cancer. Further, subgroup meta-analyses revealed no preventive efficacy on esophageal cancer by type of methodological quality and type of vitamin and antioxidant supplements. Conclusions: Unlike observational {{epidemiological studies}}, this meta-analysis of RCTs suggests that there is no clinical evidenc...|$|E
