Some units were later fitted with a 6-cylinder 150 hp Leyland petrol engine and a Lysholm-Smith hydraulic transmission. Experiments were also made with AEC and Winton engines in some vehicles. A 6-cylinder 120hp Leyland diesel engine was also trialled in one unit. During World War 2, to conserve fuel, gas <b>producer</b> <b>units</b> were fitted to six vehicles. Five of these six were destroyed when fire spread to the vehicle. Beginning in 1945, a programme began to replace the petrol engines with 6-cylinder GM Detroit Diesel 71 Series engines and Twin Disc 3-position hydraulic transmissions. It was also {{at this time that}} multiple unit controls were fitted. A single driver's cab and multiple unit controls were fitted to the No.2 End of the five trailer cars at this time.|$|E
50|$|Most 1970s {{mobile homes}} were {{constructed}} from the chassis upwards utilising predominantly cheap recycled materials. Throughout this era house-truck rigs were constructed on the decks of old ex farm trucks which {{could then be}} purchased for $500 to $2500. House-buses were either stripped down to the chassis in preparation for construction or just added onto, to facilitate increased living areas. As opposed to the bright colourful American and British versions of the 1960s, many of the early Kiwi rigs were finished in earthy colored timber exteriors. This was {{due in part to}} the fact that in the 1970s the Toyota Motor company imported their new vehicles from Japan in car-crates which were constructed from reasonable quality marine grade plywood. The crates came with good quality framed floors. These were the perfect material in which to construct and clad a house truck. In the 1970s one could then purchase a complete car crate (six-sided) for around $25. An average size house-truck took up most of five car crates to build. In the 1970s a large number of derelict country farm houses from New Zealand's early colonial days were being demolished, these containing a treasure-trove of beautiful recyclable rare timbers such as kauri, totara and rimu. Other materials were purchased from timber recyclers and secondhand traders. One could purchase cheaply a good second-hand wood fired potbelly or small wood stove with a wetback attached, for cooking, heating hot water and warmth over the winter months. As most housetrucks parked in non residential areas very few of the early housetrucks were wired up for mains electricity. Gas lighting and candles were the norm. Some trucks utilized a small gas or kerosene stove to supplement cooking over hot summer months. All these items were purchased second hand. Some early 1970s rigs experimented with homemade wind turbines for lighting; however these large units even though they were fastened to the roof during travel, proved awkward. Today smaller modern units can be purchased at a reasonable price. Innovative housetruckers looking for the complete self-sufficient unit attached gas <b>producer</b> <b>units</b> to their rigs, effectively running their engines for free on charcoal gas.|$|E

For this reason, a compose method on basis of unsubjective double comparisons matrix has been used. At research process, after specifying the {{input and output}} variables and also a proper model for DEA, computational research method are dismounted at two stages: At the first stage, DEA model, is dismounted for two-by –two of items (branches), regardless to other items. At the second stage, double items comparisons matrix is provided from first stage results, that is performed total rating by resolving a unit – level AHP model. For this purpose, for dismounting this technique, we have attempted to assess rivet <b>producer</b> <b>units</b> efficiency, {{at one of the}} greatest industrial units in Iran.

40|$|The medium-based {{manufacturing}} of {{sheet metal}} parts based on compressed gases is well suited {{to the production of}} complex construction parts and also for difficult-to-form materials. On the basis of fundamental investigations for medium-based forming the work ranged from cup-size up to medium sized {{sheet metal parts}}. For this two different tools were designed. The compressed gas used as a medium was produced by a gas producer; the obtained pressures lay within the range from under 10 MPa up to 40 MPa. Times of pressure build-up lay within the range from 30 to 100 ms. In {{the first phase of the}} project section suitable gas producers were selected. The criteria for this included: high value of produced gas, fast pressure build-up, moderate combustion behaviour as well as small formation of residues. With two selected gas producer mixtures, cup forming tests with sheet metals made of aluminium (EN AW- 5754), steel (DC 04) and high-grade steel (X 5 CrNi 18 - 10) were done to determine the significant forming parameters. These were maximum pressure, increase of pressure speed, radii of the die and the resulting radii of the bottom part of the cups. The end-forming of the cup could be determined by an instrumented base plate in the tool. These results served as parameters for a simulation of the forming process. With these research results experiments with a real part (model hood on a scale 1 : 2, 5) were conducted. An existing tool was modified so that two gas <b>producer</b> <b>units</b> and pressure sensors could be integrated. The gas producers consisted of double chambers, which were ignited separately in order to vary the pressure build-up times. As a result, a nearly complete shaping of the hoods was possible with pressures below 20 Mpa...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringSanjoy DasThe future energy grid is {{expected}} to operate in a decentralized fashion as a network of autonomous microgrids that are coordinated by a Distribution System Operator (DSO), which should allocate energy to them in an efficient manner. Each microgrid operating in either islanded or grid-connected mode may be considered to manage its own resources. This can take place through auctions with individual units of the microgrid as the agents. This research proposes efficient auction mechanisms for the energy grid, with is-landed and connected microgrids. The microgrid level auction is carried out {{by means of an}} intermediate agent called an aggregator. The individual consumer and <b>producer</b> <b>units</b> are modeled as selfish agents. With the microgrid in islanded mode, two aggregator-level auction classes are analyzed: (i) price-heterogeneous, and (ii) price homogeneous. Under the price heterogeneity paradigm, this research extends earlier work on the well-known, single-sided Kelly mechanism to double auctions. As in Kelly auctions, the proposed algorithm implements the bidding without using any agent level private infor-mation (i. e. generation capacity and utility functions). The proposed auction is shown to be an efficient mechanism that maximizes the social welfare, i. e. the sum of the utilities of all the agents. Furthermore, the research considers the situation where a subset of agents act as a coalition to redistribute the allocated energy and price using any other specific fairness criterion. The price homogeneous double auction algorithm proposed in this research ad-dresses the problem of price-anticipation, where each agent tries to influence the equilibri-um price of energy by placing strategic bids. As a result of this behavior, the auction’s efficiency is lowered. This research proposes a novel approach that is implemented by the aggregator, called virtual bidding, where the efficiency can be asymptotically maximized, even in the presence of price anticipatory bidders. Next, an auction mechanism for the energy grid, with multiple connected mi-crogrids is considered. A globally efficient bi-level auction algorithm is proposed. At the upper-level, the algorithm takes into account physical grid constraints in allocating energy to the microgrids. It is implemented by the DSO as a linear objective quadratic constraint problem that allows price heterogeneity across the aggregators. In parallel, each aggrega-tor implements its own lower-level price homogeneous auction with virtual bidding. The research concludes with a preliminary study on extending the DSO level auc-tion to multi-period day-ahead scheduling. It takes into account storage units and conven-tional generators that are present in the grid by formulating the auction as a mixed inte-ger linear programming problem...|$|E
