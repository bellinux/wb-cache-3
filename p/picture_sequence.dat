40|$|Background: Williams {{syndrome}} (WS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} associated with intellectual impairment, good verbal skills and an unusual social personality. Despite extensive interest in the area, it remains unclear whether theory of mind (ToM) abilities are impaired or intact in WS. This uncertainty most likely relates to {{the wide range of}} measures used to assess ToM abilities and the unique profile of strengths and weaknesses associated with the syndrome. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine ToM in WS using a nonverbal <b>picture</b> <b>sequencing</b> task. The <b>picture</b> <b>sequencing</b> task was selected so that the WS individuals could not rely on their good verbal skills when performing the task. The paper also aimed to further explore heterogeneity within WS and the possibility of WS subtypes. Methods: Langdon et al. ’s (1997) <b>picture</b> <b>sequencing</b> task was administered to 30 individuals with WS and to normal chronological-age-matched and mental-age-matched controls. The <b>picture</b> <b>sequencing</b> task assesses understanding of pretence, intention and false belief, while controlling for social script knowledge and physical cause-and-effect reasoning. Results: Results indicated a specific deficit in understanding of false belief within the WS group. There was also evidence of heterogeneity in the WS group, with the false belief impairment restricted to only a particular subgroup of WS individuals identified originally by Porter and Coltheart (2005). Conclusions: Our research, using a nonverbal task to assess ToM, indicates impaired false belief understanding in a select group of WS individuals. There are some indications that the deficits in social understanding in this group go beyond an impaired ToM. 1 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Each {{edition of}} Club International {{features}} ten photosets, {{with the exception}} of the slightly larger 'special edition' which features between twelve and thirteen sets. The photosets are usually single-girl shoots but there are also lesbian scenes. The shoots are generally softcore, and as such do not feature any sort of penetration or oral-genital contact. However some photoshoots feature the occasional 'pink' shot, where a model exposes her vaginal lips. During the early to mid-1980s, a regular feature was 'Club Event', a <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> involving a group of models (usually about half a dozen) performing a form of striptease around a central theme such as a Christmas party, or whilst wearing (and removing) various types of uniforms.|$|E

40|$|This study tests three {{different}} interventions for {{hard of hearing}} students who have written language needs. Participants wrote first drafts of narratives, and retold the narrative to the investigator, who represented the retelling in three ways: (a) through simple <b>picture</b> <b>sequences,</b> (b) through <b>picture</b> <b>sequences</b> with added graphic elements, and (c) with direct instruction in graphic element meaning. Following the verbal-visual interventions, students wrote second drafts. The addition of graphic elements to <b>picture</b> <b>sequences</b> allowed participants to improve second drafts of stories, resulting in syntax, semantics and story grammar that more closely approximated the writing of children with normal hearing. Direct instruction in the meaning of graphic elements resulted in further improvement in second drafts by {{three of the four}} participants, with an observable impact on certain variables, specifically: (a) length of story, (b) length of T-unit, (c) increase in precise vocabulary use, (d) decrease in proportion of syntactic cohesive ties, (e) {{increase in the number of}} cohesive categories and (f) improved total scores for story grammar elements. ^ Although general trends were noted, in all cases there were complex interactions between student characteristics, targeted writing skills, and intervention types. Implications of the findings from this investigation for teachers of students who are hard of hearing are presented. The need for further study is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} stereopair data compression. Two fundamentally different techniques for compressing stereopairs are discussed. The first technique, called disparity-compensated transform-domain predictive coding, attempts to minimize the mean-square error between the original stereopair and the compressed stereopair. The second technique, called mixed-resolution coding, is a psychophysically justified technique that exploits known facts about human stereovision to code stereopairs in a subjectively acceptable manner. A method for assessing the quality of compressed stereopairs is also presented. It involves measuring the ability of an observer to perceive depth in coded stereopairs. It is found that observers generally perceived objects to be further away in compressed stereopairs {{than they did in}} originals. Finally, the problem of coding stereopairs is considered from a rate-distortion perspective. It is proved that the rate distortion limit for coding stereopairs cannot in general be achieved by a coder that first codes and decodes the right <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> independently of the left <b>picture</b> <b>sequence,</b> and then codes and decodes the left <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> given the decoded right <b>picture</b> <b>sequence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: One {{feature of}} literate language, noun phrase elaboration, was {{examined}} in the oral fictional narratives of school-aged children. Method: Two narratives were elicited from 5 -, 8 - and 11 -year-old children, 1 {{in response to a}} <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> and 1 in response to a single picture. Noun phrases were categorized into 4 types. Results: Simple designating noun phrases were produced by all children at age 5, simple descriptive noun phrases by all children at age 8, and noun phrases with postmodification by all children at age 11. All noun phrase types were produced by more children in object than in subject position and in the single picture than in the <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> context. Conclusion: There are important developmental changes in noun phrase elaboration in the elementary school years as children learn to manage narrative contexts. Even within picture tasks, variations in visual depiction can affect the use of elaborated noun phrases (ENPs), with more descriptive language more likely to occur in narratives based on a single picture fantasy context than on a realistic <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> context. Performance expectations for types of ENPs within these contexts are provided. These findings will be useful to school clinicians in evaluating and working on narrative language within the elementary school period...|$|E
40|$|Background: This paper {{reports the}} {{performance}} of DSM-IV-TR diagnosed bipolar disorder (BD) patients on a well-recognised measure of theory of mind (ToM) that commonly elicits group-related differences in schizophrenia research. Methods: Forty-nine BD patients and 49 age and gender matched controls completed Langdon and Coltheart (1999) <b>Picture</b> <b>Sequencing</b> Task. Results: Relative to controls, patients with BD performed significantly worse on the ToM relevant false-belief stories of the <b>picture</b> <b>sequencing</b> task, {{but not on the}} control stories requiring social script knowledge, executive control or an understanding of causal connexions. There were no differences in the ToM performance of symptomatic versus euthymic patients or those categorised as having BD I or BD II. Limitations: As sub group sizes were small, data suggesting a trait-like deficit in ToM should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions: The results support previous evidence of ToM impairment in BD and indicate a potential endophenotypic overlap in the phenomenology of both schizophrenia and BD...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRetinex method mainly {{consists}} of two steps: estimation and normalization of illumination. How to extract the background illumination accurately is a key problem. The backgrounds of <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> in video's adjacent frames are usually similar and closely related. More accurate illumination information can be extracted when this characteristics of video's <b>picture</b> <b>sequence</b> is considered. In the paper, we propose an improved Retinex algorithm. Filter the images using the Gauss masks of different scale and parameter for each frame image, and all these filtering results are fused together by minimum method. In the paper, the scale of Gauss filters are set as 5, 9, 13, 25, and their variance set as 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7 and 1. 0 respectively. 6 adjacent frame images are selected, and the uniform and optical background image for these 6 images can be extracted by maximum method. This method makes use of the similarity and relationship among the adjacent frame images in videos. Enhance the images using Retinex method with this optical background image as their uniform illumination information. Experiment shows that more accurate back grounds are acquired and more excellent enhancement performance are achieved...|$|E
