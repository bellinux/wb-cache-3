5|$|To remain undetected, {{the player}} can perform {{techniques}} which {{make use of}} both Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with location of nearby enemies and their field of vision. Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and a cardboard box disguise.

5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport.

In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture <b>promotes</b> <b>a</b> sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.

5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions and <b>promotes</b> <b>a</b> republican ideology. Relying on 17th- {{and early}} 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E
30|$|Considering {{parts and}} {{components}} suppliers, we verify that imports from the ROW, EU, EA, LA, and North America <b>promoted</b> <b>an</b> {{increase in the}} sophistication of the final products traded inside Latin America. A 1 % increase in North American participation in the import basket composition, all ceteris paribus, <b>promotes</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.06 % {{in the quality of}} the intra-bloc export basket, while imports from EU <b>promoted</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.04 %, followed by increases of 0.02 % in the case of imports from LA or EA, and 0.01 % for the ROW. The second column reveals that imports just from LA and North America had a positive effect in the electric machinery sector, while the coefficients for imports from other regions are statistically insignificant. Increases of 1 % in imports from North America <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.07 % in the quality of final electric machinery intra-bloc export basket, while imports from LA <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.06 %. Transport equipment coefficients were all statistically insignificant. In the second half of Table  5, we verify similar results for the case of pooled machinery data. North American imports <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.1 % in the quality of the parts and components export basket, while imports from the EU and EA <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.04 % each. In column 5, the coefficients are slightly different, revealing that imports only from China <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> 0.04 % increase in the intra-bloc export basket of electric machinery parts and components, while imports from EA have a negative effect. Once again, transport equipment coefficients are statistically insignificant.|$|R

5|$|The {{attempts}} to gain {{entry to the}} manor continue as the LEP recruit an infamous criminal, the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums to break in. Fairies are forbidden from entering human dwellings without permission, but Mulch has forfeited the magic preventing him from entering dwellings, causing him to be safe when burglarizing. He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system, allowing Mulch to freely explore. Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis' copy of the Book, finally revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis' knowledge, which he had led them to believe he had acquired from a truth serum administered to Holly. The Fairy Council, deciding that nothing is working, <b>promotes</b> <b>a</b> lieutenant called Briar Cudgeon to Acting Commander, temporarily usurping Julius Root. Meanwhile, Holly Short cracks through the concrete of her cell, finding fresh dirt, and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn. Having regained her magic, she escapes into the main house.|$|E
