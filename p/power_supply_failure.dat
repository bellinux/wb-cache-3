Home server hosting configurations have a higher probability of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>failures,</b> internet connectivity failures and hardware failures. For this reason my work is focusing on disaster recovery and achieving high availability of servers. The designed HA system is transparent to the user, which means that in normal circumstances all of the connected servers appear to be working as one logical system, distributing their data across all servers. In case of failure, clients connected to the failing server are reconnected to a working server without losing their global session on the system...|$|R

40|$|D. Ing. This thesis {{considers}} {{water supply}} and divides the water supply environment into three categories; the macro water supply environment, the water supply scheme and the consumers. Each of the categories is briefly explored {{in terms of the}} factors that may influence it. Subsequently, some of the unique features of a bulk water distribution system are dealt with, as well as different approaches related to bulk water distribution system design and assessment. One of these approaches, the probabilistic approach, offers unique features to assess the reliability of a bulk water distribution system but requires that the probabilistic characteristics of the stochastic events be quantified. The above prompted the goal of this thesis; “…to assess and quantify the probabilistic characteristics of selected factors that may compromise bulk water distribution reliability”. The objectives set and dealt with in this thesis are: • Conducting a literature review that explores uncertainty, reliability, models and techniques, highlighting selected factors that may compromise bulk water distribution reliability, as well as bulk water distribution system water requirements. • Quantifying the probabilistic characteristics of water distribution pipeline failures. • Quantifying the probabilistic characteristics of pipeline failures caused by sinkholes in dolomitic areas. • Quantifying the probabilistic characteristics of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>failures.</b> This study provides a comprehensive summary of a range of uncertainties that may compromise bulk water distribution reliability. However, the greatest value added corresponds to the following: • It establishes a benchmark related to the probabilistic characteristics of pipeline failures for five pipeline material categories, related to pipeline failure rates and pipeline repair times. • A new methodology is developed in terms of which the probabilistic characteristics of pipeline failures caused by sinkholes in dolomitic areas can be quantified. • It provides a benchmark of the probabilistic characteristics of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>failures</b> at bulk water distribution pump stations. Proposals are made related to future research needs, divided into two categories: • Complementary research needs that will complement and enhance the work undertaken within this thesis. • Promotional research needs that will promote the practical application of the outcomes generated as part of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Main Electronics Module (MEM) <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{heat sink}} {{temperature}} {{is critical to}} the Landsat- 7 mission. It is strongly dependent on the thermal louver design. A lower <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> heat sink temperature increases the reliability of the MEM, and reduces the risk of over heating and thermal shut-down. After the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>failures</b> in ETM+ instrument thermal vacuum tests # 1 and # 2, the author performed detailed thermal analyses of the MEM, and proposed to reduce the louver set-points by 7 C. At the 1998 Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC), the author presented a paper that included results of thermal analysis of the MEM. It showed that a 70 C reduction of the louver set points could reduce the maximum <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> heat sink temperature in thermal vacuum test and in flight to below 20 "C in the cooler outgas mode and in the nominal imaging mode, and has no significant impact on the standby heater duty cycle. It also showed that the effect of Earth infrared and albedo on the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> heat sink temperature is small. The louver set point reduction was implemented in June 1998, just prior to ETM+ thermal vacuum test # 3. Results of the thermal vacuum tests, and temperature data in flight validate the MEM thermal performance improvement due to the 70 C reduction of the louver set points...|$|R

The obvious implication from this commitment is that the present major social, economic and political trends are not leading to a harmonious society or, at least, not leading to a harmonious society fast enough. Analytically, if the Chinese economy is depicted as a speeding car, there are three classes of failures (a) a hardware failure from the breakdown of an economic mechanism, a development that {{is analogous to the}} collapse of the chassis of the car; (b) a software failure from a flaw in governance that creates frequent widespread social disorders that disrupt production economy-wide and discourage private investment, a situation similar to a car crash that resulted from a fight among the people inside the speeding car; and (c) a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>failure</b> from hitting either a natural limit or an externally-imposed limit, a situation that is akin, respectively, to the car running out of gas or to the car smashing into a barrier erected by an outsider.

30|$|In this paper, {{the study}} process starts with {{translating}} the deterministic criteria into probabilistic measures using system well-being analysis. Once the probabilistic index {{driven by the}} given deterministic criteria has been established, this index {{can be used as}} a benchmark value to determine the transmission capacity reserve requirement. The proposed methodology has been applied to a real-life scenario where the system load continues to grow, and thus the system reinforcement in a form of a new transmission circuit addition is required to maintain the overall system reliability. Advancing the new transmission addition project in order to accommodate the proposed transmission capacity reserve can offer several benefits such as reducing energy loss, reducing reliability must run (RMR) generation cost, and reducing customer damage cost due to <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>failures.</b> However, the advancement of the project will incur an earlier investment cost than the original plan governed by the traditional deterministic criterion. Therefore, the economic analysis to appreciate the present value (PV) of the advanced project must be considered to determine whether or not the project advancement can solidly have an economic justification.|$|R
