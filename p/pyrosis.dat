40|$|M. Tech. Homoeopathy is {{considered}} to be a safe and effective modality of treatment for various ailments commonly encountered during pregnancy, such as constipation, exhaustion, <b>pyrosis,</b> backache, haemorrhoids, and varicose veins (Castro, 2004; Rothenberg, 2004). <b>Pyrosis</b> is defined as a burning sensation in the epigastric and sub-sternal region, which may radiate to the neck, throat, back and even the face, with rising of acid liquid from the stomach (Beers & Berkow, 1999; O’Toole, 2003). <b>Pyrosis</b> affects up to 85 % of pregnant woman, the aetiology being complex and multi-factorial (Broussard & Richter, 1998; Page & Percival, 2000; Richter, 2005). The aim of the study was to determine the effect of homoeopathic similimum treatment on the frequency and severity of <b>pyrosis</b> during pregnancy, and also on the frequency which other antacid medication was taken. A qualitative, interventive, and descriptive study was conducted monitoring twelve participants over a period of five weeks. Non-probability purposive sampling was employed to select twelve pregnant women between 12 - 34 weeks gestation, suffering from <b>pyrosis,</b> and met the inclusion criteria for the study. Participants were recruited through referrals from midwives and advertisements placed in pharmacies and health stores. The participants evaluated their own symptoms on a daily questionnaire, recording how often they suffered from <b>pyrosis,</b> and also rating the severity of their discomfort. The questionnaire was completed for one week prior to treatment, and then for four weeks during which the participant received homoeopathic similimum treatment. The researcher interviewed each participant during three consultations. A thorough homoeopathic case history was taken during the initial consultation, capturing the totality of the participants’ symptoms on a case study form. After evaluation of the symptoms and repertorisation, a homoeopathic similimum remedy was prescribed. The choice of dosage and potency was individualized to the participant according to homoeopathic principles. A follow-up consultation was conducted after two weeks of treatment. During the follow-up consultation the participants’ symptoms were recorded on a follow-up sheet and their response to the treatment was evaluated. Where indicated the treatment was continued as before, the similimum remedy changed if indicated by a change in symptoms, or treatment stopped when no longer necessary. A final consultation was conducted after another two weeks. The symptoms were again recorded on a follow-up sheet, and the effectiveness of the similimum treatment was then evaluated. The data from the consultations were used to write in-depth case studies representing a qualitative evaluation of the study, based on the subjective experience of symptoms by the participants. Quantitative data was obtained from the daily questionnaires, and represented graphically. The means for all twelve cases, relating to the frequency and severity of <b>pyrosis</b> during the time of the study, were obtained from this data, and represented on bar graphs. From the case studies and questionnaires it was determined that there was an improvement in all twelve of the cases studied. All the participants, except for case five, eight, and nine, experienced improvement in the frequency that <b>pyrosis</b> was experienced. There was improvement of the severity of the symptoms in all twelve case studies. In case five, eight, and nine, the frequency of the symptoms of <b>pyrosis</b> didn’t decrease, but there was amelioration of the severity of the symptoms. In several cases there was also improvement of other concomitant symptoms and participants reported an overall improvement of their health. In case three the symptoms were no longer present after the first two weeks of treatment. No further treatment was required, and the participant remained symptom free for the remainder of her pregnancy. In all of the other cases the participants still continued to experience symptoms, but less frequently and suffered less discomfort. The symptoms were typically ameliorated when the prescribed remedy was taken. Provisional findings suggest that homoeopathic similimum treatment may be effective in managing <b>pyrosis</b> during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|The {{subjective}} {{symptoms of}} the aged were studied classifying the patients by their age and blood pressure. And the following results were obtained: 1. The commonest symptom was stiff shoulder and over {{one half of the}} subjects had this. And the following symptoms arreared in the order given in their frequency. Fatigability, headache, palpitation, tinnitus, insomnia, numbness, vertigo, stomach repletion, constipation, nycturia, expectoration, caughing, trembling, belching, <b>pyrosis.</b> 2. The following symptoms increased with age: Constipation, numbness, trembling, insomnia, nycturia, tinnitus, caughing. Nycturia and tinnitus were most renarkable. 3. Such symptoms as belching, stomach repletion, <b>pyrosis,</b> fatigability and stiff shoulder decreased with the elevation of blood pressure, fatigability being most remarkable. The symptoms of digestive system came under this categary. 4. The symptoms of respiratory system were more frequent among women, caughing and expectoration being the only symptoms of this categorywhich were found among men. The following symptoms were highly frequent with women: Tinnitns, belching, constipation, numbness: trembling, insomnia, virtigo, palpitation, headache, fatigability, stiff shoulder, stomach repletion, <b>pyrosis,</b> nycturia, etc. Among the above, the frequency of constipation, virtigo, and headache with women was twice of men while that of stiff shoulder, palpitation, belching, numbness, and insomnia was 1. 5 times. Such marked subjective symptoms with women may probably due to thier different reactions to the surroundings and their climacterium. 5. The symptoms most frequent with the group with systoric pressure of 180 - 209 mmHg, were tinnitus, numbness, trembling, palpitation, insomnia, and constipation. These symptoms increased in the group with 180 - 209 mmHg because the persons in this group were in the period when the blood pressure fluctuates sharply while it dropped with the group with over 210 mmHg as their blood pressure was stabilized. 6. It was found the disease and sex difference were two important factors for causing subjective symptoms...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The {{pathogenesis}} of dyspeptic/reflux {{symptoms and}} the clinico-pathologic profile of affected patients are still poorly understood. To improve our knowledge {{in this field}} we carried out a systematic, comparative analysis of symptom profiles and histopathologic patterns of oesophagogastroduodenal mucosa {{in a series of}} 221 subjects, 140 with and 81 without endoscopic evidence of hiatal hernia. Of these, 190 showed reflux and/or dyspeptic symptoms. METHODS: Before endoscopy, all the subjects were questioned about the presence and severity of 12 individual symptoms. Biopsies were taken from the distal oesophagus, cardia, corpus, angulus, antrum and duodenal bulb, and were scored in accordance with the Sydney system. RESULTS: Patient groups with a distinct clinico-pathologic profile were better identified when symptoms of adequate severity were compared with histopathologic parameters. A correlation between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) symptoms and histologic signs of oesophagitis was mostly restricted to patients endoscopically positive for oesophagitis. Retroxiphoid <b>pyrosis</b> correlated with cardial gastritis but not with oesophagitis, either endoscopic or histologic, while ulcer-like epigastric pain correlated with active duodenitis and distal gastritis. No definite histopathologic background was detected in patients with putative dysmotility-like symptoms, endoscopy-negative GORD and low score or mixed symptoms. CONCLUSION: A contribution of Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis to the pathogenesis of some dyspeptic symptoms seems likely. However, the identification of specific histologic changes causing individual symptoms remains rather elusive, with the exception of active antroduodenitis in patients with ulcer-like pain and of active proximal gastritis in patients with severe retroxiphoid <b>pyrosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Integrated {{management}} {{of solid waste}} is nowadays a requirement and, at the same time, a challenge {{for the conservation of}} civilization and life on the planet. The material and energy exploitation of solid waste already contributes to a great extent to the resolution of environmental issues in the advanced countries of the planet. Unfortunately, a significant delay in the treatment of waste is noted in Greece, leading to our country having to pay excessive fines, since the European legislation is particular and binding for all member states and does not allow dumping of mechanically untreated waste in hygienic waste dumping areas. Given the fact that waste quantities to be processed will constantly increase, and considering how expensive and time consuming is the development of facilities for mechanical treatment of waste, it is certain that our country {{will not be able to}} fulfill the Union’s political targets for 2020 regarding the percentages of Renewable Energy Sources and the decrease in CO 2 emissions. In consideration of the above situation, the presented work investigates the design of a modern method for the integrated {{management of}} solid waste in the Western Macedonia Region, Greece. For this scope, a number of laboratory analyses and measurements were performed for the determination of all the physical and chemical characteristics and attributes that affect the processability and enrichability of waste in the area. Measurements included quantities, qualitative and quantitative composition, density, volume, humidity, heating value, particle distribution, biodegradability, hydro-absorbability, compressibility, loss of <b>pyrosis,</b> <b>pyrosis</b> residual, compostability, pH and heavy metals content. Considering the above data, a flow diagram of an integrated management method is proposed for solid waste in this region. The proposal includes a mixed system with four parallel components: a) recycling of paper, aluminum, and plastics at the source, b) mechanical treatment, c) incineration, and d) composting...|$|E

40|$|Prolonged (24 h) intra-esophageal pH {{measurements}} {{have shown}} that short-lasting reflux episodes regularly occur in normal subjects, especially in the postprandial period. This phenomenon has been called physiological reflux. When the reflux episodes become more frequent and last longer, symptoms and esophagitis ensue. The mechanism of symptom production (<b>pyrosis</b> and/or chest pain) is incompletely understood. Chemoreceptors are involved but manometric disturbances and irritability of the esophagus may play an important role. The pathogenesis of pathological reflux is multifactorial: 1. An ineffective anti-reflux barrier {{at the level of}} the gastroesophageal junction is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of reflux. 2. Once reflux has occurred, an appropriate clearing of the refluxed material is necessary to minimize the contact time of the noxious agent with the esophageal mucosa. This clearing function is a two-step operation. In the refluxed material the concentration of H+ is the most irritant factor although pepsine increases its noxious character. Bile acid reflux decreases the epithelial resistance. The mucosal resistance to noxious agents is determined by the mucous layer, the cytoprotective properties of the epithelium, the regeneration capacity of the cells and by a number of post-epithelial factors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} some biochemical and histopathological aspects in a group of patients with a view to identifying any differences depending on whether the pathology was associated with previous cholecystectomy or idiopathic. The study involved 23 patients (8 post-cholecystectomy cases and 15 ulcer-free dyspeptic patients) with the diagnosis of duodenogastric reflux gastritis confirmed by endoscopic histopathological evaluation. The following parameters were considered: 1) pH and bile salt concentration in gastric juice; 2) histological classification of antral biopsies (Niemela's criteria); 3) dyspeptic symptoms (dyspepsia, <b>pyrosis</b> and epigastric pain, sense of repletion, foul-tasting mouth) graded on a scale from 0 to 4. All parameters were considered in relation to whether or not Helicobacter Pylori was found in the histological specimens. No significant differences were found between the two groups for pH and bile salt values or for Helicobacter Pylori positivity. No relationship was observed between the Helicobacter Pylori and either the severity of the histological picture, the features of the biochemical parameters or the severity of the clinical symptoms. Such findings confirm the common pathophysiological pattern of reflux gastritis regardless of any permanent biliary tract alterations and the low importance of Helicobacter Pylori infection in determining this syndrome...|$|E

Etiology of CIU is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection eradication in improvement of CIU. Materials and methods: In this double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 CIU patients were enrolled in the study. Urea breath test (UBT) was performed for indicating the Hp infection. Hp positive patients were divided in 2 groups: cases that were treated with quadruple therapy for eradication of Hp(Amoxicillin, Omeprazole, Bismuth and Metronidazole) and controls (placebo). The gastrointestinal (GI) and dermatologic symptoms and signs were recorded and compared in the beginning of the study, and 1 and 3 months after the treatment.

It is hypothesized that the diarrhea might be due to ischemia in bowel mucosa or inflammation, but the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the diarrhea is still unknown. We aimed at exploring the mechanism for diarrhea in these patients by thorough endoscopic and histological assessment. Materials and methods Endoscopies of the upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 10 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who developed diarrhea during treatment with VEGFR TKIs were performed. Results Ten patients were included. The results showed endoscopically normal mucosa in the lower GI tract in seven patients without signs of ischemic colitis or inflammation. Gastroduodenoscopy revealed gastro-esophageal reflux disease, bulbitis and/or duodenitis with ulcers in eight patients. In three selected patients with bulbitis/duodenitis additional video capsule endoscopy was performed but revealed no additional intestinal abnormalities.

Selected patients complained of dyspeptic symptoms in the absence of digestive lesions or Helicobacter pylori infection within the previous 3 months. They were treated with Uliveto water (1. 5 l day(- 1)) for 30 days. Frequency and severity of symptoms were assessed at baseline and day 30 by a score system. Preclinical experiments were carried out on rats, allowed to drink Uliveto or oligomineral water for 30 days. Animals then underwent pylorus ligation to evaluate gastric secretion of acid, pepsinogen, and mucus. In separate experiments, gastric emptying was assessed. Crenotherapy was associated with a relief of epigastric pain, retrosternal <b>pyrosis,</b> postprandial fullness and gastric distention. At preclinical level, Uliveto water increased acid and pepsinogen secretions as well as gastric emptying, without changes in bound mucus. The enhancing actions of Uliveto on gastric secretions and emptying were prevented by L- 365, 260, an antagonist of gastrin/CCK- 2 receptors. These findings indicate that a regular intake of Uliveto favors an improvement of dyspeptic symptoms.

This formulation is administered QD and provides steady plasmatic levels of the drug. ObjectiveThe aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness and tolerability of CR diclofenac-potassium versus the immediate-release (IR) formulation, when used for treatment of pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis. MethodsThis prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative, multi-center, parallel-group study was conducted in male and female patients who had been previously diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. Inclusion criteria included knee joint pain and ≥ 3 of the following: age > 50 years, morning rigidity lasting < 30 minutes, crackling in the joint, pain with applied pressure to the bones, bone hypertrophy, absence of articular heat, and a radiology status of I to III on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale. Patients were randomly divided into 1 of 2 equal-sized groups: 1 group received diclofenac-potassium IR 50 mg BID for 30 days and 1 group received diclofenac-potassium CR 100 mg QD for 30 days. Patients were assessed at baseline and again at 15 and 30 days after initiation of treatment with a physical examination, pain measurement via 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS), and Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index questionnaire. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by direct interrogation, hematology controls, blood chemistry, hepatic tests, coagulation tests, and urine tests performed on patients before treatment initiation and on day 30. ResultsSixty-five patients were screened and 62 patients (mean [SD]age, 61. 8 [8. 9] years; mean [SD] weight, 71. 3 [12. 4] kg; female sex, 55 [88. 9 %]) were included in the study; each study group had 31 patients. After 30 days, both products were equally effective in relieving pain, as measured by VAS (IR, 17. 3 vs CR, 21. 6; P = NS), and changes in the WOMAC score (IR, 14. 5 vs CR, 19. 2; P = NS). Significantly more patients in the IR group reported feeling better after 30 days than in the CR group (94 % vs 76 %; P = 0. 002) and, according to the physician's opinion, significantly more patients treated with diclofenac-potassium IR felt better (97 % vs 83 %; P = 0. 03). Significantly more patients in the IR group required rescue medication than those in the CR group (36 % vs 26 %; P = 0. 03). In the CR group, 7 patients experienced AEs: 6 were gastrointestinal (ie, <b>pyrosis,</b> epigastralgia, dyspepsia) and 1 patient experienced increased arterial pressure. One patient from this group discontinued treatment due to a lack of efficacy. In the IR group, 6 patients experienced AEs (ie, tachycardia, epigastralgia, and <b>pyrosis).</b> One patient discontinued because of AEs, and 3 withdrew due to a lack of efficacy.

40|$|Barrett's {{oesophagus}} (BO) is {{the primary}} precursor lesion for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (ADC). The natural history of metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence remains largely unknown. HER 2 /neu oncogene results overexpressed/amplified in preneoplastic lesions and in ADC of the oesophagus {{and it has been}} associated with poor prognosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of HER 2 overexpression/amplification in predicting the conversion from precursor lesions to ADC. We retrospectively evaluated by univariate analysis of single variables clinical records and histological specimens of 21 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of BO and/or oesophageal dysplasia. Clinical variables included age, gender, alcohol and smoking intake, presence of symptoms (<b>pyrosis,</b> disphagia) and endoscopic features (length). HER 2 status was studied by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin-embedded tissue. The end-points were the occurrence of progression and the time-to-progression (TTP) from the initial histologic lesion to the worst pathological pattern. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range 37 - 84). BO median length was 4. 5 cm. Progression occurred in 11 of 21 patients and median TTP was 24 months. HER 2 was overexpressed/amplified in 8 of 21 (38 %) patients. HER 2 overexpression/ amplification and the presence of dysplasia were statistically associated with progression (P= 0. 038).

The study was conducted as a prospective, open-label, multicenter design in 342 patients with dysmotility-like functional dyspepsia (n= 279) and nonerosive reflux disease (n= 63), who received levosulpiride 25 mg 3 times daily orally for 4 weeks. Individual symptoms (pain/discomfort, fullness, bloating, early satiety, <b>pyrosis,</b> regurgitation, and nausea/vomiting) and a global symptom score were assessed at 15, 30, and 60 days after starting treatment. Adverse events also were recorded. There were 151 men and 191 women (mean age 38. 8 years) who referred dyspeptic symptoms for a mean of 10. 2 (10. 7) months. A total of 66. 4 % patients were treated with 75 mg/day levosulpiride and 33. 6 % with 50 mg/day. At the 15 -day visit, a decrease greater than 50 % in the global symptom score was observed. The frequency and intensity of individual symptoms showed a statistically significant decrease (p< 0. 001) at all visits compared with baseline. At the 30 -day visit, all symptoms had almost disappeared, a trend that was maintained until the last visit. Treatment with levosulpiride was well tolerated and only 40 adverse events were recorded (galactorrhea 26. 7 %, somnolence 17. 8 %, fatigue 11. 1 %, headache 11. 5 %) and no patient had to abandon the study due to side effects. In conclusion, levosulpiride is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of dysmotility-like functional dyspepsia and non-erosive reflux disease...|$|E

She had noticed a gradual {{disappearance of the}} skin folds of her face {{and a lack of}} ability to open her mouth. Her limbs showed sclerodactyly and isolated telan-giectases (Fig. 1 a). She had positive anticentromere antibody. She was evaluated because of dysphagia with solids, <b>pyrosis</b> and regurgitation. The esophageal manometry showed a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter and peristaltic waves of low amplitude {{in the body of the}} esophagus. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal. She referred fatigue and liver tests showed a cholestatic pattern with high serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidasa. She had high titers (1 : 320) of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) and the serum levels of IgM were also elevated (512 mg/dL). Liver biopsy revealed a moderate periportal inflammatory infiltration and bile duct proliferation consistent with the stage II of the Scheuer’s classification of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The hands X-ray showed massive deposits of material of calcium density inside the thumb (Fig. 1 b). In the limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome –calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dys-function, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia), there is an excessive amount of collagen deposited mainly in the skin. In ad-vanced stages of the disease, the synovial membrane of the joints, the tendon sheaths and the fascias, develop fibrin depo-sits that trend to evolve to fibrosis and finally to produce dystrophic calcifications (calcinosis). The occurrence of calcinosis and telangiectasia have been more frequently described in patients with CREST syndrome when it was associa-ted with PBC in comparison with those who did not show this syndrome.

40|$|Abstract  Aims—To {{study the}} {{epidemiology}} and {{natural history of}} gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).  Methods—Retrospective cohort study involving all 172 hospitals of the Department of Veterans Affairs. A total of 194 527 patients with GORD were followed between 1981 and 1994. Distribution of oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcer, oesophageal stricture, strictured hiatus hernia, hiatus hernia, and <b>pyrosis</b> by age, sex, and ethnicity were determined. The comorbid occurrence of various forms of GORD in identical patients was analysed by an age and race standardised morbidity ratio. The population of all hospitalised veterans was used for comparison.  Results—Severe forms of GORD associated with oesophageal erosions, ulcers, or strictures, affected elderly, white, male patients more often than their corresponding opposite demographic group. All forms of GORD clustered in the same patient population; on average, any form of GORD was 10 {{times more likely to}} occur in a patient with another form of GORD than without. The highest morbidity ratio (22) was found in oesophageal ulcer and stricture. About one third of all patients with oesophageal erosions, ulcers, or strictures also had hiatus hernia; 46 % of patients with hiatus hernia were diagnosed as having other forms of GORD. While one third of all oesophageal strictures appeared in patients without other forms of GORD diagnosed at any time, oesophageal ulcers were always associated with some other form of GORD. No clear cut progression in different forms of GORD was found.  Conclusions—Older age, male sex, and white ethnicity are risk factors in the development of severe forms of GORD. The most severe grade of GORD is reached {{at the onset of the}} disease. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Functional {{evaluation}} of digestive transplants after oesophagectomy for cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated alimentary comfort {{and quality of}} life and performed a videofluoroscopy (radiocinema) in 34 patients who were alive and disease-free one year or more after oesophagectomy for malignancy. There were 22 males and 12 females; mean age was 64 years. Twenty-three patients had a gastric pull-up and 11 a colonic graft. Mean follow-up was 36 months (range: 12 - 100 months). Possible correlations between clinical symptoms and radiographic observations were studied with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Most-cited symptoms were gurgling in 16 patients, early fullness during eating in 15, diarrhea in 14, postprandial sweating in 9, <b>pyrosis</b> in 8, nocturnal cough in 7, and dysphagia in 5. Most patients considered the side effects of the operation as mild to moderate and mean rating of alimentary comfort was 7. 6 / 10. Twenty-five patients qualified their quality of life as good, 8 as satisfactory, and 1 as poor. Twenty-nine patients led active lives. Videofluoroscopic evaluation showed that colonic grafts emptied mainly by gravity, while active contractions were observed in the antrum of gastric transplants. There was a significant correlation between alimentary symptoms and radiographic distension of the transplant. Oro-pharyngeal abnormalities, site of proximal anastomosis, nature, motility, or active versus passive emptying of the transplant did not correlate with clinical complaints. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients quality of life and alimentary comfort are good after oesophagectomy and gastric or colonic interposition. Radiocinema is an adequate method to evaluate the dynamic of the transplant and shows a better emptying of gastric grafts, compared to colonic grafts, particularly when the proximal portion of the oesophagus triggers the progression.

40|$|Pharyngo Laryngeal Reflux (PLR) {{influences}} the voice quality : hoarseness, vocal fatigue and hypertonia (Shaw et al, Hopkins et al). Our {{goal is to}} measure {{the influence of the}} PLR on the voice of 96 subjects by using the Belafsky’s reflux symptom index (RSI) and reflux finding score (RFS). 46 dysphonic patients (26 M/ 24 F) constitute the experimental group (EG) and 50 subjects (13 M/ 33 F) without vocal or gastric complaint the control group (CG). All are evaluated by subjective measures (RSI), D-type scale (DS- 16, Denollet et al) and objective measures (Video Laryngo Stroboscopy, RFS). The EG shows a RSI score significantly higher on test than on the retest (p= 0. 002). The specificity of the RSI calculated on the CG amounts to 98 % (chi ²: p < 0, 05, Cramer: 0, 678). The EG scores are significantly higher than those of the CG (p= 0, 000) although the CG obtains scores significantly higher as for the eating risk habits (p= 0, 001). In the EG, we note a correlation between the coffee consumption, the item 9 (<b>pyrosis)</b> (rho: 0, 32; p < 0, 05) and the global RSI score (rho: 0, 35; p < 0, 05). In the CG, alcohol consumption influences significantly the item 9 (rho: 0, 47). The correlations between RSI and RFS are not significant (p < 0. 05). The ENT evaluation is severe and probably {{influences the}} result. We observe no influence of the gender and of the D-type scale on the RSI scores (p < 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Encephalopathy {{associated}} with metronidazole is rare and, in most cases, reversible following discontinuation. OBJECTIVE: We describe {{a case of}} fatal encephalopathy after treatment with high-dose intravenous metronidazole and the potential causes of the irreversibility. CASE SUMMARY: A 38 -year-old white woman (weight, 45 kg) received metronidazole among other medications to treat osteomyelitis for 74 days after surgery to correct a spinal neuroarthropathy. An initial dose of 500 mg IV QID was administered. After 6 weeks, the patient was discharged and the dose was changed to 1500 mg IV administered once daily (over 90 minutes) by a visiting nurse. Other treatments included teicoplanin 400 mg once daily and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole 480 mg BID for the infection, baclofen 25 mg TID for pain {{associated with}} a congenital spinal cord lesion with paraplegia, and omeprazole 20 mg once daily for <b>pyrosis.</b> Ten weeks {{after the start of}} metronidazole, the patient developed somnolence and dysarthria, changing to encephalopathy with coma on admission 2 weeks later. Despite discontinuation of all medication, including metronidazole, 2 days after admission, the patient's condition appeared to be irreversible. After 8 weeks, her coma was considered permanent, mechanical ventilation was discontinued, and she died. Evaluating all medicines administered, metronidazole, with a Naranjo adverse drug reaction score of 5 (probable), was the most plausible cause of the encephalopathy. The other medicines, including baclofen, had a negative score of - 3 to - 2 (doubtful). All tests on infections, metabolic disorders, or interactions between medications were negative. CONCLUSION: This patient had a fatal encephalopathy, probably associated with long-standing exposure to high plasma concentration peaks of metronidazole, due to a once-daily dose of 1500 mg IV over several weeks...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the prevalence of HP infection and that of HP strains which express the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin-associated gene A (VacA) in patients (pts) with IA. 54 pts (40 males and 14 females, mean age 44 + 17 years) affected by IA, 23 pts with supraventricular (SVA) and 31 pts with ventricular (VA), were evaluated. HP infection was determined by 13 C-urea breath test. The presence of the cytotoxins CagA and VacA, in HP-positive pts, was evaluated through Western blot analysis. Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms (bloating, <b>pyrosis,</b> epigastric pain, belching, halitosis and nausea) were also assessed. 23 out of 54 IA pts (42 %), 16 males and 7 females, (mean age 48 + 14 years), 11 out of 23 (48 %) with SVA and 12 out of 31 (39 %) with VA, resulted infected by HP. CagA and VacA cytotoxins were found in 65 % (15 out of 23) and 74 % (17 out of 23) of pts, respectively. HP positive pts did not show any significant difference in the incidence of the GI symptoms when compared to non infected pts, excluding belching that was markedly more prevalent in infected pts (83 vs 42 %, p< 0. 002). The prevalence of HP infection in pts with IA is similar to that reported in the literature in normal controls. The prevalence of HP strains able to produce CagA and VacA cytotoxins is much higher in infected arrhythmic pts, as compared to that reported in HP positive controls (28 %). Further investigations are needed to evaluate the pathogenic role of HP cytotoxic strains in the development of immune-mediated IA and cardiomyopath...|$|E
40|$|Up to 20 % of the US adult {{population}} experi-ences gastroesophageal reflux on a week-ly basis. 1 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) {{is defined as}} chronic symptoms or mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. 2 Symptoms of GERD include <b>pyrosis</b> (heartburn), regurgitation, dys-phagia, cough, and atypical chest pain. Laryngopha-ryngeal reflux (LPR) is defined as chronic symptoms or mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the upper airway. Although LPR and GERD are both caused by abnormal reflux of gastric contents, they are distinct clinical entities with differing pathophysiologic mechanisms. Well-equipped to handle physiologic amounts of gastric reflux, the esophagus has a multi-tiered pro-tective mechanism consisting of a physical antireflux barrier, esophageal acid clearance, and innate tissue resistance. 3 Up to 50 reflux episodes in the esophagus may be considered normal. 4 The larynx, however, lacks both the extrinsic and intrinsic defenses possessed by the esophagus and is much more susceptible to {{the harmful effects of}} acid and pepsin. Experiments in ani-mals suggest that as few as 3 reflux episodes a week can produce significant laryngeal damage. 5 Up to 35 % of adults have symptoms suggestive of LPR, such as excessive throat clearing, intermittent dysphonia, the sensation of postnasal drainage (PND), globus, cervical dysphagia, and cough. 6 Many physi-cians, however, may not recognize the relationship of these symptoms to LPR. The clinician cannot rely upon the presence of heartburn and regurgitation to make the diagnosis of LPR. Instead, a combination of symptoms and findings on laryngoscopy and ambula-tory pH monitoring can help establish a diagnosis. This article reviews the signs and symptoms of LPR and out-lines an approach to management. Several terms have been used to describe LPR (Table	 1); laryngopharyngeal reflux is the term chosen by the American Academy o...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized {{study was}} done on 45 patients {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the Hill, Nissen or Belsey anti-reflux procedure. All patients had symptoms of GE reflux unresponsive to medical therapy, a + standard acid reflux test (SART), and esophagitis (38 / 45) or + Burnstein test (7 / 45). Esophageal symptomatic, radiographic, manometric and pH (SART and 24 -hr monitoring) evaluation was done pre- and 154 days (ave.) postsurgery. All procedures improved the symptoms of <b>pyrosis.</b> The best improvement was seen after the Nissen repair. All procedures increased the distal esophageal sphincter (DES) pressures over preoperative levels. The Nissen and Belsey increased it more than the Hill. Sphincter length and dynamics remained unchanged. The Nissen procedure placed more of the manometric sphincter below the respiratory inversion point in the positive pressure environment of the abdomen. The esophageal length was increased by the Nissen and Hill repairs. This was thought to account for the high incidence of temporary postsurgery dysphagia following the Nissen and Hill repairs and the lower incidence following the Belsey repair. Reflux was most effectively prevented by the Nissen repair, as shown by the SART and the 24 -hr esophageal pH monitoring, a sensitive measurement of frequency and duration of reflux. The average length of hospital stay was 20 days for Belsey and 12 days for both Nissen and Hill procedure. Postsurgery complications were more common following the thoracic than the abdominal approach. Ability to vomit postrepair was greatest with the Hill and least with the Belsey and Nissen repair. All procedures temporarily increased amount of flatus. It is concluded that the Nissen repair best controls reflux and its symptoms by providing the greatest increase in DES pressure and placing more of the sphincter in the positive abdominal environment. This is accomplished with the lowest morbidity but at the expense of temporary postoperative dysphagia and a 50 % chance of being unable to vomit after the repair...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Acute {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) {{is one of the}} most common infections requiring empirical antibiotic therapy. Selection of efficient and safe antimicrobial agent is important in the emergency department (ED). The aim of this study is to compare the microbiological and clinical efficiency of single-dose fosfomycin trometamol (FT) therapy with a 3 -day course of ciprofloxacin (CP) for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Methods: This randomized, prospective, single-blind study evaluated women aged between 18 and 65 years and complaining of dysuria, frequency and urgency in the ED. The onset of symptoms were less than 72 hours before admission to the ED. Patients received either a single-dose FT or 3 -day course of CP. Those with positive cultures of mid-stream urine samples constituted study patients. Microbiological and clinical cure were assessed at the test-of-cure visit (7 - 10 days after completion of therapy). Chi-square tests were used to compare efficiencies of regimens. Results: Mean age of 81 women included the study was 30 ± 12. There were 40 patients in the FT group and 41 patients in the CP group. The most common uropathogen isolated was E. Coli in 50 subjects (61. 3 %). Clinical cure was demonstrated in 38 patients (96 %) in the FT group and 38 patients (93 %) in the CP group (χ²: 0, 347, df: 1, p= 0. 275). Bacteriologic eradication was achieved in 30 patients (80 %) in the FT treated group and 27 patients (65. 8 %) in the CP treated group (χ²: 0, 1591, df: 1, p= 0. 207). 3 patients (7. 5 %) in the FT and 4 patients (10 %) in the CP group experienced <b>pyrosis,</b> while nausea was seen in 5 patients (12 %) in the CP group as adverse events.

40|$|Study Design. Cross-sectional and nonexperimental. Objective. To {{detect and}} compare {{functional}} abnormalities in the esophagus and esophagogastric junction in 2 groups with chronic spinal injuries, 1 with injuries at the phrenic innervation {{level and the}} other at upper thoracic levels, and to relate these to gastroesophageal reflux containment. Summary of Background Data. There are no studies on esophageal manometry with pH metering among spinal cord injury patients. Worldwide statistics reveal that the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease among spinal cord injury patients is greater than among the general population, at around 22 % to 27 %. the diaphragmatic crura has been recognized as an important antire-flux barrier and should functionally {{be considered to be}} a muscle separated from the costal diaphragm. However, doubts remain regarding whether this difference relates to its innervation. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study on 29 patients with complete spinal cord injuries: 14 quadriplegics (level C(4)) and 15 paraplegics (levels T(1) -T(7)). Functional abnormalities of the esophagogastric junction, esophagus, and diaphragm were investigated using esophageal manometry and diaphragmatic video fluoroscopy. Presence of gastroesophageal reflux was investigated subjectively (<b>pyrosis</b> and regurgitation) and objectively (pH metering and endoscopy). Results. the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease was 27. 6 %, without difference between the groups. This became statistically significant when the mean diaphragmatic crural pressures were compared (quadriplegics: 37. 5 +/- 17. 8; paraplegics: 26. 6 +/- 7. 2; P = 0. 048). It was also significant in relation to the prevalence of {{at least one of the}} objective and/or subjective reflux findings and/or esophageal peristaltism (quadriplegics: 85. 7 %; paraplegics: 40. 0 %; P = 0. 011). Conclusion. Spinal injury at the level of the phrenic innervation did not predispose the quadriplegics toward greater risk of developing gastroesophageal reflux disease. Paradoxically, manometry showed significantly greater crural contractility among the quadriplegics.

The causes of dyspepsia include gastric acid oversecretion, gastrointestinal dysmotility, Helicobacter pylori infection, some diets and psychologic factors. Many drugs such as H 2 -blockers and Prokinetics are perscribed in NUD. We designed a randomized clinical trial in Shohadaye Haftome Tir Hospital, Tehran, Iran at 2000 to compare efficacy of cimetidine and Metoclopromide in NUD and their side effects. This study were designed as a double blind randomized clinical trial on 101 patients suffering from NUD in shohadaye Haftome Tir Hospital, Tehran, Iran at 2000. The patients with NUD were selected. The inclusion criteria were having at least one of the symptoms epigastric pain, bloating, heart burn (<b>pyrosis),</b> vomiting nausia, regurgitation, fullness and halitosis for 3 months. Then patients were examined physically and their ESR, CBC, FBS, BUN, Cr, Ca, P, Na, K, SGOT, SGPT, AlkPh, T 3 RIA, T 4 RIA, TSH, Stoole Exam(3 times) Abdominal Sonography and Electrocardiography were checked to rule out cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, panceratic disease and electrolyte disorders. Endoscopy was done for each patient by gastroentrologist to rule out any lesion in esophagus, stomach and deodenum. Finally the patients who had not used any drugs since 2 weeks before and hadn’t had history of psycologic disorders, were selected. After illustration and taking agreement of this patients, they were devided into two groups randomly: group of Cimetidine (50 persons) and group of metoclopramide (51 patients). The drugs were similar in shape and size and color. Cimetidine were from chemidaru company 200 mg 4 times daily and metoclopramide from hakim company 10 mg 4 times daily. These drugs were administred while 2 weeks in two groups simultaneusly. Complete treatment was defined getting rid of all their symptoms. Partial treatment was defined reminding symptoms to less than 50 % and finally no treatment was defined reminding more than 50 % of their symptoms. Group of cimetidine included 26 males and 24 females while metoclopromide group 25 males and 26 females. In the cimetidine group, the mean of age was 28. 4 with standard deviation of 7. 84 years. In the other one, the mean of age was 33. 02 years with standard deviation of 10. 77 years. There were not any significant differences in age and sex between these two groups. In cimetidine group 14 persons (28 %) were completely treated, 23 (46 %) partially treated and 13 (26 %) were not treated while in the metoclopromide group 19 persons (37. 3 %) were completely treated, 20 (39. 2) partially treated and 12 (23. 5 %) were not treated. There were not any significant differences in treatment of NUD between these two groups. Also there were not any significant differences in side effects of these drugs except drowsiness that was significantly more in metoclopromide group (P-value= 0. 01). In the metoclopromide group, Anxiety in females were significantly more than males(P-value= 0. 02). There were many risk factors in NUD, also there were many drugs with different mechanism for NUD.
