2500|$|Consider {{the case}} of a thin, solid, parallel-sided {{rotating}} disc of axial thickness t (L) and radius R (L). [...] The disc has a density ρ (M/L3), rotates at an angular velocity ω (T−1) and this leads to a stress S (MT−1 in the material. [...] There is a theoretical linear elastic solution, given by Lame, to this problem when the disc is thin relative to its radius, the faces of the disc are free to move axially, and the plane stress constitutive relations can be assumed to be valid. [...] As the disc becomes thicker relative to the radius then the plane stress solution breaks down. [...] If the disc is restrained axially on its free faces then a state of <b>plane</b> <b>strain</b> will occur. [...] However, if {{this is not the case}} then the state of stress may only be determined though consideration of three-dimensional elasticity and there is no known theoretical solution for this case. [...] An engineer might, therefore, be interested in establishing a relationship between the five variables. [...] Dimensional analysis for this case leads to the following (5−3=2) non-dimensional groups: ...|$|E

The layerwise equality of strain in concrete and steel in the in-plane transversal direction y is maintained, but the same strain is assumed in the out-of-plane direction, z, {{for all of the}} confined concrete layers and stirrups. This new assumption avoids defining different out of <b>plane</b> <b>strains</b> for different layers along the height. The main equations of this formulation are as follows.|$|R

40|$|Three direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} time-evolving turbulent plane wakes developing {{in the presence}} of various irrotational <b>plane</b> <b>strains</b> have been generated. A pseudospectral numerical method with up to 26 million modes is used to solve the equations in a reference frame moving with the irrotational strain. The initial condition for each simulation is taken from a previous turbulent self-similar plane wake direct numerical simulation at a velocity deficit Reynolds number, Re, of about 2000. Three different <b>plane</b> <b>strains</b> (of the same magnitude) are imposed. In the first two simulations the strain is in a plane normal to the streamwise wake direction (the two cases having strain of opposite sign); in the third the wake is compressed in the streamwise direction and stretched in the inhomogeneous cross-stream direction. The two flows that are stretched in the cross-stream direction experience an exponential increase of Re; flow visualization indicates many small-scale vortices with little or no organized large-scale structure. In the flow that is compressed in the cross-stream direction Re decays exponentially and the layer appears to be relaminarizing. The evolution of several turbulence statistics in each of these flows is examined...|$|R

These nondestructively determined moisture-induced <b>plane</b> <b>strains,</b> obtained in 1 mm thick cement paste samples, are orthotropic. They vary with variations of relative humidity between 70 %- 80 % and 40 %- 50 %, being the highest at 20 % RH.

Microcracking due to moisture gradient could not be avoided, although very thin samples were examined with gradual reduction of relative humidity in drying steps of 10 %. The coefficient of deformation of cement paste is directly proportional to shrinkage/expansion. It depends on variations of relative humidity during drying in ESEM and the sample age.

40|$|The {{flexural}} behaviour of masonry rectangular cross-sections is studied {{in order to}} characterize the mechanical behaviour of structural elements under axial eccentric loads {{by means of a}} proper law. First the experimental response of walls under vertical centred loads is observed and a stress-strain law depending on two parameters is given in order to fit the experimental results. Subsequently the behaviour of walls nominally equal to the walls mentioned before is investigated under eccentric vertical loads, and the response is observed in terms of moment-curvature relation. To this point a comparison is made between the moment-curvature response obtained experimentally and the moment-curvature response obtained by means of the stress-strain law given, in the hypothesis of a <b>plane</b> <b>strained</b> section. Once the accuracy of the model is proved, the limit domain of the cross-section is calculated in order to be used for practical applications. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This study adopts {{the digital}} image {{correlation}} (DIC) method {{to measure the}} mechanical properties under tension in agarose gels. A second polynomial stress– strain equation based on a pore model is proposed in this work. It shows excellent agreement with experimental data and was verified by finite element simulation. Evaluation of the <b>planer</b> <b>strain</b> field by DIC allows measurement of strain localization and Poisson’s ratio. At high stresses, Poisson’s ratio is found to exceed the standard assumption of 0. 5 which is {{shown to be a}} result of pore water leakage. Local failure strains are found to be approximately twice those determined by crosshead displacements. Viscous properties of agarose gels are investigated by performing the tensile tests at various loading rates.
