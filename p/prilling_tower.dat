50|$|The {{material}} to be prilled {{must be in}} a solid state at room temperature and a low-viscosity liquid when melted. Prills are formed by allowing drops of the melted prill substance to congeal or freeze in mid-air after being dripped {{from the top of}} a tall <b>prilling</b> <b>tower.</b> Certain agrochemicals such as urea are often supplied in prilled form. Fertilizers (ammonium nitrate, urea, NPK fertilizer) and some detergent powders are commonly manufactured as prills.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1970s most urea plants {{produced}} their fertilizer in {{the form}} of prills. In the prilling process, droplets of urea ‘melt’ (obtained by concentrating the product solution from the urea plant to a very high level) are cast into an upward flow of air, solidifying as they fall. For air prilling, a concrete tower is required between 40 and 70 meters high, depending on the production capacity and climatic conditions. On account of their relatively low strength, prills are susceptible to breakage during handling and transportation, which increases the risk of caking (concretion) of the product during storage and gives rise to dust when the urea is spread on the land.Stamicarbon developed a new technology to improve the impact strength, known as ‘seeding’. This process involves blowing tiny urea particles (seeds) into the <b>prilling</b> <b>tower.</b> The seeds act as kernels for the crystallization of the urea melt droplets, and in so doing their strength is increased.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{comprehensive}} study of the internal flow field for the prilling application in a perforated rotating bucket has been carried out. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the flow field of urea melt inside the perforated rotating bucket. The bucket is mounted {{at the top of}} the <b>prilling</b> <b>tower.</b> In prilling process, urea melt is sprayed by the perforated rotating bucket to produce the urea droplets, which falls down due to gravity. These drops fall down through a cooling medium and solidify into prills. The velocity field in the bucket is very important to study, as it has great effect on the heat and mass transfer performance in prilling process. ANSYS 14. 0 CFD package is used to simulate and Design Modeler and Catia V 5 are used for geometrical model of the perforated prilling bucket. Velocity distribution on different planes are obtained and discussed...|$|E

5000|$|Ammonium Nitrate making Process is a {{neutralisation}} process {{consisting of}} a reaction between ammonia and nitric acid. Ammonia is vaporised and then sparged through a proportionate amount of nitric acid to make 83% wt/wt ammonium nitrate solution.

40|$|Prilling {{represents}} an innovative technology for continuous particle processing {{and has been}} intensively used {{for the production of}} urea pellets. The process converts a molten liquid into droplets followed by cooling of the droplets in a <b>prilling</b> <b>tower,</b> generating solid spherical particles with uniform size distribution. Up until now, only a few studies evaluated the suitability of the prilling technique for pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, lipid matrix excipients offer an interesting alternative for conventional polymers to achieve controlled drug release as they cover a large group of non-toxic materials with highly versatile physicochemical properties. Hence, the combination of the continuous prilling technique and the use of lipid excipients provides an encouraging platform to address certain formulation challenges. The general aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of prilling as continuous process for the manufacturing of lipid-based multiparticulate dosage forms. As the use of fatty acids is rather limited in lipid-based drug delivery, this class of lipid excipients was selected as controlled release matrix formers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an innovative new alternative for utilizing phase change materials as energy storage media in solar power towers. The solar power tower prilling or granulation concept combines the existing molten salt design with a <b>prilling</b> <b>tower</b> {{incorporated into the}} central receiver. In this way heat transfer limitations normally associated with these systems can be overcome since only very small particles (diameter 1 – 2 mm) are utilized. Three design cases were considered and a detailed model of the process was developed. The model demonstrates the design dependence on several key variables including particle diameter {{and the necessity of}} considering the system in conjunction with the steam generation cycle. Pinch considerations within this cycle and the tower itself determine the operational feasibility. It was found that the receiver design and prilling feed systems are crucial aspects which must be investigated further to refine the concept design and complete a full techno-economic assessment and optimization. The ‘‘best case scenario” resulted in a reduction of the circulating salt flow by one third compared to the base case. Preliminary indications are that this would result in a 20 % reduction of the overall plant capital cost, but additional costs such as solids handling and a complex receiver design have to be taken into account.

40|$|Present {{studies show}} {{the ability of}} cold spray {{processing}} (prilling) to tailor the morphology of simple or double emulsion-based fluid systems as investigated for two types of air-assisted nozzle geometries under various processing conditions. The spray process parameters varied were: (i) gas to liquid flow rate ratio (GLR), (ii) spraying pressure and (iii) total mass flow rate. The results depicted that the emulsion flow inside the nozzle (liquid cap) {{as well as in}} the spray (outside nozzle) have a distinct impact on the resulting product structure due to the respective flow stresses acting. Increasing the flow stresses either lead to an additional dispersing impact or to separation and coalescence of the disperse fluid phase(s). Besides the process parameters, the material characteristics of the emulsion systems such as viscosity ratio λ of dispersed to continuous phase and the interfacial tension γ were varied in a wider range. The results demonstrated a systematic increase in structure stability for higher λ values within a range of 0. 32 – 30. As representative dimensionless numbers, (a) a critical liquid Weber number Wel,Drop,cr/λ and (b) a critical gas Weber number Weg,Drop,cr/λ were defined to describe the effect of liquid cap-tip and air-assisted spraying, respectively, with respect to preserving the disperse microstructure of the treated emulsions. Above these critical We numbers, the dispersed emulsion phase drops were broken up and drop mean sizes were exponentially decreased due to the flow stresses acting either in the liquid flow inside the nozzle or in the spray filament outside the nozzle. Dynamic viscosity η and dynamic moduli (G′, G″) of treated emulsions increased with decreasing droplet size of the dispersed phase(s) thus altering the spraying performance as well as the properties of the liquid product systems reconstituted from resulting spray-chilled powders. A third critical Weber number Weg,Nozzle,cr was derived for the spray droplet (tertiary droplet) generation by the spray filament breakup providing information of the smallest spray droplet that could be attained, while keeping the dispersed emulsion (secondary) droplets unchanged in size. The impact of Weg,Nozzle on the resulting spray (tertiary) mean drop size was systematically explored for internal (INMIX) and external (EXMIX) liquid-gas mixing air-assisted nozzles. High-speed videography and laser shadowgraphy were applied to visualize liquid spray filament stretching and breakup, as well as the velocity distribution in the sprays. Sufficiently gentle spray conditions for complete preservation of the disperse emulsion structure were only achieved in the Rayleigh filament breakup regime. Accordingly, a pressure controlled rotary “Rayleigh atomizer” was developed to study emulsion spraying by filament stretching and gently spray drop formation, preserving the emulsion (secondary) droplet structure. At the same time pressure adjustment enabled higher throughput rates compared to conventional rotary spraying nozzles for which only centrifugal forces determine filament stretch and throughput rate simultaneously. Filament length and drop size decreased with increasing rotational speed at a given total pressure (centrifugal pressure + static liquid pressure at the nozzle inlet) or flow rate, and the filament length and drop size increased with higher liquid pressures and related throughput rates at a given rotational speed. Chilling solidification of the spray drops was superimposed in selected cases. Prilling (spraying[*]+[*]chilling) was carried out for various emulsion systems in a <b>prilling</b> <b>tower</b> applying average air temperatures of ca. − 10 °C for higher melting fat-continuous emulsions down to − 50 °C for low melting oil- or water-continuous emulsions, in order to produce solid powder particles. The microstructure of the solid particles was analyzed in further detail by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM). Concerning emulsion structure preservation in the sprayed products, the results clearly demonstrated that the disperse structure can differ significantly from the initial emulsion structure if critical flow stress conditions are exceeded. Respective process-structure functions were also quantified. For emulsion-based prilled powders, the applicability and adjustability as functional component carriers for controlled release applications is of big interest in industries such as food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics. For related functional component release experiments we designed an in vitro gastric/duodenal setup. With this, the release kinetics of functional components encapsulated/embedded in dispersed secondary or primary emulsion drop phase(s) were quantified under simulated gastric or duodenal digestion conditions. Accordingly, an iron compound (micronutrient) was encapsulated into the primary and/or secondary dispersed emulsion droplets of simple or double emulsions, and related solid emulsion powder particles were produced through prilling applying our selected air-assist atomizers. In a first testing step, the iron release kinetics for selected products were systematically investigated in the in-vitro gastric system at pH[*]≈[*] 2. 0, and quantified as a function of prill powder particle size, secondary emulsion drop size and prill powder storage time under ambient conditions...|$|E
