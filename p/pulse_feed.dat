Splanchnic sequestration can be saturated by <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> (80 % of daily protein intake in a single meal), enabling increased protein synthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore whether protein <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> increased postprandial AA concentrations, and if so whether this increase persisted after 6 wk of dietary treatment. METHODS: This prospective randomized study enrolled 66 elderly malnourished or at-risk patients in an inpatient rehabilitation unit. All were given a controlled diet for 6 wk. In a spread diet (SD) group (n = 36), dietary protein was spread over the four daily meals. In a pulse diet (PD) group (n = 30), 72 % of dietary protein (averaging 1. 31 g/kg body weight daily) was consumed in one meal at noon. The patients were evaluated on day 1 and at 6 wk for plasma postprandial (five times from 0 to + 180 min) AA concentrations (expressed as area under the curve above baseline). RESULTS: Protein <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> was more efficient than protein spread feeding at increasing plasma postprandial AA concentrations, notably of essential AAs.

Sewage which is collected from mixed industrial and domestic population may be contaminated with metals and industrial chemicals. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of heavy metals on the biogas production in the anaerobic digestion process for the treatment of sewage sludge. The selected metals are Hg, Cd and Cr III. The toxic effect and the inhibitory impact of the digestion process are among the objective of the study. The fate and toxic effects of heavy metals on the biogas production was determined. The sewage sludge samples were separated from the sewage water of the pilot plant at the National Research Centre, TDC site. The effect of heavy metals on the biogas production of the anaerobic digester was studied. The inhibitory effect on the biogas production and toxic level of metals was determined in this study. The general ranking of heavy metal toxicity appears to be Hg > Cd > Cr (III). The present investigation reveals that heavy metals in addition to the anaerobic digester decreased the biogas production as an indication of efficiency of the process. A significant decrease in gas production and volatile organic matter removal was obtained.

The weight increase of the sample, and oxygen consumption during oxidation were measured. Two different flow configurations were used to determine the oxygen consumption rate: a continuous flow technique (CF) in which reactor effluent gases were analyzed by gas chromatography; and a <b>pulse</b> <b>feed</b> (PF) technique in which small and known amounts of various N 2 /O 2 mixtures were injected into a carrier gas stream before the gas entered the reactor; the oxygen up-take was measured by G. C. analysis. The PF technique yielded the reaction rate in the first moments of oxidation, during which the oxygen consumption rate was relatively high. The effect of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, particle size, and gas flow rate were evaluated. The rate of oxidation decreased with increasing time of oxidation: the lower the temperature, the faster the rate decreased. At 100 °C the rate was independent of particle size, indicating full chemical control while at 160 ° the rate was affected by internal diffusion, since oxidation of larger particle sizes resulted in a decrease in the rate. The rate was also affected by the time during which previously oxidized samples were kept in an inert atmosphere (restoration time) : the restoration of reactivity increased with restoration time. Initial rates measured by the PF technique were used to obtain the activation energy and the order of reaction.

40|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} regarding global energy security and environmental sustainability {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to increase the energy efficiency of the transport sector. The internal combustion engine will probably continue to be the main propulsion system for road transportation for many years to come. Hence, much effort must be put in reducing the fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine to prolong a future decline in fossil fuel production and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Turbocharging and variable valve actuation applied to any engine has shown great benefits to engine efficiency and performance. However, using a turbocharger on an engine gives some drawbacks. In an attempt to solve some of these issues and increase engine efficiency further this thesis deals with the investigation of a novel gas exchange concept called divided exhaust period (DEP). The core idea of the DEP concept is to utilize variable valve timing technology on the exhaust side in combination with turbocharging. The principle of the concept is to let the initial high energy blow-down <b>pulse</b> <b>feed</b> the turbocharger, but bypass the turbine during {{the latter part of the}} exhaust stroke when back pressure dominates the pumping work. The exhaust flow from the cylinder is divided between two exhaust manifolds of which one is connected to the turbine, and one bypasses the turbine. The flow split between the manifolds is controlled with a variable valve train system. The DEP concept has been studied through simulations on three heavy-duty diesel engines; one without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), one with short route EGR and one with long route EGR. Simulations show a potential improvement to pumping work, due to reduced backpressure, with increased overall engine efficiency as a result. Although, the efficiency improvement is highly dependent on exhaust valve size and configuration due to issues with choked flow in the exhaust valves. The EGR system of choice also proves to have a high impact on the working principle of the DEP application. Furthermore, the DEP concept allows better control of the boost pressure and allows the turbine to operate at higher efficiency across the whole load and speed range. The option of discarding both wastegate and variable geometry turbine is apparent, and there is little need for a twin-entry type turbine since pulse interference between cylinders is less of an issue.

In this study, these factors {{played an important role}} in developing the discrete compact aggregates. <b>Pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> caused dramatic changes of substrate concentration and pH values in a cycle of SBR operation (Fig.  2), and enhanced substrate penetration into sludge aggregates and substrate storage at the beginning of each cycle. Moreover, heterotrophic bacteria underwent cyclic feast and famine conditions for substrates in SBR operation, which is regarded as a critical approach for granulation owing to the excessive production of extracellular polymeric substances (Tay et al. 2001). Short settling times exerted a hydraulic selection pressure on small flocs of activated sludge, and forced the slow-growing nitrifying communities acclimated in the granular aggregates. The high aeration flow rate (8  L/min) produced a superficial air upflow velocity of 3.68  cm/s and a shear rate of 1200   1 /s. This high shear rate contributes to the formation of granular aggregates that resist deformation under physical stress.|$|R
40|$|Background Sustainable water {{pollution}} control calls for effective enforcement of regulations and adoption of cleaner production technology {{as well as}} effective end-of-pipe treatment of effluents. The final effluent quality of many municipalities and industries in Kenya seldom comply with government-prescribed effluent discharge guidelines. There is, therefore, {{a need for a}} sustainable technology that can reliably achieve acceptable effluent quality for discharge into the environment at minimal cost. Natural and artificial wetland systems have been used as a cost-effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment methods for improving final effluent quality. Data and information on pulp and paper mill wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands are few while performance data that can guide design and operation under tropical environment conditions are lacking. This study was undertaken to explore the potential of a constructed wetland {{to improve the quality of}} the final effluent from Pan African paper mills (E. A.) Limited (PANPAPER) in western Kenya in order: 1) to be in compliance with national discharge regulations, and 2) to protect the receiving aquatic environment, the River Nzoia, and downstream riparian users. In this thesis the problematic wastewater components were characterised (Chapter 2). The data were used to evaluate the performance of the PANPAPER Mills wastewater treatment ponds and the wetland system with respect to removal of nutrients, organic matter (BOD, COD), suspended solids (TSS), and phenols (Chapters 4 - 6) under various operational conditions. A pilot-scale constructed wetland covering a total area of 48. 5 m 2 was located in the tree nursery just below the final stabilization pond of PANPAPER Mills. It consisted of eight subsurface flow (SSF) cells each of dimensions 3. 2 m (length) x 1. 2 m (width) x 0. 8 m (depth) cells and two cells of dimensions 6. 2 m (length) x 1. 5 m (width) x 0. 8 m (depth). The latter were initially operated as free water surface flow and later as subsurface flow systems. The subsurface flow cells were planted in pairs with Cyperus immensus, Typha domingensis, Phragmites mauritianus and Cyperus papyrus. The Cyperus immensus did not establish well due to frequent attacks by vermin monkeys and were therefore removed after eight months and the cells left implanted. The larger cells were planted with Typha domingensis. All cells were filled with gravel to a depth of 30 cm. The experimental systems operation was dynamic and ran for a total period of 3 years from 2002 to 2005. It involved different operation modes, hydraulic loading rates and retentions in order to optimise pollutant removal while maintaining good plant vitality. Initially the wetland was operated on a batch load-drain mode starting with 5 -day retention time (batch phase 1). It was assumed that this format would enhance organic matter degradation. Plant vitality was relatively poor and was partly attributed to low nitrogen loading at a long retention time. A shorter retention time of 3 days (batch phase 2) was subsequently used. Although plant vitality increased, there was a reduction in treatment efficiency with respect to TSS. It was therefore decided to use a continuous flow operation mode. The results of batch phase 2 had shown better wetland performance at 3 days than at 5 days. A third phase of batch operation was undertaken as a repeat of the first phase when the wetland was considered to be mature. In all there were three phases of batch operation and two of continuous flow. In the first phase of continuous flow plant growth was at steady stage while in the second phase the plants were at an exponential growth stage. A tracer study using lithium chloride was conducted in the first phase. Wetland performance The study revealed that the PANPAPER Mills pond system was actually performing well as per its type and design. However, the concentration of pollutants in the final effluent (average 45 ± 3, 394 ± 340, 52 ± 6, and 0. 64 ± 0. 09 for BOD, COD, TSS and phenols, respectively) discharged into the Nzoia River does not comply with the national discharge limits. Mean total nitrogen and phosphorus were about 3 mg/ 1 and 0. 7 mg/ 1, respectively giving a low N:P ratio. Evapotranspiration (8 - 16 mm/day) was found to be an important component of outputs in the water budget of the wetland system making up to 15 - 32 %, depending on the system type. ET rates were different for the aquatic plant species studied. It was not possible to deduce the actual retention time and other hydraulic parameters (efficiency and number of "tanks in series") under continuous flow, as there was no discernable tracer concentration curve for all wetland cells. For this wastewater, which has high organic matter content, the study should be conducted with a different tracer. Alternatively, lithium chloride may still be used but with continuous feed instead of <b>pulse</b> <b>feed,</b> as was the case in this study. Plant tissue nutrient concentrations were lower than in healthy natural wetland plants. Nitrogen concentrations based on dry weights in Phragmites, Typha and papyrus were 9. 2 ± 0. 7, 7. 4 ± 0. 5, and 6. 1 ± 0. 2 mg/g, respectively while phosphorus concentrations were 1. 7 ± 0. 12, 1. 9 ± 0. 11, 1. 6 ± 0. 14 mg/g, respectively. Despite this, Typha and Phragmites had satisfactory aboveground biomass production (10896 g/m and 3015 g/m 2 dry weight, respectively) when compared to natural wetlands. The growth of papyrus was sub-optimal with an aerial biomass of 3075 g/m 2. In general, plant vitality and growth was lower during batch mode wetland operation. Below ground root and rhizome growth was variable. Typha roots penetrated the entire bed depth (approx. 30 cm) while Phragmites and papyrus rooting depths were in the top 20 cm and 10 cm, respectively. Plant uptake of nutrients exceeded inputs by influent in the exponential growth stage. Nutrient mass flows indicated that in this low loaded system mineralisation and cycling of nutrients in accumulated sediments and/or in senescing/decaying plant organs are important for sustaining plant growth. Mean removal efficiency for total nitrogen was in the range of 49 - 75 % for planted cells and 42 - 49 % for unplanted ones in continuous flow. For phosphorus removal efficiencies were 30 - 60 % in planted cells and (minus) 4 - 38 % in unplanted ones. Removal efficiency of up to 25 % may be attributed to uptake into plant shoots. Harvesting of plant shoots should be appropriately timed to avoid depletion of the nutrient pool. The removal efficiencies were lower during batch operation modes. The constructed wetland effectively removed BOD (up to 90 %) and TSS (up to 81 %) from the wastewater to concentrations below that prescribed by the regulating authority in Kenya. However, COD removal was low (up to 52 %). The non-zero background concentration for BOD varied between 4. 3 and 7. 4 mg/ 1 for the different cells while areal BOD reaction rate constants varied from 0. 055 - 0. 114 m/day (20 - 42 m/yr). The reaction rates are reported for pulp and paper mill wastewater for the first time. Typha cells had consistently higher TSS removal efficiency than Phragmites and papyrus in continuous flow. Besides TSS removal in the wetland bed with developed plant roots, the presence of macrophytes does not seem to enhance BOD and COD removal when compared to unplanted cells. However, the presence of plants is essential for nutrients and phenol removal. Mean phenol removal efficiencies based on mass flows ranged from 73 % to 96 %. Good buffering was achieved even during the highest inflow phenol concentration of 1. 3 mg/ 1 and the highest hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 9. 8 cm/day in the wetland. For batch operation, optimal removal was achieved at 5 -day hydraulic retention time with a mean outflow concentration of 0. 053 ± 0. 004 mg/ 1. The major processes of phenol removal are microbial breakdown (60 %) followed by sedimentation/adsorption (up to 30 %). However, ultimate biodégradation in a mature wetland may be higher as some of the sedimented and/or adsorbed phenols may be re-cycled and microbially degraded. The removal was enhanced by wetland age and presence of aquatic macrophytes especially when they were at an exponential growth stage. During this stage plant uptake rates were 5. 4 - 12. 7 mg phenol/day accounting for 10 - 23 % of phenol removed in SSF cells. The study reports, for the first time, phenol reduction rates (k values) in a constructed wetland. Average k, for SSF cells was 27 m/yr and 44 m/yr respectively at hydraulic loading rates of 4. 1 - 4. 9 cm/day and 9. 8 cm/day, respectively. The reduction rate was 38 m/yr for the free water surface flow cells at a HLR of 9. 3 cm/day. Mean volumetric removal rate for batch operation was 0. 57 d' for Phragmites and papyrus cells. Water quality of Nzoia River PANPAPER Mills's effluent discharge in a "business-as usual" scenario causes an increase in the concentration of pollutants downstream (3 km) compared to an upstream location (500 m). The increase is highest during low flow in the River, usually in the dry season (January to March). This was reflected in an increase in the concentration of various pollutants by between 20 % and 120 % at the downstream sampling point during the month of March. From the findings of this study I predict that the quality of water in River Nzoia downstream of the discharge point would improve significantly if a full-scale constructed wetland with similar performance as that in the pilot study were to be integrated with the existing treatment ponds as a tertiary stage. Such an intervention would decrease pollution by more than 90 % for phenols. TSS, COD and BOD would be reduced by 44 %, 30 % and 63 %, respectively. Nitrogen concentration downstream of discharge would remain the same as that in the upstream location (100 % pollution reduction) while phosphorus concentrations would reduce by 50 % of the current level. An appraisal of these findings is given in Chapter 7, which also includes recommendations for design, set-up and maintenance of a full-scale wetland...|$|E

Indeed, C- 13 NMR isotopomer analysis suggested an increase of acetate utilization towards TCA cycle, due to an increased request of ATP production for glycogen biosynthesis regulated by ADP-GlcPPase.

40|$|Abstract Background Here we {{describe}} a new technical solution for optimization of Pichia pastoris shake flask cultures with {{the example of}} production of stable human type II collagen. Production of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong AOX 1 promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol. Optimization of processes using the AOX 1 promoter in P. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed-batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon/energy starvation. The development of feeding protocols {{and the study of}} AOX 1 -controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks, although shake flasks have very limited possibilities for measurement and control. Results By applying on-line pO 2 monitoring we demonstrate that the widely used <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> of methanol results in long phases of methanol exhaustion and consequently low expression of AOX 1 controlled genes. Furthermore, we provide a solution to apply the fed-batch strategy in shake flasks. The presented solution applies a wireless feeding unit which can be flexibly positioned and allows the use of computer-controlled feeding profiles. By using the human collagen II as an example we show that a quasi-continuous feeding profile, being the simplest way of a fed-batch fermentation, results in a higher production level of human collagen II. Moreover, the product has a higher proteolytic stability compared to control cultures due to the increased expression of human collagen prolyl 4 -hydroxylase as monitored by mRNA and protein levels. Conclusion The recommended standard protocol for methanol addition in shake flasks using <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> is non-optimal and leads to repeated long phases of methanol starvation. The problem can be solved by applying the fed-batch technology. The presented wireless feeding unit, together with an on-line monitoring system offers a flexible, simple, and low-cost solution for initial optimization of the production in shake flasks which can be performed in parallel. By this way the fed-batch strategy can be applied from the early screening steps also in laboratories which {{do not have access to}} high-cost and complicated bioreactor systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the cell mass yield in fed-batch cultivations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy, originally developed by Mats Åkesson at the Department of Automatic Control (Åkesson, 1999), was implemented. The purpose of the controller {{was to keep the}} specific glucose uptake rate, qs, below the critical specific uptake rate qscrit, and thereby avoid over-flow metabolism. Simulations, made to see if the method worked, and to find optimal working conditions, preceded the experiments. A robust PID controller was developed in order to regulate the dissolved oxygen concentration at 30 %. (by controlling the stirrer speed). Two different commercial strains of yeast (from Jästbolaget AB, Sweden) were used: a “blue ” (for ordinary doughs), and a “red ” strain (for sweet doughs). Glucose was the carbon source in the cultivations. The specific glucose uptake rate, qs, was controlled by the amount of feed solution added. If an up <b>pulse</b> in the <b>feed</b> rate resulted in a decrease of the DOT (dissolved oxygen tension), below a certain point, the feed rate was increased in proportion to ∆DOT. If qs exceeded qscrit no decrease in DOT would be seen, and therefore the feed rate was decreased. When the stirrer speed was close to its maximum value, a safety net in the regulator prevented further increase in feed rate. Growth was kept respirative in all fed-batch cultivations. This was shown by the high biomass yields and the low glucose and ethanol concentrations measured during the cultivations...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of feeding history on otolith shape and symmetry was examined in juveniles of 2 species of coral reef fish, Amphiprion akindynos and Pomacentrus amboinensis. Fast Fourier {{analysis was used}} to describe the shape of otoliths of fish from a variety of experimental feeding treatments, ranging from starvation, through <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding,</b> to feeding ad libitum. The resulting harmonics from both the left and right otoliths of each individual fish were used in a multivariate analysis to investigate shape differences among feeding treatments in the 2 species. When left and right otoliths were analysed separately, no significant differences between feeding treatments were revealed for either species. In contrast, when left and right otoliths from individuals were analysed together, clear separations in feeding groups were observed in both species. Differences among feeding treatments were largely due to differences in the finer details of the otolith shape, represented by the middle level harmonics. Fish that had been starved had significantly different otolith shapes than fish from all other treatments. Differences in otolith shape could not simply be attributed to differences in fish size or age among treatments. We conclude that differences in otolith shape are influenced by recent feeding history, but processes that influence otolith shape are complex and most likely species-specific.

Up to 95 % removal of TCE was observed after 5 days of incubation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} easily {{manipulated}} variables in fish larval culture is the photoperiod. Long light photoperiod regimes are commonly used to enhance growth in commercial species. However, for species with a piscivorous larval period, as the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), long time exposure to light {{could lead to a}} lower survival through aggressive behavior and cannibalism. One alternative could be modifications of the light and dark cycles during the photophase. These modifications can result in short <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> regimes since bonito larvae fill up their stomach completely during light hours but do not feed in darkness. Little is known about how such intermittent feeding regimes affect growth and survival in fish. In this study, we tried different alternating and continuous light regimes during the culture of bonito larvae to identify the best regime that maximizes growth and survival. Fertilized eggs of Atlantic bonito were obtained from different spontaneous spawning events by a captive broodstock at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) in Mazarrón. Bonito larvae 8 days post hatch (dph) were reared in 150 l tanks equipped with a lid that was used to cover and uncover the tanks to manipulate the hours of light and therefore <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> regimes. Bonito larvae were always fed with yolk sac seabream larvae ad libitum. A total of three experiments were conducted. In all, a continuous dark period of 7. 5 hours was maintained from 24 : 00 to 7 : 30. All light regimes had a total of 9 light hours except for one that had 15 hours of light (15 L: 9 D). In the first experiment, light regimes provided alternating light and dark conditions of either 1. 5, 3 or 4. 5 hours from 7 : 30 to 24 : 00). In the second experiment, the 3 hours alternating light regime was compared to two continuous regimes of 15 hours of light (15 L: 9 D) and 9 hours of light (9 L: 15 D). These two experiments were conducted at the same temperature, 24. 7 ± 0. 4 °C. The third experiment was identical to the second experiment but at colder temperatures, 21. 4 ± 0. 45 °C. All regimes had 3 replicates. 10 larvae were sub-sampled 3 days after the experiments began and were ended after 6 days when all larvae were sampled. Due to slower growth, the third experiment ended after 9 days. The larvae were measured in standard length and individual dry weights were calculated. Larvae were counted in the tanks every 3 days to estimate survivorship. Final larval sizes in the alternating light regimes were larger in the 3 hours than those obtained in the 1. 5 and 4. 5 hours (first experiment, Fig. 1 a, Tukey test p 0. 01). The 3 hours alternating light regime yielded the largest larval sizes {{at the end of the}} experiment compared to the other alternating regimes. Final sizes at the 3 hours regime were larger than those obtained under the 9 L: 15 D continuous light regime at both temperatures. The time to satiation and the elapsed time to evacuate food totally from the gut in a similar species is about 3 - 4 hours (Young and Davis, 1990). Our results suggest that a better strategy for bonito larvae growth is to fill their stomach more than once per day followed by a resting period when food is being digested. However, no effect was observed in terms of survival, possibly due to high abundance of larval prey. Changes in the light regime that result in <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> can be a good strategy to increase growth in larval cultures when fitting well the evacuation and satiation rates...|$|R
40|$|Batch {{cultures}} of Fayella panamenis were pulse fed Heterocapsa triquetra at concentrations ranging from 200 to 3, 000 cells/ml. The digestion process was followed using both bright field and epifluoresence microscopy for live and fixed ciliates. Ingestion rates, vacuole passage times, {{and the time}} required for complete digestion of vacuolar contents were determined during <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> experiments. Findings indicate the following. 1) The digestion rate of Favella panamenis begins to saturate at 2, 000 - 2, 500 Heterocapsa/ml. The ingestion rate increases over the range of Heterocapsa/ml studied (200 to 3, 000 cells/ml). 2) Each ciliate could fully digest ≤ 3 Heterocapsa simultaneously. If the cell ingested ≥ 4 Heterocapsa at one feeding, the food items were excreted partially digested. Ingestion of ≥ 3 Heterocapsa per ciliate began at an initial food concentration of 2, 500 Heterocapsa/ml. The results suggests {{that the rate of}} digestive enzyme production may limit the transfer of energy through microbial food webs under food saturating or bloom conditions. This may ultimately decrease growth efficiencies at high feeding rates, which then must be considered in energy and carbon flow calculations...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effect of acetate/starch mixture on the formation of storage biopolymers {{as compared with the}} storage mechanism in systems fed with these compounds as single substrates. Experiments involved two sequencing batch reactor sets operated at steady state, at sludge ages of 8 and 2 days, respectively. Each set included three different runs, one fed with acetate, the other with starch and the last one with the acetate/starch mixture. In single substrate systems with <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding,</b> starch was fully converted to glycogen, whereas 25 % of acetate was utilized for direct microbial growth at sludge age of 8 days, together with polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB) storage. The lower sludge age slightly increased this fraction to 30 %. Feeding of acetate/starch mixture induced a significant increase in acetate utilization for direct microbial growth; acetate fraction converted to PHB dropped down to 58 and 50 % at sludge ages of 8 and 2 days respectively, while starch remained fully converted to glycogen for both operating conditions. Parallel microbiological analyses based on FISH methodology confirmed that the biomass acclimated to the substrate mixture sustained microbial fractions capable of performing both glycogen and PHB storage...|$|R

There is a range of techniques available however the most common is feed channel spacers as described in spiral wound modules. All of the strategies work by increasing eddies and generating a high shear in the flow near the membrane surface.

40|$|A micro-fluidized bed reactor (MFBR) was {{developed}} to enable (1) on-line <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> and rapid heating of particle reactant, (2) effective suppression of the interfacial diffusion via fluidization, (3) minimization of intra-particle diffusion through adoption of fine solid reactants, and (4) on-line monitoring the composition of effluent product gas using, for example, process mass spectrometer. Application of the MFBR to biomass pyrolysis demonstrated that the reactor led the pyrolysis to have higher gas yield and less remaining carbon than the test in TG, and at 1173 K the reaction finished in 10 s. The time span to release an individual gas component appeared longest for H(2), shortest for CO(2) and equivalent for CH(4) and CO in between. Reaction kinetics was investigated {{with respect to the}} formation of individual gas component and pyrolysis gas mixture. The resulting activation energy and preexponential factor with respect to gas mixture were 11. 77 kJ/mol and 1. 45 s(- 1), respectively. These values were obviously lower than those measured with TG and fixed bed reactors, reflecting the quick reaction nature enabled by the MFBR. A consequent comparison revealed further the factors that affect the values of the kinetic parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Fats, {{oils and}} greases (FOG) are energy-dense wastes {{that can be}} added to {{anaerobic}} digesters to substantially increase biomethane recovery via their conversion through long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). However, {{a better understanding of the}} ecophysiology of syntrophic LCFA-degrading microbial communities in anaerobic digesters is needed to develop operating strategies that mitigate inhibitory LCFA accumulation from FOG. In this research, DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) was coupled with metagenomic sequencing for a genome-centric comparison of oleate (C 18 : 1) -degrading populations in two anaerobic codigesters operated with either a <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> or continuous-feeding strategy. The pulse-fed codigester microcosms converted oleate into methane at over 20 % higher rates than the continuous-fed codigester microcosms. Differential coverage binning was demonstrated for the first time to recover population genome bins (GBs) from DNA-SIP metagenomes. About 70 % of the 13 C-enriched GBs were taxonomically assigned to the Syntrophomonas genus, thus substantiating the importance of Syntrophomonas species to LCFA degradation in anaerobic digesters. Phylogenetic comparisons of 13 C-enriched GBs showed that phylogenetically distinct Syntrophomonas GBs were unique to each codigester. Overall, these results suggest that syntrophic populations in anaerobic digesters can have different adaptive capacities, and that selection for divergent populations may be achieved by adjusting reactor operating conditions to maximize biomethane recovery...|$|R

Original CW, consisted of one horizontal subsurface filter bed, was built in 1994 at Kotenčice, Central Bohemia, division Příbram. Despite of a relatively high efficiency of the CW, mechanical pretreatment didn't provide sufficient efficiency and the filtration beds suffered from severe clogging, therefore the whole system was rebuilt in 2011 - 2012. Reconstructed CW for 250 PE has been designed for treat sewage from a separate sewer system.

40|$|Tryptophan {{serves as}} a {{precursor}} for the biosynthesis of alkaloids in the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea (Fries) Tulasne, and also is believed {{to act as an}} inducer of the enzymes necessary for alkaloid production. The characteristics of the transport system responsible for the accumulation of tryptophan in ergot mycelium were investigated, with the goal of clarifying the complex relationships among tryptophan uptake, size of the free intracellular pool of tryptophan, and alkaloid production. The characteristics of tryptophan uptake were studied by <b>pulse</b> <b>feeding</b> radioactively labeled tryptophan to cultures of Claviceps species, strain SD- 58, which represented a variety of ages and nutritional states. Tryptophan accumulation in strain SD- 58 is mediated by an energy-requiring system which exhibits specificity for neutral aromatic and aliphatic l-amino acids, is pH and temperature dependent, and shows saturation at high substrate concentrations. Tryptophan transport {{is a function of the}} intracellular concentration of free tryptophan, the nitrogen deficiency of the mycelium, the rate of growth, and alkaloid production, which were measured in Claviceps strain SD- 58 growth in several culture media, some of which promoted alkaloid production and some of which did not.
