One promising method is the inverse vulcanization, which is used to prepare polymeric structures derived from sulfur and divinyl comonomers.

Hence, in the present study, we synthesized a 200 g scale of amorphous, hydrophobic as well as translucent, hyperbranched polymeric sulfur networks that provide a high thermal resistance (> 220 °C). The polymeric material properties of these sulfur copolymers can be controlled significantly by varying the monomers as well as the feed content.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} {{ultrasonic}} oscillations on extrusion processing, phase morphology, and compatibility {{as well as}} mechanical properties for blends of propylene based <b>plastomer</b> (DP) and ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymer (EOC) were examined. The results show that introduction of ultrasonic oscillations into polymer melts in extrusion can in situ improve their processability, including the reduction of die pressure and shear viscosity under a constant shear rate (flow rate) and the increase of throughput under the same shear stress (die pressure). Scanning electron microscopy observation reveals that with ultrasonic oscillations, morphology of reduced disperse phase (EOC) size and good interfacial adhesion between EOC and DP matrix are formed in DP/EOC blends. The interfacial tension between DP and EOC melts obtained from the Palierne emulsion model decreases with applying ultrasonic oscillations. FTIR and GPC analysis indicate that in situ copolymer formation between DP and EOC happens with ultrasonic oscillations and copolymer consequently acts as compatibilizer for the blends. Accordingly, it leads to an elevation of stress at break and elongation at break of the blends. KEY WORDS: propylene based <b>plastomer,</b> ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymer, blends, ultrasound...|$|E

40|$|Advances and {{challenges}} {{in the field of}} bitumen polymer modification for road construction during the last 40 years are reviewed in this paper. The history of bitumen polymer modification is described chronologically. Some popular <b>plastomers</b> and thermoplastic elastomers in bitumen modification are discussed regarding their advantages and disadvantages, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene-butyl acrylate (EBA), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) and styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS). Although these polymers all improve bitumen properties to some extent, there are still some drawbacks limiting the future development of bitumen polymer modification, such as high cost, low ageing resistance and poor storage stability of polymer modified bitumen (PMB). Researchers attempted various ways to remove these drawbacks. Some technical developments for removing drawbacks are reviewed in this paper, including saturation, sulfur vulcanization, adding antioxidants, using hydrophobic clay minerals, functionalization and application of reactive polymers. The future development of polymers for bitumen modification is analyzed as well. Since it is currently challenging to perfectly achieve all expected PMB properties at the same time, some compromised recommendations are given in this paper, among which greatly enhancing the properties with an acceptably high cost, significantly reducing the cost with relatively poor properties and their combinations. Functionalization is emphasized as a promising way to enhance the properties of currently used polymers and develop new-type polymer modifiers with much greater success in the future.

40|$|Permanent {{deformation}} in asphalt mixture, {{also known}} as ?rutting?, {{is one of the}} most important distresses observed in asphalt pavements. Rutting in the asphalt mixture layer is the permanent deformation of the asphaltic layer near the surface. As the binder phase is responsible for the viscoelastic behavior of a mixture, it plays a dominant part in determining many of the aspects of pavement performance, such as resistance to permanent deformation. This phenomenon is more critical during the warm season of the earlier period of pavement life due to the asphalt binder lower stiffness. To strengthen asphalt pavements against damage, modifiers are added to the asphalt binder. The polymers that are used for binder modification can be divided into two broad categories, namely <b>plastomers</b> and elastomers. <b>Plastomers</b> increase the binder?s stiffness and toughness, while elastomers are known to increase the stiffness and elastic response. Elastic and viscous response of binders are important aspects in the behavior of polymer modified binders and are believed to have an important role in rut resistance of asphalt mixture,although the exact nature of their effect is not well understood. In this study, finite element simulation and image analysis were used to simulate the behavior of asphalt mixture and study the effect of elastic and viscous component of binder behavior on performance of asphalt mixture in rutting. Finite element method provides data that cannot be directly obtained from experiments and are not readily accessible, such as information regarding local stress and strain distribution of the components in the aggregate structure. A multi-scale approach was developed and used to investigate the performance of asphalt mixture across a number of scales. Binder viscoelastic properties used in the analysis were derived from analysis of rheological data derived using a Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR), and were consequently used to determine the viscoelastic properties of the mastic scale. Mastic scale response was used in the mortar scale. Finally the mortar scale response provided the input to the asphalt mixture scale. The results of this dissertation prove the hypothesis that binder elastic properties and viscous properties affect the rut resistance of hot mix asphalt. It is shown that the permanent deformation of the mixtures containing binders with higher viscous component (lower permanent deformation) is lower. It is also concluded that for the binders with same permanent deformation under the same step stress (same viscous component), higher elastic response of binder leads to lower permanent deformation of the asphalt mixture; however the effect of elastic component on rutting is minor in comparison with the effect of asphalt binder viscous component. In the case of aggregate gradation it is shown that a well-graded, intermediate gradation is capable of generating effective particle networks in micro- and macro-scale, thus reducing binder stress levels over all scales of the asphalt mixture. Overly fine aggregate gradation could prevent effective formation of aggregate skeletons at the macro scale. On the other hand use of overly coarse gradations leads to lower volume fractions of fine particles, impeding network formations and leading to softer mastic and mortar matrixes. It is shown that the structure of asphalt mixture changes continuously during the repeated creep loading test. It is believed that at the end of the secondary zone of rutting large deformations are initiated in the asphalt mixture resulting in degradation of the structure of the aggregates. This stage is the beginning of the tertiary zone of rutting. This study focuses on the effect of binder response elastic component and viscous component on rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures in primary and secondary zones where the structure of the mixture has not been degraded significantly due to initiation of large deformations. The results of this study clearly demonstrates, that mixtures containing binders with higher viscous component show lower permanent deformation. In such a context, the effect of viscous properties of the binder on rutting resistance of asphalt mixture is significantly higher than its elastic response...|$|R

However, PVC-based formulations must be processed with plasticizers, which have recently raised some concerns from a sustainability point of view. In the research work reported here, calcium carbonate-filled formulations based on polyolefin plastomers, POP, are prepared in a laboratory-scale mixer, and their mechanical properties are studied for flooring applications. Plastomers are olefin copolymers synthesized using new metallocene catalyst technologies. The POP <b>plastomer</b> used in this research is Affinity 1140 a copolymer of ethylene and octene, and does not require any plasticizers for processing. The key mechanical properties of the calcium carbonate-filled POP, which include tensile strength, elongation and impact strength, are found to compare very favourably to those of PVC formulations at filler loadings of 200 phr. In addition, the filled POP formulations are able to incorporate a significant amount of post-consumer polyethylene(PC-PE) while maintaining adequate physical properties.

To further improve the EVA/crumb rubber optimized mixture for workability FT wax (Sasobit®) was assayed at loadings from 0 - 2. 5 %. This was done to match the EVA content and maintain the original maximum loading of 2. 5 % in the optimized mixture. The phase change abilities of FT wax owing to the high latent heat enabled co-crystallization with the EVA with the elastomeric backbone of crumb rubber acting as support material. The energy-sustainability nexus was found to have worked at less than 1 % loading of FT wax in the EVA/crumb rubber modified bitumen. Response surface methodology approach to all the sections of work was used {{to come up with the}} optimized mixtures based on rheological parameters complex shear modulus, phase angle and rutting parameter at test temperature 64 ˚C. The interaction chemistry of bitumen, crumb rubber, EVA and FT wax was found to be first and second order in all cases involving individual contributions and co-interaction amongst the factors. Project costing for each section of work (optimizing section, antioxidant section and FT wax section) was conducted involving the raw materials used, equipment used, labour involved and other costs incurred for all the project work...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 49 The aim of pump {{development}} {{in recent years}} has been mainly reliability, safety, low maintenance, and the avoidance of dangerous leakages. For years, more and more rigid regulations against pollution and for better safety have been issued. Many reaction components have been classified toxic or dangerous, with the consequence of a great trend towards leak free systems. For oscillating displacement pumps, the plunger sealing is difficult due to high pressure, pulsating forces and sliding speed. If ever one finds a satisfactory solution for a difficult plunger seal, there remain the disadvantage of unavoidable low leakage, necessary skilled maintenance and low lifetime. The obvious separation of the pump?s liquid end from the drive mechanism by diaphragms has been realized for years in small metering pumps. The development climbed to increasing power of about 10 kW, so that actually, there is a dominance of the diaphragm towards piston pumps. Recently, the development of very large diaphragm pumps for process service, with power up to 500 kW, shows very reliable performances. Together with the total leak-free design the remarkable increase of reliability compared with conventional multiplex plunger pumps is very important. Many difficult fluids, such as abrasive suspensions, nonlubricating solvents or liquids gases can be pumped troublefree at pressures up to 1000 bar. For process service, the application of resistant fluor <b>plastomer</b> or metal diaphragms is a mus. The design, calculation, sealing, champing, fatigue, lifetime, and especially the future development, which is expected to reduce the dimensions, are explained. Long term applications have shown that diaphragm pumps actually perform to trouble-and maintenance-free service of many months. The most important step towards total safety was the development of sandwich diaphragm rupture monitoring systems. The hydraulic system and the alternative designs are compared. This has developed towards automatic position-control of the diaphragm. Safety, venting and snifting valves and their control are very important. Some remarks deal with fatigue and wear problems at high pressure of components like thick walled parts and valves, and with design of the drive units and their control. An important condition for reliable service of high pressure diaphragm pumps is the restriction of pressure vibrations in the piping system and avoiding any cavitation. There is a significant influence of fluid compressibility on displacement characteristics and stimulation of pipe vibrations. A computation method including dampers is outlined...|$|E
