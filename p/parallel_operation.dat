50|$|The SkeTo {{project is}} a C++ library which {{achieves}} parallelization using MPI. SkeTo is different from other skeleton libraries because instead of providing nestable parallelism patterns, SkeTo provides parallel skeletons for parallel data structures such as: lists, trees, and matrices.

2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work {{was a critical}} factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations. [...] Early projects used reciprocating steam engines, operating at relatively low speeds. The introduction of the steam turbine fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations. Steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines, and generally had higher efficiency. The speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution; making <b>parallel</b> <b>operation</b> of AC generators feasible, and improved the stability of rotary converters for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses. [...] Steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines, not being limited by the allowable speed of a piston in a cylinder. This made them more compatible with AC generators with only two or four poles; no [...] gearbox or belted speed increaser was needed between the engine and the generator. It was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service.|$|E
2500|$|Weary of the {{possibility}} that the scenario unfolding in Nicaragua at the time would occur in Guatemala, the government of General Romeo Lucas Garcia began a large-scale covert program of selective assassination, overseen primarily by Interior Minister Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz and National Police chief Col. German Chupina Barahona, who together controlled all of the military and paramilitary security services. Targets included peasants, trade unionists, cooperative members, student activists, university staff, members of the judiciary, church leaders and members of centrist and left-leaning political parties. The deaths of these people, labeled as [...] "subversives" [...] by the government, were largely attributed to a new vigilante organization calling itself the [...] "Secret Anticommunist Army" [...] (ESA), a group linked to the offices of Col. Germán Chupina. [...] The ESA had announced its existence on 18 October 1978 {{in the aftermath of the}} bus fare strikes and authored a series of bulletins announcing its intent to murder government opponents. [...] A <b>parallel</b> <b>operation</b> targeting common criminals began at roughly the same time the ESA began its operations.

A partitioned object is a multidimensional array of elements {{that can be}} partitioned and distributed by the programmer.
