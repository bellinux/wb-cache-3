50|$|The {{green-winged pytilia}} (<b>Pytilia</b> <b>melba)</b> {{is a common}} species of estrildid finch found in Africa. It has an {{estimated}} global extent of occurrence of 6000000 km2.|$|E
50|$|Vidua orientalis {{has often}} been {{considered}} a subspecies of eastern paradise whydah, Vidua paradisea, since both birds parasitise the green-winged pytilia, <b>Pytilia</b> <b>melba,</b> a common species of estrildid finch. However, the finch has two subspecies, nominate melba and citerior, which are sometimes treated as separate species. The ranges of these two taxa correspond well to those of V.paradisea and V. orientalis.|$|E
50|$|Notable animals {{found here}} include the Djibouti {{francolin}} (Pternistis ochropectus), {{a population of}} green-winged pytilia that may actually be a distinct species or subspecies (<b>Pytilia</b> (<b>melba)</b> flavicaudata), {{as well as the}} mysterious and undescribed TÃ´ha sunbird or Djibouti sunbird (Chalcomitra sp. indet.). All of these birds do not occur outside Djibouti, and except for the francolin they have only ever been found in Day Forest. More widespread birds inhabiting the forest are Gambaga flycatcher (Muscicapa gambagae), Somali bulbul (Pycnonotus (barbatus) somaliensis) and Somali starling (Onychognathus blythii). The rare colubrid snake Platyceps afarensis is also found here.|$|E
50|$|The Sahel {{paradise whydah}} does not build its own nests, but parasitises the green-winged pytilia, <b>Pytilia</b> <b>melba,</b> a common species of estrildid finch. These birds do not destroy the host green-winged pytilia's eggs, but they deposit their own {{eggs in the}} nests of their hosts, adding them to those already present. As in other whydah species to attract hens the songs of the males mimic the song of their hosts. These birds are not monogamous pairs, in fact males breed with many females. In a {{breeding}} season females may lay about 22 eggs, that hatch after 12-13 days of incubation. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.|$|E
