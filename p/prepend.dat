What Windows {{terminology}} calls [...] "ANSI encodings" [...] are usually single-byte ISO/IEC 8859 encodings (i.e. ANSI in the Microsoft Notepad menus is really [...] "System Code Page", non-Unicode, legacy encoding), except for in locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean that require double-byte character sets. ANSI encodings were traditionally used as default system locales within Windows, before {{the transition to}} Unicode. By contrast, OEM encodings, also known as DOS code pages, were defined by IBM [...] {{for use in the}} original IBM PC text mode display system. They typically include graphical and line-drawing characters common in DOS applications. [...] "Unicode"-encoded Windows text files contain text in UTF-16 Unicode Transformation Format. Such files normally begin with Byte Order Mark (BOM), which communicates the endianness of the file content. Although UTF-8 does not suffer from endianness problems, many Windows programs (i.e. Notepad) <b>prepend</b> the contents of UTF-8-encoded files with BOM, to differentiate UTF-8 encoding from other 8-bit encodings.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} active {{measurement}} {{study of the}} routing dynamics induced by AS-path <b>prepending,</b> a common method for controlling the inbound traffic of a multi-homed ISP. Unlike other inter-domain inbound traffic engineering methods, AS-path <b>prepending</b> not only provides network resilience but does not increase routing table size. Unfortunately, ISPs often perform <b>prepending</b> on a trail-and-error basis, {{which can lead to}} suboptimal results and to a large amount of network churn. We study these effects by actively injecting <b>prepended</b> routes into the Internet routing system using the RIPE NCC RIS route collectors and observing the resulting changes from almost 200 publicly-accessible sources of BGP information. Our results show that our <b>prepending</b> methods are simple and effective and that a small number of ASes is often responsible for large amounts of the route changes caused by <b>prepending.</b> Furthermore, we show that our methods are able to reveal hidden <b>prepending</b> policies to <b>prepending</b> and tie-breaking decisions made by ASes; this is useful for further predicting the behavior of <b>prepending.</b> ...|$|R

The AS path <b>prepending</b> approach artificially inflates {{the length of}} the AS path attribute on one of the links in hopes of diverting some of the traffic to other links. Unlike the current practice that determines the <b>prepending</b> length in a trial-and-error way, we propose AutoPrepend, a systematic and automated procedure for conducting <b>prepending.</b> The entire process consists of four components: passive measurement, active measurement, traffic change prediction, and AS path update. The main idea is to predict the traffic change due to a new <b>prepending</b> value before effecting the change. We have also employed a number of mechanisms to minimize intrusion into the normal operation of the Internet. We have deployed AutoPrepend on a noncommercial site and evaluated its effectiveness based on the measurements collected over six months. Department of Computin...|$|R
