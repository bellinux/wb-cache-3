Some release agents, {{also known as}} de-molding agent, form oil, <b>parting</b> <b>agent</b> or form releaser, are substances used in molding and casting that aid in the separation of a mould from the material being moulded and reduce imperfections in the moulded surface.|$|E
3000|$|For an {{investigation}} into an approach to reduce the lubricating action of zinc stearate or stearic acid in the adhesive layer during the bonding procedure, two different technologies were considered and a process optimization was performed for each.

40|$|The {{potential}} to improve tools for elastomer products by application of CVD and PVD coatings were investigated {{in this research}} project. Today galvanic and wet-chemical coatings like Teflon are state of the art. To replace these coatings, the Materials Science Institute (Lehr- und Forschungsgebiet Werkstoffwissenschaften) has developed adapted PVD coatings. For evaluation the ejection force in dependence of several parameters, a testing plant was designed and built. The ejection behaviour {{was influenced by the}} vulcanisation temperature, composition of the elastomer, the roughness of the tool surface and the <b>parting</b> <b>agent.</b> Especially the <b>parting</b> <b>agent</b> lowers the influence of the other parameters. The different coatings were tested about their resistance against corrosive attack during cleaning and manufacturing processes. The following coating systems showed good resistance: CrC (CVD), TiC/TiN (CVD/CVD) and TiC/Cr (CVD/PVD). By an adapted choice of several parameters and an optimised coating system the ejection force is lowered and the corrosive attack minimised. This results in an increased lifetime of the tools.

40|$|Abstract: Wax esters are {{long-chain}} esters {{that have}} been widely applied in premium lubricants, <b>parting</b> <b>agents,</b> antifoaming agents and cosmetics. In this study, the biocatalytic preparation of a specific wax ester, cetyl octanoate, is performed in n-hexane using two commercial immobilized lipases, i. e., Lipozyme ® RMIM (Rhizomucor miehei) and Novozym ® 435 (Candida antarctica). Response surface methodology (RSM) and 5 -level- 4 -factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) are employed to evaluate the effects of reaction time (1 – 5 h), reaction temperature (45 – 65 °C), substrate molar ratio (1 – 3 : 1), and enzyme amount (10 %– 50 %) on the yield of cetyl octanoate. Using RSM to optimize the reaction, the maximum yields reached 94 % and 98 % using Lipozyme ® RMIM and Novozym ® 435, respectively. The optimum conditions for synthesis of cetyl octanoate by both lipases are established and compared. Novozym ® 435 proves {{to be a more}} efficien...|$|R

To obtain the particles up to 8 mm average size {{it is necessary to}} grind or granulate rubber bales. Because of very high stickiness of rubber it is necessary to separate single particles of crushed material using a suitable type of <b>parting</b> <b>agent.</b> The amount of the parting agents depends on type of rubber and it equals 1 – 5 %.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{electrochemical}} production of thin (35 μm) copper films on anodized titanium substrates. The formation of a microporous oxide layer on the titanium electrodes greatly enhances the surface density of copper nuclei during a potentiostatic experiment so that a complete coverage of the cathode surfaces may be obtained after short term (20 s) polarization. Moreover, the oxide film may act as a <b>parting</b> <b>agent</b> and the copper films may be easily stripped from their substrates. The higher the pore density of the oxide film, the higher the surface density of nuclei and the easier the foil's formation. © 1990. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|WO 200205972 A UPAB: 20020613 NOVELTY - By {{temporal}} variation of polymerization conditions, a release layer with property gradient is produced. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding mold with permanent layer of <b>parting</b> <b>agent.</b> USE - To make a permanent mold release layer with property gradient. The mold {{is used to}} produce plastic objects, e. g. from polyurethane or polyurethane foam (claimed applications). ADVANTAGE - A low-energy, actively-separating surface is formed, which is so stable {{that it may be}} considered permanent. A valuable feature is the clean surface produced on the molding. It requires no additional cleaning stage before e. g. adhering, lining, painting or metallizing onto the molding. The layer resists temperatures at least up to 200 deg. C and can be cleaned with a little solvent, e. g. benzene or isopropanol on a cloth, without damage. The layer remains effective even after some mechanical damage. Even after considerable damage, it is merely necessary to after-coat the mold...|$|E

40|$|A {{process for}} slip casting ceramic {{articles}} {{that does not}} employ <b>parting</b> <b>agents</b> and affords the casting of complete, detailed, precision articles that do not possess parting lines is presented. This process is especially useful for high temperature superconductors and water-sensitive ceramics. A wax pattern for a shell mold is provided, and an aqueous mixture of a calcium sulfate-bonded investment material is applied as a coating to the wax pattern. The coated wax pattern is then dried, followed by curing to vaporize the wax pattern and leave a shell mold of the calcium sulfate-bonded investment material. The shell mold is cooled to room temperature, and a ceramic slip, created by dispersing a ceramic powder in an organic liquid, is poured therein. After a ceramic shell of desired thickness or a solid article has {{set up in the}} shell mold, excess ceramic slip is poured out. The shell mold is misted with water and peeled away from the ceramic article, after which the ceramic is fired to provide a complete, detailed, precision, high temperature superconductive ceramic article without parting lines.

40|$|For {{measurements}} of stellar reaction rates of proton rich nuclei involving resonance levels just above threshold, targets of Si- 28 {{were used in}} studies of the Si- 21 (He- 4, He- 6) Si- 26 reaction using the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) Ring Cyclotron at Osaka University. Resonance structure observed in Si- 26 above the 5. 5 MeV proton threshold identified levels populated in the astrophysically important reaction Al- 26 (p,gamma) Si- 26 and help to determine the yield of Al- 26 gamma-rays seen in Novae. A few isolated states were also observed above the 9. 2 MeV alpha threshold in the (He- 4, He- 6) reaction {{which can be used}} to improve the present stellar rate calculations. We describe here the involved preparation of large area Si- 28 metal targets used for these experiments produced by the method of electron beam evaporation. The <b>parting</b> <b>agent</b> used was betaine. To obtain the 0. 7 Mg/cm(2) Si- 28 target thickness needed for the experiment, several mounted layers were assembled together by stacking. This formidable approach therefore required many foils. Two targets stacks of 0. 7 Mg/cm(2) and 0. 5 mg/cm(2) Si- 28 were delivered to Osaka for the run. Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E
