2500|$|In 1985, Thomas Kunkel {{introduced}} {{a technique that}} reduces the need to select for the mutants. The DNA fragment to be mutated is inserted into a <b>phagemid</b> such as M13mp18/19 and is then transformed into an E. coli strain deficient in two enzymes, dUTPase (dut) and uracil deglycosidase (ung). Both enzymes {{are part of a}} DNA repair pathway that protects the bacterial chromosome from mutations by the spontaneous deamination of dCTP to dUTP. The dUTPase deficiency prevents the breakdown of dUTP, resulting in a high level of dUTP in the cell. The uracil deglycosidase deficiency prevents the removal of uracil from newly synthesized DNA. As the double-mutant E. coli replicates the phage DNA, its enzymatic machinery may, therefore, misincorporate dUTP instead of dTTP, resulting in single-strand DNA that contains some uracils (ssUDNA). The ssUDNA is extracted from the bacteriophage that is released into the medium, and then used as template for mutagenesis. [...] An oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation is used for primer extension. The heteroduplex DNA, that forms, consists of one parental non-mutated strand containing dUTP and a mutated strand containing dTTP. [...] The DNA is then transformed into an E. coli strain carrying the wildtype dut and ung genes. Here, the uracil-containing parental DNA strand is degraded, so that nearly all of the resulting DNA consists of the mutated strand.|$|E

The Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal proteins are a large family of insecticidal toxins which bind to receptors found on the brush border of larval midgut cells, different crystal toxins having different larval specificities. Here we describe the display of different CryIA(a) toxin regions {{on the surface of}} <b>phagemids</b> using the display vector pHEN 1, the purpose being the identification of toxin sequences suitable for mutagenesis and selection using phage display. We show that CryIA(a) domain II, in which the receptor binding activity is located, is efficiently displayed as well as being secreted as soluble protein into the periplasm of bacterial cell. This forms the basis of a simple means for the modification of toxin specificity and the selection of toxin proteins with novel or expanded host ranges...|$|R
50|$|A <b>phagemid</b> or phasmid is a plasmid that {{contains}} an f1 {{origin of replication}} from an f1 phage. It {{can be used as}} a type of cloning vector in combination with filamentous phage M13. A <b>phagemid</b> can be replicated as a plasmid, and also be packaged as single stranded DNA in viral particles. Phagemids contain an origin of replication (ori) for double stranded replication, as well as an f1 ori to enable single stranded replication and packaging into phage particles. Many commonly used plasmids contain an f1 ori and are thus phagemids. Similarly to a plasmid, a <b>phagemid</b> can be used to clone DNA fragments and be introduced into a bacterial host by a range of techniques, such as transformation and electroporation. However, infection of a bacterial host containing a <b>phagemid</b> with a 'helper' phage, for example VCSM13 or M13K07, provides the necessary viral components to enable single stranded DNA replication and packaging of the <b>phagemid</b> DNA into phage particles. The 'helper' phage infects the bacterial host by first attaching to the host cell's pilus and then, after attachment, transporting the phage genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Inside the cell, the phage genome triggers production of single stranded <b>phagemid</b> DNA in the cytoplasm. This <b>phagemid</b> DNA is then packaged into phage particles. The phage particles containing ssDNA are released from the bacterial host cell into the extracellular environment. Filamentous phages retard bacterial growth but, contrasting with the lambda phage and the T7 phage, are not generally lytic. Helper phages are usually engineered to package less efficiently (via a defective phage origin of replication) than the <b>phagemid</b> so that the resultant phage particles contain predominantly <b>phagemid</b> DNA. F1 Filamentous phage infection requires the presence of a pilus so only bacterial hosts containing the F-plasmid or its derivatives can be used to generate phage particles. Prior to the development of cycle sequencing, phagemids were used to generate single stranded DNA template for sequencing purposes. Today phagemids are still useful for generating templates for site-directed mutagenesis. Detailed characterisation of the filamentous phage life cycle and structural features lead to the development of phage display technology, in which a range of peptides and proteins can be expressed as fusions to phage coat proteins and displayed on the viral surface. The displayed peptides and polypeptides are associated with the corresponding coding DNA within the phage particle and so this technique lends itself to the study of protein-protein interactions and other ligand/receptor combinations.|$|E

Several recombinant <b>phagemids</b> carrying P. aeruginosa chromo-somal DNA which provided for good growth on EDDHA-pyoverdine-containing medium and which concom-itantly restored production of the ferripyoverdine receptor in strain K 437 were isolated. These <b>phagemids</b> contained a common 4. 6 -kb SphI fragment which similarly restored production of the receptor in K 437. Nucleotide sequencing of the SphI fragment revealed a single large open reading frame, designated fpvA (ferripyoverdine uptake), of 2439 bp. The predicted translation product offpvA has a molecular mass of 89, 395 Da. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified ferripyoverdine receptor confirmedfpvA as the receptor gene. Moreover, it indicated that the receptor is initially synthesized as a precursor with a signal sequence of 27 amino acids which is cleaved to yield the mature protein. The deduced FpvA polypeptide exhibited homology to regions shown to be conserved in TonB-dependent receptor proteins. FpvA also shared strong homology (41. 3 % identity) with the PupA protein ofPseudomonas putida WCS 358.

40|$|Numerous {{infectious}} diseases {{have been documented}} in reptiles, however minimal information is available concerning their immunological response. One of the most diffuse and lethal reptile pathogen is Testudinid herpesvirus 3 (TeHV 3), a Alphaherpesvirinae. All species of tortoises (Testudinide) are considered susceptible to TeHV 3, however the virus is over represented in the genus Testudo, which includes, among others, T. graeca, T. hermanni, T. marginata, and T. horsfieldii, that are popular pets in Europe. Incidence of TeHV 3 -associated disease is highest right after hibernation (Origgi, 2012). The aim of this work is to partially characterize the immunological response of T. graeca against TeHV 3. A bacteriophage library composed of about 5. 000 clones containing genomic DNA fragments of TeHV 3 was produced. Bacteriophages were amplified in a specific strain of E. coli and were screened with TeHV 3 -seropositive sera from T. graeca. <b>Phagemids</b> were excised from the positive bacteriophages, sequenced, and compare with the TeHV 3 genome to identify the encoding genes.

40|$|Phage {{display is}} a widely used {{technology}} for the isolation of peptides and proteins with specific binding properties from large libraries of these molecules. A drawback of the common phagemid/helper phage systems is the high infective background of phages that do not display the protein of interest, but are propagated due to non-specific binding to selection targets. This and the enhanced growth rates of bacteria harboring aberrant <b>phagemids</b> not expressing recombinant proteins leads to a serious decrease in selection efficiency. Here we describe a VCSM 13 -derived helper phage that circumvents this problem, because it lacks the genetic information for the infectivity domains of phage coat protein pIII. Rescue of a library with this novel CT helper phage yields phages that are only infectious when they contain a phagemid-encoded pIII-fusion protein, since phages without a displayed protein carry truncated pIII only and are lost upon re-infection. Importantly, the CT helper phage can be produced in quantities similar to the VCSM 13 helper phage. The superiority of CT over VCSM 13 during selection was demonstrated by {{a higher percentage of}} positive clones isolated from an antibody library after two selection rounds on a complex cellular target.

Delivery remains a significant impediment to realizing the therapeutic potential of siRNA, a problem that is also tied to immunogenicity and toxicity. Numerous delivery vehicles have been developed, including some that can be categorized as pseudovirions: these are vectors that are directly derived from viruses but whose viral coding sequences have been eliminated, preventing their classification as viral vectors. Characteristics of the pseudovirions discussed in this review, namely <b>phagemids,</b> HSV amplicons, SV 40 in vitro-packaged vectors, influenza virosomes, and HVJ-Envelope vectors, make them attractive for the delivery of siRNA-based therapeutics. Pseudovirions were shown to deliver siRNA effector molecules and bring about RNA interference (RNAi) in various cell types in vitro, and in vivo using immune-deficient and immune-competent mouse models. Levels of silencing were not always determined directly, but the duration of siRNA-induced knockdown lasted at least 3 days.

Purified virion preparations contained isometric particles of 25 nm diameter, superficially similar to spike-less {{members of the}} uX 174 family of bacteriophages. The single-stranded circular DNA genome of uCPG 1 included five large ORFs, which were similar to ORFs in the genome of a previously described Chlamydia bacteriophage (Chp 1) that infects avian C. psittaci. Three of the ORFs encoded polypeptides that {{were similar to those}} in a phage infecting the mollicute Spiroplasma melliferum, a pathogen of honeybees. Lesser sequence similarities were seen between two ORF products and the major capsid protein of the uX 174 coliphage family and proteins mediating rolling circle replication initiation in phages, <b>phagemids</b> and plasmids. Phage uCPG 1 is the second member of the genus Chlamydiamicrovirus, the first to infect a member of a Chlamydia species infecting mammals. Similarity searches of the nucleotide sequence further revealed a highly conserved (75 % identity) 375 base sequence integrated into the genome of the human pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae. This genomic segment encodes a truncated 113 residue polypeptide, the sequence of which is 72 % identical to the amino-terminal end of the putative replication initiation protein of uCPG 1. This finding suggests that C. pneumoniae has been infected by a phage related to uCPG 1 and that infection resulted in integration of some of the phage genome into the C. pneumoniae genome...|$|R
40|$|N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are {{enriched in}} seed-derived tissues and are {{believed}} to be formed from the membrane phospholipid, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) via the action of phospholipase D (PLD). In an effort to identify a functional NAPE-PLD in cotton seeds and seedlings, we have screened a cotton seedling cDNA (cotyledon mRNA from 48 h dark grown seedlings) library with a 1. 2 kb tobacco partial cDNA fragment encoding the middle third of a putative PLDβ/γ (genbank accession, AF 195614) isoform. Six plaques were isolated from the Uni-ZAP lambda library, excised as pBluescript SK(-) <b>phagemids</b> and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. Alignment of derived sequences with Arabidopsis PLD family members indicated that the cDNAs represent six different PLD gene products -three putative PLD β isoforms and three putative PLD δ isoforms. The PLD β isoforms, designated Ghpldβ 1 a, GHpldβ 1 b and a truncated Ghpldβ 1 b isoform. Both the full-length PLD β proteins contained characteristic HKxxxxD catalytic domains, a PC-binding domain, a PIP 2 -binding domain and a C 2 domain. In addition both cotton PLD β isoforms had a N-terminal "SPQY" rich domain which appeared to be unique to these PLDs. The three PLD δ isoforms, designated Ghpldδ 1 a, Ghpldδ 1 b and Ghpldδ 1 b- 2 encode full-length PLDδ proteins, and like the above PLDs, contained the characteristic catalytic and regulatory domains. The expression of Ghpldδ 1 b showed hydrolytic and transphosphatidylation activity toward radiolabelled phosphatidylcholine (PC) but it appears Ghpldδ 1 b does not utilize NAPE as a substrate to produce NAEs nor does it seem to be suppressed by NAEs...|$|R
40|$|A phage display {{library was}} made {{starting}} from a cDNA library from the hematophagous human parasite Necator americanus. The cDNA library was transferred by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) cloning into phage display vectors (<b>phagemids),</b> using specially designed primers such that proteins would be expressed as fusions with the C-terminal part of the phage coat protein pVI. The vectors used are multicloning site variants of the original pDONG vectors described by Jespers et al. (1995). Electroporation of the ligation mixtures into electrocompetent Escherichia coli TGI cells yielded 3 x 10 (8) pG 6 A, 1. 9 x 10 (8) pG 6 B, and 1 x 10 (8) pG 6 C transfectants for N. americanus. The final libraries consisted of a mix of equal numbers of insert-containing phages from the A, B, and C libraries. Selection of phages for binding to human collagen was performed. Four rounds of panning on human collagens I and III resulted in a significant enrichment of collagen-binding phages from the N. americanus libraries. PCR analysis revealed various insert lengths; however, sequence determination indicated that all phages contained the same protein, albeit with different poly-A tail lengths. The encoded protein itself is a 135 -amino acid protein (15 kDa), with no apparent homology to any other known protein. Next the protein was recloned into E. coli using the pET- 15 b-vector. Upon isopropyl- 1 -thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside induction, the recombinant protein, rNecH 1, could be recovered by urea treatment from inclusion bodies. The rNecH 1 protein binds to different collagens: human I > rat I > human III = calf skin I in a specific, dose-dependent, and saturable manner. status: publishe...|$|R
