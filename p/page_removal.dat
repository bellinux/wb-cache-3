40|$|In {{the past}} {{two-dimensional}} models of QFT {{have served as}} theoretical laboratories for testing new concepts under mathematically controllable condition. In more recent times low-dimensional models (e. g. chiral models, factorizing models) often have been treated by special recipes {{in a way which}} sometimes led to a loss of unity of QFT. In the present work I try to counteract this apartheid tendency by reviewing past results within the setting of the general principles of QFT. To this I add two new ideas: (1) a modular interpretation of the chiral model Diff(S) -covariance with a close connection to the recently formulated local covariance principle for QFT in curved spacetime and (2) a derivation of the chiral model temperature duality from a suitable operator formulation of the angular Wick rotation (in analogy to the Nelson-Symanzik duality in the Ostertwalder-Schrader setting) for rational chiral theories. The SL(2,Z) modular Verlinde relation is a special case of this thermal duality and (within the family of rational models) the matrix S appearing in the thermal duality relation becomes identified with the statistics character matrix S. The relevant angular Euclideanization'' is done in the setting of the Tomita-Takesaki modular formalism of operator algebras. I find it appropriate to dedicate this work to the memory of J. A. Swieca with whom I shared the interest in two-dimensional models as a testing ground for QFT for more than one decade.

40|$|Abstract. A {{data object}} is broad {{if it is}} one of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) of many data objects. We {{introduce}} a new database primitive called Generalized Nearest Neighbor (GNN) to express data broadness. We also develop three strategies to answer GNN queries efficiently for large datasets of multidimensional objects. The R*-Tree based search algorithm generates candidate pages and ranks them based on their distances. Our first algorithm, Fetch All (FA), fetches as many candidate pages as possible. Our second algorithm, Fetch One (FO), fetches one candidate page at a time. Our third algorithm, Fetch Dynamic (FD), dynamically decides on the number of pages that needs to be fetched. We also propose three optimizations, Column Filter, Row Filter and Adaptive Filter, to eliminate pages from each dataset. Column Filter prunes the pages that are guaranteed to be nonbroad. Row Filter prunes the <b>pages</b> whose <b>removal</b> do not change the broadness of any data point. Adaptive Filter prunes the search space dynamically along each dimension to eliminate unpromising objects. Our experiments show that FA is the fastest when the buffer size is large and FO is the fastest when the buffer size is small. FD is always either fastest or very close to the faster of FA and FO. FD is significantly faster than the existing methods adapted to the GNN problem. ...|$|R

40|$|Operating system {{designers}} {{attempt to}} keep high CPU utilization by maintaining an optimal multiprogramming level (MPL). Although running more processes makes it less likely to leave the CPU idle, too many processes adversely incur serious memory competition, and even introduce thrashing, which eventually lowers CPU utilization. A common practice {{to address the problem}} is to lower the MPL with the aid of process swapping out/in operations. This approach is expensive and is only used when the system begins serious thrashing. The objective of our study is to provide highly responsive and cost-effective thrashing protection by adaptively conducting priority page replacement in a timely manner. We have designed a dynamic system Thrashing Protection Facility (TPF) in the system kernel. Once TPF detects system thrashing, one of the active processes will be identified for protection. The identified process will have a short period of privilege in which it does not contribute its least recently used (LRU) <b>pages</b> for <b>removal</b> so that the process can quickly establish its working set, improving the CPU utilization. With the support of TPF, thrashing can be eliminated in its early stage by adaptive page replacement, so that process swapping will be avoided or delayed until it is truly necessary.

Compared with the original Linux page replacement, we show that TPF consistently and significantly reduces page faults and the execution time of each individual job in several groups of interacting SPEC CPU 2000 programs. We also show that TPF introduces little additional overhead to program executions, and its implementation in Linux (or Unix) systems is straightforward...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} suggests that not only can the kidneys initiate arterial hypertension but also counteract it. The evidence for the latter may be briefly summarized as follows:-Many investigators following Goldblatt (1937) found that when the renal artery of one kidney is constricted by a clamp or the renal parenchyma compressed by the scar of cellophane perinephritis (<b>Page,</b> 1939 a), <b>removal</b> of the other kidney hastens and intensifies the rise in arterial pressure. This suggests that normal renal tissue is concerned in preventing the rise of blood pressure to abnormal levels. Indeed Katz, Friedman, Rodbard, and Weinstein (1939) believe that {{the severity of the}} hypertension depends on the ratio of ischemic to normal renal tissue. A second fact of great importance, originally demonstrated by Tigerstedt and Bergmann (1898), is that bilateral nephrectomy greatly increases the sensitivity of test animals to extracts of kidney containing renin. They interpreted this as indicating that renin was excreted by the kidneys.

40|$|Amphiregulin (AR) is a newly {{discovered}} glycosylated, 84 -amino acid residue polypeptide growth regulator which has sequence homology to the EGF family of proteins. To obtain immunological reagents {{to study the}} biological role of AR, two synthetic peptides containing sequences corresponding to distinct regions of AR were used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. One preparation of antipeptide antibodies directed against residues 26 - 44 of AR (AR-Ab 2) was most effective in the detection of native AR, whereas another preparation of antibodies against residues 8 - 26 (AR-Ab 1) {{was found to be}} most efficacious in the detection of AR in formalin-fixed and paraffin- embedded tissues. The growth of a colon carcinoma cell line, Geo, which proliferates autonomously under serum-free conditions, was stimulated by the exogenous addition of AR or EGF. Half-maximal stimulation of this growth was observed at 40 and 200 pM of EGF and AR, respectively. A mAb to the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor blocked the stimulation of cell proliferation induced by the exogenous addition of AR, suggesting that this stimulation was mediated via the EGF receptor. Geo cells were found to constitutively express significant levels of the AR mRNA transcript as determined by analysis of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA product and AR protein was detected immunocytochemically using the AR-Ab 1 antibodies in these cells. AR was immunoprecipitated specifically using the AR-Ab 2 antibodies from the conditioned medium of Geo cells, which had been metabolically labeled with [35 S]cysteine. The secreted AR migrated as a broad band (18. 5 - 22. 5 kD) with a median molecular weight of approximately 20. 7 kD in SDS- <b>PAGE.</b> Immunospecific <b>removal</b> of AR from serum-free medium conditioned by the Geo cells and readdition of the AR-depleted medium to Geo cells resulted in an approximately 40 % inhibition of cell growth relative to controls. Furthermore, the growth of the Geo cells was also inhibited by approximately 50 % by the addition of the anti-EGF receptor mAb alone. These results indicate that AR and the EGF receptor are involved in the autocrine growth of these cells and suggests that AR may act through the EGF receptor via an extracellular autocrine loop.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. 2014. Major: Dentistry. Advisor: Scott McClanahan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); 70 <b>pages.</b> INTRODUCTION: <b>Removal</b> of contaminated canal contents and biofilms by mechanical preparation alone are limited. Irregular cross sections, lateral canals, and apical deltas are mostly inaccessible to mechanical preparation (Siqueira et al., 1997). Therefore, {{the use of}} chemical dissolution and disinfection of these regions is necessary. Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite in providing these functions (Hand et al., 1978; Rosenfeld et al., 1978). However, adverse cytotoxic outcomes have been reported with its use (Joffe et al., 1991), as well as reports of allergic hypersensitivity (Kaufman et al., 1989). 	The ideal irrigant has attributes of; broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, ability to dissolve pulp tissue remnants, inactivates endotoxin, removes the smear layer components, and is systemically nontoxic to periodontal tissues. Such an irrigant does not yet exist (Zehnder, 2006). MTAD, a final irrigation solution containing 3 % doxycycline, 4. 25 % citric acid, and 0. 5 % Tween- 80 {{has been shown to}} remove smear layer on extracted human teeth and provides broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (Torbinejad et al., 2003). QMiX, a final irrigation solution containing; bisbiguanide, calcium chelating agent, cetrimide surfactant, and saline has demonstrated efficacy at removing smear layer and disinfecting dentin tubules (Wang et al., 2013). SmearClear, a smear layer removing irrigant containing EDTA, cetrimide and water, has been shown to remove smear layer efficiently in an ex-vivo, split-tooth model (Andrabi et al., 2013). 	The aims of this study are to; demonstrate the use of a novel polymicrobial biofilm model to test endodontic irrigants, measure the susceptibility of a biofilm to individual irrigant treatment groups, and to characterize the responses visually through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser confocal microscopy. METHODS: Clinical endodontic microbial samples were collected from six adult patients that presented to the graduate endodontics clinic at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry with a diagnosis of pulpal necrosis. For each of the 3 experimental runs a pool of one to three patients were combined to ensure a collection of heterogeneous microbial species. A series of baffled 500 mL Erlenmeyer culture flasks were used as a “bioreactor” system to facilitate biofilm formation on hydroxyapatite discs. A total of six discs were contained per flask (2 discs per cell strainer basket). The flasks were covered with a sterile, vented flask cap and placed within the anaerobic chamber for incubation at 37 °C and 20 RPM. This allowed for biofilm formation on the hydroxyapatite discs under shear force conditions. 	The flasks were allowed to incubate according to the conditions described above for approximately 48 total hours. Following incubation, discs were randomly selected for placement into a sterile, flat-bottomed, 12 -well polystyrene culture plate (Sigma-Aldrich) for treatment according to the irrigant protocol. Four irrigation solutions were independently used for testing on the 48 hour biofilms. Sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a negative control treatment group. MTAD (DENTSPLY, Int.), QMiX (DENTSPLY, Int.), and Smearclear (SybronEndo, Orange, CA) were used as challenge treatment groups. Groups included; 1 X PBS at 1 minute exposure, MTAD at 1 minute exposure,MTAD at 20 minutes exposure, QMiX at 1 minute exposure,QMiX at 20 minutes exposure,SmearClear at 1 minute exposure, and SmearClear at 20 minutes exposure. Evaluation of biofilm disruption was determined by; cell viability staining, crystal violet biomass staining, SEM, and confocal laser microscopy. Microbial speciation was performed by the Forsyth Institute (Cambridge, MA) by HOMIM 16 sRNA analysis. RESULTS: The flask bioreactor, as previously described, can be utilized for growing a polymicrobial biofilm suitable for testing the efficacy of antimicrobial and biofilm removing endodontic irrigants. 	When compared as a group, the endodontic irrigants in this study achieved a statistically significant reduction in cell viability as time of exposure increased. In a pairwise comparison between irrigants, the mean cell viability was lowest for QMiX. No statistically significant difference in the reduction of biomass between endodontic irrigants was observed. Comparing endodontic irrigants individually by time did not result in a statistically significant difference in reducing cell viability or biomass. None of the endodontic irrigants completely removed the biofilm, as observed by SEM and confocal laser microscopy. 6 of 12 microbial species recovered were found to be in common between the patient pools when analyzed by HOMIM 16 sRNA identification. This study presents a simple model for growing endodontic biofilms under anaerobic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study support the inefficient removal of biofilm by the irrigants included in the study. It was determined that QMiX achieved the lowest cell viability over the 20 minute treatment exposure. As a group, the irrigants were statistically significant in reducing cell viability and reducing biomass. However, it could be concluded that they should not be utilized as a single irrigant to disinfect or remove biofilm...|$|R
