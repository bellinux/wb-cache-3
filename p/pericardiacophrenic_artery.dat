40|$|The {{internal}} thoracic artery was studied {{because of}} its recent use in the revascularization of the myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease. the artery of 50 cadavers of adult individuals of either sex, whose age ranged from 20 to 84 years, was studied after neoprene latex injection. Its origin, relation to the phrenic nerve and origin of the <b>pericardiacophrenic</b> <b>artery</b> were investigated. {{the left and right}} phrenic nerves cross the artery anteriorly in 54 % of the cases and posteriorly in 14 %. the right nerve crosses the artery anteriorly and the left posteriorly in 22 %, and the reverse occurs in 10 %. the origin of the {{internal thoracic artery}} is much more frequent from the subclavian artery (80 %) than from a common trunk with other arteries (20 %). the <b>pericardiacophrenic</b> <b>artery</b> is a branch of the internal thoracic artery in 99 % of the cases and the average distance between the origins of these two arteries is 3. 9 +/- 1. 3 cm.

40|$|Background. the {{internal}} thoracic artery (ITA) has become increasingly important in coronary artery bypass grafting due to the excellent long-term results. This study reviews its anatomic characteristics. Methods. the ITAs of 100 cadavers were examined and their origin, relation to the phrenic nerve, presence of lateral costal branch; origin of pericardiacophrenic arteries, length, level and type of ITA termination, relation with the transverse muscle of thorax, collateral parietal branches, and distance between the ITA and sternal margins were studied. Results. the ITA was present in all cases, originating directly from the subclavian artery or from a common trunk with other arteries. Its length was 20. 4 cm on average, and the most frequent level of termination was at the sixth intercostal spate, existing as a bifurcation in 93 % and as a trifurcation in 7 %. the <b>pericardiacophrenic</b> <b>artery</b> originated from the ITA in 89 %. the lateral costal branch was present in 15 % of the cases. the ITA was covered by the transverse muscle of the thorax for 7. 5 cm (average) and was crossed anteriorly by the phrenic nerve in 70. 0 %. Conclusions. Information provided by this study may contribute to knowledge of its anatomic characteristics and in turn help prevent complications in ITA dissections.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{compared}} sternal wound infections between diabetic patients undergoing off-pump {{coronary artery}} bypass surgery using bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting or single internal thoracic artery grafting and nondiabetic patients receiving bilateral internal thoracic artery or single internal thoracic artery grafting using a modified pedicled harvest technique of internal thoracic artery. MethodsThis retrospective {{study was conducted to}} analyze the data from 3072 patients who underwent primary {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery using an off-pump technique from August 2004 to October 2010. Of the 1211 diabetic patients, 181 received bilateral internal thoracic artery grafts (group 1) and 1030 received single internal thoracic artery grafts (group 2). Of the 1861 nondiabetic patients, 161 received bilateral internal thoracic artery grafts (group 3) and 1700 received single internal thoracic artery grafts (group 4). The incidence of postoperative sternal wound infections in diabetic patients who received bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting was compared with the incidence in other groups (group 2, 3, and 4). A modified technique of pedicled harvesting of the internal thoracic artery was done in patients receiving bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting, and a standard pedicled harvest was used in patients receiving single internal thoracic artery grafts. ResultsNo significant differences were present in the preoperative variables among the groups. The observed rate of superficial sternal wound infections in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 1. 1 % (2 patients), 1. 65 % (17 patients), 1. 86 % (3 patients), and 1. 65 % (28 patients), respectively (P = . 9941). Deep sternal infections were observed in 1 (0. 55 %), 5 (0. 48 %), 1 (0. 62 %), and 14 patients (0. 82 %) in groups 1 through 4, respectively (P = . 8380). Multivariate analysis showed that bilateral internal thoracic artery harvesting (P = . 889), diabetes mellitus (P = . 96), and patient age were not predictors of sternal wound infection. ConclusionsThe {{results of the present study}} show that there is no increase in the incidence of sternal wound infections in diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery with bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting by using a modified pedicle bilateral internal thoracic artery harvesting technique with sparing of the communicating bifurcation of internal thoracic artery to the chest wall and preservation of <b>pericardiacophrenic</b> <b>artery</b> branch...|$|E
