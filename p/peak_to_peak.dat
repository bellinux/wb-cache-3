25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned an EPR spectra is usually directly measured {{as the first}} derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field {{is applied to the}} external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100kHz. By detecting the <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{velocity}} of a tsunami {{can be calculated}} by obtaining the square root of {{the depth of the}} water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10m/s2). For example, if the Pacific Ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres, the {{velocity of}} a tsunami would be the square root of √(5000 × 10) = √50000 = ~224 metres per second (735 feet per second), which equates to a speed of ~806 kilometres per hour or about 500 miles per hour. This formula is the same as used for calculating the velocity of shallow waves, because a tsunami behaves like a shallow wave as it <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> value reaches from the floor of the ocean to the surface.|$|E
25|$|With {{advances}} in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage {{directly from the}} output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967, Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since that time, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices; many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> signals, but have relatively low current output, so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage.|$|E

2500|$|Moving coil {{instruments}} {{can respond}} {{only to the}} average value of the current through them. [...] To measure alternating current, which changes up and down repeatedly, a rectifier is inserted in the circuit so that each negative half cycle is inverted; [...] {{the result is a}} varying and non-zero DC voltage whose maximum value will be half the AC <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> voltage, assuming a symmetrical waveform. [...] Since the rectified average value and the root-mean-square value of a waveform are only the same for a square wave, simple rectifier-type circuits can only be calibrated for sinusoidal waveforms. [...] Other wave shapes require a different calibration factor to relate RMS and average value. This type of circuit usually has fairly limited frequency range. Since practical rectifiers have non-zero voltage drop, accuracy and sensitivity is poor at low AC voltage values.|$|E

The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80kPa at a distance of 4cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of [...] and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. It corresponds to a zero to peak pressure level of 218decibels relative to one micropascal (dB re 1μPa), equivalent to a zero to peak source level of 190dB re 1μPa at the standard reference distance of 1m. Au and Banks measured <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> source levels between 185 and 190dB re 1μPa at 1m, {{depending on the size of}} the claw. Similar values are reported by Ferguson and Cleary.

40|$|The {{change in}} {{morphology}} of central structures with crater size on the terrestrial planets {{has been studied}} by many investigators.

What, for instance, is the amount of stratigraphic uplift in craters? Answers to questions such as this will provide useful constraints on models of origin for central structures and would help in interpretation of remote-sensing data.
