40|$|Background: The {{development}} of technological routes to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels requires an in-depth {{understanding of the}} cell wall architecture of substrates. Essential pretreatment processes are conducted to reduce biomass recalcitrance and usually increase the reactive surface area. Quantitative three-dimensional information about both bulk and surface structural features of substrates needs to be obtained to expand our knowledge of substrates. In this work, phase-contrast tomography (PCT) was used to gather information about {{the structure of a}} model lignocellulosic biomass (<b>piassava</b> fibers). Results: The three-dimensional cellular organization of <b>piassava</b> fibers was characterized by PCT using synchrotron radiation. This technique enabled important physical features that describe the substrate <b>piassava</b> fibers to be visualized and quantified. The external surface area of a fiber and internal surface area of the pores in a fiber could be determined separately. More than 96 % of the overall surface area available to enzymes was in the bulk substrate. The pore surface area and length exhibited a positive linear relationship, where the slope of this relationship depended on the plant tissue. Conclusions: We demonstrated that PCT is a powerful tool for the three-dimensional characterization of the cell wall features related to biomass recalcitrance. Original and relevant quantitative information about the structural features of the analyzed material were obtained. The data obtained by PCT can be used to improve processing routes to efficiently convert biomass feedstock into sugars...|$|E

The composites were molded with variable amounts of PF (10, 20 and 30 wt%), with and without maleic anhydride functionalized polypropylene (MAPP) (10 wt%) as compatibilizer. The composites were characterized using mechanical tests (flexural, tensile, impact and hardness), thermal analyses (thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry), along with evaluations of heat deflection temperature, melting flow index, density and morphology. Tensile and flexural strength of composites increased with PF content, but impact strength decreased, since the material became stiffer. The use of MAPP in the formulations yielded superior properties, showing good fiber/matrix interaction. In all, the use of PF as reinforcement in PPr was considered an interesting way of reducing solid waste and to reinforce plastics, being a possible alternative for the substitution of wood in WPC composites...|$|E
40|$|Natural fiber {{reinforced}} polymer composites (NFRPCs) {{have gained}} a worldwide acceptance {{as a potential}} substitute for glass filled composites over past few years especially in the automotive sector. As natural fibers are lesser in weight, easier to handle, non abrasive & cost effective, composites made from them are also sustainable & economical. Every natural fiber has its own surface morphology which decides the interfacial matrix-fiber adhesion. Some natural fibers like <b>piassava</b> have fine protrusions containing silica on their surface which enhances interlocking at the fiber-matrix interface and thereby improving mechanical properties of the composites. Hydrophilic nature of natural fibers creates wetting issues with the resin matrix which are mostly improved by chemical, radiation & corona treatments. The mechanical properties of natural fiber composites generally increases with volume fraction of fibers up to an optimum level, and then tend to decrease.
