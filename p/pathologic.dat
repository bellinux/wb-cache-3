5|$|AD {{may also}} impair LTP through {{mechanisms}} distinct from Aβ. For example, one study {{demonstrated that the}} enzyme PKMζ accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles, which are a <b>pathologic</b> marker of AD. PKMζ is an enzyme with critical importance in the maintenance of late LTP.|$|E
5|$|In itself, NSML {{is not a}} {{life-threatening}} diagnosis, most people diagnosed with the condition live normal lives. Obstructive cardiomyopathy and other <b>pathologic</b> findings involving the cardiovascular system may be a {{cause of death in}} those whose cardiac deformities are profound.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} <b>pathologic</b> gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was <b>pathologic,</b> showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as most likely a specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was <b>pathologic,</b> showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases that involve a <b>pathologic</b> proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. Originally thought to be <b>pathologic,</b> Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the <b>pathologic</b> lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|With time, {{the idea}} that the differing skulls might be {{representative}} of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, Ostrom and Wellnhofer published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, Triceratops horridus. Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region (modern examples being the elephant and the giraffe in modern Africa). To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus lineage was composed of females, the T.calicornis-T.elatus lineage was made up of males, and the T. obtusus-T. hatcheri lineage was of <b>pathologic</b> old males. His reasoning was that males had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, forward-facing horns.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>pathologic</b> {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E
25|$|S3 can be {{a normal}} finding in young {{patients}} but is generally <b>pathologic</b> {{over the age of}} 40. The most common cause of <b>pathologic</b> S3 is congestive heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Tumors {{should be}} {{verified}} by <b>pathologic</b> examination.|$|E
25|$|The long bones show {{osteopenia}} and <b>pathologic</b> fractures can occur.|$|E
25|$|The Partin tables predict <b>pathologic</b> {{outcomes}} (margin status, extraprostatic extension, and {{seminal vesicle}} invasion) {{based on the}} same three variables and are published as lookup tables.|$|E
25|$|ST {{elevation}} myocardial infarctions {{have different}} characteristic ECG findings {{based on the}} amount of time elapsed since the MI first occurred. The earliest sign is hyperacute T waves, peaked T-waves due to local hyperkalemia in ischemic myocardium. This then progresses over a period of minutes to elevations of the ST segment by at least 1nbsp&mm. Over a period of hours, a <b>pathologic</b> Q wave may appear and the T wave will invert. Over a period of days the ST elevation will resolve. <b>Pathologic</b> q waves generally will remain permanently.|$|E
25|$|For cases treated surgically, {{information}} {{obtained from the}} pathologist {{can be used in}} assigning a separate <b>pathologic</b> stage, but is not to replace the original clinical stage.|$|E
25|$|Although rare, other <b>pathologic</b> {{conditions}} may also affect {{the function of}} temporomandibular joints, causing pain and swelling. These conditions include chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, giant cell tumor and aneurysmal bone cyst.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pathologic</b> mandibular prognathism is a {{potentially}} disfiguring genetic disorder where the lower jaw outgrows the upper, {{resulting in an}} extended chin and a crossbite. It is sometimes a result of acromegaly.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} <b>pathologic</b> {{findings}} {{are seen in}} ischemic colitis, corresponding to the spectrum of clinical severity. In its mildest form, mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage and edema are seen, possibly with mild necrosis or ulceration. With more severe ischemia, a <b>pathologic</b> picture resembling inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. chronic ulcerations, crypt abscesses and pseudopolyps) may be seen. In the most severe cases, transmural infarction with resulting perforation may be seen; after recovery, the muscularis propria may be replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in a stricture. Following restoration of normal blood flow, reperfusion injury may {{also contribute to the}} damage to the colon.|$|E
25|$|If {{the stage}} is based on removal of the cancer with surgery and review by the pathologist, the letter p (for <b>pathologic)</b> or yp (<b>pathologic</b> after neoadjuvant therapy) may appear before the T and N letters. If {{the stage is}} based on {{clinical}} assessment using physical exam and imaging, the letter c (for clinical) may appear. The TNM information is then combined to give the cancer an overall stage. Stages are expressed in Roman numerals from stage I (the least advanced stage) to stage IV (the most advanced stage). Non-invasive cancer (carcinoma in situ) is listed as stage 0.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pathologic</b> {{fracture}} – A fracture {{through a}} bone {{that has been}} made weak by some underlying disease is called pathological fracture. e.g., a fracture through a bone weakened by metastasis. Osteoporosis is {{the most common cause of}} pathological fracture.|$|E
25|$|Chronic eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{was first}} described by Carrington in 1969, {{and it is}} also known as Carrington syndrome. Prior to that, eosinophilic pneumonia was a well described <b>pathologic</b> entity usually associated with medication or parasite exposures. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia was first described in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Familiar {{examples}} of normal myoclonus include hiccups and hypnic jerks {{that some people}} experience while drifting off to sleep. Severe cases of <b>pathologic</b> myoclonus can distort movement and severely limit a person's ability to sleep, eat, talk, and walk. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in individuals with epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|A Norwegian {{study in}} 1928 had {{reported}} on the <b>pathologic</b> manifestations of untreated syphilis in several hundred white males. This study {{is known as a}} retrospective study, since investigators pieced together information from the histories of patients who had already contracted syphilis but remained untreated for some time.|$|E
25|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) {{implies the}} presence of blood within the subarachnoid space from some <b>pathologic</b> process. The common medical {{use of the term}} SAH refers to the nontraumatic types of hemorrhages, usually from rupture of a berry aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation(AVM). The scope of this article is limited to these nontraumatic hemorrhages.|$|E
25|$|Romanowsky {{staining}} is a prototypical staining {{technique that}} was the forerunner of several distinct but similar methods, including Giemsa, Jenner, Wright, Field, and Leishman stains, which are used to differentiate cells in <b>pathologic</b> specimens. It was named after the Russian physician Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky (18611921), who invented it in 1891.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} review of CT diagnosis {{found that the}} sensitivity was 68 percent (95% CI 55-80%) and specificity was 93 percent (95% CI 89-96%) compared with <b>pathologic</b> examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard. With triple-phase helical CT, the sensitivity 90% or higher, but this data has not been confirmed with autopsy studies.|$|E
25|$|Three {{examples}} of hallucinations {{can be linked}} to <b>pathologic</b> neurophysiology: the belief that there is an intruder in the room, the incubus, and vestibular motor sensations. A neurological hypothesis is that in sleep paralysis, these mechanisms—which usually coordinate body movement and provide information on body position—become activated and, because there is no actual movement, induce a floating sensation.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin {{variants}} {{are a part}} of {{the normal}} embryonic and fetal development. They may also be <b>pathologic</b> mutant forms of hemoglobin in a population, caused by variations in genetics. Some well-known hemoglobin variants, such as sickle-cell anemia, are responsible for diseases and are considered hemoglobinopathies. Other variants cause no detectable pathology, and are thus considered non-pathological variants.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications to HIFU for {{prostate}} cancer include a prostate volume larger than 40grams, which can prevent targeted HIFU waves from reaching the anterior and anterobasal regions of the prostate, anatomic or <b>pathologic</b> conditions that may interfere with the introduction or displacement of the HIFU probe into the rectum, and high-volume calcification within the prostate, {{which can lead to}} HIFU scattering and transmission impairment.|$|E
25|$|A {{miscarriage}} may {{be confirmed}} by an obstetric ultrasound and by {{the examination of the}} passed tissue. When looking for microscopic <b>pathologic</b> symptoms, one looks for the products of conception. Microscopically, these include villi, trophoblast, fetal parts, and background gestational changes in the endometrium. When chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than one miscarriage, genetic testing of both parents may be done.|$|E
25|$|Dirofiliaria are {{important}} medical parasites, but diagnosis is unusual {{and is often}} only made after an infected person happens to have a chest X-ray following granuloma formation in the lung; the nodule may {{be large enough to}} resemble lung cancer on the X-ray and require a biopsy for a <b>pathologic</b> assessment. This may well be the most significant medical consequence of human infection by the dog heartworm.|$|E
25|$|Early stages (IB1 and IIA {{less than}} 4nbsp&cm) {{can be treated}} with radical {{hysterectomy}} with removal of the lymph nodes or radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is given as external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and brachytherapy (internal radiation). Women treated with surgery who have high-risk features found on <b>pathologic</b> examination are given radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy {{to reduce the risk}} of relapse.|$|E
25|$|In some contexts, {{the word}} {{thrombus}} is used interchangeably {{with the word}} clot, regardless of its composition (white, red, or mixed). In other contexts {{it is used to}} contrast a normal from an abnormal clot: thrombus arises from physiologic hemostasis, thrombosis arises from a <b>pathologic</b> and excessive quantity of clot. In a third context it is used to contrast the result from the process: thrombus is the result, thrombosis is the process.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{is associated}} with the HLA-B27 gene on chromosome 6 and by the presence of enthesitis as the basic <b>pathologic</b> lesion and is triggered by a preceding infection. The most common triggering infection in the US is a genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Other bacteria known to cause reactive arthritis which are more common worldwide are Ureaplasma urealyticum, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., and Campylobacter spp.|$|E
25|$|That anecdote {{probably}} illustrates {{better than}} any other the early promise of a distinguished scientific career. Where many other physicians had found laboratory work in the army a chore, McManus had made the very best use of the available resources. Many of the principles of histochemistry had been established before the outbreak of war, but developing and applying them to the physiologic and <b>pathologic</b> problems were mainly a post World War II contribution to medical science.|$|E
