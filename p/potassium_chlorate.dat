Aeroplanes struggled to reach a typical altitude of , and firing the solid bullets usually used by aircraft Lewis guns was ineffectual: they made small holes causing inconsequential gas leaks. Britain developed new bullets, the Brock containing flammable <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate,</b> and the Buckingham filled with phosphorus, to ignite the <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> and hence the Zeppelin's hydrogen. These had become available by September 1916. They proved very successful, and Lewis guns loaded {{with a mixture of}} Brock and Buckingham ammunition were often employed for balloon-busting against German Zeppelins, other airships and Drache barrage balloons.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{striking}} {{match with}} a phosphorus head {{was invented by}} Charles Sauria in 1830. These matches (and subsequent modifications) were made with heads of white phosphorus, an oxygen-releasing compound (<b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate,</b> lead dioxide, or sometimes nitrate), and a binder. They were poisonous to the workers in manufacture, sensitive to storage conditions, toxic if ingested, and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface. [...] Production in several countries was banned between 1872 and 1925. The international Berne Convention, ratified in 1906, prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oxidation}} of aniline {{has been}} heavily investigated, and {{can result in}} reactions localized at nitrogen or more commonly results {{in the formation of}} new C-N bonds. In alkaline solution, azobenzene results, whereas arsenic acid produces the violet-coloring matter violaniline. Chromic acid converts it into quinone, whereas chlorates, in the presence of certain metallic salts (especially of vanadium), give aniline black. Hydrochloric acid and <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> give chloranil. Potassium permanganate in neutral solution oxidizes it to nitrobenzene, in alkaline solution to azobenzene, ammonia and oxalic acid, in acid solution to aniline black. Hypochlorous acid gives 4-aminophenol and para-amino diphenylamine. [...] Oxidation with persulfate affords a variety of polyanilines compounds. These polymers exhibit rich redox and acid-base properties.|$|E
2500|$|Riis had {{for some}} time been {{wondering}} how to show the squalor of which he wrote more vividly than his words could express. He tried sketching, but was incompetent at this. Camera lenses of the 1880s were slow as was the emulsion of photographic plates; photography thus {{did not seem to}} be of any use for reporting about conditions of life in dark interiors. In early 1887, however, Riis was startled to read that [...] "a way had been discovered to take pictures by flashlight. The darkest corner might be photographed that way." [...] The German innovation, by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke, flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> and some antimony sulfide for added stability; the powder was used in a pistol-like device that fired cartridges. [...] This was the introduction of flash photography.|$|E
2500|$|Lesmok powder was {{a product}} {{developed}} by DuPont in 1911, one of several semi-smokeless products in the industry containing a mixture of black and nitrocellulose powder. It was sold to Winchester and others primarily for [...]22 and [...]32 small calibers. Its advantage {{was that it was}} believed at the time to be less corrosive than smokeless powders then in use. [...] It was not understood in the U.S. until the 1920s that the actual source of corrosion was the potassium chloride residue from <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> sensitized primers. [...] The bulkier black powder fouling better disperses primer residue. [...] Failure to mitigate primer corrosion by dispersion caused the false impression that nitrocellulose-based powder caused corrosion. [...] Lesmok had some of the bulk of black powder for dispersing primer residue, but somewhat less total bulk than straight black powder, thus requiring less frequent bore cleaning. [...] It was last sold by Winchester in 1947.|$|E
6000|$|But {{he never}} really did experiments, except that in the class in {{systematic}} botany he sometimes made us tease common flowers to pieces. He did not do experiments if he could possibly help it, because {{in the first place}} they used up time and gas for the Bunsen burner and good material in a ruinous fashion, and in the second they were, in his rather careless and sketchy hands, apt to endanger the apparatus of the Institute and even the lives of his students. Then thirdly, real experiments involved washing up. And moreover they always turned out wrong, and sometimes misled the too observant learner very seriously and opened demoralising controversies. Quite early in life I acquired an almost ineradicable sense of the unscientific perversity of Nature and the impassable gulf that is fixed between systematic science and elusive fact. I knew, for example, that in science, whether it be subject XII., Organic Chemistry, or subject XVII., Animal Physiology, when you blow into a glass of lime-water it instantly becomes cloudy, and if you continue to blow it clears again, whereas in truth you may blow into the stuff from the lime-water bottle until you are crimson in the face and painful under the ears, and it never becomes cloudy at all. And I knew, too, that in science if you put <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> into a retort and heat it over a Bunsen burner, oxygen is disengaged and may be collected over water, whereas in real life if you do anything of the sort the vessel cracks with a loud report, the <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> descends sizzling upon the flame, the experimenter says [...] "Oh! Damn!" [...] with astonishing heartiness and distinctness, and a lady student in the back seats gets up and leaves the room.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> {{should be}} handled with care. It reacts vigorously, {{and in some}} cases spontaneously ignites or explodes, when mixed with many {{combustible}} materials. It burns vigorously in combination with virtually any combustible material, even those normally only slightly flammable (including ordinary dust and lint). Mixtures of <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> and a fuel can ignite by contact with sulfuric acid, so it should be kept away from this reagent.Sulfur should be avoided in pyrotechnic compositions containing <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate,</b> as these mixtures are prone to spontaneous deflagration. Most sulfur contains trace quantities of sulfur-containing acids, and these can cause spontaneous ignition - [...] "Flowers of sulfur" [...] or [...] "sublimed sulfur", despite the overall high purity, contains significant amounts of sulfur acids. Also, mixtures of <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> with any compound with ignition promoting properties (ex. antimony(III) sulfide) are very dangerous to prepare, as they are extremely shock sensitive.|$|E
50|$|The safe {{performance}} of this reaction requires very pure reagents and careful temperature control. Molten <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> {{is an extremely}} powerful oxidizer and spontaneously reacts with many common materials such as sugar. Explosions have resulted from liquid chlorates spattering into the latex or PVC tubes of oxygen generators, {{as well as from}} contact between chlorates and hydrocarbon sealing greases. Impurities in <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate</b> itself can also cause problems. When working with a new batch of <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorate,</b> it is advisable to take a small sample (~1 gram) and heat it strongly on an open glass plate.
