40|$|In our {{analytical}} {{general equilibrium model}} {{where two}} polluting inputs can be substitutes or complements in production, we {{study the effects of}} a tax on one pollutant in two cases: one where both pollutants face taxes and the second where the other pollutant is subject to a <b>permit</b> <b>policy.</b> In each case, we solve for closed-form solutions that highlight important parameters.

First, the change in the pollutant facing a tax increase depends on whether the other pollutant is subject to a tax or <b>permit</b> <b>policy.</b> Second, if that other pollutant is subject to a tax, then general equilibrium effects can increase or decrease its quantity (affecting overall welfare).

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the impact of migrant workers on the Israeli wage structure, on the chances of being {{unemployed}} or out of the labor force and on inequality in gross earnings from work. One of the manifestations of globalization is the movement of migrant workers from low-income to richer countries. The recent increase in living standards in Israel has created significant wage differentials for workers from low-income countries. Paradoxically,an important trigger for this process was also the worsening of Israel’s security situation in 1993,following the Oslo accord between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel responded to the deterioration by closures,which sharply reduced the number of Palestinian workers in Israel,substituting them with migrant workers, mainly from Eastern Europe,South and Central America and the Far East. The rapid inflow of migrant workers,especially since 1995,makes Israel an interesting case study for studying its effects on labor force participation, unemployment,the wage structure and gross earnings inequality. Given the bias in the government’s <b>permit</b> <b>policy</b> in favor of unskilled workers,the paper emphasizes the effects on Israelis with weak economic endowments. The research is based on pooled micro data,combined with data on the number of non-Israeli workers by economic branch. The micro-data is based on the Israeli income survey,including a host of personal characteristics,such as the individual’s education level,labor market status and a model-based calculation of welfare benefits. The research also focuses on government policy issues,such as the effect of the replacement ratio on the rate of labor force participation. For individuals not in the labor force the replacement ratio is defined as the income support payment divided by the potential wage. The inflow of migrant workers affects the potential wage negatively and together with a relatively easy access to income support payments,this policy variable is found to contribute significantly to the explanation of the exclusion from the labor force and the worsening of gross earnings distribution in a statistically significant way. The effect of these variables on unemployment is less clear and the effects on the wage structure are varied,distinguishing between substitutive and complementary effects,depending on the individual’s occupational and educational characteristics {{as well as on the}} time perspective. The study also shows that the highly branch-specific Israeli migrant <b>permit</b> <b>policy</b> did not prevent the effects on wages from spreading throughout the economy,thus emphasizing the general-equilibrium nature of these effects. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} missing markets, heterogeneous pollutants, and the pollution technology of firms on the efficacy of transferable pollution permits. Under the assumption of perfect competition in all markets, we show that if firms can substitute among pollutants, then setting the “optimal” number of permits for only one pollutant will not, in general, lead to an efficient outcome. The degree of the inefficiency {{will depend on the}} information set available to the regulator and the substitutability among pollutants by firms. When establishing transferable pollution rights regulators should, therefore, consider the technology of firms. If firms discharge pollutants in the same fixed proportions, then the regulator need only set a market for one of the pollutants to ensure an efficient outcome. Where firms can substitute among pollutants, however, establishing a market for only one pollutant provides an incentive for firms to substitute to unregulated ones. This is an important policy issue as substitutability among pollutants within and across production processes may dampen the dynamic advantages of a tradeable <b>permit</b> <b>policy.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1994 Pollution, permit markets, technology, Jel Classification.

40|$|AbstractStudy regionThree {{districts in}} {{crystalline}} aquifer region of semi-arid south India. Study focusIndia, world’s largest groundwater user (250 billionm 3 yr− 1) {{has been reported}} to experience declining groundwater levels. However, the statistical significance of the decline has not been analyzed to separate human effects from natural variability. Trends in groundwater levels in three administrative districts of south India were analyzed and explained through changes in irrigation, rainfall, and agricultural power subsidy. New hydrological insights for the regionContrary to common perception of widespread groundwater declines only 22 – 36 % of the wells showed statistically significant declines. The use of well depth during dry well periods may slightly underestimate the number of declining wells (by 1 %) and rate of decline. Increase in groundwater irrigated area combined with rainfall and power subsidy policy, were the main causative factors for the decline. Groundwater decline after implementation of free-electricity policy in 2004 confirmed the nexus between power subsidy and groundwater. These declines are likely to worsen due to future well drillings. Trends in other regions with similar hydro-geologic conditions need to be analyzed to verify groundwater declines and its linkages with power subsidy. Once established, reforms in power subsidy and well <b>permit</b> <b>policy</b> along with conversion to efficient micro–irrigation may be needed to maintain or enhance groundwater availability in the crystalline aquifer region of India (240 millionha) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{particular}} {{aspect of}} 2 ̆ 2 consumer {{behavior in the}} health marketplace 2 ̆ 2 I should like to emphasize {{is the problem of}} access to medical care. Health care policy makers, planners, administrators, and medical care consumers themselves are increasingly voicing their concern that access to the medical care system should be improved. A plethora of programs has been launched during the past decade with the expressed objective of achieving equity of access to medical care in the United States. Some of these programs are directed at increasing the buying power or medical knowledge of the health care consumer-e. g., Medicaid, Medicare, national health insurance, and health education and nutrition programs. Others seek to improve the availability or organization of medical manpower and facilities-e. g., development of family practice as a specialty, paramedical training programs, and HMOs. All these programs are intended in some way to provide equal access to the medical care system to various groups in the population. Just what the concept of 2 ̆ 2 access 2 ̆ 2 means, however, much less how it might be measured and what methods should be used to evaluate it, is ill-defined. Thus far, access has been primarily a political concept.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{undertakes}} {{to answer}} the question of how used petroleum oil and grease enter groundwater or to the drain becoming both environmental and economic problems to utility companies. Design/methodology/approach: Laboratory methodology was based on modern instrumentation validated further with experimental investigation. Petroleum-contaminated soil samples were analyzed for oil and grease (O/G) content, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), and volatile aromatic compounds: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and naphthalene. Gas chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyse BTEX and naphthalene analytes. Findings: The results show that total petroleum hydrocarbon fraction (TPH) accounted for oil and grease (O/G) and the ratio of [TPH]/[O/G] ranged from 12 % to 50 %. The results of volatile organic fraction (BTEX) accounted for {{only a small part of}} total TPH and the ratio of [BTEX]/[TPH] ranged below 1 %. The concentration of four samples for TPH test exceeded the regulatory limit of 500 ppm for hydrocarbons. The gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) method appear to offer the best basis for standard TPH test in soil and groundwater verification of site cleanup. Research limitations/implications: In the future it will be possible to apply the procedures to other more complicated cases e. g. used oil containing more than 1000 ppm total halogens, which is regulated as hazardous waste. Practical implications: Promising directions for adaptation of appropriate pre-treatment standard processes for recycling programs, pollution prevention and reduction of maintenance cost. Originality/value: The gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) methods appear to offer the best hope for standard TPH test in soil and groundwater verification of site cleanup.
