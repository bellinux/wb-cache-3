Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E

Alcohol related expectancies are correlated with parental alcoholism and alcohol abuse among their offspring. Problem solving discussions in families with an alcoholic parent contained more negative family interactions than in families with non-alcoholics parents. Several factors related to parental alcoholism influence COA substance abuse including stress, negative affect and decreased parental monitoring. Impaired parental monitoring and negative affect correlate with COAs associating with peers that support drug use.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia has classically been {{associated}} with disturbances to interoception with people hyper-focused on their bodies. People with anorexia concentrate on distorted <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> body exterior in fear of weight gain, and they also report altered physical states within their bodies, such as indistinct feelings of fullness or {{are not able to}} distinguish emotional states from bodily sensations in general (also called alexithymia). Further, people with anorexia experience abnormally intense cardiorespiratory sensations, particularly of the breath, and this is most prevalent before they consume a meal. Abnormal senses of interoceptive awareness such as these have been observed so frequently in anorexia that they have become key characteristics of the illness.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} information exchange patterns between 98 married couples in Israel where {{one is a}} cancer patient {{and the other is}} the main caregiver. Specifically, the accuracy <b>of</b> each spouse's <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the extent of knowledge and the need to receive more disease-related information is examined {{as a function of the}} role (patient-caregiver) and gender of the participants. The results showed that women, regardless <b>of</b> <b>their</b> role, were inaccurate in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> husbands' knowledge and motivation to know more. For men, a difference between the roles was found for the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wives' knowledge.

25|$|Peasant {{women were}} rarely held {{accountable}} for their actions because of the officials’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> protests. They “physically blocked the entrances to huts of peasants scheduled to be exiled as kulaks, forcibly took back socialized seed and livestock, and led assaults on officials.” Officials ran away and hid to let the riots run their course. When women came to trial, they were given less harsh punishments as the men because women, to officials, were seen as illiterate and the most backward part of the peasantry. One particular case of this was a riot in a Russian village of Belovka where protestors were beating {{members of the local}} soviet and setting fire to their homes. The men were held exclusively responsible as the main culprits. Women were given sentences to serve as a warning, not as a punishment. Because of how they were perceived, women were able to play an essential role in the resistance to collectivization.|$|E

2500|$|A concept {{related to}} {{organizational}} justice is {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR). Organizational justice generally refers to perceptions of fairness in treatment of individuals internal to that organization while corporate social responsibility focuses on the fairness of treatment of entities external to the organization. Corporate social responsibility refers to a mechanism by which businesses monitor and regulate their performance in line with moral and societal standards such that it has positive influences on all of its stakeholders (Carroll, 1999). Thus, CSR involves organizations going above and beyond what is moral or ethical and behaving in ways that benefit members of society in general. [...] It has been proposed that an employee's <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> organization's level of corporate social responsibility can impact that individual's own attitudes and perceptions of justice {{even if they are}} not the victim of unfair acts (Rupp et al., 2006).|$|E
2500|$|Studies by Michael Conway et al., David Wagner and Joseph Berger, John Williams and Deborah Best, and Susan Fiske et al. found {{widely shared}} {{cultural}} beliefs {{that men are}} more socially valued and more competent than women at most things, as well as specific assumptions that men are better at some particular tasks (e.g., math, mechanical tasks) while women are better at others (e.g., nurturing tasks). Shelley Correll, Michael Lovaglia, Margaret Shih et al., and Claude Steele show that these gender status beliefs affect the assessments people make of their own competence at career-relevant tasks. Correll found that specific stereotypes (e.g., women have lower mathematical ability) affect women's and men's <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> abilities (e.g., in math and science) such that men assess their own task ability higher than women performing at the same level. These [...] "biased self-assessments" [...] shape men and women's educational and career decisions.|$|E
2500|$|The Fascists paid special {{attention}} to the role of women, from elite society women to factory workers and peasants. Fascist leaders sought to [...] "rescue" [...] women from experiencing emancipation even as they trumpeted the advent of the [...] "new Italian woman" [...] (nuova italiana). The policies revealed a deep conflict between modernity and traditional patriarchal authority, as Catholic, Fascist and commercial models of conduct competed to shape women's <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> roles and their society at large. The Fascists celebrated violent [...] "virilist" [...] politics and exaggerated its machismo while also taxing celibate men to pay for child welfare programs. Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 and the resulting League of Nations sanctions shaped the tasks assigned to women within the Fascist Party. The empire and women's contribution to it became a core theme in Fascist propaganda. Women in the party were mobilized for the imperial cause both as producers and as consumers, giving them new prominence in the nation. The Fascist women's groups expanded their roles to cover such new tasks as running training courses on how to fight waste in housework. Young Italian women were prepared for a role in Italy's [...] "place in the sun" [...] through special courses created to train them for a future as colonial wives.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of students’ {{participation}} in the certificate program offered by the Asian Studies Center (ASC) at the University <b>of</b> Pittsburgh on <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> global competency and skills development for international careers. Undergraduate and graduate students who {{were enrolled in the}} ASC’s certificate program as of March 16, 2012 (n= 125) participated in an on-line student survey. Data are used to provide a descriptive analysis, significance tests, and a multiple regression analysis that examine six research questions. The descriptive analysis explores students’ characteristics, satisfaction with the certificate program, international experience, foreign language capability, {{and the extent to which}} the certificate program increases their global competency and skills for international careers. Tests were conducted to examine whether the differences in pre-post increases in students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency and skills development for international careers were statistically significant for all respondents as well as between disaggregated groups. The multiple regression analysis tests the correlation between three independent variables (courses taken in the certificate program, center activity participation, and students’ international experience) and each of the two dependent variables (students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> increased global competency and students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> improved skills for international careers). Findings show that significantly different changes in students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency and skills development for international careers exist before their participation in the certificate program and after their participation in the certificate program. Students who stayed 1 - 6 months in an Asian country have the most significant increases in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency after their participation in the certificate program. Senior students have the most significant increases in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency and skills for international careers after their participation in the certificate program. Students’ international experience and courses taken in the certificate program are important variables related to <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> increased global competency and improved skill for international careers. The effect of students’ international experience is greater than courses taken in the certificate program on <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> increased global competency and improved skills for international careers. ...|$|R
