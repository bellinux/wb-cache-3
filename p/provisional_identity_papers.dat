40|$|The {{vicissitudes of}} Irène Némirovsky place us before {{a problem of}} identity, of {{cultural}} belonging, of citizenship and of exile. Imprisoned {{in a kind of}} eternal limbo, in diasporic structures that in her short life repeated themselves with amazing regularity, dragged through a series of wanderings and <b>provisional</b> <b>identities,</b> the secret key to Irène Némirovsky’s novels is scission, separation, belonging through exclusion, eternal marginality.

40|$|I {{argue that}} {{religious}} elementary schools whose pedagogical methods satisfy {{the principle of}} rational authority have distinctive advantages over secular elementary schools {{for the purpose of}} laying the foundations for ethical autonomy in the children of religious parents. Insights from developmental psychology bolster the argument from conceptual analysis. Before children have the cognitive capacities to engage in authentically autonomous reflection, their long-run interest in developing autonomy is best served by developing their understanding of and <b>provisional</b> <b>identity</b> within their primary culture and by encouraging a limited form of ethical reasoning within the framework provided by that secure cultural identity. Are children who attend religious schools less likely to develop ethical autonomy, understood as the capacity and inclination for ongoing, critical-rational reflection about one’s conception of the good, one’s ethical belief...|$|R

40|$|The migrants’ daughter’s {{study is}} a space within the house of {{immigrants}} in which the daughter fulfils her tertiary education.

It examines the relations between body, space, and language through the daughter’s struggle to make and inhabit an individual space, a study. It signals the lack of private space within the migrant house and the lack of public place in terms of subject positions accessible to migrants’ daughters outside the house. The study is proposed as a space of exchange between otherwise disparate cultural fields and as a space for the theatrical staging of <b>provisional</b> <b>identities</b> and possible agencies for the migrants’ daughter. The article speculates on the study as a threshold for a female ethnic imaginary and subjectivity. <br /...|$|R
