Materials and Methods: Samples were mixed with methanol and ethanol (as solvents) and were extracted on magnetic shaker, separately. The experiments were carried out to measure the Total Phenolic Content (TPC), Total Flavonoid Content (TFC), Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), Reducing Power Assay (RPA), Chain Breaking Activity (CBA), and quantity of Malondialdehyde (MDA), 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),Nitric Oxide (NO),Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and superoxide(O 2 -) radicals inhibition.

40|$|Prunes, {{which are}} industrially {{obtained}} by dehydrating fresh plums at 85 − 90 °C for 18 h, contain {{higher levels of}} phenolic compounds than most other fruits.

A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 °C until 50 % of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 °C; (ii) air temperature at 60 °C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking result was that drying at 85 °C doubled antioxidant activity in both cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 °C processed plums...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} of hand-harvesting cost in plum and prune production {{to the total}} costs amounts to 25 - 40 %. Mechanical harvesting {{makes it possible to}} cut drastically both the harvesting and total costs. To test the suitability of plum and prune species to be mechanically harvested, an experimental grove (area 0. 8 ha) was established in 2008. Three plum cultivars and one prune cultivar grafted on semi-dwarf and vigorous rootstocks were planted at high density (1250; 1666; 2500 trees·ha− 1). During the span of full yielding (2012 - 2014), fruits were harvested mechanically with a canopy contact, straddle harvester in continuous motion, designed at the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice, to harvest tart cherry, and later adapted to harvesting <b>plums</b> <b>and</b> <b>prunes.</b> Trees grafted on semi-dwarf rootstock (‘Wangenheim Prune’) appeared to be more suitable for mechanical harvesting than strong-growing trees grafted on Prunus cerasifera clone ‘Myrobalan’. Cumulative yield per ha (years 2012 - 2014) was the highest at the highest planting density. Trees grafted on the semi-dwarf rootstock had a higher productivity index than trees grafted on the vigorous rootstock. There {{was no significant difference in}} fruit quality related to planting distance. Mechanical harvesting was nearly 40 times more efficient than hand picking. The efficiency of mechanical harvest was from 85 % to 90 %. Over 5 % of fruits were lost on the ground and from 1 to 5 % of fruits were left on the tree. Up to 18 % of the plums and no more than 10 % of the prunes harvested mechanically showed some damage. They can be fully acceptable for processing, for up to 10 days, providing the potential deterioration processes are inhibited by cold storage. The large-fruited cultivars seem to be more susceptible to bruising than the small-fruited ones. For the latter, the share of marketable quality fruits within the mechanically harvested crop amounted to about 80 %, which could be a good prognostic justifying further trials on the prune harvester...|$|E
