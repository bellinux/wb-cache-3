40|$|<b>Excise</b> <b>duties</b> are an {{important}} source of government revenue and their rates change relatively often in the Czech Republic. Reforms of <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> change the prices of goods, a change to which households respond by adjusting their expenditures. I use detailed Czech Statistical Office data and estimates of own- and cross-price and income elasticities for individual households to create a microeconomic simulation model that enables me to simulate the impact of changes in <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> on households' demands. I show the distributional impact of current <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> and then I simulate the impact of hypothetical increases of 10 per cent in each of them. I further simulate impact of certain approved or proposed changes in <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> including the unsuccessful 2012 proposal to introduce an <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on wine...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco {{products}} in the Czech Republic since 1993 {{up to the present}} time, especially the development of rates and revenues. <b>Excise</b> <b>duty</b> is imposed on tobacco products in the Czech Republic and also in the other European Union countries. Harmonisation efforts in the European Union and also fiscal need of Czech Republic cause frequent changes in tobacco <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, which conduces not only to change of tax collection, but can also bring some other related effects. In the theoretical part I first characterize the tax theory with a detailed focus on <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products. Subsequently I define the meaning of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products, the principles and the mechanisms of the tax collection. In the practical part of the thesis I aim at analyse the evolution of the legal framework that affects <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products and significantly affects the thesis in other sections. Further, I analyse the relationship between the rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products and tax collection and find out that the higher rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> not always led to higher tax yields. Finally I assess the effectiveness of the increase of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products {{and its impact on the}} consumption of tobacco products, illegal market and the public budgets...|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{selective}} nature, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> {{is one of}} themost effective {{sources of}} the state budget revenues. A fundamental influence on the receipts from this source is exercised by: the kinds and number of articles recognized as excisable and the volume of their sales {{in the country and}} of their imports, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, the extent of granted allowances and exemptions, as well as the efficiency in collecting the revenues from this duty. The range of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> applicability is very large and covers a great number of articles, many of them of no significant fiscal importance. At the same time, the list of allowances and exemptions introduced both by acts of Parliament or by ordinances of government bodies is excessively extended. The bulk of revenues obtained from the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> comes from taxation of alcoholic beverages, tobacco articles and fuels, while the source of greatest importance is the duty on domestic sales of goods that, in 1994 - 2001, provided on average 87. 7 % of the total <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> revenues. The taxation of imports played a much smaller role. The rates of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> burden are relatively high and since the start of their functioning have been many times modified. However, in recent years a trend towards stabilizing the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, and even towards reducing some of them, can be observed. Excessive <b>excise</b> rate <b>duties</b> led to deterioration in the condition of the spirits, wine and tobacco branches. Financial difficulties of some firms, especially those producing alcoholic beverages, led to accumulation of arrears in the discharge of their <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> liabilities and to remission of a part of their indebtedness on that score. The <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> is a flexible source of budget revenues and it is the Minister of Finance who plays the role of the main author of the state's policy in this area. He has broad powers in shaping the rates and introducing the allowances and exemptions and, consequently, in shaping the revenues from the <b>excise</b> <b>duty.</b> The excessive authority of the Minister of Finance and the use of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> as a source of additional revenue whenever the budget is in critical situation is often subject for criticism. ...|$|R

In contrast to value added tax, they are mainly specific taxes, i. e. expressed as a monetary amount per quantity of the product. The most commonly applied <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> are those on alcoholic beverages, manufactured tobacco products and energy products (motor fuels and heating fuels, such as petrol and gasoline, electricity, natural gas, coal and coke). The basic principles applicable to all products subject to <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> have been laid down in Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products. Products subject to <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> are generally produced, and can afterwards be held under duty suspension, in tax warehouses. The establishment and operation of tax warehouses is subject to the authorization of the Member States. They should respect the principles laid down in Commission Recommendation 2000 / 789 /EC of 29 November 2000 setting out guidelines for the authorisation of warehousekeepers under Council Directive 92 / 12 /EEC in relation to products subject to <b>excise</b> <b>duty.</b> The products can be sent under [...] ...|$|R

Czech Republic joined the European Union in 2004. The EU begun the integration to achieve {{political power and}} economic prosperity. To achieve that prosperity could be complicated due to obstructions of free movement of products created by demands on administration of <b>excise</b> <b>duties.</b> I decided to focus on <b>excise</b> <b>duties,</b> especially the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> applied on alcohol and alcohol beverages.

I also paid attention to problems concerning implementation of the EU legislation into Member States law including Czech Republic. In the first chapter we can find a definition of a tax, its characteristics and classification from different points of view, after that also more detailed description of features of an indirect taxation. In the second chapter I have attempted to define the concepts of coordination, harmonization and competition in tax field and then evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in comparison.

40|$|Different motives in {{determining}} the level and structure of alcohol taxes lead to greatly varying alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> levels. The aim {{of this paper is}} to look at alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates in European Union (EU) and the mechanisms affecting them. Also the trends in alcohol prices and alcohol consumption will be discussed. Material. Material concerning alcohol taxes and consumption comes from available statistics and published literature. Results. This paper shows that despite many attempts the EU has not been able to harmonise alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates in its member states. The importance of alcohol taxes as an alcohol control measure has decreased as the real value of alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates has decreased in most EU countries during the last decades. Discussion. In most European countries the share of alcohol taxes of the price of alcoholic beverages is quite low. Therefore, increasing alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates would in most countries lead to increased alcohol tax revenues to the public sector. Consequently, increasing alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates would serve both the fiscal and the health and social policy interests of the state...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The thesis {{analyses}} {{effects of}} <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> increase, effective from 1 st January 2010. The thesis concentrates on spirits, {{beer and wine}} market. Based on the Czech Statistical Bureau study of spirits market, all the significant declines of consumption took place whenever Czech government raised rates of <b>excise</b> <b>duty.</b> In comparison with selected European countries, the Czech nominal rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> of spirits is rather average. Our <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> of beer {{is one of the}} lowest rates in Europe. When correlating GDP, unemployment rate and alcohol consumption in Czech Republic, the thesis does not prove declines in GDP cause higher alcohol consumption nor rising unemployment results in higher alcohol consumption. However, results of correlation analysis are distorted by a short period on which data are available for the Czech Republic. Data available from both Board of Customs and Ministry of Finance proved that expectation of higher national tax revenue after rise of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rate has been incorrect. The national tax revenue in 2010 was by almost 1 billion CZK lower than the government expected...|$|R
