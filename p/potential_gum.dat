30|$|The load {{supporting}} columns were originally straight cylinders, {{the diameter of}} which expanded under high load, causing them to bind to the HarmonicDrive™ fitting units from time to time. Frequent servicing was required to clean the interfaces and replace lubricant. Therefore, a modification was made to the columns (Fig.  2 b, c). The new columns have a slightly smaller general diameter, with only three circular lines matching the inner diameter of the HarmonicDrive™ fitting units, to ensure axial alignment of the system. This has completely eliminated potential binding between the columns and the fitting units. In addition, two circular grooves {{were added to the}} column profile to alleviate <b>potential</b> <b>gumming</b> when lubricant hardens. After this modification, the system has been used routinely up to 50  t (the designed load limit) and we have not seen any binding since. The mechanical strength and stability of the entire system have also been enhanced.|$|R

30|$|Studies {{on the use}} of some macromolecules (i.e., natural polymers) {{have also}} been carried out. For example, Umoren et al. [7, 8] studied the <b>potential</b> of <b>gum</b> arabic as a {{corrosion}} inhibitor for aluminum in alkaline medium. The inhibition of aluminum corrosion by gum arabic was attributed to the presence of arabinogalactan, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glucoproteins since these compounds contain oxygen and nitrogen atoms which are the centers of adsorption. The inhibitive effect of exudate gum from Dacroydes edulis on the corrosion of aluminum in HCl solutions was studied using weight loss and thermometric methods at 30 °C to 60 °C by Umoren et al. [9, 10], and the results revealed that the exudate gum acted as an inhibitor for the corrosion of aluminum in HCl solution. The inhibition efficiency increases with an increase in the concentration of the exudate gum but decreases with increase in temperature.|$|R

50|$|Dennis Crouch, in Patently-O {{commented on}} the issues and {{provided}} {{a summary of the}} merits briefs filed in the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2017. Crouch opposed the Federal Circuit's ruling on these grounds:With personal property courts long ago rejected servitudes (such as use and resale restrictions) that bind subsequent purchasers. Unlike real property, personal property moves and is often transferred without substantial paperwork or record-keeping, and allowing a set of unique restrictions has the <b>potential</b> of <b>gumming</b> up the marketplace. The Federal Circuit in this case {{went all the way to}} the other side — holding that the presumption in foreign sales is that no US patent rights are exhausted. I purchased my last couple of smart phones through the used market - and have also repaired them several times. Under the law, I probably should have taken steps to ensure that all of the original equipment manufacturers affirmatively granted repair and resale rights. Coming together, the Federal Circuit’s approach here has the potential to limit the market for the repair and reselling of goods. I would suggest that those activities are incredibly beneficial to our society in terms of resource allocation and avoiding waste as well as empowering citizens and avoiding anticompetitive market behavior.|$|R

The effect of calcium sulphate dihydrate (water insoluble) and lactose (water soluble) diluent on the release of propranolol hydrochloride was studied. The DSC thermograms of drug, gum and mixture of gum/drug indicated no chemical interaction. Tablets (F 1, F 2, F 3, and F 4) were prepared containing calcium sulphate dihydrate as diluent, propranolol hydrochloride as model drug using 10 %, 8 %, 6 % and 4 % w/v of gum solution as binder. Magnesium stearate was used as lubricant. Physical and technological properties of granules and tablets like flow rate, Carr index, Hausner ratio, angle of repose, hardness, friability and disintegration time were determined and found to be satisfactory. Tablets were prepared by wet granulation method containing calcium sulphate dihydrate as excipient, propranolol hydrochloride as model drug using 10 %, 20 % and 30 % of gum as release retardant, magnesium stearate was used as lubricant. Similarly tablets were prepared replacing lactose with calcium sulphate dihydrate. Despite of the widely varying physico-chemical characteristics of the excipients, the drug release profiles were found to be similar. The drug release increased with increasing proportions of the excipient and decreased proportion of the gum irrespective of the solubility characteristics of the excipient. The values of release exponent ‘n’ are between 0. 37 and 0. 54. This implies that the release mechanism is Fickian. There {{is no evidence that the}} dissolution or erosion of the excipient has got any effect on the release of the drug. The t 50 % values for tablets containing calcium sulphate dihydrate were on an average 10 %- 15 % longer than the tablets containing lactose as excipient.

Irvingia gum was produced according to the methods described by previous workers. Coacervation was achieved by adding ethanolic solution of the drug (6 g in 8 ml) to the gum mucilage (3 g in 100 ml of water) : i. e, gum: drug ratio 1 : 2, and allowing to stand for 48 h to form a sediment (coacervate). Also prepared were gum: drug ratios: 1 : 1 and 2 : 1. Effects of composition, temperature and pH on coacervate yield and degree of drug entrapment were investigated. Tragacanth gum was used, as reference standard. 1 : 2 ratio gave the highest yield for both caffeine (78. 5 ± 0. 02 % w/w) and salicylic acid (79 ± 0. 00 %w/w) coacervates. pH increase of gum mucilage (2. 21 to 12. 03) increased the yield of irvingia caffeine coacervate but decreased that of irvingia: salicylate coacervates. Raising the temperature (25 - 60 0 C) decreased both coacervate yields. Both systems (with gum: drug ratio 1 : 2) gave the highest degree of drug entrapment. This study, therefore, presents optimal condition for enhancement of yield and degree of drug entrapment in coacervation of poorly-water soluble drugs: caffeine and salicylic acid.

Aqueous coating suspensions of okra gum and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (0. 6 &#x 0025;w/v) were prepared and used to coat the tablets in Hi-coater. The coated tablets were evaluated for weight uniformity, diameter, thickness, hardness, friability, disintegration time, and moisture uptake at controlled humidity. The coating remained intact, durable, and resistant to chipping when challenged to catastrophic fall or rubbed on a white paper. The coated tablets had lower friability, increased disintegration time (24 min) compared to the core (3 min) and improved hardness, {{but there was no}} difference in the dissolution profile of the samples from the batches containing okra and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as film formers.

Near infrared (nIR) absorption spectra, photomicrographs, and some physicochemical properties of the coated tablets were evaluated. The okra gum samples had different nIR spectra and possessed good processing and application quality due to relatively low viscosity.

Rheological behaviour was characterized using steady shear measurements, and instrumental colour and sensory analysis were also carried out. All tested biopolymers {{can be used}} to improve viscosity/consistency of F and F/T mashed potatoes. The effects were highly dependent on the type and level of biopolymer added. Adding higher levels of ALM and HM pectins (3 - 8 g kg- 1) increased rheological properties of F/T mashed potatoes as compared to their fresh counterparts, suggesting their usefulness as texturizers in F/T mashed potatoes. F and F/T samples with added κ-C and i-C were more structured. Freezing and thawing did not significantly affect the steady data of the product with added carrageenans and xanthan, highlighting the <b>potential</b> of these <b>gums</b> to stabilize the texture of frozen and microwave-thawed mashed potatoes, as compared with fresh counterparts. Addition of biopolymers affected parameter a* (greenness) more than yellowness index (YI), although XG and WP affected less the colour of the mashed potatoes.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is associated with}} a significant increased morbidity and mortality resulting from microvascular and macrovascular complications, in particular diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. Treatment of these conditions has involved improving diabetic control, reducing blood pressure and addressing other cardiovascular risk factors. Dietary fibre has wide reaching health benefits, including improvement of diabetic control and blood pressure, potentially by alterations in colonic bacterial populations that result in changes in serum short chain fatty acids. An open labelled study with a washout period was undertaken to examine the <b>potential</b> effects of <b>Gum</b> arabic on blood pressure and renal function. A daily supplement of gum arabic (25 g), a soluble dietary fibre, was administered for a period of 12 weeks. An initial pilot study was conducted in healthy subjects (n= 10) and subjects with overt nephropathy (n= 14). A follow on study investigated subjects with incipient nephropathy (n= 23) in more detail. Measurements of renal function, including isotope GFR and ERPF, blood pressure and vascular stiffness (follow on only), and short chain fatty acids were measured. A significant drop in GFR was seen in the healthy individuals with no associated change in filtration fraction, which could convey some renal protective effect. No changes were seen in the diabetic subjects. Significant drops in blood pressure were seen each of the individual groups. Results of pulse wave analysis and central blood pressure measurements suggest this is not as a result of changes in vascular stiffness. Significant changes in short chain fatty acid production were seen, in particular an increase in acetate (p= 0. 033) in the incipient nephropaths and butyrate (p= 0. 03) in the healthy subjects. This study suggests that Gum arabic has beneficial effects on blood pressure but no immediate beneficial effects on renal function in either diabetic cohort...|$|R
40|$|Conversion of forested {{lands to}} agriculture, {{including}} cultivation and pasture {{has been linked}} to land degradation, including soil compaction, reduced soil fertility and increased salinity hazard. The Queensland Government is currently providing incentives for landholders to plant ex-pasture and cropping areas with hardwood plantations. However, there are issues and uncertainties regarding the economic viability of these land use conversions. Carbon credits resulting from additional carbon (C) sequestration achieved in the plantations are now recognised under the Kyoto Protocol, but the nature of the carbon trading scheme that will apply is still unclear, as Australia has not ratified the Protocol. This study compared the total soil C under native scrub (subtropical dry vine forest), grazed pasture, cultivation and spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subspecies variegata) forest on the Red Ferrosol soils of the Kingaroy region in southeast Queensland (SEQ). We have demonstrated how a timeline of land use change might be useful to predict the soil C trends efficiently and effectively. Cumulative soil C (including surface litter and particulate organic matter) to 1. 2 t m- 2 dry soil ranged from 72 t ha- 1 at the cultivated site to 281 t ha- 1 under the mature spotted gum forest. The estimated annual rates of soil C loss under cultivation in last 55 years (1950 - 2005) was 2. 1 % and the estimated annual rate of soil C gain in pasture in last 23 years (1983 - 2005) was 1. 1 %. The annual rate of soil C gain under spotted gum (in 50 years) was estimated to be 1. 4 %. Therefore there is considerable <b>potential</b> for spotted <b>gum</b> plantations to sequester soil C when planted on ex-agricultural land in SEQ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the {{utilization}} of magnetic nanoparticles in biological systems, {{it is important to}} develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions that take place between the two systems. Magnetic nanoparticles are of particular interest for applications such as transfection, biodetection, and targeted drug delivery to name a few. The goal of this research was to study the effect iron oxide nanoparticles have on cellular growth and function, as well as to improve the particles' stability and biocompatibility in aqueous and biological media. Particle synthesis consisted of producing magnetite using the Massart method. Composite iron oxide nanoparticles produced under combustion synthesis were also studied. Previous results indicated that the inorganic nanoparticles formed small aggregates in microbial growth media, thus influencing particle stability. To mitigate this problem, a stabilizing polymer known as gum arabic was tested to control particle size and prevent further agglomeration in aqueous and growth media. Results showed that gum arabic greatly improved particle stability. Growth studies measured the influence of the nanoparticles on cell proliferation using both M 9 and Luria Bertani media to track growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in minimal and rich growth conditions. In addition to E. coli, prostate carcinoma cells (cell line DU 145) were cultured {{in the presence of the}} treated nanoparticles to determine whether gum arabic improved the uptake of the particles in mammalian cells. Fluorescent microscopy was incorporated to detect the location of the nanoparticles in or about the cells by labeling the gum arabic with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The results illustrate the <b>potential</b> use of <b>gum</b> arabic as a surface-modifying agent to improve magnetic particle stability, as well as to promote nanoparticle uptake by mammalian cell cultures...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} extraction process and the <b>potential</b> of okra <b>gum</b> as a suspending agent in pharmaceutical oral formulations containing acetaminophen as a model drug. Clarified mucilage of dried okra was either extracted directly with ethanol 96 &#x 0025; (F 1) or was first treated with base (F 2), acid (F 3) or heating in the presence of salt (F 4) before extraction with ethanol 96 &#x 0025;. The samples were used at 0. 5 &#x 0025; w/v as suspending agents in acetaminophen acetaminophen suspension to deliver 125 mg/ 5 mL acetaminophen. A binary mixture of F 2 and F 4 (1 : 1) was also used. Similar suspensions of acetaminophen containing either hydroxymethylpropylcellulose (HPMC) or tragacanth gum (TRAGA) were produced. Some physicochemical properties of the formulations were evaluated. The rheological properties of acetaminophen-containing treated okra gums (F 2 -F 5) were generally similar. Changes in viscosity with storage were slower in the F 2 -F 5 formulations as compared with F 1. Particle size and particle size distribution were different for all formulations, and hysteresis was a function of time and the suspending agent used. The re-dispersion time of the formulations with treated okra gums was generally shorter than that observed with the untreated okra gum. The use of a binary mixture of F 2 and F 4 resulted in different physicochemical properties from those of either F 2 or F 4. The physicochemical properties of the formulations were comparable to those with HPMC and TRAGA. It can thus be concluded that treating okra gum with acid, base or salt impacted better physicochemical properties on an acetaminophen pediatric suspension when they were used as suspending agents...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess health professionals' {{views of}} {{genitourinary}} medicine (GUM) {{services in a}} large UK city and to determine potential intervention measures for change. METHODS [...] A postal questionnaire was sent to 205 service providers {{in a range of}} sexual health services in Glasgow, including GUM specialist doctors, nurses and health advisers. The questionnaire included structured questions about organisation and use of GUM services, assessment of profile and stigma, and asked about factors most likely to influence future service development. RESULTS [...] 128 questionnaires were returned from areas throughout the city. Non-GUM health professionals had poor factual knowledge about the organisation of GUM services. GUM had a poor profile compared with other sexual health services and stigma was thought to exist about the service. Most non-GUM service providers continue traditionally to regard GUM mainly as a referral centre for a few specific sexually transmitted infections and not as a centre for holistic sexual health care. Genital chlamydial infection and pelvic inflammatory disease were considered low priority for GUM referral by some groups of service providers. These views contrasted with those working in the speciality. There was generally poor professional contact between GUM and other service providers involved in sexual health. Most indicated that greater levels of information and publicity, increased professional contact, and a broader range of services within GUM were important for future service development. CONCLUSIONS [...] The response to the questionnaire strongly indicates that there is poor awareness of and consequently suboptimal use of the full range of services offered by <b>GUM.</b> <b>Potential</b> interventions to address this need include increased cross-speciality collaboration and targeting of specific groups of service providers involved in sexual health care. Important groups include hospital-based specialists and voluntary agencies as well as general practitioners. There is a clear need to project the broad range of sexual health services offered by GUM, and to emphasise the role of GUM in managing specific sexual health problems including several sexually transmitted infections...|$|R
40|$|Summary. At {{present the}} {{pharmaceutical}} industry and academia are focusing {{on the use of}} natural materials and resources for development of pharmaceutical product. In previous study, neem gum (NG), obtained from Azadirachata indica plant revealed satisfactory film forming ability. The present study evaluates the application <b>potential</b> of neem <b>gum,</b> as an aqueous film coating material, using ciprofloxacin hydrchloride (drug) as a model drug. Initial study of physical mixture indicated absence of chemical interaction in between drug and NG. Aqueous coating solution of NG was optimized and consisted of neem gum (13. 34 %w/w), triethyl citrate (1. 25 %w/w), talc (0. 25 %w/w) and titanium dioxide (0. 17 %w/w). The coating parameters such as pan revolutions (rpm), inlet air pressure, inlet temperature, and pan load were optimized. The uncoated and coated tablets were evaluated for hardness, disintegration time, dissolution, drug content. The coated tablets were subjected to accelerated stability conditions for 1 month and the results were compared with marketed drug tablet. Any coating defects, except surface roughness, were absent in case of NG coated tablets. NG coated tablets depicted satisfactory mechanical strength. Dissolution study of NG coated tablets depicted 90 % of drug release in 10 minutes and 100 % of drug release at 30 minutes. Accelerated storage conditions didn’t affect the tablet hardness and % drug release. The coating process efficiency, coating uniformity and loss on drying confirmed that the coating solution was optimum and coating parameters were robust. Industrial relevance. A paradigm shift, from organic solvent-based to water-based film coating of pharmaceutical dosage forms, apparent in pharmaceutical industries, is due to Government regulation, high cost of the organic solvents, safety issues {{associated with the use of}} organic solvents. Currently, the commercially available edible coatings utilize synthetic cellulosic polymers namely, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polydextrose. A particular disadvantage of HPMC coating is hardening of the coating over time and thereby prolonged tablet disintegration time. Neem gum is a promising natural, biodegradable, cheap and eco-friendly film former which can be employed for aqueous film coating of tablets, containing bitter taste or moisture sensitive drug. Moreover neem gum is an effective film former in lower concentrations (10 - 15 % w/w) and may be a cost-effective alternative over conventional film formers. Keywords.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out during 2007 / 2008 in the nursery and {{experimental}} farm of Gum Arabic Research Center, University of Kordofan at El Obeid town, North Kordofan State, to study the effect of seed sources and soil types on seed germination and seedlings establishment of Acacia polycantha. Seeds were collected from three areas: South Darfur; South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. The study consisted of seed dormancy breakage test by several methods (pretreatment with soaking in cold and hot water, corroding by 25 % and 50 % conc. H 2 SO 4, and itching by electrical needle); the seed were planted in the nursery in different soil types (sand, clay and mixture) and field establishment of the species through direct seed sowing and seedling transplantation. The seeds from South Darfur failed to germinate, and did not thrive satisfactorily both in the nursery and in the field, and thus {{were excluded from the}} experimentation. Seeds treated by electric needle test gave the highest germination percentage (60 %). Treatment with H 2 SO 4 25 gave the lowest values (20 %), even (10 %) x lesser than that of the control and cold water. The electric needle and the boiling water were effective treatment for Acacia polycantha seed dormancy breakage. The cold water and 50 % conc. H 2 SO 4 gave identical values. The seed source obviously had little effect on Acacia polycantha seed germination except for the control from Blue Nile which was twice stronger than that of South Kordofan. The study showed that there were significant differences among the types of soils in measured parameters in the nursery. The seedlings length in the mixture was better than in the sand. Little difference was observed between seedling length in the mixture and the clay, but the difference between the mixture and sand was about 1. 5 folds. Root length growth in the sand showed better performance (32. 1 cm) and fallowed by clay and mixture. Shoot/root length ratio was similar in the clay and the mixture but that in the sand was the lowest. Seedlings of the mixture had denser foliage than those of clay and sand. Shoot dry weight was significantly different between the mixture and sand, while {{there was no difference between}} both mixture and clay and clay and sand. Seedlings in the sand had the lowest shoot masses. The shoot/root weight ratio, in the sand was far lower than that of clay and mixture; this difference exceeded 3. 7 folds. xi For the seeds source, the Blue Nile seedlings length was higher than those of South Kordofan by a difference of 4. 1 cm. Like wise a significant difference was obtained between the seedlings root length of the two locations; here the South Kordofan seedlings developed longer root lengths by a difference of 3. 4 cm on average. The shoot/root length ratios of the seedlings of the two locations were 1. 8 and 1. 4 for Blue Nile and South Kordofan, respectively. For the shoot and root dry weights, the respective difference of magnitude in the mass values of these parameters was 0. 7 and 0. 8 g. For the shoot/root weight ratio, the Blue Nile seedlings were higher than those of South Kordofan, by a difference of 0. 6. NPK and organic carbon content in the seedlings showed, no significant differences between South Kordofan and Blue Nile; also there were no significant difference between the soil type (Mixture and Sand) but the clay differed from the others in Potassium and organic carbon. Direct seed sowing in the field failed to germinate which was attributed to the poor sandy soil conditions and drought conditions. The study showed that there were no significant differences in the studied parameters for the seedlings transplanted in the field except for the root collar diameter; which was better in mixture fallowed by sand and clay. For the two seed sources there were no significant differences in diameter and xii number of leaves, but there were significant differences between them in seedlings length which was taller for Blue Nile than South Kordofan source. The study concluded that seed dormancy of Acacia polycantha can be easily broken by available pre-treatment methods, particularly hot water and electrical needle itching. Nursery seedling stock can be satisfactorily raised in sand-clay mixture soils. Seeds from different areas had different germination and growth rates which might be considered as separate provenances. Field establishment of Acacia polycantha in dry ecozones on sandy soils is very poor and better establishment may be obtained in more humid areas as on clay or loamy soils. In view of the scanty information about this species and envisaging its apparent <b>potential</b> as <b>gum</b> producing tree, more research work is needed both for natural stands and plantations...|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Engenharia BiomédicaCartilage {{is a type}} {{of dense}} {{connective}} tissue that possesses interesting features in terms of organization and functionality. It has only one type of cells – the chondrocytes – which are embedded in an extensive network constituted mostly of collagens and proteoglycans. It is also avascular, exhibiting a low metabolic rate and a subsequent low regenerative potential. Articular cartilage is a particular type of hyaline cartilage that has an important structural function in the skeletal system as a weight bearing tissue, creating smooth gliding areas that can absorb both shocks and loads in an efficient way. Due to its nature, articular cartilage function may be severely affected by trauma events, aging related degeneration such as osteoarthritis, or developmental disorders, since no efficient regeneration of the damaged tissue is performed. A direct result of this is chronic pain and disability conditions that seriously limit normal everyday life. Different possible solutions have been experimented to solve these conditions, such as prosthetic joint replacement, arthroplasty, and drilling, but the outcomes are still not satisfactory which imposed the need for alternative approaches. Tissue engineering has been proposed as a new method to address these problems, being widely studied as a promising therapeutic tool. The tissue engineering strategy usually implies the use of a 3 D structure that is able to support cells growth and differentiation in an adequate environment towards the development of a functional tissue engineered system. The support systems fabricated for these purposes can be of natural or synthetic origin, or either a combination of both. Different materials have been produced and processed in various ways with the aim of conferring specific properties that are expected to render the best performances. The main goal of the work described in this thesis was to develop a system that can be easily, efficiently, and successfully applied in the treatment of articular cartilage lesions. Due to its potential, the concept of tissue engineering was applied by using natural origin based structures combined with different cell types (cell lines, primary culture differentiated and undifferentiated cells) in adequate culturing environments. Among the several support structures studied, the emphasis of the work was put on the development and application of a minimally invasive injectable hydrogel system which testing started from its ability {{to be used as a}} cell supporting material to in vivo functional studies in an articular cartilage rabbit knee defect model. In the initial part of the work presented in this thesis, the first tested structures consisted of scaffolds of chitosan and polybutylene succinate processed by compression moulding with salt leaching that were used to support the growth and chondrogenic differentiation of BMC 9 cells – a mouse bone marrow derived mesenchymal progenitor cell line. The cells were able to proliferate and colonize the scaffolds structure, remaining viable during the time of the experiments. Immunological analyses further indicated that the BMC 9 cells were being differentiated towards the chondrogenic pathway. A different structure of the scaffolds was experimented using the same blend of chitosan and polybutylene succinate by processing it in the form of fibres and producing a 3 D fibre scaffold that was at this time used to culture primary culture chondrocytes from bovine origin. The chondrocytes exhibited a normal and typical morphology, colonising both the surface and inner pores of the scaffolds. Cartilage-like extracellular matrix formation was observed by the deposition of collagen type II and proteoglycans, indicating that chitosan and polybutylene succinate fibre based scaffolds had good potential as matrices for the regeneration of cartilage. A different natural fibre based scaffold consisting of a blend of starch and polycaprolactone was also investigated regarding its ability to support growth and extracellular matrix formation by bovine articular chondrocytes seeded in vitro. The chondrocytes presented normal morphological features with extensive cells presence at the surface of the support structures, and penetrating the scaffolds pores. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that typical cartilage extracellular matrix components were being deposited during the course of the experiments thereby showing the potential of these systems for future applications in the field. Another type of support, and the more extensively studied within the work described in this thesis, was a natural origin hydrogel – gellan gum - that was firstly tested to be used as a cell encapsulating agent. Gellan gum was shown to be versatile in terms of applications with the possibility of being used as a cell/drug delivery vehicle in different situations. In terms of cartilage regenerative approaches, its material properties and non cytotoxic nature were shown suitable for the proposed application. A final stage of this part involved the encapsulation and in vitro culturing of human nasal chondrocytes in gellan gum hydrogels which remained viable showing the potential of these new systems as cell supports for cartilage regeneration. In the following work, gellan gum hydrogels were tested for their ability to be used as injectable systems for delivering and maintaining human chondrocytes by in situ gelation, as well as for supporting cell viability and production of extracellular matrix. The characterization of some of the materials properties showed their injectability under physiological conditions and with the encapsulation and culturing of human articular chondrocytes it was possible to observe that cells were viable and actively depositing cartilage-like extracellular matrix. In a final stage, the in vivo performance of the gellan gum hydrogels, in terms of induced inflammatory reaction and integration into the host tissue, was performed upon subcutaneous implantation in mice. The results showed a residual response from the organisms and maintenance of the mechanical stability of the gels throughout the implantation periods. These results prompted the study of the gellan gum with human chondrocytes systems in vivo to test for cartilage-like tissue formation. Gellan gum hydrogels were combined with human articular chondrocytes and were subcutaneously implanted in the back of nude mice. The results showed a homogeneous cell distribution and the typical round shape morphology of the chondrocytes within the matrix upon implantation. Proteoglycans synthesis was detected in the histological sections and a statistically significant increase of proteoglycans content in gellan gum-human articular chondrocytes tissue engineered constructs was measured with the GAG assay from 1 to 4 weeks of implantation. Real-time PCR analyses showed a statistically significant upregulation of collagen type II and aggrecan levels in the same periods, while the immunological assays suggested deposition of collagen type II along with some collagen type I. The overall data reinforced the previously observed <b>potential</b> of gellan <b>gum</b> hydrogels in the generation of a fully functional cartilage tissue engineered construct. Finally, the last study performed under the scope of this thesis looked into the therapeutic effect of gellan gum hydrogels when combined with adipose tissue derived progenitor cells and injected in rabbit full-thickness articular cartilage defects in an autologous approach. Adipose tissue derived progenitor cells (chondrogenic pre-differentiated and non pre-differentiated) where compared with articular chondrocytes, gellan gum alone, and empty defects. The cell loaded hydrogels showed the best macroscopic appearance and integration with the native tissue. Histological scoring and staining, along with real-time semiquantitative PCR analyses, provided results that taken together showed that gellan gum hydrogels in combination with adipose tissue derived progenitor cells constitute a promising approach for the treatment of articular cartilage defects, being a possible candidate for future clinical applications in this field. As a concluding remark, it can be stated that the work performed in this thesis tested several supports for application in the cartilage tissue engineering field, with the main emphasis being put in gellan gum hydrogels. Gellan gum was originally suggested and tested as a new support to aid in cartilage tissue regeneration. Gellan gum was shown to be a promising biomaterial for these purposes as evidenced by its materials properties, in vitro, and in vivo results. Such evidences suggest that the herein described gellan gum systems combined with different cells types, namely adipose tissue derived progenitor cells, may have potential clinical application in the treatment of cartilage defects. A cartilagem é um tipo de tecido conectivo denso que possui características interessantes em termos da sua organização e funcionalidade. Tem apenas um tipo de células - os condrócitos - que estão incluídos numa matriz extracelular constituída maioritariamente de colagéneo e proteoglicanos. É igualmente avascular, exibindo uma baixa taxa metabólica e um baixo potencial regenerativo. A cartilagem articular é um tipo particular de cartilagem hialina que tem uma função estrutural importante no sistema esquelético já que pode ser vista como um sistema de suporte de cargas capaz de criar áreas de deslizamento suaves que podem absorver choques e cargas de uma forma eficaz. Devido a sua natureza, a função articular da cartilagem pode ser severamente afectada por eventos traumáticos, desgaste progressivo do tecido e mecanismos degenerativos tal como a osteoartrite, dado que uma regeneração eficiente do tecido danificado não acontece na maior parte dos casos.
