5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the <b>pride</b> against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the <b>pride.</b> Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the <b>pride</b> is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the <b>pride</b> must defend their relationship to the <b>pride</b> from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the <b>pride.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their <b>pride</b> to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth <b>pride.</b> However, when the <b>pride</b> becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the <b>pride,</b> adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E

50|$|Males of the Tsavo <b>prides</b> {{are usually}} larger than other male lions, and {{actively}} participate in hunting. Their <b>prides</b> are {{unique in that}} they frequently have only a single male lion, whereas most lion <b>prides</b> have two to eight (usually related) males. Tsavo <b>prides</b> {{also tend to be}} larger overall, with an average of seven to eight adult females in each group.|$|R

5|$|Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks {{past the}} hyenas at <b>Pride</b> Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts him over {{his role in}} Mufasa's death and backs him {{to the edge of}} the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the <b>pride.</b> Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, {{attempting}} to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of <b>Pride</b> Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the <b>Pride</b> Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas, who overheard him betray them to Simba. With his enemies gone, Simba takes over the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.|$|E

5|$|In June 2016, Black Lives Matter was {{selected}} by <b>Pride</b> Toronto as the honoured group in that year's <b>Pride</b> parade, during which they staged a sit-in to block the parade from moving forward for approximately half an hour. They issued a number of demands for <b>Pride</b> to adjust its relationship with LGBTQ people of colour, including stable funding and a suitable venue for the established Blockrama event, improved diversity in the organization's staff and volunteer base, and most famously that Toronto Police officers be banned from marching in the parade in uniform. <b>Pride</b> executive director Mathieu Chantelois signed BLM's statement of demand, but later asserted that he had signed it only to end the sit-in and get the parade moving, and had not agreed to honour the demands.|$|E

5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, their mates, and offspring. Such a group is called a <b>pride.</b> Females form the stable social unit in a <b>pride</b> and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average <b>pride</b> consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition if more than one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion <b>pride</b> which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal <b>pride</b> when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth <b>pride.</b> Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although <b>pride</b> females in estrous may allow nomad males to approach them.|$|E

5|$|The area a <b>pride</b> {{occupies}} {{is called}} a <b>pride</b> area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a <b>pride</b> tend {{to stay on the}} fringes, patrolling their territory. Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the <b>pride</b> regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the <b>pride,</b> and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.|$|E

5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the <b>pride</b> until the cubs are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to <b>pride</b> life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a <b>pride</b> often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the <b>pride.</b> The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E
5|$|Years go by as Scar squanders the kingdom's {{resources}} and allows his army of hyenas to wreak havoc upon the <b>Pride</b> Lands, which turn barren. Meanwhile, an alive and adult Simba is visited by Mufasa's ghost, who encourages {{him to return}} to the <b>Pride</b> Lands and take his rightful place as king. Aided by his friends Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba arrives at <b>Pride</b> Rock and witnesses Scar striking his mother Sarabi and confronts Scar, who demands that Simba admit to the <b>pride</b> that he killed Mufasa. As he prepares to throw Simba off <b>Pride</b> Rock and have him meet a similar fate to that of his father, Scar whispers that {{he was the one who}} killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tackles Scar and forces his uncle to admit the truth to the <b>pride,</b> initiating a ferocious battle between the <b>pride,</b> Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, Rafiki and Scar's hyenas. Scar tries to escape, but is cornered by Simba on the top of <b>Pride</b> Rock; Scar begs for mercy and even attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas, unaware that they are listening nearby. Simba ignores Scar and gives him one last chance to run away and never return. When Simba's back is turned, Scar attacks him and they fight. Simba bests Scar in combat and throws him over the cliff edge and into a pit. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.|$|E
