40|$|RESTRITOThe main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the volatile compounds extracted from <b>fermented</b> <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> by two extraction methods in order to characterize the samples. The purge and trap system provided the necessary sensitivity for the analysis of low-boiling point compounds, such as acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate, and the liquid–liquid extraction method allowed for the analysis of a great number of medium to high boiling point volatile compounds, such as phenylethyl alcohol, hexanoic and octanoic acids, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate. Ethyl propionate and propyl acetate, extracted by the liquid–liquid method, characterized the sample of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> <b>fermented</b> by Kloeckera apiculata. The sample of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> <b>fermented</b> by Pichia membranaefaciens was characterized by 2 -propanol and 2 -hexanone, extracted by the purge and trap system and liquid–liquid method, respectively.

The grape {{is known for its}} deep dark coloring and is used primarily as a coloring agent in red blends. In the history of Chianti it played a minor role, mostly for its affinity and use to the governo winemaking technique. Like Canaiolo, Colorino did not rot easily while going through the partial drying process to later be added to the <b>fermenting</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> However the <b>grape</b> did not provide the same level of fruit and softening effect that Canaiolo did and fell out of favor. In the late 1980s, there was a surge of interest in the variety among Tuscan winemakers who saw in this local grape variety similarity to the role Petit Verdot plays in Bordeaux blends. Colorino was planted and used to add darker colors and structure from phenolic compounds in the grape's thick skin without the overpowering aromatics that Cabernet Sauvignon could add.

40|$|Wine is {{a complex}} beverage, {{comprising}} hundreds of metabolites produced through the action of yeasts and bacteria in <b>fermenting</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> To ensure a robust and reliable fermentation, most commercial wines are produced via inoculation with commercial strains of the major wine yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In doing so, the varied metabolic contributions of the numerous non-Saccharomyces species in this microbial community are thought to impart complexity and desirable taste and aroma attributes to wild ferments in comparison to their inoculated counterparts. In order the map the microflora of spontaneous fermentation, metagenomic techniques were used to characterize and monitor the progression of fungal species in several wild fermentations. Both amplicon-based ITS phylotyping (meta-barcoding) and shotgun metagenomics were used to assess community structure.

40|$|Industrial {{food-grade}} yeast strains {{are selected}} for traits that enhance their application in quality production processes. Wine yeasts {{are required to}} survive in the harsh environment of <b>fermenting</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> {{while at the same time}} contributing to wine quality by producing desirable aromas and flavors. For this reason, there are hundreds of wine yeasts available, exhibiting characteristics that make them suitable for different fermentation conditions and winemaking practices.

This becomes a laborious and costly process when the targets for improvement involve flavor compound production. Here, we demonstrate a new approach harnessing preexisting industrial yeast strains that carry desirable flavor phenotypes - low hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production and high ester production. A low-H 2 S Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain previously generated by chemical mutagenesis was hybridized independently with two ester-producing natural interspecies hybrids of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii.

40|$|Fructose {{utilization}} by {{wine yeasts}} {{is critically important}} {{for the maintenance of}} a high fermentation rate at the end of alcoholic fermentation. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast able to <b>ferment</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> sugars to dryness was found to have a high fructose utilization capacity. We investigated the molecular basis of this enhanced fructose utilization capacity by studying the properties of several hexose transporter (HXT) genes. We found that this wine yeast harbored a mutated HXT 3 allele. A functional analysis of this mutated allele was performed by examining expression in an hxt 1 - 7 Δ strain. Expression of the mutated allele alone was found to be sufficient for producing an increase in fructose utilization during fermentation similar to that observed in the commercial wine yeast. This work provides the first demonstration that the pattern of fructose utilization during wine fermentation can be altered by expression of a mutated hexose transporter in a wine yeast. We also found that the glycolytic flux could be increased by overexpression of the mutant transporter gene, with no effect on fructose utilization. Our data demonstrate that the Hxt 3 hexose transporter {{plays a key role in}} determining the glucose/fructose utilization ratio during fermentation...|$|R

The microbiological investigation started with the plate count onto two culture media to distinguish total yeasts (TY) and presumptive Saccharomyces (PS). Yeasts were randomly isolated and identified by a combined genotypic approach consisting of {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) of 5. 8 S rRNA gene and 26 S rRNA and sequencing of D 1 /D 2 domain of the 26 S rRNA gene, which resulted in the recognition of 14 species belonging to 10 genera. The distribution of the yeasts within the vineyards showed some differences in species composition and concentration levels among 2008 and 2009 vintages. Due to the enological relevance, all Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates were differentiated applying two genotypic tools (interdelta analysis and microsatellite multiplex PCR of polymorphic microsatellite loci) that recognized 51 strains.

Recently, research on detecting physical and chemical changes in plants and biological tissues by EIS measurements has become a focus of interest. This research confirmed that EIS is effective in monitoring the ripening stages and physical damage to fruit, such as chilling and bruising. However, the EIS applications on wine fermentation analysis are rarely researched. Due to the huge rise of wine consumption all over the world, analytical tools on wine fermentation monitoring, which can measure major components in <b>fermenting</b> <b>grape</b> juice quickly, is required. As a rapid, inexpensive and simple method, EIS has great potential to replace the current slow response tools, such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC). In this research, an investigation into the application of electrical impedance measurements to simulated solutions and <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> is carried out. The dissertation outlines the experimental research conducted on relationships between impedance properties and concentration of major components of <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> EIS measurements for monitoring ethanol, sugar, tartaric acid and malic acid changes in the process of fermentation are investigated. Experiments were performed on single solvent solutions, compound solutions and grape juice under fermentation. As a result, linear relationships between impedance properties (including impedance magnitude on specific frequency, diameter of Nyquist plot and value of components in equivalent electrical circuits) and concentration of ethanol in pure solutions are found. Two major organic acids in grape juice, tartaric acid and malic acid, are also tested. Power relationships between malic and tartaric acid concentrations and solution resistance which is measured by EIS are found. It has also been discovered that the ionization resistance of organic acids has a linear relationship with the concentration of ethanol. Based on these findings, the ethanol concentration and organic acid concentrations in compound solutions can be measured by EIS. Two models containing constant phase elements are established for high and low conductivity solutions and they fit the data better than any previous models, such as the Cole model and the Hayden model, etc. Validation experiments on ethanol solutions and real <b>fermenting</b> <b>grape</b> juice are also carried out to confirm the applicability of ethanol measurement in real condition. In conclusion, this research proves that the impedance measurements are suitable to measure ethanol concentrations in <b>fermenting</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> They are rapid in response and easy to operate. This method may cause a revolution in current fermentation analysis. Further research may consummate the EIS method for industrial wine applications, and spread this method to applications in other alcoholic beverages and food products...|$|R

Malolactic fermentation is a highly complicated process in enology and leads to a higher concentration of biogenic amines, so the use of Schizosaccharomyces pombe can be an excellent tool for assuring wine safety. Schizosaccharomyces also has much more potential than only reducing the malic acid content, such as increasing the level of pyruvic acid and thus the vinylphenolic pyranoanthocyanin content.
