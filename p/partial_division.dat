5000|$|The {{history of}} Czechoslovak {{constitutionality}} {{starts with the}} formation of independent Czechoslovakia out of the ruins of Austria-Hungary. In 1918, the Interim Constitution of Czechoslovakia has been enacted hastily, establishing the republic with its president and temporary parliament. The Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920 succeeded it, inspired by western democratic constitutions, and, controversially, postulating the Czechoslovak nation. This lasted over the First Republic and the second world war. In 1948, the so-called Ninth-of-May Constitution was enacted after the communist coup - interestingly preserving some democratic institutions (human rights, <b>partial</b> <b>division</b> of the three powers, independent judiciary), though the political reality of the country departed from it radically. The 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, influenced by soviet constitutions, is often dubbed the [...] "Socialist Constitution". It changed the name of the country to Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and defined socialist, rather than democratic, character of the state, and introduced the leading role of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The 1960 constitution remained in force until 1992, although in 1968 it was substantially modified by the Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation - this transformed the unitary state into a federation of the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic. Further radical modifications were enacted after the regime change of 1989, but {{they turned out to be}} short-lived, as in 1992 the Constitution of the Czech Republic has been promulgated after the division of Czechoslovakia, and entered into force in 1993.|$|E

40|$|Pollen {{development}} and male gametogenesis are critically dependent upon cell polarization {{leading to a}} highly asymmetric cell division termed pollen mitosis I. A mutational approach was adopted in Arabidopsis thaliana to identify genes involved these processes. Four independent gemini pollen mutants were isolated which produce divided or twin-celled pollen. The gemini pollen 1 mutant was characterized in detail and shown to act gametophytically resulting in reduced transmission through both sexes. gemini pollen 1 showed an incompletely penetrant phenotype resulting in equal, unequal and <b>partial</b> <b>divisions</b> at pollen mitosis I. The division planes in gemini pollen 1 were shown to be aligned with the polar axis (as in wild type) and evidence was obtained for incomplete nuclear migration, which could account for altered division symmetry. gemini pollen 1 also showed division phenotypes consistent with spatial uncoupling of karyokinesis and cytokinesis suggesting that GEMINI POLLEN 1 may be required for the localization of phragmoplast activity. Cell fate studies showed that in both equal and unequal divisions a vegetative cell marker gene was activated in both daughter cells. Daughter cells {{with a range of}} intermediate or hybrid vegetative/generative cell fates suggests that cell fate is quantitatively related to cell size.

Journal of Hand Surgery (British Volume, 1989) Triggering is a well-known complication of a partially-cut flexor tendon. Commonly, the cut tendon becomes entrapped and may then trigger on the perforation of the tendon sheath.

The Americans, as a nation, disavowed this allegiance, and the English choosing to support their sovereign in the attempt to regain his power, most of the feelings of an internal struggle were involved in the conflict. A large proportion of the emigrants from Europe, then established in the colonies, took part with the crown; and there were many districts in which their influence, united to that of the Americans who refused to lay aside their allegiance, gave a decided preponderance to the royal cause. America was then too young, and too much in need of every heart and hand, to regard these <b>partial</b> <b>divisions,</b> small as they were in actual amount, with indifference.

Eighty years after its opening, the neighborhood is altered in physical consistency and affected by obsolescence due to the building techniques and the changed living habits.

Patients were randomized into: group I which included 15 patients who were injected with BTX-A and group II which included 15 patients who underwent bilateral PDPR.

The study aims to determine whether there is a correlation between a certain type of corporate governance on one side and the frequency of the two categories of changes in the structure of the activity and/or of the social capital.
