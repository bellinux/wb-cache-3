A man could work under favourable circumstances twenty to thirty tons a day. An Australian company, mentioned by Mr. R. Brough Smyth, with 200 inches of water, directed by ten hands, 'hydraulicked' in six days 224,000 cubic feet of dirt.

30|$|Regarding {{this last}} aspect [7, 8], we can remark that {{low-level}} vision gets useful measurements such as color, spatial frequency, binocular disparity, motion processing, etc., from several channels. Some {{of the aforementioned}} channels or space-temporal filters can be identified with receptive fields that deliver information to the retina. Others, such as binocular disparity or motion processing, are combinations of the previously mentioned ones. Mid-level vision integrates <b>primitives</b> <b>processes</b> at a previous level. Information delivered at this stage corresponds to real-world inferences such as egomotion and independent moving objects (IMOs). They are called causal actions or object candidates in connection with any multimodal characterization. Examples of these are the combination of luminance measurements to infer lightness, shape from shading, perceptual grouping, figure organization, etc. Finally, high-level vision interprets the scene through specific tasks such as relational reasoning, knowledge building, object recognition, etc.|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{of this article}} renders closed-form density approximation feasible for univariate continuous-time models. Implementation methodology depends directly on the parametric-form of the drift and the diffusion of the <b>primitive</b> <b>process</b> and not on its transformation to a unit-variance process. Offering methodological convenience, the approximation method relies on numerically evaluating one-dimensional integrals and circumvents existing dependence on intractable multidimensional integrals. Density-based inferences can now be drawn for a broader set of models of equity volatility. Our empirical results provide insights on crucial outstanding {{issues related to the}} rank-ordering of continuous-time stochastic volatility models, the absence or presence of nonlinearities in the drift function, and the desirability of pursuing more flexible diffusion function specifications.

Default occurs when the firm‚Äôs cash flow cannot cover the interest payments and the recovery rate is dependent on the economic condition at default. Our model produces the folloBarLinewing predictions: (i) credit spread is mostly negatively correlated with interest rate; (ii) credit spread yield curves are upward sloping for low-grade bonds; (iii) firm characteristics have significant effects on credit spreads and these effects also vary with economic conditions. These predictions are consistent with the available empirical evidence and generate implications for further empirical investigation...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{intractable}} part of the measurement problem‚Äîthe ‚Äòbig ‚Äô mea-surement problem‚Äîis a pseudo-problem that depends for its legitimacy on the ac-ceptance of two dogmas.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an advanced tool to facilitate accident data-collection and analysis processes. An integration of three technologies: hand-held computers, GPS and GIS is proposed with objectives to replace cumbersome <b>primitive</b> <b>processes,</b> to make accident data-collection and analysis more standardized, less error-prone and, therefore, more efficient. Under a proposed concept, the hand-held computers would {{play a major role in}} recording non-spatial data, while a main function of GPS is a spatial data collector.

40|$|Summary. This paper {{describes}} ongoing {{work toward}} a principled controller synthesis methodology for large-scale, minimalist multi-robot systems. The work‚Äôs key objectives {{is to establish a}} set of programming primitives (processes) for which macroscopic behavior can be formally predicted. Such prediction is made possible by statistical physics techniques that use properties of time-invariant processes while exploiting the system‚Äôs large size. This paper‚Äôs focus is on the use of numerical and simulation methods during construction of the <b>primitive</b> <b>process</b> set. A computational method, developed by physicists, is used as a high-level simulation to characterize individual process behavior. The output, when interpreted qualitatively, guides distributed system design. In order to validate the approach, we consider a sequential inspection domain with a swarm of 400 + simulated robots. Synchronization is achieved through processes analyzed with the methods described, and predictions are compared with behavior exhibited in a traditional multi-robot simulation. The two simulation tools play different roles in characterizing collective behavior, and these differences shed new light on the multi-robot controller synthesis problem. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} {{research has}} gone through more than 200 studies from 1934 to 2016 to find the differences and similarities in cancer cells, mostly the cause. The most important difference between normal cells and cancer cells is how they respire. Normal cells use the sophisticated process of respiration to efficiently turn any kind of nutrient that is fat, carbohydrate or protein into high amounts {{of energy in the}} form of ATP. This process requires oxygen and breaks food down completely into harmless carbon dioxide and water. Cancer cells use a <b>primitive</b> <b>process</b> of fermentation to inefficiently turn either glucose from carbohydrates or the amino acid glutamine from protein into small quantities of energy in the form of ATP. This process does not require oxygen, and only partially breaks down food molecules into lactic acid and ammonia, which are toxic waste products. The most important result is that fatty acids or better told fats cannot be fermented by cells.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{embryonic}} {{development of}} germ cells in tetrapods is described, focusing on groups with the inductive mode of germ cell specification. In mammals PGCs are induced {{early in the}} gastrulation process, they are internalized with future extraembryonic mesoderm in the early posterior primitive streak, and specified soon thereafter. Strong evidence indicates that a similar process occurs in turtles and some other reptiles. In amniotes, the PGCs appear well before formation of the gonad in the posterior trunk, resulting in {{a period in which}} they are located outside the embryo before their migration to the gonad. In contrast, in urodeles the PGCs appear relatively late, and throughout development maintain a position close to precursors of the somatic cells of the gonad so that migration is not required. In lampreys early development of germ cells is strikingly similar to that in urodeles, suggesting this is the <b>primitive</b> <b>process.</b> As amniotes evolved large yolky eggs and better access to nutrition, development of the posterior half of the trunk became more dependent on cell proliferation; this was followed or accompanied by a shift of early germ cell development to the equivalent of the early primitive streak. A similar process may have occurred as some basal vertebrates developed large yolky eggs...|$|E
