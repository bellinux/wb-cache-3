50|$|Developed in {{parallel}} with the I.A.R. 15, the model '16' featured {{for the first time}} an all-metal airframe structure, covered with duralumin sheets, plywood and fabric. It resembled the I.A.R. 14 more closely than the I.A.R. 15, being inferior to the latter. The fuselage outlines followed the '14's, as did the wings, although their area was increased to 20.30 m². The tail section, as usual, was redesigned, the rear part this time becoming rounded. The two-strut undercarriage of the I.A.R. 14 was retained as well, and the tailskid appeared again. A new British radial engine, the Bristol Mercury IV S2, of maximum 560 h.p. (418 kW) output at 4,500 m, was experimented with. The powerplant was covered with a narrow Townend ring and individual exhaust pipes were fitted to each of the nine cylinders. The typical feature of this model was a large <b>propeller</b> <b>cone</b> fitted to a Bristol-made two-blade wooden airscrew. Due to the larger wings and all-metal fuselage structure the empty weight increased to 1,430 kg, giving a relatively high, 70.14 kg/m² wing load, that increased further during flight, taking also into consideration that the all-up weight was 1,650 kg. The usual armament, comprising two 7.7 mm Vickers machine guns, featured on all early I.A.R. fighters, was employed, this time placed in the wings and firing outside the propeller arc. The British engine offered an impressive maximum speed of 342 km/h at 5,000 m that could be reached in 6 ½ minutes, while the ceiling was established at 10,000 m.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that the boundary-layer flow over a {{rotating}} cone is susceptible to cross-flow and centrifugal instability modes of spiral nature, depending on the cone sharpness. For half-angles (ψ) ranging from <b>propeller</b> nose <b>cones</b> to rotating disks (ψ 40 ◦), the instability triggers co-rotating vortices, whereas for sharp spinning missiles (ψ 40 ◦. Below this half-angle we suggest that an alternative instability mechanism is at work, which is not amenable to investigation using the formulation presented here...|$|R
50|$|On 13 July 2011, a Britten-Norman Islander {{fixed-wing}} aircraft G-BSWR {{operated by the}} Police Service of Northern Ireland touched down short of the runway at Belfast International Airport, making contact with the runway approach lights. Damage was discovered after landing to the right hand side of the fuselage, <b>propeller</b> and nose <b>cone.</b> The crew were uninjured.|$|R
40|$|The flow over a {{rotating}} cone in still fluid {{is susceptible to}} crossflow and centrifugal instability modes of spiral nature, depending on the cone half-angle. For parameters ranging from <b>propeller</b> nose <b>cones</b> to rotating disks, the instability triggers co-rotating vortices, whereas for slender spinning missiles, counter-rotating vortices are observed. Upon introduction of an oncoming flow, the problem essentially becomes a battle between the streamwise and azimuthal shear flow, due to the rotating surface. The boundary layer instability is again visualized by the formation of spiral vortices, which wrap around the cone surface in a helical nature. For both crossflow and centrifugal instabilities, we derive the mean flow boundary layer equations and investigate the high Reynolds number asymptotic linear stability of the flow to inviscid crossflow modes (type I), type II modes, which arise from a viscous-Coriolis force balance, and neutral modes for a slender cone. The influence of the cone half-angle (ψ) and axial flow strength (s or Ts) on the number and orientation of the spiral vortices is examined, with comparisons made with previous experimental and numerical results.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade major {{reserves}} of fossil fuel energy sources have started to thin out, while the demand for energy is increasing due {{to the growth of}} population, economic growth and energy consumption pattern itself is constantly increasing. One of the source renewable energy which is interest to study is wind energy. Research wind energy conversion system low speed not yet widely used in Indonesia, while there are several locations that have a continuous low wind speeds that allow for convert to energy. The use of lighting at night is one thing to absorb quite a lot of electrical energy, particularly in public street lighting. As a solution, in this study designed the blade vertical axis wind turbine type cone involute to convert wind energy as an alternative energy source. Vertical axis wind turbines are still rare in Indonesia and the type of cone involute is a new technology implementation Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) which is still little study in design and manufacture. This type of VAWT is safer to use than the horizontal axis type. Some of the assumptions used to design a <b>propeller</b> shape <b>cone</b> involute, because of limitations data. This wind turbine generator connected to the axial flux type (AFPMG - Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Generator). This generator is very suitable for vertical wind turbines because of its low speed and can connect directly to the main axis of the turbine so that eliminating transmission losses. On the testing of blade vertical axis cone involute turbine without the generator obtained tip speed ratio (TSR) 1. 002423...|$|R
40|$|Two {{computational}} systems {{created by}} V Isley & P Smith (aka boredomresearch) in 2010 {{as part of}} their new series. They consist of an environment that runs in real-time, shifting slowly from periods of brightness to darkness. Continuing to explore extended time frames but also pursue stillness and a gradual shifting state. The different groups of flying machines called Whirligigs have a biological and mechanical appearance. Occasionally, they call out their unique song, seeming restless in their abandoned world. When darkness falls the Whirligigs pulsing lights and glowing smoke calls are electrified. Each Whirligig group has a certain lifespan and when this ends a new generation is created, with unique calls, <b>propellers</b> and nose <b>cones</b> patterns. They all have an energy level and when this drops they try and perch on a wire to rest and recharge, slipping gradually into hibernation. This artwork uses a new compositing tool developed by boredomresearch to allow for the live compositing of animations. The animations rely on artificial intelligence to move the characters they include and do not require interaction. boredomresearch often think of themselves as employing computer gaming technology to create landscape paintings and life studies that move. Many of their works have been created using modelling techniques similar to those used by scientists to study naturally occurring phenomena. However their aim is to create something new of intrigue and beauty. This artwork was produced using Processing and Blender 3 D...|$|R
