40|$|ABSTRACTEosinophils {{are the key}} {{effector}} cells for allergic inflammation. In order to clarify drugs which can regulate eosinophil function, we investigated the direct effect of <b>pemirolast</b> potassium (anti-allergic drug) and FK 506 (immunosupressant) on eosinophil degranulation and cytokine production. Eosinophil degranulation induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and/or platelet activating factor was inhibited from 10 - 4 to 10 - 6 mol/L <b>pemirolast</b> (inhibitory effect 66 and 33 %, respectively) and 10 - 8 mol/L FK 506 (inhibitory effect 45 %). <b>Pemirolast</b> and FK 506 also inhibit interleukin (IL) - 8 production by eosinophil. Our data suggest that both <b>pemirolast</b> potassium and FK 506 possess direct regulatory effects on human eosinophils and a potential to suppress allergic inflammation...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the clinical effectiveness of houttuynia cordata eye drops combined with <b>pemirolast</b> potassium eye drops on the patients with allergic conjunctivitis. METHODS: Totally, 63 patients with allergic conjunctivitis were randomly divided into the control group(31 cases) and the observation group(32 cases). The {{patients in the}} control group were treated with <b>pemirolast</b> potassium eye drops alone while patients in the observation group were medicated with <b>pemirolast</b> potassium eye drops combined with houttuynia cordata eye drops. Symptoms such as nictation, eye itching, red eye, foreign body sensation and signs such as conjunctival edema and hyperemia, upper and lower palpebral conjunctiva nipple and filtering blebs were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: The pretreatment symptom evaluation scored 9. 38 ± 0. 71 and 9. 41 ± 0. 56 respectively in the observation group and the control group and their pretreatment sign evaluation scored respectively 10. 21 ± 1. 03 and 10. 68 ± 0. 99, with {{no significant difference between the}} two groups. After the treatment, symptom evaluation scored 1. 22 ± 0. 61 and 4. 25 ± 0. 84 for the observation group and control group respectively and their sign evaluation scored respectively 1. 21 ± 0. 60 and 5. 78 ± 1. 29, with statistical difference between the two groups. The effective rate of the observation group(78. 12 %) was significantly higher than that of the control group(32. 25 %), and with statistical difference. CONCLUSION: The <b>pemirolast</b> potassium eye drops combined with houttuynia cordata eye drops can ameliorate the clinical symtoms and signs of the patients with allergic conjunctivitis and improve the treatment efficacy...|$|E
40|$|The painful {{peripheral}} neuropathy occurring frequently during che-motherapywith paclitaxel or oxaliplatin {{is one of}} their dose-limiting factors. We reported previously that substance P is involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel in rats, and an antiallergic agent <b>pemirolast</b> reverses this reaction via the blockade of release of substance P. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of substance P in paclitaxel-induced {{peripheral neuropathy}} compared with that by oxaliplatin. In von Frey and acetone tests in rats repeated administration of paclitaxel (6 mg/kg i. p., once a week for 4 weeks) or oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg i. p., twice a week for 4 weeks) induced both mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy was reversed primarily by the acute administration of <b>pemirolast</b> (0. 1 and 1 mg/kg p. o.). Moreover, coadministration of the receptor antagonists neurokinin 1 [N-acetyl-L-tryptophan 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) benzylester (L- 732, 138), 100 g/body i. t. ] and neurokinin 2 [5 -fluoro- 3 -[2 -[4 -methoxy- 4 -[[(R) -phenylsulphinyl]-methyl]- 1 -piperidinyl]ethyl]- 1 H-indole (GR 159897), 100 g/body i. t. ] strongly reversed paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. On the other hand, oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy was not reversed by <b>pemirolast.</b> In the in vitro study using cultured adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons paclitaxel (1000 ng/ml) significantly in-creased the release of substance P, and <b>pemirolast</b> (100 and 1000 nM) significantly inhibited this increase of substance P release. Oxaliplatin, by contrast, did not increase the release of substance P. These results suggest that substance P is involved in paclitaxel-induced neuropathy, and the mechanism of its action is clearly different from that of oxaliplatin...|$|E
