50|$|Construction {{was started}} in August 1947, but due to the marshland-geology of the site, main ground works {{contractor}} Robert M Douglas was forced to devise {{a new type of}} formwork for its construction. Timber was the traditional material for such purposes, but immediately post-war could only be obtained on permit from the Ministry of Supply. The quantity allocated by the ministry was inadequate to maintain the required progress of the work, so alternative means of providing the necessary formwork were investigated. Limited quantities of cold steel plate were available, and the timber obtained by permit was to a considerable extent used as framing to which the steel plate was fixed. The available quantities were soon absorbed and the supply was augmented by the purchase of now redundant Anderson-type air raid shelters, which were rolled flat and pressed into panels of uniform size. This was the first steel <b>panel</b> <b>formwork</b> system ever deployed in the world.|$|E

This paper reports on the findings of a study, consisting of a questionnaire survey, interviews and work-site visits, to compare the use of low-waste building technologies in public housing and private residential projects in Hong Kong. The results show that large <b>panel</b> <b>formwork</b> and prefabricated building components are widely used in public housing projects in Hong Kong. Due to the difference of the design with public housing, the use of smaller aluminium <b>panel</b> <b>formwork</b> is more common in the private housing projects. The barriers for the adoption of low-waste building technologies in the private sector are identified and discussed. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

These sealing actions lead to additional costs, making the self-compacting concrete solution more expensive than casting traditional vibrated concrete. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental research, regarding the required tightness of the joints between <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> when using SCC as non-fair faced, structural concrete. First, small scale tests are executed using artificial increase of the pressure exerted onto the tested SCC inside the formwork. In the second phase of this research, experiments are conducted on real scale formwork constructions (up to 6 m of concrete height). A wide range of calibrated joint openings between the <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> are tested. During casting of the SCC the mortar loss through the gaps is visually observed. After removal of the formwork, the surface and corners of the hardened concrete elements are analysed. The acceptable gaps between the <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> can reach values of up to 7 mm and higher, without leading to honeycombing and/or too widely spread âinfectedâ zones on the concrete surface. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|MEVA {{was founded}} in 1970 by Gerhard Dingler. The idea of {{developing}} a formwork system that would be re-usable led to the company’s foundation and to the first frame-based panelised formwork system with a facing integrated into a metal frame, the so-called <b>formwork</b> <b>panel.</b> The panels are produced in different sizes and can be freely combined, hence the name modular formwork system. In the course of its history, MEVA developed several innovations, part of which have become standard features in the industry.|$|R
40|$|Formwork {{system is}} the most {{important}} factor determining the project success especially, in high-rise building construction projects in terms of speed, quality cost and safety of the work as it accounts 40 % of the total project cost of the structure. The contractor needs to complete the project in the shortest time possible as a means to minimise the cost and the clients wants the building to start the business as early as possible. The most effective way to speed up the works in high-rise buildings is to achieve a very short floor cycle to have the structure of typical floors completed in the shortest time. That directly depends on the selected formwork type for the particular construction project. Thus, appropriate selection of an effective formwork system is crucial factor in successfully completing any high-rise building project. Two case studies were carried out to analyse the cost for different types of formwork: modern conventional method; semi-system formwork; and, Aluminium <b>panel</b> system <b>formwork</b> use in construction projects. Case study projects were selected among high-rise buildings projects more than 25 stories which are located in Colombo metropolises in Sri Lanka. The results indicated that the cost of formwork does not directly affect to the total project cost but the type of formwork is highly affected to the total project cost especially, in high-rise building construction projects. Accordingly, the Aluminium <b>panel</b> system <b>formwork</b> reduces the project duration and hence, the total project cost and gives construction structure a very high quality finish though the Aluminium panel system is very expensive itself. Moreover, this study reveals most cost effective formwork system for high-rise buildings more than 25 stories is the Aluminium panel system comparatively. Thus, this outcome is useful to decision makers to select the most appropriate formwork system for high-rise building construction.

The core walls are inclined at different angles {{and so are the}} corners which are also rounded with different radii. MEVA has developed and uses both standard and special formwork, or a combination of both, to meet the forming requirements for these complex building parts. Steel formwork, for example, is used for rounded corners if required for structural reasons. Trapezoidal areas of inclined cylindrical corner areas are poured with special Mammut 350 wall <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> and special designs of MEVA’s circular column formwork Circo are used for the tilted and rounded corners.|$|R

The object of investigation is 22 -storey high-rise commercial residential building. The effectiveness of solid concrete slab construction works and selecting the formwork system was evaluated taking account of quality requirements, equipment ability, demand of time and labour i. e. complexity of assembling technology, universality of operation and other. Three options of PERI formwork systems were selected for investigation: SKYDECK <b>panel</b> slab aluminum <b>formworks,</b> MULTIFLEX girder slab formworks and UNIPORTAL tableforms. The rating criteria were selected for the evaluation of the effectiveness of selected formwork systems. Using the pairwise evaluation method the following order of criteria importance was obtained: 17. 3 % – formwork rental price (K 7), 16. 3 % – complexity of assembling technology (K 3), 15. 4 % – machinery costs (K 2), 13. 9 % – labour costs (K 1), 13. 0 % – required compressive strength of concrete before formwork demoulding (K 5), 12. 5 % – formworks demoulding time, days (K 6), 11. 5 % – reliability of suppliers (K 4).

40|$|Formwork {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} temporary works for reinforced-concrete superstructures in building projects. The use of traditional timber formwork has dominated the construction industry in Hong Kong for many years. Now, however, low-waste technologies for superstructure construction are becoming more common. The study reported here compares the advantages and disadvantages of using traditional timber formwork and a large <b>panel</b> steel <b>formwork</b> system integrated with precast concrete semi-slab (composite formwork system) in superstructure construction in Hong Kong. The study compares these two different formwork systems used in two identically designed school projects in Hong Kong. The comparisons are focused on construction cost, time required for completion of work and construction waste generation. By conducting a detailed cost comparison, this paper shows that, despite the fact that the composite formwork system is able to produce less construction waste, the traditional timber formwork system is still more favourable economically. However, if the composite formwork could be reused in other standard school projects after completion of the project, economic advantages would be realised.

Setting up the computational model and choosing its parameters and constraints is based on the physical construction process, highlighting the relationship between material and form. As part of the cyclical exchange, evaluation of the digital model with physical testing demonstrates that the simulation can actually be trained by reducing the physical/ digital discrepancies...|$|R
40|$|A new {{construction}} method replacing rigid <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> with a flexible textile membrane that deflects under the dead weight of wet concrete, provides numerous advantages {{and opportunities for}} architecture, engineering, and construction technology in both advanced and basic building economies. Inexpensive formwork fabrics provide the options of sacrificial or reusable formworks in both precast and cast-in-place applications. Methods {{have been developed for}} fabric-cast foundations, walls, columns, capitals, slabs, and beams. Permeable membranes allow air bubbles and excess mix water to bleed out, producing a flawless, cement-rich finish and a stronger and more durable Òcase hardenedÓ concrete. Structurally efficient variable section members are easily formed, reducing dead weight and material expenses. Steel-free concrete structures are envisioned through the use of three dimensional compression geometries formed through a simple inversion of funicular curves.

5000|$|In 1958 {{the company}} branch Doka was founded. The company {{founding}} and company name are interlinked {{with their first}} product and projects. In Austria in the 1950s, large infrastructural construction was underway including several hydro electrical dams. The dams were being built on the Danube river (Donau) and its tributaries by the Austrian utility [...] "Donaukraftwerke" [...] or DOKW for short, translating as 'Danube power stations'. Because of the great size of these structures, traditional timber beam formwork was too labor-intensive to form the large walls. Thus a large scale systematic and reusable formwork was developed, with the wooden <b>formwork</b> <b>panels</b> being produced and shipped from the Amstetten company. Originally the DOKW was the delivery address, but then became the product name (DOKW boards). Linguistic usage slurred DOKW into DOKA, which became {{the name of the}} newly founded company.In 1961 the first subsidiary was established in Germany, followed in 1977 by Brazil and Kuwait. Since then Doka has grown to service countries in all inhabited continents, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, and in the English speaking countries Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States.

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{the development of}} a fire resistant prefab concrete panel called the Fire Fighting Layer® (FFL®). This panel can be used to provide fire protection for concrete constructions in infrastructure, non-residential and industrial buildings. The panel has two functions: During the construction phase, the <b>panel</b> functions as <b>formwork,</b> during the user phase, the panel functions as a fire resistant protective layer for the underlying main Load-bearing structure. In order to be approved for use as a fire resistant protective layer for main concrete load- bearing structure, the FFL® must be able to withstand the temperatures generated in the hydrocarbon fire test curve (Dutch Directorate General for Public Works and Water Management). Three additional requirements must also be met: The temperature of the main reinforcing elements may not exceed 250 °C, The temperature of the concrete at a distance of 25 mm from the outside of the reinforcing elements may not exceed a temperature of 380 °C, The panel must remain intact for a period of at least two hours.

The reason for developing this solution was the idea to save time during construction by omitting the fire proofing of the construction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of six {{different}} fabric construction methods (three Standard methods; three Alternative methods) on energy performance and costs, for a typical English four bedroom detached dwelling. The energy performance of the dwelling was assessed using the UK Government’s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP), {{which is based on}} the Building Research Establishment Domestic Energy Model. The capital costs were estimated from data published by the Building Cost Information Services applied to Leicester UK area in 2011. Standard construction methods were considered to be masonry cavity walls, solid concrete floors and cold pitched timber roofs. Alternative construction methods were considered to be structural insulated <b>panels,</b> insulated concrete <b>formwork</b> and thin joint block work. Through alterations to the dwelling fabric alone, a reduction of 30 % in carbon emissions of the base property could be achieved. Standard methods proved to be as effective as Alternative methods at reducing carbon emissions for an average capital cost increase of 9. 1 % against the base property. This was equivalent to an extra cost of £ 13. 7 for each kg of CO 2 emissions reduction. The optimum construction method that would help achieve the UK government target in terms of future zero carbon dwellings, was also discussed...|$|R
