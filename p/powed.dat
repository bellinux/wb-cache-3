40|$|Recent {{advances}} in indoor positioning systems {{led to a}} business interest in those applications and services where a precise localization is crucial. Wi-Fi fingerprinting based on machine learning and expert systems are commonly used in the literature. They compare a current fingerprint to a database of fingerprints, and then return the most similar one/ones according to: 1) a distance function, 2) a data representation method for received signal strength values, and 3) a thresholding strategy. However, most of the previous works simply use the Euclidean distance with the raw unprocessed data. There is not any previous work that studies {{which is the best}} distance function, which is the best way of representing the data and which is the effect of applying thresholding. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study using 51 distance metrics, 4 alternatives to represent the raw data (2 of them proposed by us), a thresholding based on the RSS values and the public UJIIndoorLoc database. The results shown in this paper demonstrate that researchers and developers should take into account the conclusions arisen in this work in order to improve the accuracy of their systems. The IPSs based on k-NN are improved by just selecting the appropriate configuration (mainly distance function and data representation). In the best case, 13 -NN with Sørensen distance and the <b>powed</b> data representation, the error in determining the place (building and floor) has been reduced in more than a 50 % and the positioning accuracy has been increased in 1. 7 m with respect to the 1 -NN with Euclidean distance and raw data commonly used in the literature. Moreover, our experiments also demonstrate that thresholding should not be applied in multi-building and multi-floor environments...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar os efeitos do uso de leucena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de wit), em dietas para bovinos com ou sem adição de levedura (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) sobre a digestão (degradabilidade e digestiilidade), fermentação (produção de ácido graxos voláteis, amônia e metano) e população de protozoários no rúmen. Foram utilizados quatro bovinos machos mestiços, com peso vivo médio de 797 kg, canulados no rúmen em experimento com delineamento Quadrado Latino 4 x 4 em arranjo fatorial 2 x 2 com dois níveis leucena (20 % e 50 %) com feno de Cynodon dactylon {{cultivar}} coast-cross na presença ou ausência da levedura. Os tratamentos foram denominados: 20 S = 20 % de feno de leucena + 80 % de de coast-cross; 50 S = 50 % de feno de leucena + 50 % de de coast-cross; 20 L = 20 % de feno de leucena + 80 % de de coast-cross + 10 g de levedura; 50 L = 50 % de feno de leucena + 50 % de de coast-cross + 10 g de levedura. Os parâmetros ruminais avaliados foram: produções de ácidos graxos voláteis (AGVs); concentração de amônia; pH; produção de gás metano; taxa de passagem do líquido; degradabilidade in situ da MS, FDN e PB dos fenos de leucena e coast-cross; digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da MS dos fenos de leucena e coast-cross; contagem diferencial dos gêneros de protozoários ciliados. Houve efeitos da interação entre níveis de leucena e levedura nas dietas sobre as concentrações médias dos AGVs totais (P 0, 05) mas foram observados efeitos significativos da interação, evidenciando maiores concentrações do ácido butiríco no tratamento 20 L. Não foram observadas diferenças (P> 0, 05), nas concentrações de amônia no rúmen, variando de 18, 71 a 21, 28 mg/ 100 mL no líquido ruminal. Houve diferença (P 0, 05). A população de protozoários ciliados no rúmen sofreu alterações conforme o tratamento aplicado, tanto na concentração como na composição final da fauna, indicando um efeito associativo que ocorreu com o aumento de leucena na dieta juntamente com a levedura ou mecanismo de ação semelhante de ambos, dependendo do nível de leucena na dieta. The present work had as objective {{to evaluate the}} effect of the use of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) of Wit) in diets for bovines with or without yeast addition (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on the digestion (degradability and digestibility), fermentation (production of volatile fatty acids, ammonia and methane) and ciliate protozoa population in rumen. Four crossbred male cattle, with average body weight of 797 kg, with rumen cannula were utilized in a Latin Square assay design 4 x 4, in factorial arrangement (2 x 2) with two levels of leucaena (20 % and 50 % DM) with hay of Cynodon dactylon cv coast-cross with or without addition of yeast. The treatments had been called: 20 S = 20 % of leucena hay + 80 % of hay of coast-cross; 50 S = 50 % of leucena hay + 50 % of hay of coast-cross; 20 L = 20 % of leucena hay + 80 % of hay of coast-cross + 10 g of yeast and 50 L = 50 % of leucena hay + 50 % of hay of coast-cross + 10 g yeast. The ruminal parameters evaluated were: volatile fatty acids production; ammonia concentration; pH; gas production of methane; fluid outflow; in situ degradability in situ of the DM, NDF and CP of leucena and coast-cross hays; DM in vitro digestibility of leucena and coast-cross hays and concentration and generic counting of the ciliate protozoa. It was observed effect of the interaction between leucena levels and yeast in the diets on average total concentrations of VFA. No differences were observed in the concentrations of acetic acid among the treatments. But the propionic acid concentrations had shown significant effect for levels of leucena in the diet and interaction, with higher values obtained in the high leucaena level with yeast addition (19. 14 mM). The increase of the leucaena level favored a higher production of propionic acid and this effect was <b>powed</b> by the yeast addition. There were no differences in the butyric acid production among the treatments, but significant effect of the interaction had been observed, evidencing higher concentrations of butyric acid in the treatment 20 L. No difference had been observed in the rumen ammonia concentrations, varying from 18. 71 to 21, 28 mg/ 100 mL of ruminal liquid. A reduction in the methane production was observed in the animals receiving higher level of leucena with yeast addition. The values found for the kinetic ruminal had not been affected by the treatments. There was observed alteration in the rumen protozoa population according to treatment, as much in the concentration as mainly in the final composition of the fauna, indicating to have an associative effect that occurs with the increase of leucena in the diet together with the yeast addition or occurs a mechanism of similar action of both depending on the level of leucena in the diet...|$|E
