50|$|Appropriate public {{policies}} and legislation are essential requirements for sustainable {{economic and social}} development in rural and urban areas, for safeguarding the environment in which we live, and for protecting flora, fauna and the cultural heritage. Environmental protection has traditionally been an element of forestry, both in its emphasis on conserving forests and their natural character and in accounting for environmental impacts outside the forest, especially on soil and water. Still, this was normally within the framework of forests as a <b>productive</b> <b>asset</b> managed by production specialists.In recent years a series of influences primarily from outside the forest sector has had a substantial impact on the objectives of forestry and on the contents of forest law. In common with other sectors, forestry has been profoundly affected by the emergence of environmental awareness and by environmental legislation in the last generation. The greening of forest law has brought greater emphasis on non-financial values, including the protection of wilderness and aesthetic values.To the general environmental influences on forest law have been added two very specific influences: biological diversity and climate change.In general terms, biological diversity is appearing in national laws as a value to be protected in forest management. In some cases it is {{to be taken into account}} when forest management plans are drawn up. Where criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management exist, biological diversity is representedClimate change is now entering forest vocabulary and legislation, especially with the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. General references place mitigating climate change among the objectives of forest law and policy. This complements broader climate policies and programs. As Rosenbaum and colleagues point out, however, there is little legislation containing specific provisions for mitigating forest-based climate-change.|$|E

40|$|Abundant {{research}} {{in developing countries}} has demonstrated that poor households are highly vulnerable to negative shocks of various kinds. The shocks themselves are often devastating – e. g., crop or livestock losses, illness or death in the family, crime and natural disasters. In addition, many negative shocks involve a loss of <b>productive</b> <b>assets,</b> either directly or indirectly. Direct effects, in this context, arise from the destruction or loss of assets – as with land or dwellings damaged by a flood or other disaster. Indirect effects arise when households sell off assets {{as a response to}} the shocks. In either case, a loss of <b>productive</b> <b>assets</b> can have long-term implications for poor individuals and households, reducing their ability to transition out of poverty. Poverty analyses find that income-poor households that own <b>productive</b> <b>assets</b> are more likely to transition out of poverty than households that are both income and asset-poor (Adato, Carter, and May 2006; Carter and Barrett 2006).
