40|$|<b>Provision</b> <b>against</b> <b>risk</b> {{can be a}} {{good reason}} to {{champion}} equality in modern times. No one is free from such risks as disease, aging, caring for old parents, and raising children. Since human beings are vulnerable by nature, they fall victim to various risks regardless of their wealth or social status. If one considers others’ hardships as one’s own, one would naturally support policies that socialize risks. The socialization of risk is closely related therefore to the idea of equality because it compensates those who fall victim to risk. Today risks are growing due to the fierce competition brought about by globalization. People have come to realize their lives are at risk. Even diligent and honest people are dismissed from their jobs for reasons beyond their control when their employers try to cut wages. Many ordinary students have great difficulty finding a job. As advanced societies age, the people are more concerned about their lives after retirement, especially in terms of pensions and medical insurance. In the United States, where there is no public health insuranc e system, more people suffer the risk of sickness. This short paper aims to consider why neo-liberals are still popular among people in such a risk- filled society. In other words, why don’t the people elect the Left or Social Democrats in Western Europe and the Liberals in the United States, whose traditional agenda is the enhancement of equality, and thereby relieve themselves of these concerns? This article attempts to answer this question by looking at the variety and gradation of risks...|$|R
30|$|The {{hydrological}} {{phenomena in}} a watershed are not independent events, but rather interactive feedbacks between hydrologic processes. Comprehensive and quantitative understanding of hydrologic feedback processes {{is important for}} the effective water budget and the <b>provision</b> <b>against</b> potential <b>risks</b> to water resources (Winter et al. 1998; Guo 2002; Brooks et al. 2003; Ward and Trimble 2004; Brutsaert 2005; Gupta 2010). Various techniques and models have been developed to estimate the hydrologic processes. To avoid the overdraft and declining groundwater level, {{it is important to understand}} the behavior of an aquifer system subjected to artificial stresses. Simulation modeling is an excellent tool to achieve this goal. Groundwater simulation models are useful in simulating groundwater flow scenarios under different management options and thereby taking corrective measures for sustainable use of water resources by conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater.|$|R
40|$|The present paper simulates the {{privatization}} of social security in an economy populated by overlapping generations of individuals that have time-consistent or time-inconsistent preferences, face mortality and individual income risk as well as borrowing constraints. We compute the transition path and compensate households in order to isolate the efficiency effects of the reforms. The model is calibrated to the German economy where {{the social security system}} offers little income insurance. Nevertheless, we find a positive role for social security due to the insurance <b>provision</b> <b>against</b> mortality <b>risk</b> and the provision of a commitment technology for present-biased consumers. In economies with rational consumers the elimination of social security yields an efficiency loss of roughly 0. 6 percent of initial resources, while in economies with hyperbolic consumers the efficiency loss increases to 1. 8 percent.

40|$|Section 340 f of the German Commercial Code allows {{banks to}} <b>provision</b> <b>against</b> the special <b>risks</b> {{inherent}} to the banking business by building hidden reserves. Beyond risk provisioning, these reserves are implicitly accepted as an earnings management device. By analyzing financial statements of German banks {{for the period}} 1995 through 2009, we see these hidden reserves being used to (1) avoid a negative net income, (2) avoid a drop in net income compared to the previous year, (3) avoid a shortfall in net income compared to a peer group, and (4) reduce the variability of banks' net income over time. We (5) find a diminished relevance of avoiding a drop in net income {{as well as a}} shortfall relative to the peer group during the financial crisis. Finally, we are (6) unable to confirm any differences in the relevance of hidden reserves for earnings management between listed and non-listed banks.

50|$|In 1895 {{the first}} {{legislative}} provision {{was made for}} protection of workers <b>against</b> <b>risk</b> of accident or special injury to health. Sufficient cubic space, lighting, ventilation, sanitary accommodation, reasonable temperature, removal of noxious gases or dust, fencing of machinery, precautions <b>against</b> <b>risk</b> from fire and other matters are provided for. The manufacture of lucifer matches by means of white phosphorus was forbidden and the export, importation and sale was regulated by a law of 28 May 1901. By a regulation of 16 March 1904 provisions for safety and health of women and young workers were strengthened in processes where lead compounds or other poisons are used, and their employment at certain dangerous machines and in cleaning machinery or near driving belts was prohibited. No penal <b>provision</b> <b>against</b> truck exists in the Netherlands, but possibly abuses of the system are prevented by the existence of industrial councils representing both employers and workers, with powers to mediate or arbitrate in case of disputes.|$|R
