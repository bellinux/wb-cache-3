60|$|The <b>postal</b> <b>guide</b> tells me, disobligingly, {{that there}} is no mail to you via San Francisco this month and that I must confide my few lines to the {{precarious}} and perfidious Hamburg. I do so, then, for the plain reason that I can no longer repress the enthusiasm that has surged within me ever since I read Catriona. I missed, just after doing so, last month's post, and I was infinitely vexed that it should not have conveyed to you the freshness of my rapture. For the said Catriona so reeks and hums with genius {{that there is}} no refuge for the desperate reader but in straightforward prostration. I'm not sure that it's magnanimous of you to succeed so inconsiderately--there is a modesty in easy triumph which your flushed muse perhaps a little neglects.--But forgive that lumbering image--I won't attempt to carry it out. Let me only say that I don't despatch these ineffectual words on their too watery way to do anything but thank you for an exquisite pleasure. I hold that when a book has the high beauty of that one there's a poor indelicacy in what simple folk call criticism. The work lives by so absolute a law that it's grotesque to prattle about what might have been! I shall express to you the one point in which my sense was conscious of an unsatisfied desire, but only after saying first how rare an achievement I think the whole personality and tone of David and with how supremely happy a hand you have coloured the palpable women. They are quite too lovely and everyone is running after them. In David not an error, not a false note ever; he is all of an exasperating truth and rightness. The one thing I miss in the book is the note of visibility--it subjects my visual sense, my seeing imagination, to an almost painful underfeeding. The hearing imagination, as it were, is nourished like an alderman, and the loud audibility seems a slight the more on the baffled lust of the eyes--so that I seem to myself (I am speaking of course only {{from the point of view}} of the way, as I read, my impression longs to complete itself) in the presence of voices in the darkness--voices the more distinct and vivid, the more brave and sonorous, as voices always are--but also the more tormenting and confounding--by reason of these bandaged eyes. I utter a pleading moan when you, e.g., transport your characters, toward the end, in a line or two from Leyden to Dunkirk without the glint of a hint of all the ambient picture of the 18th century road. However, stick to your own system of evocation so long as what you positively achieve is so big. Life and letters and art all take joy in you.|$|E

The administration has also supported <b>postal</b> reform, outlining <b>guiding</b> principles intended to ensure that the Service: implements best practices with a governing body equipped to meet its responsibilities; enhances transparency of timely and accurate data on postal costs and performance; provides greater flexibility for the Service to meet its customer obligations; ensures accountability through appropriate independent oversight; and keeps the Service financially selfsufficient, covering all of its obligations. GAO was asked to discuss comprehensive postal reform in light of these principles. This testimony is largely based on prior GAO reports and testimonies. ...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis empirically {{investigates the}} antecedents, processes, performance, and {{consequences}} of internationalisation of Indonesian SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) engaged in manufacturing and services. It also develops an integrated conceptual model that explains the rationale of SME internationalisation in Indonesia. It is proposed that there are significant and positive relationships between the following: internationalisation antecedents and internationalisation process; internationalisation antecedents and internationalisation performance; internationalisation process and internationalisation performance; and internationalisation performance and organisational performance of Indonesian SMEs. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods is employed. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} 9 Indonesian experts and 14 Indonesian SME owners or managers using a semi-structured interview <b>guide.</b> <b>Postal</b> surveys were also done which resulted in 131 usable respondents’ answers. Both the in-depth interviews and postal surveys were conducted concurrently in five provinces of Indonesia: Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, and Bali. The qualitative data were analysed using NVivo 10 software, while the quantitative data were examined using statistical techniques, namely descriptive statistics, factor analysis, reliability analysis, and inferential (comparative and correlation) statistics of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 22 software. Applying the mixed methods follows the model developed by Steckler et al. (1992), and the qualitative results serve to help interpret and explain the quantitative findings. The findings indicate that of seven defining components of internationalisation antecedents - human capital, social capital, organisational characteristics, characteristics of domestic market, characteristics of foreign markets, market internationalisation, and industry - “market internationalisation” has the least observations (3. 7 % at the 5 % and 10 % significance levels) concerning significant and positive relationships with the internationalisation process, and “organisational characteristics” is found to have the most observations (44. 44 % at the 5 % significance level and 55. 55 % at the 10 % significance level) that has significant and positive relationships with internationalisation process. The variable “industry” has the least observations (4. 54 % at the 5 % and 10 % significance levels) concerning significant and positive relationships with internationalisation performance. Lastly, “organisational characteristics” is discovered to have the most observations (25 % at the 5 % significance level and 29. 55 % at the 10 % significance level) regarding significant and positive relationships with internationalisation performance. Furthermore, the findings indicate that 18. 18 % (at the 5 % significance level) and 22. 22 % (at the 10 % significance level) observation of the defining components of internationalisation processes have significant and positive relationships with internationalisation performance. It is evident that 36. 36 % (at the 5 % significance level) and 45. 45 % (at the 10 % significance level) observation of the defining components of internationalisation performance do have significant and positive relationships with the Indonesian SMEs’ growth. Finally, 42. 42 % (at the 5 % significance level) and 45. 45 % (at the 10 % significance level) observation of the defining components of internationalisation performance are found to have significant and positive relationships with the Indonesian SMEs’ profitability. The originality of this thesis is embedded in at least four key aspects. First, the study has been conducted in Indonesia, a country in which SME internationalisation is not widely known or documented. Second, the relationships among three aspects of internationalisation of Indonesian SMEs - specifically the antecedents, processes and performance, and consequences integrated in a newly developed conceptual model for this research - have been analysed together at the same time. Third, the study has also developed a new approach for describing the strength of the relationship among the researched variables beyond the matters of hypothesis rejection or acceptance. Fourth, the study has applied the second model of mixed methods developed by Steckler et al. (1992) as mentioned above. The implications of the research findings not only for practitioners (especially managers and researchers), but also for policy-makers, are provided in the last chapter, Chapter Six, of this study...|$|R
