25|$|The Pioneer 400 is a {{low wing}} monoplane, with a {{trapezoidal}} plan wing that has sweep only on the trailing edge and winglets at its tips. The wing structure is wooden with a single box-spar and is covered with <b>pre-preg</b> carbon fibre. Ailerons occupy about half the span; inboard, slotted flaps fill the rest. Both ailerons and flaps are fabric covered.|$|E
25|$|Multi-layer {{printed circuit}} boards have trace layers inside the board. This is {{achieved}} by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat {{for a period of}} time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom <b>pre-preg</b> and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{different}} dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known <b>pre-preg</b> materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of failures of mechanical components {{are caused by}} fatigue. Unlike many conventional engineering components, implants in the body are subjected to complex multidirectional loading patterns, thus fatigue not only occurs under axial, fully or partly reversed loading, but also under torsional loading. The fatigue behaviours of self-reinforced poly lactide composite (PLA) of unidirectional PLA fibres in PLA matrix containing tricalcium phosphates (TCP), (PLA-PLA-TCP) produced via <b>pre-pregging</b> technique has been investigated. Quasi-static test results indicated that PLA-PLA-TCP is stronger in tension than in compression and torsion and is significantly influence by moulding temperature. Uniaxial fatigue testing at 37 ° C in saline solution established S-N (Wöhler) curves for both axial and torsional loading for two moulding temperatures (140 °C and 150 °C). Compression loading showed {{significant effect on the}} axial fatigue behaviour. Biaxial fatigue results showed that the addition of torsion to axial loading significantly reduced the fatigue life. Out-of-phase loading was less detrimental to the fatigue life than in-phase. Fatigue development was evaluated by reduction in secant modulus and increase in energy absorbed. The threshold number of cycles at which damage starts to accumulate in the composite was found to be load ratio and direction dependent. The effects of the degradation process in saline solution on the fatigue behaviour of the composite were also studied at 25...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to enhance performance of composite coatings through modification of graphite-reinforced polyimide composite surfaces prior to metal bond coat/ hard topcoat application for use in the erosive and/or oxidative environments of advanced engines. Graphite reinforced polyimide composites, PMR- 15 and PMR-II- 50, formed by sheet molding and <b>pre-pregging</b> will be surface treated, overlaid with a bond coat and then coated with WC-Co. The surface treatment will include cleaning, RF plasma or ultraviolet light- ozone etching, and deposition of SiO(x) groups. These surface treatments will be studied in order to investigate and improve adhesion and oxidation resistance. The following panels were provided by NASA-Glenn Research Center(NASA-GRC) : Eight compression molded PMR-II- 50; 6 x 6 x 0. 125 in. Two vacuum-bagged PMR-II- 50; 12 x 12 x 0. 125 in. Eight compression molded PMR- 15; 6 x 6 x 0. 125 in. One vacuum-bagged PMR- 15; 12 x 12 x 0. 125 in. All panels were made using a 12 x 12 in. T 650 - 35 8 HS (3 K-tow) graphite fabric. A diamond-wafering blade, with deionized water as a cutting fluid, was used to cut PMR-II- 50 and PMR- 15 panels into 1 x 1 in. pieces for surface tests. The panel edges exhibiting delamination were used for the preliminary surface preparation tests as these would be unsuitable for strength and erosion testing. PMR- 15 neat resin samples were also provided by NASA GRC. Surface profiles of the as-received samples were determined using a Dektak III Surface profile measuring system. Two samples of compression molded PMR-II- 50 and PMR- 15, vacuum-bagged PMR-II- 50 and PMR- 15 were randomly chosen for surface profile measurement according to ANSI/ASME B 46. 1. Prior to each measurement, the samples were blasted with compressed air to remove any artifacts. Five 10 mm-long scans were made on each sample. The short and long wavelength cutoff filter values were set at 100 and 1000 m, diamond stylus radius was 12. 5 microns.

50|$|Glass {{reinforced}} aluminium (GLARE) is a fiber {{metal laminate}} (FML) composed of several very thin layers of metal (usually aluminium) interspersed {{with layers of}} glass-fiber <b>pre-preg,</b> bonded together with a matrix such as epoxy. The uni-directional <b>pre-preg</b> layers may be aligned in different directions to suit predicted stress conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-preg</b> {{allows one}} to {{impregnate}} the fibers on a flat workable surface, or rather in an industrial process, and then later form the impregnated fibers to a shape which {{could prove to be}} problematic for the hot injection process. <b>Pre-preg</b> also {{allows one to}} impregnate a bulk amount of fiber and then store it in a cooled area (below 20°C) {{for an extended period of}} time to cure later. Unfortunately the process can also be time consuming in comparison to the hot injection process and the added value for <b>pre-preg</b> preparation is at the stage of the material supplier.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pre-preg</b> is [...] "pre-impregnated" [...] {{composite}} fibers where a thermoset {{polymer matrix}} material, such as epoxy, is already present. The fibers often {{take the form}} of a weave and the matrix is used to bond them together and to other components during manufacture. The thermoset matrix is only partially cured to allow easy handling; this B-Stage material requires cold storage to prevent complete curing. B-Stage <b>pre-preg</b> is always stored in cooled areas since heat accelerates complete polymerization. Hence, composite structures built of pre-pregs will mostly require an oven or autoclave to cure.|$|E

50|$|The Swan 80 Mk II was a {{sailboat}} designed by German Frers and built by Nautor's Swan and first launched in 2010. The hull is constructed using foamcored carbon-fibre reinforced construction using the <b>pre-preg</b> lay-up.|$|E
50|$|A third {{method of}} {{constructing}} composite materials {{is known as}} a dry layup. Here, the carbon fiber material is already impregnated with resin (<b>pre-preg)</b> and is applied to the mold in a similar fashion to adhesive film. The assembly is then placed in a vacuum to cure. The dry layup method has the least amount of resin waste and can achieve lighter constructions than wet layup. Also, because larger amounts of resin are more difficult to bleed out with wet layup methods, <b>pre-preg</b> parts generally have fewer pinholes. Pinhole elimination with minimal resin amounts generally require the use of autoclave pressures to purge the residual gases out.|$|E

50|$|A {{great deal}} of design {{work has been done}} by Greg Cole of Windward Performance to show that a {{sailplane}} for 90,000 feet is relatively straightforward, while 100,000 feet is possible, although more difficult and expensive. Windward Performance will build the sailplane of high performance <b>pre-preg</b> in production-quality tooling. The sailplane requires relatively high-end design, analysis, and construction, to be flutter-safe at very high true air speeds, and strong enough for the potentially heavy turbulence that could be encountered at 90,000 feet.

The shipyard had a workforce of 280 people in 2016. The 139ft SAMURAI was delivered early 2016: Huisfit and the advanced composites division converted this 40-knot carbonfibre stripped-out speed machine (ex-Mari-Cha IV) into a luxurious yet high performance superyacht. The 65ft S&S sloop Aileen II, constructed entirely of <b>pre-preg</b> carbon fibre, is launched in 2017.

5000|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} CFRP parts is by layering sheets of carbon fiber cloth into a mold {{in the shape}} of the final product. The alignment and weave of the cloth fibers is chosen to optimize the strength and stiffness properties of the resulting material. The mold is then filled with epoxy and is heated or air-cured. The resulting part is very corrosion-resistant, stiff, and strong for its weight. Parts used in less critical areas are manufactured by draping cloth over a mold, with epoxy either preimpregnated into the fibers (also known as <b>pre-preg)</b> or [...] "painted" [...] over it. High-performance parts using single molds are often vacuum-bagged and/or autoclave-cured, because even small air bubbles in the material will reduce strength. An alternative to the autoclave method is to use internal pressure via inflatable air bladders or EPS foam inside the non-cured laid-up carbon fiber.|$|E
