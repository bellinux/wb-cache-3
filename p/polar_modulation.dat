30|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} a {{potential}} multiple access and modulation {{scheme based on}} polarized states (PS) of electromagnetic (EM) waves for line-of-sight (LOS) communications. The proposed scheme is theoretic different from the existing <b>polar</b> <b>modulation</b> for EDGE and WCDMA systems.

Because of the inflexibility of polarization information in the time and frequency domains, as well as independence of frequency and space, the polarization information can be used independently for wireless communications, i.e., another independent resource domain that can be utilized. Due to the independence between the PS and the specific features of signals (such as waveform, bandwidth and data rate), the discussed polarization division multiple access (PDMA) and polarization modulation (PM) are expected to improve the spectrum utilization effectively. It is proved that the polarization filtering technique can be adopted in the PDMA-PM wireless communications to separate the multiuser signals and demodulate the bit information representing by PS for desired user.
