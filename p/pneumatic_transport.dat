40|$|Background: <b>Pneumatic</b> tube <b>transport</b> of {{pathology}} specimens from {{the emergency department}} to the laboratory for analysis is a widely used practice. When compared to manual specimen transport, it results in savings in both time and labour. Sampling of cerebrospinal fluid still forms part of the workup of patients with suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage. There are claims in the literature that transport of cerebrospinal fluid samples by pneumatic tube results in excess haemolysis, which interferes with cerebrospinal fluid analysis {{for the presence of}} bilirubin. The aim of our study was to ascertain whether <b>pneumatic</b> tube <b>transport</b> of blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid to the laboratory, results in clinically significantly higher levels of haemolysis compared with manual transport of the same specimens. Methods: Stored cerebrospinal fluid was spiked with varying amounts of red blood cells creating 72 specimens of varying red cell concentration. Half of these specimens were transported to the laboratory manually while the other half were sent by <b>pneumatic</b> tube <b>transport.</b> The rates of haemolysis were compared between the pneumatic tube and manual transport samples. Results: There was no clinically significant difference in the rates of haemolysis between the samples transported to the laboratory by pneumatic tube compared with those moved manually. Conclusions: <b>Pneumatic</b> tube <b>transport</b> of cerebrospinal fluid to the laboratory is not associated with clinically significantly higher rates of haemolysis when compared to manual transport...|$|R

Some problems include simply the flow itself. These include such things as reducing pressure drop, eliminating flow induced vibrations, or ensuring uniform flow through an equipment that processes elements of the flow (e.g., pollution reduction equipment such as a catalyst or an electrostatic precipitator). Since fluid flow carries energy, heat transfer problems such as improving thermal mixing or heating/cooling characteristics are often solved. Similarly, ASC undertakes many problems involving the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transport</b> of particulate. The chemical reactions in a flowing gas or liquid are also the subject of ASC studies. Methods used to solve these problems include: Numerical simulation (including Computational fluid dynamics), Wind tunnel testing, Laboratory modeling (including Scale models), and Field testing.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} derived to {{calculate}} the pressure losses originating from the dilute phase <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transport</b> of coarse particles in the horizontal stationary flow regime. The model {{is based on the}} balance of drag forces and frictional forces acting on the particles during <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transport.</b> The particles are characterized by the particle terminal velocity, the particle âwall sliding friction coefficient and the coefficient of restitution between particles and wall. The influence of the inhomogeneous particle distribution in the pipe is taken into account using a particle density distribution resembling the barometric height formula. The model is verified experimentally by the use of particle velocity measurements and particle-wall collision measurements during <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transport.</b> For this purpose measuring techniques and tools have been developed. A Froude number, based on the mean square value of the radial particle-velocity component, appears in the model as an empirical parameter.

However this dependency could not be quantified and may restrict the accuracy of pressure loss predictions with the model.

On the basis of experimental researches results of vortex chamber superchargers the diagram comparison of achievable injector factors direct-flow jet devices and vortex chamber superchargers is plotted. Findings. It is received that the injector factor on a solid of vortex chamber supercharger surpasses four times achievable (theoretical) injector factor on a solid of the direct-flow jet device. Consequently, necessary pressure of an active flow considerably decreases, and the necessary (consumed) power brought to the device for supply of the set injector factor on a solid decreases. At pumping of solid mediums in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>transport</b> vortex chamber superchargers are more effective and possess the big efficiency. ?? ?????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????????? ? ???????? ?????- ? ????????????????. ??? ???????????? ?????????????????? ??????, ????????, ??? ??????????? ??????? ?? ???????? ???? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ? ??? ???? ??????????
