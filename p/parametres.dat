This new function, far from helping intelligence agents to work on information collection as well as data and information analysis, will make it harder for the Argentine state to move away “from the promiscuous relationship between the intelligence structure and federal justice”, as criticized by CFK during the national broadcast where she announced the new proposed changes.|$|E

In the first part the graduation thesis presents the runoff basics, as part of the hydrologic circle, are presented. There is also the description of the hydrograph, its components and characteristics. The use and characteristics of the unit hydrograph are given. Furthermore, there is a chapter about the geographical and meteorological characterisctics of the watershed and their affect on the shape, duration and maximum runoff volume of the hydrograph. Timing <b>parametres</b> and their definictions are described. In case of <b>parametres</b> with multiple definictions, all of them are descibed and their differences are submited. The following part contains the methods and equations for calculating the values of these <b>parametres.</b> The methods are divided into three approaches: the analysis of gauged hydrographs, the velocity method and the empirical equations. Numerous equations are listed with details. The process of defining timing <b>parametres</b> from gauged hydrographs and rainfall is presented. For the selected basins multiple hydrographs were defined from measured data. Timing <b>parametres</b> were then gathered from the hydrographs.

Focus is then put on time, and we observe that relevant contributions to the problem of time-oriented data, and to the uncertainty issue, have lately emerged in the visual analytics scientific community.
