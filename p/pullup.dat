2500|$|In {{order to}} {{withstand}} the high g-forces experienced during <b>pullup</b> after a dive attack, much of the aircraft's center-section was cut from a solid steel block. It was powered by a similar Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior air-cooled radial engine as used by the Great Lakes design, and had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The crew of two sat in tandem in separate cockpits, with the observer in the rear cockpit armed with a single flexibly mounted machine gun, and the pilot with a single fixed [...] synchronized machine gun firing through the aircraft's propeller arc. Its bombload was carried on a crutch under the fuselage that swung down to ensure the bomb would clear the propeller when dropped in a steep dive.|$|E

He also engaged in what are now called bodyweight exercises similar to gymnastics, achieving seven one-arm <b>pullups</b> with the right arm and five with the left, several one-finger one-arm <b>pullups,</b> one-arm <b>pullups</b> carrying twenty pounds, one-arm <b>pullups</b> on a one-half inch ledge, and one-arm front levers. http://www.johngill.net. Over the age of 75, Gill still enjoys doing mild bodyweight exercises.|$|R
50|$|Microelectronic devices using {{open drain}} signals (such as microcontrollers) {{may provide a}} 'weak' {{internal}} pull-up resistor to connect the terminal in question to a positive voltage source/rail like Vdd of the device. Such weak <b>pullups,</b> often {{on the order of}} 100 kΩ, reduce power usage by keeping input signals from floating. External <b>pullups</b> are stronger (perhaps 3 kΩ) to reduce signal rise times (like with I²C) or to minimize noise (like on system RESET inputs). Internal <b>pullups</b> can often be disabled for cases where there is an external one, or in other cases where they are not needed.|$|R

50|$|Some {{non-compliant}} cables with a USB-C connector {{on one end}} and {{a legacy}} USB-A plug or Micro-B receptacle {{on the other end}} incorrectly terminate the Configuration Channel (CC) with a 10kΩ <b>pullup</b> to VBUS instead of the specification mandated 56kΩ <b>pullup,</b> causing a device connected to the cable to incorrectly determine the amount of power it is permitted to draw from the cable. Cables with this issue may not work properly with certain products, including Apple and Google products, and may even damage power sources such as chargers, hubs, or PC USB ports.|$|E

5000|$|The idle line {{state is}} when the device is {{connected}} to the host with a <b>pullup</b> on either D+ and D−, with transmitter output on both host and device is set to high impedance (hi-Z) (disconnected output).|$|E
5000|$|The Pseudo Open Drain (POD) {{drivers have}} a strong {{pull-down}} strength but a weaker <b>pullup</b> strength. A pure open-drain driver, by comparison, has no <b>pullup</b> strength except for leakage current: all the pull-up action is on the external termination resistor. This is why the term [...] "pseudo" [...] has to be used here: there is some pull-up on the driver side when output is at high state, the remaining pull-up strength is provided by parallel-terminating the receiver {{at the far end}} to the HIGH voltage, often using a switchable, on-die terminator instead of a separate resistor. The purpose of all this is to reduce the overall power demand compared to using both strong <b>pullup</b> and strong pull-down, as in drivers such as HSTL. DDR4 memory uses POD12 drivers but with the same driver strength (34 Ω/48 Ω) for pull-down (RonPd) and pull-up (RonPu). The term POD in DDR4 referring only for termination type that is only parallel pull-up w/o the pull-down termination at the far end. The reference point (VREF) for the input is not half-supply as was in DDR3 and may be higher.|$|E

50|$|The {{hardware}} utilized are RS-485 transceivers {{wired for}} open collector operation {{through the use}} of a <b>pullup</b> and pulldown of the separate data lines. Transmission is accomplished by controlling the driver enable pin of the transceiver. This method allows multiple devices to share the bus without the need for a single master node. Collisions are avoided by monitoring the bus while transmitting the MID to ensure that another node has not simultaneously transmitted a MID with a higher priority.|$|E

40|$|A {{flight test}} {{maneuver}} autopilot (FTMAP) {{is currently being}} flown to increase {{the quality and quantity}} of the data obtained in the flight testing of the highly maneuverable aircraft technology (HiMAT) remotely piloted research vehicle (RPRV). The FTMAP resides in a ground-based digital computer and was designed to perform certain prescribed maneuvers precisely, while maintaining critical flight parameters within close tolerances. The FTMAP operates as a non-flight-critical outer loop controller and augments the vehicle primary flight control system. The inputs to the FTMAP consist of telemetry-downlinked aircraft sensor data. During FTMAP operation, the FTMAP computer replaces normal pilot inputs to the aircraft stick and throttle positions. The FTMAP maneuvers include straight-and-level flight, level accelerations and decelerations, pushover <b>pullups,</b> and windup turns. The pushover <b>pullups</b> can be executed holding throttle or Mach number fixed. The windup turns can be commanded by either normal acceleration or angle of attack. The operational procedures, control mode configuration, and initial simulation results are discussed...|$|R
