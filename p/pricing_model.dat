5|$|Depression Quest is a 2013 {{interactive}} fiction game {{dealing with}} the subject of depression. It was developed by Zoë Quinn using the Twine engine, with writing by Patrick Lindsey and music by Isaac Schankler. It was first released for the web on February 14, 2013, and for Steam on August 11, 2014. The game {{tells the story of}} a person suffering from depression and their attempts to deal with their affliction. It was created to foster greater understanding about depression. Depression Quest can be played for free, and has a pay-what-you-want <b>pricing</b> <b>model.</b> The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline receives part of the proceeds.|$|E

In 2002, Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, experimented with yield management for frequent loyalty card passengers.

Based on those <b>price</b> <b>models,</b> investigation was performed to study the impacts of different components in <b>price</b> <b>models</b> on customers’ cost. The result shows that customers with flatter consumption profiles can benefit from the <b>price</b> <b>model</b> that has a higher share of load demand component and use consumers’ real-time consumption data for charging. On the contrary, when a <b>price</b> <b>model</b> that has a higher share of energy component is adopted, customers with flatter consumption profiles may experience {{an increase in the}} cost. ...|$|R

25|$|Uber fares {{are based}} on a dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>model,</b> in which fares are higher during periods of high demand for rides. The same route costs {{different}} amounts at different times as a result of factors such as the supply and demand for Uber drivers at the time the ride is requested. When rides are in high demand in a certain area and there are not enough drivers in such area, Uber fares increase to get more drivers to that area and to reduce demand for rides in that area. The rate quoted to the rider will reflect such dynamic pricing.|$|E

Additionally, the possible impacts of financial crises and business conditions on forecast performance of GARCH option <b>pricing</b> <b>models</b> are examined as well. The empirical results demonstrate that market momentum has impacts on forecast performance of GARCH option <b>pricing</b> <b>models.</b> In particular, the EGARCH model performs better in downward market momentum while the standard GARCH performs better in upward market momentum. Further, parsimonious models generally perform {{much better than}} richly parameterized models. The findings above are robust to financial crises.

40|$|In Sweden {{there has}} been a move towards more cost {{reflective}} <b>price</b> <b>models</b> for district heating in order to reduce economic risks that comes with variable heat demand and high shares of fixed assets. The keywords in the new <b>price</b> <b>models</b> are higher shares of fixed cost, seasonal energy prices and charging for capacity. Also components that are meant to serve as incentives to affect behaviour are introduced, for example peak load components and flow components. In this study customer responses to these more complex <b>price</b> <b>models</b> have been investigated through focus group interviews and through interviews with companies that have changed their <b>price</b> <b>models.</b> The results show that several important customer requirements are suffering with the new <b>price</b> <b>models.</b> The most important ones are when energy savings do not provide financial savings, when costs are hard to predict and are perceived to be out of control. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{equations}} used {{to model}} the option are often expressed as partial differential equations (see for example Black–Scholes equation). Once expressed in this form, a finite difference model can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: explicit finite difference, implicit finite difference and the Crank-Nicholson method. A trinomial tree option <b>pricing</b> <b>model</b> can {{be shown to be}} a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs– for example dividend yield, risk free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these– that are not tractable in closed form.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{following}} the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed {{the original version}} of the binomial options <b>pricing</b> <b>model.</b> It models {{the dynamics of the}} option's theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the option's life. The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the Black–Scholes model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black–Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.|$|E

40|$|The hedonic <b>price</b> <b>model,</b> {{derived from}} Lancaster's (1966) {{consumer}} theory and Rosen's theoretical (1974) model, {{has been used}} extensively in the scientific investigation of various aspects of housing markets. This paper reviews {{the literature on the}} application of the hedonic <b>price</b> <b>model.</b> Theoretical background, major empirical issues, inherent limitations, and advantages are discussed. The applicability of the model to the housing market is critically examined. Previous empirical studies of the effects of locational, structural, and neighborhood-related housing attributes on property prices are identified and reviewed. A list of common housing attributes used in the estimation of the hedonic <b>price</b> <b>models</b> and their effects on housing prices are identified. Although the set of prices influencing characteristics is different across different markets, and the variables included in the hedonic <b>price</b> <b>model</b> are also constrained by the availability of data, this list should serve as a useful basic checklist for the application of the hedonic <b>price</b> <b>model</b> in different markets. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{describe}} how the biggest Swedish taxi company (Taxi Kurir) developed an innovative <b>price</b> <b>model</b> to leverage the business model. Design/methodology/approach : The empirical data in the article describe Taxi Kurir’s {{development of a new}} <b>price</b> <b>model.</b> Data about the Swedish taxi market and about Taxi Kurir has been compiled though interviews and document studies. Detailed information about the background, development and implementation of Taxi Kurir’s new <b>price</b> <b>model</b> has been captured through interviews with representatives from Taxi Kurir. Findings : Based on both the empirical example, and other investigations, we have found that a company can create substantial changes in their <b>price</b> <b>model,</b> by just changing some of its basic characteristics. A well designed <b>price</b> <b>model</b> can contribute to leveraging the intentions of the business model. Practical implications : Most academic and practical texts about business <b>models</b> consider <b>pricing</b> to be an important component. However, they typically do not refer to the specifics of the price- or revenue models. According to the literature review in this paper, and the empirical findings, the configuration of a company’s <b>price</b> <b>model</b> should be aligned with its business model. This will contribute to leveraging the business model. Originality/value: The Swedish taxi market {{is one of the most}} deregulated in the world. Differently from most other countries, any individual or company can start and operate a taxi business. This case offers a unique description on how the biggest company in the market responded to the competition by introducing a fundamentally new <b>price</b> <b>model,</b> by making a small change in one of the dimensions in their existing <b>price</b> <b>model...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ghosh's 'supply-driven' {{input-output}} {{model is}} a well-known alternative for Leontief's traditional 'demand-driven' input-output model. The Ghosh model calculates changes in gross sectoral outputs for exogenously specified changes in the sectoral inputs of primary factors. Typically, the model is interpreted so as to describe physical output changes as caused by changes in the physical inputs of primary factors. It has been convincingly argued, however, that this interpretation in terms of quantities is implausible. In the present paper it is shown that the supply-driven input-output model becomes plausible, once it is interpreted as a <b>price</b> <b>model.</b> That is, sectoral output values change due to price changes, which are caused by price changes for the primary inputs. Therefore the term Ghosh <b>price</b> <b>model</b> is adopted for the supply-driven model, whereas the demand-driven model {{is referred to as}} the Leontief quantity model. Dual to this Leontief quantity model is the standard Leontief <b>price</b> <b>model.</b> It is shown that the results obtained by the two <b>price</b> <b>models</b> are equivalent. Interpreting the supply-driven input-output <b>model</b> as a <b>price</b> <b>model</b> also allows for a meaningful interpretation of the inverse matrix in terms of multipliers.
