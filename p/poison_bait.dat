The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting <b>poison</b> <b>bait</b> for rats around the now exposed nest sites.

500|$|In {{the western}} Palaearctic, there is {{evidence}} of population decline, but at a level below the threshold required for global conservation concern (i.e., a reduction in numbers of more than 30% in ten years or three generations) and the IUCN Red List categorises this species as of [...] "Least Concern". In Great Britain and the Netherlands, there has been a more than 50% decline in population and the song thrush is included in regional Red Lists. The decreases are greatest in farmlands (73% since the mid-1970s) and believed to be due to changes in agricultural practices in recent decades. The precise reasons for the decline are not known but {{may be related to the}} loss of hedgerows, a move to sowing crops in autumn rather than spring, and possibly the increased use of pesticides. These changes may have reduced the availability of food and of nest sites. In gardens, the use of <b>poison</b> <b>bait</b> to control slugs and snails may pose a threat and in urban areas, some thrushes are killed while using the hard surface of roads to smash snails.|$|E
2500|$|Achatina fulica {{and other}} Achatina species, giant African snails. They can {{grow up to}} 326mm (1ft ¾ in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was {{purposely}} introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, {{it is a serious}} agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like <b>poison</b> <b>bait</b> causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate Achatina. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails. However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant [...] "tiger stripes" [...] on their shells.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Damage by Belding's ground {{squirrel}} (Spermophilus beldingi) to alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and the efficacies of various poisoning regimes to reduce damage were evaluated during March-July, 1976 and 1977. Regimes examined {{were designed to}} measure the effect of 3 variables on damage to alfalfa caused by squirrels including; timing of application, in early or late spring; the number of applications, 1 or 2; and {{the inclusion of a}} border strip around the field on which <b>poison</b> <b>baits</b> are also applied. Neither single nor multiple applications of <b>poisoned</b> <b>baits</b> resulted in significant (P > 0. 1) control of {{ground squirrel}} damage to alfalfa in 1976. However, significant (P < 0. 05) reductions of damage were obtained in 1977 with multiple applications and when both the field and a 60 m wide border were treated with <b>poisoned</b> <b>baits.</b> Belding’s ground squirrels caused an average of 46 percent loss of the first harvest of alfalfa in untreated fields. Maximum application of <b>poisoned</b> <b>baits</b> reduced this loss to an average loss of 25 percent. Control of ground squirrel damage achieved between different fields and treatments was highly variable, and was directly related to the number of times poison was applied and whether or not a border strip was treated...|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} nesting {{behavior}} and presence of numerous queens in each colony, {{it is generally}} impractical to spray Argentine ants with pesticides or to use boiling water as with mound building ants. Spraying with pesticides has occasionally stimulated increased egg-laying by the queens, compounding the problem. Pest control usually requires exploiting their omnivorous dietary habits, through use of slow-acting <b>poison</b> <b>bait</b> (e.g. fipronil, hydramethylnon sulfuramid), which will be carried back to the nest by the workers, eventually killing all the individuals, including the queens. It may take four to five days to eradicate a colony in this manner.|$|E

All data were gathered by a passive surveillance system based on voluntary reporting, which became mandatory in 2009 after a decree of the Italian Ministry of Health had come into force. This prohibited the use and detention of <b>poisoned</b> <b>baits</b> and ordered to selected institutions and professionals to carry out standardized surveys to assess suspect and/or confirmed reported cases; all the necessary anatomopathological and toxicological investigations to confirm the reported cases were then performed for free by public veterinary health institutes whenever a veterinarian diagnosis or clinical suspicion were provided.

5000|$|Rodents are {{somewhat}} {{more susceptible to}} high doses than other species, and cholecalciferol {{has been used in}} <b>poison</b> <b>bait</b> for the control of these pests. It has been claimed that the compound is less toxic to non-target species. However, in practice it has been found that use of cholecalciferol in rodenticides represents a significant hazard to other animals, such as dogs and cats. [...] "Cholecalciferol produces hypercalcemia, which results in systemic calcification of soft tissue, leading to renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, hypertension, CNS depression, and GI upset. Signs generally develop within 18-36 hr of ingestion and can include depression, anorexia, polyuria, and polydipsia." ...|$|E
50|$|Poison shyness, {{also called}} {{conditioned}} food aversion, {{refers to the}} avoidance of a toxic substance by an animal that has previously ingested that substance. Animals learn an association between stimulus characteristics, usually the taste or odor, of a toxic substance and the illness it produces; this allows them to detect and avoid the substance. Poison shyness occurs as an evolutionary adaptation in many animals, most prominently in generalists that feed on many different materials. It is often called bait shyness when it occurs during attempts at pest control of insects and animals. If the pest ingests the <b>poison</b> <b>bait</b> at sublethal doses, it typically detects and avoids the bait, rendering the bait ineffective.|$|E

50|$|Feral cats {{have proven}} more {{difficult}} to completely remove from islands. Of the 48 islands feral cats have been completely removed from in the past half century, only 10 have been on islands larger than 10km2.

5000|$|After New York City {{was banned}} by the courts in 1922 from ocean dumping of garbage, much of it ended up on Rikers Island, even though the island already had 12 {{mountains}} of garbage 40 to 130 feet tall; still, it took in 1.5 million cubic yards of additional refuse, more than the amount of dirt displaced by {{the building of the}} World Trade Center. Since much of the garbage was composed of ash from coal heating and incinerators, there were frequent spontaneous phosphorescent fires, even in the wintertime, in the snow. One warden described it in 1934: [...] "At night it is like a forest of Christmas trees - first one little light ... then another, until the whole hillside is lit up with little fires. ...

[...] The island was also plagued with rats, which at one point were so prevalent that after [...] "poison gas, <b>poison</b> <b>bait,</b> ferocious dogs and pigs" [...] failed to control them, one New Yorker tried to organize a hunting party to kill them off.
