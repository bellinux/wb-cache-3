Neonatal tetanus deaths have decreased globally from 200, 000 in 2000 to 49, 000 in 2013. This is the result of increased immunization coverage with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines among pregnant women, improved access to skilled birth attendance during delivery, and targeted campaigns with these vaccines for women of reproductive age in high-risk areas. In the process, inequities have been reduced, private–public partnerships fostered, and innovations triggered. However, lack of funding, poor accessibility to some areas, suboptimal surveillance, and a perceived low priority for the disease are among the main obstacles. To ensure MNT elimination is sustained, countries must build and maintain strong routine programs that reach people with vaccination and with clean deliveries. This should also be an opportunity to shift programs into preventing tetanus among all people. Regular assessments, and where needed appropriate action, are key to prevent increases in MNT incidence over time, especially in areas that are at higher risk. The main objective of the paper is to provide a detailed update on the progress toward MNT elimination between 1999 and 2014. It elaborates on the challenges and opportunities, and discusses how MNT elimination can be sustained and to shift the program to protect wider populations against tetanus.

40|$|Arrest of premeiotic S phase by high {{temperature}} and light causes the meiotic cell cycle {{time to become}} shortened by 4 h after release of the arrest. Genetical and cytological evidence shows that diplotene is drastically reduced from 4 - 5 h to less than 1 h. Cycloheximide (50 fig/ml) treatment of early and late diplotene cells in normal cultures prevents the meiotic divisions even though the chromosomes are condensed. The same treatment given within 1 h of meta-phase I allows both divisions to be completed but fails to allow sporulation. This is interpreted to mean that the cellular <b>programme</b> for meiotic <b>division</b> (<b>division</b> <b>programme)</b> is made during diplotene. In the arrest-release cultures, however, the <b>division</b> <b>programme</b> is made during pachytene. This finding is interpreted to mean that the cellular programme in meiosis is prepared {{one step at a}} time. When the nuclear cycle is arrested, the cytoplasmic programmes continue. As a result, the <b>division</b> <b>programme</b> is precociously induced at pachytene. Since the diplotene programme is complete, the cells proceed directly from pachytene into metaphase I with the diplotene stage drastically reduced. Cold treatment at 5 °C at pachytene temporarily suspends the progress of meiosis and hence prolongs the pachytene stage. This prolongation causes an increase in recombination frequency. This finding supports the argument that recombination frequency is a function of time...|$|R
