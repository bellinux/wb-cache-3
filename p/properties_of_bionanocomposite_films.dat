Consequently, the tensile modulus and tensile strength of CMC film increased by 60 and 47 %, respectively, in the <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> with 10 wt% of NC, and decrease by 8. 6 % for WVP with the same content of NC.

In this study, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) bionanocomposites were prepared using the solution casting technique, by incorporating the PLA with the CNW obtained from an oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed no significant changes in the PLA peak positions, which indicates that incorporating the CNW into the PLA did not result in any significant changes in the chemical structure of the PLA. Thermogravimetric analysis, on the other hand, revealed that the bionanocomposites (PLA-CNW) had better thermal stability than the pure PLA. The tensile strength of PLA-CNW increased by 84 % with the addition of 3 parts of CNW per hundred resins (phr), and decreased thereafter. Moreover, a linear relationship was observed between the Young's modulus and CNW loading. Elongation at break, however, decreased with the addition of 1 -phr CNW, and remained constant with further addition. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that agglomeration of CNW occurred at 5 -phr loading, consistent with the tensile strength results. Overall, the CNW obtained from OPEFB can enhance the tensile and the thermal <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The present work {{shows the}} role of MMT in {{physical}} <b>properties</b> and biodegradation <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites.</b> An increase in the Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was observed when 1 - 5 % (w/w) of MMT {{was added to the}} PVA/S/CMC. With the increase of the MMT concentration from 0 t o 5 %, the UTS increased 5 from 18.36 to 20.38 MPa, however, the strain to break (SB) decreased noticeably from 35.56 to 5.22 %. The MMT content significantly impacted on the rate of starch solubilistion. The decrease of the degradation rate observed in the final stage can be explained to the lower degradability of the MMT-PVA-CMC domains that remain in the material. After 8 – 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers. The water uptake ability of blends was decreased significantly as the MMT percentage increased from 0 to 5 % (W/W). At the level of 5 % (W/W) MMT, the films showed the lowest WAC% values and DED% decreased from 27.69 μg/ml h for the film without MMT to 18.95 μg/ml h for that containing 5 % MMT. Based on these results, the PVA:S:CMC:MMT <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> show better physicochemical properties than PVA:S:CMC films and they can be potentially replaced of PVA:S:CMC films.|$|R

The sodium montmorillonite clay content significantly impacted on the rate of CMC solubilization.

After 4 to 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero, as no saccharides and other compounds leached to the solution, as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers.

In the present review we introduce recent results from sepiolite- and palygorskite-based bionanocomposites showing the interest of these silicates compared to lamellar clays for diverse applications such as bioplastics and membranes, uses in biomedicine as drug delivery systems and adjuvants of vaccines as well as in tissue engineering. Other applications here discussed focus on environmental purposes, the use <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites</b> as components <b>of</b> sensor devices and bioreactors and as source of supported graphene...|$|R
40|$|Packaging {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} technological steps of food preservation. Microbial growth and oxidation reactions occurring on food surface are two of the main causes of deterioration of fresh and processed food products. Traditional food packaging generally protect foodstuff from external influences. Whereas active packaging systems interact with the food permitting the extension of their shelf-life and the maintenance, or even the improvement of their quality and sensorial features. The main objective of this thesis is the attainment of knowledge related to the development of new material formulations for food packaging by using suitably modified inorganic nanoparticles in order to obtain a controlled release system of active substances and to improve active film physical and gas barrier performances. As far as antioxidant active films is concerned, the aim of the work is the development of innovative films containing natural -tocopherol adsorbed onto functionalised and not functionalised mesoporous silica particles (SBA- 15; SBA- 15 +APTES) in order to protect it during LDPE film manufacture and to be able to control its release rate. The synthesized mesoporous powders were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and N 2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K. Powders loaded with tocopherol were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Results show that the maximum of the pore size distribution reduces from 90 Å for purely siliceous SBA- 15 to 73 Å for amino-functionalized SBA- 15. Infrared analysis shows that tocopherol interacts with the amino groups of functionalized SBA- 15. It has been also proven that circa 40 % and 30 % of tocopherol is loaded into SBA- 15 and SBA- 15 +APTES respectively. Release tests performed using 96 % v/v ethanol as fatty food stimulant show that the tocopherol diffusivity of films containing functionalized mesoporous silica decreased of about 50 % with respect to films containing free tocopherol, as. This is due to the decrease in the pore size and to the increase in diffusion resistance caused by the functionalization of the internal pore walls with the amino groups. Moreover, the oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) assay of the produced active polymer films proved the antioxidant effectiveness of tocopherol released from samples after manufacturing process. As far as antimicrobial activity is concerned, silver montmorillonite clays have been increasingly investigated as germicidal, bactericidal, antifungal, and antiseptic components in different food packaging formulation. The aim of this thesis is the development of a new class of antimicrobial systems in which the inorganic phyllosilicate clays (MMT) have been used as support for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The Ag-MMT filler consists of nanometric metallic silver and oxides particles (size in the range 2 - 40 nm) preferentially located on the surface of MMT single lamellae as the UV adsorption and FT-IR spectra showed. Antimicrobial bionanocomposites have been obtained by solution casting of AgMMT particles into chitosan, one of the most interesting biopolymers obtained from natural sources. The combined effect of glycerol and AgMMT particles on the thermal, structural and barrier <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the obtained <b>bionanocomposites</b> was investigated. In fact, the plasticizer and the silver ions as well as the surface of metallic particles exert a combined effect which allows a reduction of the liquid water uptake and water permeability with respect to neat chitosan. Indeed, X. Ray results revealed that Ag-MMT particles result partially intercalated by chitosan macromolecules although it cannot be excluded in such an extent the exfoliation due to the collapse of MMT structure during the preparation of the active filler. Moreover, considering that the antibacterial mechanism of silver is mainly related to the action of silver ions and metallic AgNPs, the silver release kinetics from bionanocomposites in water at 25 °C were also investigated. In conclusion, samples of purely siliceous and amino-functionalized SBA- 15 mesoporous silica were successfully used as α-tocopherol carriers for the production of active LDPE polymer films. In fact, active polymer films containing the functionalized carrier showed a slower tocopherol release when compared to samples containing free tocopherol and tocopherol loaded onto purely siliceous substrate. Whereas, for antimicrobial active film,. the silver supporting nanoparticles, Ag-MMT, contribute to modulate the release kinetics of silver ions from <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> over a longer time interval (up to 20 days). This is of paramount importance for the production of active films to be used as food packaging materials or potentially as biomaterials...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest to}} develop eco-benign {{polymeric}} hybrid materials arose {{out of the}} need to protect the environment from the harmful effects of synthetic petroleum polymeric waste and meet the specific needs of industries such as oil and gas, aerospace, automotives, packaging, electronics biomedicals, pharmaceuticals, agricultural, and construction. This has resulted in synergistic hybrid assembling of natural fibers, polymers, biopolymers, and nanoparticles. Bionanocomposites based on inorganic nanoparticle reinforced biofiber, polymers and biopolymers, and polysaccharides such as chitosan, alginate, and cellulose derivatives, and so on, exhibiting at least a dimension at the nanometer scale, are an emerging group of nanostructured hybrid materials. These hybrid bionanocomposites exhibit structural and multifunctional properties suitable for versatile applications similar to polymer nanocomposites.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the functions of polymers and size of nanoparticles on the antibacterial activity <b>of</b> silver <b>bionanocomposites</b> (Ag BNCs). In this research, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were incorporated into biodegradable polymers that are chitosan, gelatin and both polymers via chemical reduction method in solvent in order to produce Ag BNCs. Silver nitrate and sodium borohydride were employed as a metal precursor and reducing agent respectively. On the other hand, chitosan and gelatin were added as a polymeric matrix and stabilizer. The antibacterial activity of different sizes of silver nanoparticles was investigated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the disk diffusion method using Mueller-Hinton Agar. Results The <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> Ag BNCs were studied as a function of the polymer weight ratio in relation to the use of chitosan and gelatin. The morphology of the Ag BNCs films and the distribution of the Ag NPs were also characterized. The diameters of the Ag NPs were measured and their size is less than 20 nm. The antibacterial trait <b>of</b> silver/chitosan/gelatin <b>bionanocomposites</b> was investigated. The silver ions released from the Ag BNCs and their antibacterial activities were scrutinized. The antibacterial activities of the Ag BNC films were examined against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (S. aureus and M. luteus) by diffusion method using Muller-Hinton agar. Conclusions The antibacterial activity of Ag NPs with size less than 20 nm was demonstrated and showed positive results against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The Ag NPs stabilized well in the polymers matrix. </p...|$|R

During synthesis, GOx molecules interact with Pd salt leading to metal ion and FAD reduction probably via the thiol group of the cysteine 521 residue. for the growing of PdNPs, formic acid was necessary as a co-adjuvant reducing agent. Besides the contribution for the redox processes, GOx is also necessary for the NP stability preventing the formation of precipitates resulted from uncontrolled growing of NPs Cyclic voltammetry of the GOx-PdNPs demonstrated electroactivity <b>of</b> the <b>bionanocomposite</b> immobilized on ITO (indium-tin oxide) electrode surface and also the NP is partially blocked due to strong interaction GOx and the surface of PdNPs.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The development <b>of</b> three novel <b>bionanocomposite</b> scaffolds is presented in this dissertation. These scaffold materials are comprised of amine-functionalized nanomaterials crosslinked to the extracellular matrix (ECM) component of a porcine diaphragm tendon. On its own, the ECM is an ideal scaffold material with the structure and properties needed to support cellular attachment and tissue ingrowth. Nanomaterials were utilized to improve the physicochemical <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> the ECM while also influencing cellular behavior through a nanostructured surface. A full characterization <b>of</b> the <b>bionanocomposite</b> scaffolds was accomplished through a variety of common materials characterization techniques. Several biocompatibility studies were also performed including both in vitro studies using flow cytometry and bioreactors, as well as in vivo studies involving rodent and porcine models.
