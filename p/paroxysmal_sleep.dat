40|$|ABSTRACT – Paroxysmal motor {{phenomena}} and arousals during sleep are frequent. The differential diagnoses between benign hypnic transient events, epileptic and non-epileptic seizures represent a common clinical problem. Video-EEG monitoring during sleep, recording several episodes {{in the same}} patient, is essential in order to characterize these phenomena. It offers the possibility to compare electro-clinical data, to demonstrate the eventual stereo-typed pattern of motor {{phenomena and}} their progression in time, and to study EEG-polygraphic correlates. The recently described double split-screen syn-chronized display (DSSSD) technique represents {{a useful tool for}} comparing particular clinical patterns of epileptic seizures when dealing with complex, hypermotor phenomena observed in frontal lobe epilepsy. We reviewed the data of 24 patients admitted during a two-year period (2002 - 2003) to our epilepsy sleep unit for isolated <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>sleep</b> motor events. Four patients presented with very brief paroxysmal arousals without daytime fits. Three of our patients presented isolated paroxysmal arousals, whereas in one, the event...|$|E

Summary: This report describes a case of first-onset narcolepsy in a six-year-old female that was misdiagnosed as atypical epilepsy and other diagnoses at eight different hospitals over a period of 10 months before the correct diagnosis was made. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is more difficult in children because very few of them experience all four cardinal symptoms of narcolepsy – <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>sleep,</b> cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucination, and sleep paralysis – and they often have a more prolonged onset and diverse symptoms. To decrease the time lag between initial presentation and accurate diagnosis, we recommend that in all cases in which children report excessive sleep of unknown etiology – regardless of the associated symptoms – that sleep monitoring and sleep latency tests be conducted to rule out the possibility of narcolepsy. The case highlights the wide variety of presentations of uncommon psychiatric conditions, particularly in children, and the need for clinicians {{to be aware of the}} atypical presentations of these conditions when collecting medical histories...|$|E
40|$|Children with {{cerebral}} palsy associated with periventricular leukomalacia frequently develop unprovoked epileptic seizures, with a reported incidence of 16. 0 % to 47 %. Recently cases with early thalamic injury associated with continuous spike-waves during slow sleep syndrome (CSWSS) have been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate in a population of patients with a periventricular leukomalacia the presence of an activation of <b>paroxysmal</b> activities during <b>sleep</b> and their electroclinical characteristics...|$|R
40|$|After having {{reported}} continuous localized EEG discharge during slow sleep (CLEDS) in {{six children}} with congenital encephalopathy, we observed a similar EEG picture in six children free from both neuropsychological and neuroradiological defects. They suffered from partial idiopathic epilepsy; five presented a familial disposition towards febrile seizures. Continuous <b>paroxysmal</b> activity during <b>sleep</b> was observed from 4. 8 yrs to 4. 11 yrs (mean age: 4. 9 yrs). Spontaneous remission of CLEDS {{was observed in}} three cases after 2 - 25 months, but one or more relapses occurred in two cases, and five children are still suffering from CLEDS. Seizures were controlled by drugs in all cases. Deterioration of intelligence level, although not severe, was observed in one case, after 24 months of CLEDS...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} neurophysiological {{features}} of five patients (age range: 4 - 20 years) suffering from Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (CNsI) {{by means of}} multimodal (brainstem, somatosensory, motor) evoked potentials and periodic EEG-polygraphic recordings (follow-up: 3 months- 4. 5 years). Two patients presented with neurological disturbances, consisting mainly of mental slowing, motor impairment and seizures. Both of them presented an abnormal EEG, characterized by slowing of background activity associated with paroxysmal discharges. Liver transplantation was performed {{in one of these}} two patients and was followed by improvement of both the neurological picture and EEG activity. In a third patient, clinically normal, after two years of follow-up, the EEG started to show <b>paroxysmal</b> activity during <b>sleep</b> or when evoked by intermittent photic stimulation. In these three patients, multimodal evoked potentials were unremarkable. The remaining two younger subjects did not show any clinical or EEG abnormality. Our findings suggest that, whereas in newborns and infants evoked potentials have been demonstrated as reliable techniques to monitor bilirubin neurotoxicity, in children and adolescents with CNsI, EEG seems to be more sensitive in evaluating patients for neurological damage and effectiveness of therapeutic strategies adopted...|$|R
40|$|Study Objectives: Sleep {{breathing}} disorders may trigger <b>paroxysmal</b> events during <b>sleep</b> such as parasomnias and may exacerbate preexisting seizures. We verified {{the hypothesis}} that the amount of EEG paroxysmal activity (PA) may be high in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Design: Prospective study Settings: Sleep unit of an academic center. Participants: Polysomnographic studies were performed in a population of children recruited prospectively, for suspected OSAS, from January to December 2007, with no previous history of epileptic seizures or any other medical conditions. All sleep studies included 8 EEG channels, including centrotemporal leads. We collected data about clinical and respiratory parameters of children with OSAS and with primary snoring, then we performed sleep microstructure analysis in 2 OSAS subgroups, matched for age and sex, with and without paroxysmal activity. Measurements and Results: We found 40 children who met the criteria for primary snoring, none of them showed PA, while 127 children met the criteria for OSAS and 18 of them (14. 2 %) showed PA. Children with PA were older, had a predominance of boys, a longer duration of OSAS, and a lower percentage of adenotonsillar hypertrophy than children without PA. Moreover, PA occurred over the centrotemporal regions in 9 cases, over temporal-occipital regions in 5, and over frontocentral regions in 4. Children with PA showed a lower percentage of REM sleep, a lower CAP rate and lower A 1 index during slow wave sleep, and lower total A 2 and arousal index than children without EEG abnormalities. Conclusions: We found a higher percentage of paroxysmal activity in children with OSAS, compared to children with primary snoring, who did not exhibit EEG abnormalities. The children with paroxysmal activity have peculiar clinical and sleep microstructure characteristics that may have implications in the neurocognitive outcome of OSAS...|$|R
