5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy into <b>political</b> <b>action.</b> Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, <b>political</b> <b>action</b> required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Focusing on {{an ongoing}} grass-roots {{campaign}} of rural women in North India, this article examines how feminist activists strategically use and create social spaces to generate collective dialogue and critical reection on issues of patriarchy and violence. The author highlights {{the ways in which}} grass-roots activists theorize the interrelationships among their own <b>political</b> <b>actions,</b> their visions of empowerment, and the everyday gendered spaces they seek to transform. The article demonstrates how a serious engagement with social spaces in grass-roots activism can enable us to overcome the conceptual gaps in feminist theorizations of empowerment and violence, and to apprehend more adequately the nature, content, and meanings of women’s <b>political</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R
