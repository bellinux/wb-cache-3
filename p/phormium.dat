25|$|Whangamarino {{is located}} within the rohe (area) of the Waikato-Tainui iwi (tribe) and is {{considered}} a taonga (treasure) by local hapū. Early Māori utilised the wetland {{as a source of}} eel/tuna and birds for food, and flax/harakeke (<b>Phormium</b> tenax) for traditional cultural purposes. The rivers of the wetland were used for travel and recreation and the peat margins were used to preserve taonga such as waka, tools and weapons. Dense vegetation inhibited further use of the wetland, although it was used as a sanctuary during times of war.|$|E

25|$|Although feeding moa {{were never}} {{observed}} by scientists, their diet has been deduced from fossilised contents of their gizzards and coprolites, {{as well as}} indirectly through morphological analysis of skull and beak, and stable isotope analysis of their bones. Moa fed {{on a range of}} plant species and plant parts, including fibrous twigs and leaves taken from low trees and shrubs. The beak of Pachyornis elephantopus was analogous to a pair of secateurs, and was able to clip the fibrous leaves of New Zealand flax (<b>Phormium</b> tenax) and twigs up to at least 8mm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Other {{regional}} {{products are}} wicker baskets {{and pieces of}} furniture. The cultivation of osier (salix sp), which is native to European and Asiancold and temperate regions, was proposed by Sarmiento because it can resist floods. Another plant that adapts to floodable lands is New Zealand flax (<b>phormium</b> tenax), which was industrialised as from 1925 and is used in containers, burlap, cords, threads, runners and mats. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, the competence with synthetic fibres made New Zealand flax plantations anti-economic. Fishing and coypu breeding are other economic activities that are no longer attractive.|$|E

2500|$|Wellswood and the Lincombes {{were built}} up by wealthy Victorians who, {{influenced}} by their travels around the Mediterranean, built large villas with Italianate features and towers. There are many pine trees, Bay bushes and trees (Laurus nobilis), various palm tree species and <b>Phormiums.</b> Cabbage trees or [...] "Torbay Palms" [...] are a notable feature of the area; the trees were introduced into the area from New Zealand in 1820 and since then have flourished. The vegetation gives Torquay a look of a more exotic climate than its high latitude cool oceanic location.|$|R
5000|$|This mammoth {{undertaking}} commenced in 2012 - {{the garden}} being gradually converted {{from a small}} unused field attached to the house. It now a designed suite of 'rooms': Fishpond; Waterfall; Wetland; Orchard; Beach; Vegetable parterre garden; Urn Garden; Moorish courtyard; Herbarium; Butterfly garden; Woodland; Cottage garden; Tropical garden; and also various collections (Grasses, Conifers, Dianthus, Heathers, Fuchsias, Roses, <b>Phormiums,</b> Begonias, Acers, Coastal) all being separated by sections of lawns, hedges, low walls of brick and cotswold stone, large wooden archways, pergolas, arbours, and paths. Another feature are life size statues of ancient Greek deities and mythological creatures. There are over 23 separate seating areas, 5 patio areas, and 12 free-standing fountains.|$|R
60|$|In {{the case}} of plants, the power of {{increase}} is even greater and its effects more distinctly visible. Hundreds of square miles of the plains of La Plata are now covered {{with two or three}} species of European thistle, often to the exclusion of almost every other plant; but in the native countries of these thistles they occupy, except in cultivated or waste ground, a very subordinate part in the vegetation. Some American plants, like the cotton-weed (Asclepias cuiussayica), have now become common weeds over {{a large portion of the}} tropics. White clover (Trifolium repens) spreads over all the temperate regions of the world, and in New Zealand is exterminating many native species, including even the native flax (<b>Phormium</b> tenax), a large plant with iris-like leaves 5 or 6 feet high. Mr. W.L. Travers has paid much attention to the effects of introduced plants in New Zealand, and notes the following species as being especially remarkable. The common knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare) grows most luxuriantly, single plants covering a space 4 or 5 feet in diameter, and sending their roots 3 or 4 feet deep. A large sub-aquatic dock (Rumex obtusifolius) abounds in every river-bed, even far up among the mountains. The common sow-thistle (Sonchus oleraceus) grows all over the country up to an elevation of 6000 feet. The water-cress (Nasturtium officinale) grows with amazing vigour in many of the rivers, forming stems 12 feet long and 3/4 inch in diameter, and completely choking them up. It cost £300 a year to keep the Avon at Christchurch free from it. The sorrel (Rumex acetosella) covers hundreds of acres with a sheet of red. It forms a dense mat, exterminating other plants, and preventing cultivation. It can, however, be itself exterminated by sowing the ground with red clover, which will also vanquish the Polygonum aviculare. The most noxious weed in New Zealand appears, however, to be the Hypochaeris radicata, a coarse yellow-flowered composite not uncommon in our meadows and waste places. This has been introduced with grass seeds from England, and is very destructive. It is stated that excellent pasture was in three years destroyed by this weed, which absolutely displaced every other plant on the ground. It grows in every kind of soil, and is said even to drive out the white clover, which is usually so powerful in taking possession of the soil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phormium</b> is an {{herbaceous}} perennial monocot. Monocot classification {{has undergone}} significant revision {{in the past}} decade, and recent classification systems (including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group) have found <b>Phormium</b> to be closely related to daylilies (Hemerocallis), placing it in family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Hemerocallidoideae. <b>Phormium</b> formerly belonged to the family Agavaceae and many classification systems still place it there. It includes two species, <b>Phormium</b> colensoi and <b>Phormium</b> tenax. It also includes many cultivars.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phormium</b> colensoi (syn. <b>Phormium</b> cookianum; {{mountain}} flax, lesser New Zealand flax, [...] or wharariki [...] in Māori) is {{a perennial}} plant that {{is native to}} New Zealand. It is less common than the other <b>Phormium</b> species, P. tenax. The greenish, yellow or orange flowers are followed by twisted seed pods.|$|E
5000|$|The {{climate is}} cool temperate. Summers are drier {{than on the}} west coast of Britain, but cooler than southerly areas. Winters are cold at times, {{sometimes}} with snow. The soil is of a dark brown colour, free draining and gritty. It is very good for growing vegetables. Tender perennials are rare; some palms will grow, but need winter protection. Although <b>Phormiums</b> (New Zealand flax) grow in displays in Newbiggin, salt-laden winds may afford them some protection. The most exposed part of the town is to the east. High trees in Hirst Park give considerable shelter. The west part is much more sheltered, especially the wooded valley of the River Wansbeck. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is [...] "Cfb" [...] (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).|$|R
