40|$|Two CAMAC modules {{have been}} {{designed}} to record the time of arrival of up to 32768 sequential events. the system consists of a clock module to generate a gated clock pulse train and a memory module to record event arrival time. Two memory modules can be operated in <b>ping-pong</b> <b>mode</b> to capture a time series of indefinite length, limited only by the capacity of the data acquisition computer storage medium. The maximum clocking frequency of 25 MHz provides a minimum digitization period of 40 ns and an inter-event deadtime of 2 clock cycles. these circuits have been used in a number of experiments {{for a wide variety of}} time measurements. They are particularly suited for interpolating event occurences relative to high precision UTC time signals distributed by satellites. A synchronized output pulse has also been provided to allow an external time-to-digital converter to determine event arrival time relative to the clock phase. This permits time-of-flight measurements over long baselines with a fraction of a nanosecond accuracy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Band 3 -mediated C 1 - {{exchange}} in human {{red blood cells}} and resealed ghosts was measured at 38 °C by the continuous flow tube method. When external C 1 - concentration, C (°), is varied with constant internal C 1 o concentration, C (i), the flux fits a simple Michaelis-Menten saturation curve (MM fit), with KI/ 2 = 3. 8 2 0. 4 mM. When the CI- concentration is varied simultaneously at {{both sides of the}} membrane in resealed ghosts (C (i) = C(o) = C(i = o)), the flux rises toward a flat maximum between 200 and 450 mM C 1 -, and then decreases at very high C li=°). An MM fit to the data with C {i = o / < 500 mM gives KI ~ 2 of 106 + 13 mM; fits including modifier site inhibition (MS fit) give an over threefold higher K~) 2. Despite this uncertainty, the intrinsic asymmetry of unloaded transport sites, A (defined as E{°) /E I~) with C ~) = C °~, where E (i) is the fraction of unloaded inward-facing sites and E ~°) is the fraction of unloaded outward-facing sites), calculated from KIll 2 and KI/° 2, ranges only from 0. 046 to 0. 107. A new method, which uses the initial slope of a plot of C 1 flux versus C ~i- °), gives A values of 0. 023 to 0. 038. Flufenamic acid (FA) inhibits C 1 - exchange by binding to an external site different from the transport site. At 38 °C, FA binds 24 - 36 times more tightly to E ~°) than to E (i). Estimates of A from FA inhibitory potency range from 0. 01 to 0. 05. All methods, including bicarbonate data from the preceding paper, indicate that at 38 °C, like 0 °C, far more band 3 molecules are in the E 0 / than in the E ~°) form. The agreement of various methods supports the ping-pong model for anion exchange, and demonstrates that the intrinsic asymmetry is very slightly, if at all, affected by temperature.

40|$|Recently, {{a team of}} {{scientist}} lead by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{have proposed}} a Ka-band single-pass interferometric mission concept named SIGNAL (SAR for Ice, Glacier aNd globAL Dynamics). SIGNAL main goal is to estimate accurately and repeatedly topography and topographic changes variations associated with mass change or other dynamic effects on glaciers, ice caps and polar ice sheets. To achieve the required elevation accuracy, {{in the order of}} a few decimeter, a formation flying constellation of two compact satellites was proposed as the only way to obtain the desired cross-track baseline. One of the attractive features of Ka-band is the possibility to design relatively compact systems. However, traditional fixed beam designs Ka-band immediately fail to provide either or both the desired sensitivity (due to the small receive antenna) or the required swath. Thus, some form of digital beamforming is a must. In addition, short antennas lead to high azimuth resolution, but also to a narrow unambiguous swath. In previous work this swath limitation was partially solved by proposing a dual-swath solution using beamforming in elevation only, with a relatively large gap between swathes. This approach improves the global mission coverage, but also adds complexity to the processing and geophysical interpretation. An alternative to achieve wider continuous swathes is to use multiple azimuth phase centers. By introducing multiple antennas spaced in the along-track direction, the system immediately gains the capability to acquire along-track interferometric data. Thus, if properly designed, the resulting SAR can be operated in a wide-swath mode, and in a narrower swath ATI mode. In the particular case of SIGNAL, this means that the two-satellite system could be switched between a wide-swath cross-track interferometric mode, and an also wide swath ATI mode, where in this second case the wide swath would be achieved by combining the narrower ATI mode swathed of each of the two satellites. With this, the SIGNAL would gain the capability to accurately measure ocean currents, which would clearly extend the potential scientific user base. The paper will present the proposed enhanced SIGNAL architecture, and describe possible operating modes. Besides the aforementioned wide-swath and ATI-modes, the paper will also discuss <b>ping-pong</b> multi-baseline acquisitions <b>modes</b> exploiting a novel sub-pulses technique in order to keep a low PRF. For all these modes, the SAR performance will be described. Also the final interferometric performance, in terms of relative height errors or of ocean surface velocity errors will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Digital image {{processing}} and compression technologies have significant market potential, especially the JPEG 2000 standard which offers outstanding codestream flexibility and high compression ratio. Strong demand for high performance digital {{image processing}} and compression system solutions is forcing designers to seek proper architectures that offer competitive advantages in terms of all performance metrics, such as speed and power. Traditional architectures such as ASIC, FPGA and DSPs have limitations in either low flexibility or high power consumption. On the other hand, through the provision of a degree of flexibility {{similar to that of}} a DSP and performance and power consumption advantages approaching that of an ASIC, coarse-grained dynamically reconfigurable architectures are proving to be strong candidates for future high performance {{digital image processing}} and compression systems. This thesis investigates dynamically reconfigurable architectures and especially the newly emerging RICA paradigm. Case studies such as Reed- Solomon decoder and WiMAX OFDM timing synchronisation engine are implemented in order to explore the potential of RICA-based architectures and the possible optimisation approaches such as eliminating conditional branches, reducing memory accesses and constructing kernels. Based on investigations in this thesis, a novel customised dynamically reconfigurable architecture targeting digital image processing and compression applications is devised, which can be tailored to adopt different applications. A demosaicing engine based on the Freeman algorithm is designed and implemented on the proposed architecture as the pre-processing module in a digital imaging system. An efficient data buffer rotating scheme is designed with the aim of reducing memory accesses. Meanwhile an investigation targeting mapping the demosaicing engine onto a dual-core RICA platform is performed. After optimisation, the performance of the proposed engine is carefully evaluated and compared in aspects of throughput and consumed computational resources. When targeting the JPEG 2000 standard, the core tasks such as 2 -D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Embedded Block Coding with Optimal Truncation (EBCOT) are implemented and optimised on the proposed architecture. A novel 2 -D DWT architecture based on vector operations associated with RICA paradigm is developed, and the complete DWT application is highly optimised for both throughput and area. For the EBCOT implementation, a novel Partial Parallel Architecture (PPA) for the most computationally intensive module in EBCOT, termed Context Modeling (CM), is devised. Based on the algorithm evaluation, an ARM core is integrated into the proposed architecture for performance enhancement. A <b>Ping-Pong</b> memory switching <b>mode</b> with carefully designed communication scheme between RICA based architecture and ARM is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture for JPEG 2000 offers significant advantage in throughput. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
