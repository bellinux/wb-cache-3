50|$|In 1954 {{while he}} was still a {{graduate}} student, Goto invented the <b>parametron,</b> a circuit element that combined a ferrite core with a capacitor to generate electrical oscillations whose timing could be controlled. This provided an alternative to the vacuum tube technology then in use for building computing devices. He completed the construction of the PC-1, one of the first general-purpose computers built in Japan, in 1958, using parametron-based logic.Soon afterwards, he proposed the Goto pair, a device related to the <b>parametron.</b> Parametrons continued to be used for computing in Japan until the 1960s when they gave way to transistors. The quantum flux <b>parametron</b> is a later improvement of the <b>parametron,</b> also by Goto, that uses superconducting Josephson junctions to improve both the speed and the energy consumption of these devices.|$|E

A prototype parametron-based computer, the PC-1, was built at the University of Tokyo in 1958. <b>Parametrons</b> {{were used in}} early Japanese computers due to being reliable and inexpensive but were ultimately surpassed by transistors {{due to differences in}} speed.|$|R
50|$|Using 519 {{vacuum tubes}} and 5,400 <b>parametrons,</b> the MUSASINO-1 possessed a {{magnetic}} core memory, initially of 32 (later expanded to 256) words. A word {{was composed of}} 40 bits, and two instructions could be stored in a single word. Addition time was clocked at 1,350 microseconds, multiplication at 6,800 microseconds, and division time at 26.1 milliseconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{arithmetic}} {{and control}} circuits of the PC-1 consisted of 4200 <b>parametrons.</b> Binary numbers were coded using the two's complement representation; a short number was coded using 18 bits {{and a long}} one using 36. The single-address instructions were 18 bits long and there were about 20 of them. The memory consisted of 512 short words. The clock frequency was 15 kHz. One addition or subtraction required 4 clock cycles; one multiplication 26 cycles for a short multiplier, or 44 cycles for a long multiplier. Division consumed 161 cycles and a store operation 8. The power consumption was 3 Kw and the floor area required was 8 square meters. The input was done using a photoelectric paper tape reader; the output was provided by a teletype.|$|R

50|$|Hitachi Ltd. (now {{referred}} to as Hitachi), first began research in analog computers in 1951 with digital Computers following in 1956. As a prototype for the <b>parametron</b> logic circuit, the HIPAC-MK-1 was developed. The main transmission lines designed by Tadami power development utilized these as tensiometers. It was then that as <b>Parametron</b> calculators, the HIPAC 101 and HIPAC 103 became commercialized products. Parallel research in transistor computers soon became commercialized as well.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Parametron</b> Computer 1 (PC-1) was a binary, single-address {{computer}} {{developed at}} Professor Hidetosi Takahasi's Laboratory at the Department of Physics, University of Tokyo, {{and was one}} of the first general purpose computers that used <b>parametron</b> components and dual frequency magnetic-core memory.

50|$|Invented by Eiichi Goto at the University of Tokyo, the Quantum Flux <b>Parametron</b> (QFP) is an {{improvement}} over his earlier <b>parametron</b> based digital logic technology. Unlike its predecessor, QFP uses superconducting Josephson junctions on integrated circuits to improve speed and energy efficiency enormously. In some applications, {{the complexity of the}} cryogenic cooling system required is negligible compared to the potential speed gains. While his design makes use of quantum principles, it is not a quantum computer technology, gaining speed only through higher clock speeds. Apart from the speed advantage over traditional CMOS integrated circuit design is that parametrons can be operated with zero energy loss (no local increase in entropy), making reversible computing possible. Low energy use and heat generation is critical in supercomputer design, where thermal load per unit volume {{has become one of the}} main limiting factors.|$|E

The first office computers released in 1961: Casio's TUC Compuwriter, NEC's NEAC-1201 <b>parametron</b> computer, and Unoke Denshi Kogyo's USAC-3010.

40|$|Forty years ago, the PC- 1, <b>parametron</b> {{computer}} 1, {{was born}} at Professor Hidetosi Takahasi's Laboratory. The logical elements of the PC- 1 were parametrons, which supported majority logic. The memory system operated in a two frequency read/write scheme. The word selection mechanism applied error correcting code to decrease the number of elements. Most of the hardware technologies were created by Eiichi Goto. We studied the EDSAC computer precisely, however we developed our own architecture and programming system based upon our own philosophy. The machine instruction set was chosen to ease programming. The normal teletype on the market was employed, leaving the burden of code conversion tasks to software, which seemed to us to have had almost infinite abilities. However, the real memory capacity was indeed very small, which forced us to invent a clever way to implement things.

40|$|The {{parametric}} phase-locked oscillator (PPLO), {{also known}} as a <b>parametron,</b> is a resonant circuit in which one of the reactances is periodically modulated. It can detect, amplify, and store binary digital signals in the form of two distinct phases of self-oscillation. Indeed, digital computers using PPLOs based on a magnetic ferrite ring or a varactor diode as its fundamental logic element were successfully operated in 1950 s and 1960 s. More recently, basic bit operations have been demonstrated in an electromechanical resonator, and an Ising machine based on optical PPLOs has been proposed. Here, using a PPLO realized with Josephson-junction circuitry, we demonstrate the demodulation of a microwave signal digitally modulated by binary phase-shift keying. Moreover, we apply this demodulation capability to the dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit. This readout scheme enables a fast and latching-type readout, yet requires {{only a small number of}} readout photons in the resonator to which the qubit is coupled, thus featuring the combined advantages of several disparate schemes. We have achieved high-fidelity, single-shot, and non-destructive qubit readout with Rabi-oscillation contrast exceeding 90 %, limited primarily by the qubit's energy relaxation.

40|$|This book is {{the second}} {{enlarged}} and revised edition of the first successful monograph on complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) published in 2006, which lends itself to graduate and undergraduate courses in electrical engineering, informatics, control engineering, mechanics, robotics, bioengineering, and other relevant fields. In the second edition the recent trends in CVNNs research are included, resulting in e. g. almost a doubled number of references. The <b>parametron</b> invented in 1954 is also referred to with discussion on analogy and disparity. Also various additional arguments on {{the advantages of the}} complex-valued neural networks enhancing the difference to real-valued neural networks are given in various sections. The book is useful for those beginning their studies, for instance, in adaptive signal processing for highly functional sensing and imaging, control in unknown and changing environment, robotics inspired by human neural systems, and brain-like information processing, as well as interdisciplinary studies to realize comfortable society. It is also helpful to those who carry out research and development regarding new products and services at companies. The author wrote this book hoping in particular that it provides the readers with meaningful hints to make good use of neural networks in fully practical applications. The book emphasizes basic ideas and ways of thinking. Why do we need to consider neural networks that deal with complex numbers? What advantages do the complex-valued neural networks have? What is the origin of the advantages? In what areas do they develop principal applications? This book answers these questions by describing details and examples, which will inspire the readers with new ideas. ...|$|E
