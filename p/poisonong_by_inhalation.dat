30|$|Unlike aerosol {{applications}} for systemic drug delivery and gene therapy, immunization <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> {{does not require}} chronic repeat dosing for efficacy. For many vaccines, immunization may be achieved with 1 â€“ 2 aerosol treatments followed by a booster treatment. Thus, there is less concern {{about the safety of}} repeated lung dosing with immunization <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> compared to systemic drug delivery and gene therapy <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> Nevertheless, safety remains an issue with inhaled vaccines because some patient populations (e.g. patients with allergic asthma) may be more sensitive to excipients in the formulations and care-givers who are immunosuppressed may be more vulnerable to vaccine exposure than non-immunosuppressed individuals.|$|R

40|$|Previously, {{the contact}} {{allergen}} dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) {{was identified as}} a sensitizer <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> in BALB/c mice; in addition, DNCB induced a lymphocytic infiltrate in the larynx of dermally sensitized Th 1 -prone Wistar rats upon a single inhalation challenge. In the present study, repeated inhalation exposures to DNCB were investigated using the same protocol as the single-challenge study: female Wistar rats were dermally sensitized with DNCB and subsequently challenged <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> exposure to 7 or 15 mg/m(3) DNCB twice a week for 4 weeks. Allergy-related apnoeic breathing was not observed. DNCB-specific IgG antibodies were found in the serum and [...] predominantly lymphocytic [...] inflammations were found in the nasal tissues and larynx. Similar effects were observed in animals repeatedly exposed <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> without previous dermal contact, indicating sensitization <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> The inflammation may be the upper respiratory tract analogue of hypersensitivity pneumonitis/allergic alveolitis. Possible progression of the airway inflammation upon long-term exposure should be investigated to support or dismiss discrimination between contact and respiratory allergens in relation to respiratory allergy.

40|$|Purpose: The {{intravenous}} or intramuscular {{administration of}} epinephrine is recommended treatment in systemic anaphylaxis. The {{goal was to}} evaluate epinephrine plasma levels after intramuscular injection into the buccinator muscle in comparison to inhaled epinephrine. Methods: In this pilot study in humans, we measured plasma epinephrine concentrations before and after epinephrine administration by intramuscular injection, or <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> with intramuscular saline and intravenous epinephrine as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Results: Peak plasma epinephrine concentrations were higher after epinephrine was injected intramuscularly with a maximum plasma epinephrine concentration of 3367. 2 pg/ml. After administration <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> epinephrine peak level was 151. 89 pg/ml. Conclusions: In cases of respiratory distress when anaphylaxis is a possible cause, at first the application of epinephrine <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> may be of value. Manifest major cardiovascular reactions according to anaphylaxis without availability of a venous access can only be treated by titration of epinephrine intramuscularly.

Two different procedures were carried out to test the activity of these compounds by direct contact and <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> In the direct contact assays five different quantities of each undiluted substance (6, 2, 1, 0. 5, and 0. 25 mu l) were spread an the internal surface of 6 -cm petri dishes, each containing 10 mites. The activity <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> was tested using two petri dishes of different sizes: the smaller one (6 cm), containing 10 mites, was covered with a filter-paper disk and enclosed in a bigger dish (9 cm) containing 6 oz 2 mu l of each undiluted substance.
