5|$|The {{operation}} of local <b>prisons</b> in locations such as castles had been criticised, since John Howard's {{work in the}} 1770s, and pressure for reform continued {{to grow in the}} 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, and in the process eliminated the purpose of the debtor's <b>prisons</b> in castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local <b>prisons</b> but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British <b>prisons,</b> including <b>prisons</b> at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39% {{reduction in the number of}} <b>prisons</b> in England, including some famous castle <b>prisons</b> such as Norwich; over the coming years, centralisation and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle <b>prisons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth-century <b>prisons</b> were {{effectively}} lodging houses. Poorly {{maintained and}} often filthy, they might {{consist of a}} couple of rooms in a cellar. Before the Gaols Act 1823, then the <b>Prisons</b> Act of 1835 and 1877, they were administered by the royal household, the aristocracy and the bishops, and run for profit by private individuals who bought the right to manage and make money from them.|$|E

5|$|Villermé {{published}} Des <b>prisons</b> telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On <b>Prisons</b> as They Are and as They Should Be) in 1820. In {{this work}} he {{called attention to}} the unhealthy conditions of the <b>prisons</b> in Paris. He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in <b>prisons</b> so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|A new <b>Prisons</b> Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the <b>Prisons</b> Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the Indiana State <b>Prison</b> dates back to 1859 when the state {{legislature}} granted $50,000 for a new state <b>prison.</b> [...] It was named [...] "State <b>Prison</b> West"; as opposed to [...] "State <b>Prison</b> East" [...] {{which was the first}} state <b>prison</b> located in Jeffersonville, Indiana (and later moved to nearby Clarksville). The <b>prison</b> space at Jeffersonville became too scarce, calling for a new <b>prison</b> to be built in Michigan City. Later, State <b>Prison</b> South became the Indiana Reformatory and State <b>Prison</b> North became known as Indiana State <b>Prison.</b>|$|R

5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of <b>prisons,</b> to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of <b>prisons.</b> While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of <b>prisons,</b> effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E
5|$|Human rights organisations accuse {{police and}} {{military}} forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. <b>Prisons</b> are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and <b>prisons</b> run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents {{at the behest of}} the government. However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the Kansas District Court {{granted a}} {{petition}} from Manning for a legal name change. An Army spokesman stated {{that while the}} Army would update personnel records to acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male. Manning sought hormone therapy {{and the right to}} live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender dysphoria, which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists. Such treatment is provided in civilian federal <b>prisons</b> when it is found to be medically necessary, but it is not available in military <b>prisons.</b> The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{reform to}} Western Australia's prison system – new <b>prisons,</b> legislation, and {{administration}} – {{did not begin}} until the 1960s, lagging behind those that occurred in Europe, North America, and elsewhere in Australia after World War II. Seven new <b>prisons</b> were opened between 1960 and 1971, including a maximum-security facility at Albany, following an abrupt increase in the prisoner population in the mid- to late-1950s. In 1970, female prisoners and staff were moved from Fremantle to the new Bandyup Women's Prison, built at Bandyup {{on the outskirts of}} Perth. The female division, which had been the only women's prison in Western Australia, was subsequently used for male prisoners. New legislation regarding probation, parole, and convicted drunkards was also introduced, which provided alternatives to imprisonment. With these new arrangements, and more variety in <b>prisons</b> and prison types, a classification board was set up in 1963 to assess prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Southwark {{was settled}} by the Romans around 43 CE. It {{served as an}} entry point into London from {{southern}} England, particularly along Watling Street, the Roman road from Canterbury; this ran into what is now Southwark's Borough High Street and from there north to old London Bridge. The area became known for its travellers and inns, including Geoffrey Chaucer's Tabard Inn. The itinerant population brought with it poverty, prostitutes, bear baiting, theatres (including Shakespeare's Globe) and <b>prisons.</b> In 1796 there were five <b>prisons</b> in Southwark—the Clink, King's Bench, Borough Compter, White Lion and the Marshalsea—compared to 18 in London as a whole.|$|E
