In a widely cited article, Amartya Sen compared the birth sex ratio in Europe (106) and United States (105) with those in Asia (107+) and argued that the high sex ratios in East Asia, West Asia and South Asia {{may be due to}} excessive female mortality. Sen pointed to research that had shown that if men and women receive similar nutritional and medical attention and good health care then females have better survival rates, and it is the male which is the genetically fragile sex. Sen estimated 'missing women' from extra women who would have survived in Asia if it had the same ratio of women to men as Europe and United States. According to Sen, the high birth sex ratio over decades, implies a female shortfall of 11% in Asia, or over 100 million women as missing from the 3 billion combined population of India, other South Asian countries, West Asia, North Africa and China.|$|E

However, most {{estimates}} of sex-biased predation in birds have focused on species with obvious sexual colour dimorphism or body size dimorphism. Data on sexually monomorphic birds are generally lacking. In the present study, we adopt a PCR-based sexing procedure to help test for sex-biased predation in a wintering population of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri), a shorebird that shows only subtle sexual size dimorphism. Specifically, by comparing the a priori determined <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of live birds wintering at a site in western Mexico to the molecular estimate obtained from depredated birds at this same site, {{we were able to}} perform a population-specific test for sex bias in predator-induced mortality. The proportion of females estimated from living (ca. 25 %) versus dead (ca. 24 %) individuals was in fact not significantly different, indicating that the strong male bias in this population is not due to differential predation.
