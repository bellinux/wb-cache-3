It was estimated that this core heating and vaporization process happened in about 7.5 milliseconds, before enough steam had been formed to shut down the reaction, beating the steam shutdown by a few milliseconds.

25|$|SL-1 was {{constructed}} with a main central control rod that {{was capable of}} producing a very large excess reactivity if it were completely removed.

In normal operation control rods are withdrawn only enough to cause sufficient reactivity for a sustained nuclear reaction and power generation. In this accident, however, the reactivity addition was sufficient to take the reactor <b>prompt</b> <b>critical</b> within a time estimated at 3.6 milliseconds.

2500|$|The {{physics of}} {{radioactive}} decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is delayed neutron emission {{by a number}} of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed [...] "prompt neutrons") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half lives for their decay by neutron emission that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the critical point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain-reactivity where delayed neutrons are necessary to achieve a critical mass state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in [...] "real time"; otherwise the time between achievement of criticality and nuclear meltdown {{as a result of an}} exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the <b>prompt</b> <b>critical</b> point.

2500|$|On January 3, 1961, {{the reactor}} was being {{prepared}} for restart after a shutdown of eleven days over the holidays. Maintenance procedures required that the main central control rod be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism. At 9:01p.m., this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go <b>prompt</b> <b>critical</b> instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous power excursion caused water surrounding the core to begin to explosively vaporize. The water vapor caused a pressure wave to strike {{the top of the}} reactor vessel, causing water and steam to spray {{from the top of the}} vessel. This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the [...] vessel had jumped [...] and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location. The spray of water and steam knocked two operators onto the floor, killing one and severely injuring another. One of the shield plugs on top of the reactor vessel impaled the third man through his groin and exited his shoulder, pinning him to the ceiling. The victims were Army Specialists John A. Byrnes (age 27) and Richard Leroy McKinley (age 22), and Navy Seabee Construction Electrician First Class (CE1) Richard C. Legg (age 26). It was later established that Byrnes (the reactor operator) had lifted the rod and caused the excursion, Legg (the shift supervisor) was standing on top of the reactor vessel and was impaled and pinned to the ceiling, and McKinley, the trainee who stood nearby, was later found alive by rescuers. All three men succumbed to injuries from physical trauma; however, the radiation from the nuclear excursion would have given the men no chance of survival even if they had not been killed by the explosion stemming from the criticality accident.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Checklists are {{clinical}} {{decision support}} tools that improve process of care and patient outcomes. We previously demonstrated that <b>prompting</b> <b>critical</b> care physicians to address issues on a daily rounding checklist that were being overlooked reduced utilization of empiric antibiotics and mechanical ventilation, and reduced risk-adjusted mortality and length of stay. We sought to examine {{the degree to which}} these process of care improvements explained the observed difference in hospital mortality between the group that received prompting and an unprompted control group. Methods In the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of a tertiary care hospital, we conducted face-to-face <b>prompting</b> of <b>critical</b> care physicians if processes of care on a checklist were being overlooked. A control MICU team used the checklist without prompting. We performed exploratory analyses of the mediating effect of empiric antibiotic, mechanical ventilation, and central venous catheter (CVC) duration on risk-adjusted mortality. Results One hundred forty prompted group and 125 control group patients were included. One hundred eighty-three patients were exposed to at least one day of empiric antibiotics during MICU admission. Hospital mortality increased as empiric antibiotic duration increased (P. 001). Prompting was associated with shorter empiric antibiotic duration and lower risk-adjusted mortality in patients receiving empiric antibiotics (OR 0. 41, 95 % CI 0. 18 - 0. 92, P= 0. 032). When empiric antibiotic duration was added to mortality models, the adjusted OR for the intervention was attenuated from 0. 41 to 0. 50, suggesting that shorter duration of empiric antibiotics explained 15. 2 % of the overall benefit of prompting. Evaluation of mechanical ventilation was limited by study size. Accounting for CVC duration changed the intervention effect slightly. Conclusions In this analysis, some improvement in mortality associated with prompting was explained by shorter empiric antibiotic duration. However, most of the mortality benefit of prompting was unexplained. </p...|$|R
