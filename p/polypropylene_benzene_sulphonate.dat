Detergents {{may be used}} in any form (liquid, powder, paste, bar, cake, shape, etc,) widely for household laundry products, domestic and industrial cleaners, cosmetic products, and industrial purposes. Surfactants are organic substances, used in detergents, intentionally added to achieve cleaning, rising and/or fabric softening due to its surface-active properties. They consist of one or more hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of such nature and size that they are capable of forming micelles. Surfactants belong to a group of chemicals of high environment relevance due to their large production volumes. They are mainly discharged into the environment by the wastewater pathway, either after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant or directly where no treatment is available. Environmental compartments, which may be influenced by surfactants, are the fresh water environment (water body and sediments), the soil if surfactants loaded sewage sludge is added, and the marine environment. The wastewaters of detergent manufacturing contain high levels of inhibitory surfactants that pose appreciable impacts on the environment. In addition to industrial wastewaters, domestic wastewater also includes synthetic organic compounds like surfactants, personal-care products, additives that have severe effects on wildlife and human health due to their toxicological properties. Therefore there is a growing research need on the inhibitory effects and removal of such compounds. Linear alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonates</b> (LAS) and sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) {{play an important role in}} our everyday, since they have been announced as biodegradable and environmentally friendly surfactants compared to branched <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonates</b> like Dodecyl <b>Benzene</b> <b>Sulphonates.</b> LAS are known as biodegradable due to the linear structure of the alkyl benzene group present in this molecular structure. However, it has also been reported that surfactants, specifically linear alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonates</b> decrease the affinity of substrate to biomass and lower maximum growth rates are observed in the presence of surfactants. Sodium lauryl ether sulphate consists of straight carbon chains, usually 12 to 14, and, due to its more simple structure (i. e., no benzene ring), it can be more easily biodegradable than other surfactants such as LAS. Biodegradation is an important factor for reduction and removal of organic contaminants from the environment. The evaluation of biodegradability of anthropogenic organic substances is an essential parameter for environmental risk assessment and required according to appropriate legislation. In a risk assessment study it has been pointed out that the risk imposed on the aquatic by the anionic surfactants depends upon the applied treatment scheme prior to discharge of wastewater. [...] RESUMO O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido numa indústria de produtos de limpeza doméstica (LD) e higiene pessoal (HP), onde está implementada uma estação de tratamento de águas residuais industriais (ETARI). Durante o estudo foi monitorizada e avaliada a biodegradabilidade de algumas substâncias base dos detergentes (tensoactivos aniónicos), nomeadamente o LAS e o SLES, bem como o efluente da indústria nas diferentes fases de tratamento implementado na ETARI. Ao longo do processo de tratamento dos fluxos que compõem as águas residuais industriais, procurou-se estabelecer relações entre parâmetros chave de avaliação do conteúdo em matéria orgânica (Carência Química Oxigénio – CQO e Carência Bioquímica Oxigénio – CBO) com os tensoactivos anteriormente referidos.

40|$|The {{utility of}} {{synthetic}} cleaners or commonly called as detergents have developed far indeed in this century. The {{effective and efficient}} use of detergents in cleaning process, was attracted {{to be used in}} laundry’s industry commercially, though, it has some drawback to the society and environments. Since the active materials in the compounds can cause irritating to the skins, cataracts to mature eyes and some other environmental issues due to the excess of foams can prevent oxygen dilution in the water so it be hazardous to water living organisms. Once the promising method to solve this problem is by photo-degradation using photo-catalyst. Photo-catalyst is the process using light and catalyst in order to accelerate chemical transformation, thus,  solar or uv-rays can be used as light sources. This research aims at to show the ability of catalyst TiO 2  to degrade active material in linear alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (LAS) and alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (ABS) which is available in commercial detergent. Photo-degradation of LAS and ABS compounds was determined by optimum capacity TiO 2  and irradiance time. Whereas, for environmental application, the degrade compounds such Rinso® and Wipol® was chosen since it is commonly used in daily life. Beside, artificial water waste and laundry water was chosen to show the environmental effect.   The result shows that the optimum number of catalyst TiO 2  addition for LAS degradation was 1. 5 g, and optimum time was 120 minute. Whereas  the optimum number of catalyst TiO 2  addition for ABS degradation was 2. 0 g, and optimum time was 120 minute as well. Thus, for detergent Rinso®, at optimum catalyst addition, we found degradation number was 75. 83 %, and for detergent Wipol®, at optimum catalyst addition, we found degradation number was 57. 94 %.

The two purified preparations of antibody differed considerably {{in their ability}} to precipitate with antigen. It was found, however, that the non-precipitating antibody could largely be coprecipitated with antigen when mixed with precipitating antibody. Hapten binding experiments carried out on both preparations of antibody indicated that the κA values were of the same order of magnitude. The difference in method of preparation used was shown to have negligible effect on the hapten binding properties of the two antibodies. The important differences between the non-precipitating and precipitating antibodies were: (1) electrophoretic mobility, and (2) antigenic specificity. The precipitating antibody was identified as a γG-globulin, the non-precipitating variety as probably a γA-globulin. These results are compatible with the presence of a greater number of ionizable groups, i. e. potentially hydrophilic groups, on the non-precipitating antibody.

The highest loaded {{and most important}} component to remove from graywater is surfactant, the active ingredient in soaps and detergents.

The dynamics of BET from TiO 2 to the parent cation has been measured by monitoring the recovery kinetics of the bleach of the adsorbed dye and it is found to be multiexponential. BET dynamics have been compared with bare (unmodified) nanoparticles for the same DBF/TiO 2 system. It has been observed that BET reaction is slow on the modified surface compared to on the bare surface in earlier time domain (picosecond).

The effects of temperature, pH and electrolyte on dye solubilization were investigated for single surfactants and for binary surfactant mixtures. The results showed that the solubilization of both dyes in the surfactant micelles increased with the temperature and with addition of salt {{and that there was no}} synergy when a mixture of surfactants was used.

40|$|Nonylphenol (NP) is an {{endocrine}} disruptor present as a pollutant in river sediment. Biodegradation of NP can reduce its toxicological risk. As sediments are mainly anaerobic, degradation of linear (4 -n-NP) and branched nonylphenol (tNP) was studied under methanogenic, sulphate reducing and denitrifying conditions in NP polluted river sediment. Anaerobic bioconversion was observed only for linear NP under denitrifying conditions. The microbial population involved herein was further studied by enrichment and molecular characterization. The largest change in diversity was observed between the enrichments {{of the third}} and fourth generation, and further enrichment did not affect the diversity. This implies that different microorganisms are involved in the degradation of 4 -n-NP in the sediment. The major degrading bacteria were most closely related to denitrifying hexadecane degraders and linear alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (LAS) degraders. The molecular structures of alkanes and LAS are similar to the linear chain of 4 -n-NP, this might indicate that the biodegradation of linear NP under denitrifying conditions starts at the nonyl chain. Initiation of anaerobic NP degradation was further tested using phenol as a structure analogue. Phenol was chosen instead of an aliphatic analogue, because phenol is the common structure present in all NP isomers while the structure of the aliphatic chain differs per isomer. Phenol was degraded in all cases, but did not affect the linear NP degradation under denitrifying conditions and did not initiate the degradation of tNP and linear NP under the other tested conditions...|$|R

The tissues (liver, gill, muscle and kidney) enzyme parameters were analysed after 0 hr (initial) 2 hr, 12 hr and 24 h exposure. The increased neutral and alkaline proteases activities in the different tissues of C. gariepinus indicates the damage caused due to impairment of energy supply and alkaline proteases activity indicates higher protein degradation. Therefore, the proteins are denatured leading to more activation of protease. During the toxic exposure of LAS, the aspartate aminotransfarase (AAT) and alaninetransfarase (ALAT) were enhanced which led to incorporation of amino acids into TCA cycle for energy production. Whereas, glutamate dehydrogenase activity similarly enhanced the elevated level of amino acids, transaminases which possibly suggest the utilization of protein under stress condition of fish. Possible Impaired respiration was evident due to the toxic insult of LAS to the gill which showed severe damage such as filaments with disjointed lamella. In the liver, there was mild vacuolation and congestion of the liver tissue.

In this work, a complete study of the action of the organic additives on the crystalline orientation of the nickel electrodeposits was carried out. The selection of the organic compounds was made in order to investigate the effect of the stereochemical structure and unsaturated bonds on the nickel electrocrystallization process. It was found that the presence of acetylenic compounds (butyne- 2 -diol 1, 4 and propyne- 2 -ol) in nickel plating baths leads to the predominance of high inhibited modes of crystal growth. Propyne- 2 -ol seems to be more active, as the geometry of its molecule favours the adsorption of the additive on the metallic surface and, thus, its faster hydrogenation. With the additon of phenyl propyl alcohol, a strong perturbation of the oriented crystal growth of the nickel crystallites occurs. The adsorption of the phenyl group on the metallic surface and its hydrogenation is responsible for the predominance of high inhibited textures. In the case of coumarin, the complexity of its molecule makes its adsorption more difficult, resulting in the development of [100] textured deposits even at high concentrations of the additive.

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) measuring 20 nm and 80 nm were used as additives and sodium dodecyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (SDBS) was used as anionic surfactant. The experiments used different concentrations of nanofluid, distilled with BPS of different spherical diameter and different concentrations of nano-media, and were conducted 20 times. Experimental results of supercooling were analysed by statistical methods. Results show that the average and peak supercooling degrees of nanofluids and nano-media in BPS are {{lower than those of}} distilled water. For the distilled water in BPS, the supercooling degree decreases on the whole with the decrease of the ball diameter. With the same spherical diameter (8 mm) of BPS, the supercooling degree of TiO 2 NPs measuring 20 nm is lower than the supercooling degree of distilled water in BPS. Step-cooling experiments of different concentrations of nanofluids and nano-media in BPS were also conducted. Results showed that phase transition time is reduced {{because of the presence of}} TiO 2 NPs. The BPS substrate and the NPs enhance the heat transfer. Distilled water with a porous solid base and nanoparticles means the amount of cold-energy storage increases and the supercooling degree and the total time are greatly reduced. The phase transition time of distilled water is about 3. 5 times that of nano-media in BPS...|$|R

BBA. 860 : 699 - 707. ### PURPOSE: Derivitization of amino {{groups to}} remove the {{positive}} charge characteristics of the protein, for example to determine the importance of amino groups to a protein's function. ### MATERIALS: 1. Purified protein at approximately 0. 25 mg/ml (diluted in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, 3 mM Na azide, and, for membrane proteins, 0. 1 % SDS). - Commercial stock solution of acetic anhydride or succinic anhydride. - Microbeaker and flea bar. - pH microprobe to monitor pH during acetylation reaction. - 5 N NaOH. ### METHOD: 1. Dilute protein sample to correct concentration as described above. - Using microbeaker and flea bar, set up reaction mix {{so that it is}} stirring with the pH probe inserted and pH is monitored. pH must be maintained constantly at between 6. 0 and 7. 0, or irreversible denaturation of the protein may result. Addition of the acetic anhydride causes a transient drop of pH, which must be corrected with 20 µl volumes of 5 N NaOH. - Add 2 µl acetic anhydride from stock solution every 10 min for 60 min, then let sit for another 60 min at room temp. During this time, maintain pH as described above. - Dialyse vs. 1 litre of 35 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, 3 mM Na-azide, 0. 1 % SDS for 4 hrs, then dialyse again in the same overnight. - Residual amino groups can be assayed with trinitro <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (TNBS) ...|$|R
40|$|Liquid <b>benzene</b> was <b>sulphonated</b> with gaseous sulphur {{trioxide}} in a tube reactor {{and in a}} new gas—liquid cyclone reactor. The products are benzenesulphonic acid and diphenyl sulphone (byproduct). The observed selectivity depends on the conversion, the initial benzene concentration and the mass transfer characteristics of the reactor. Minimum diphenyl sulphone formation was obtained for a low initial benzene concentration, a low benzene conversion and with a high liquid-side mass transfer coefficient, as in the cyclone reactor. As the actual mass transfer rate during sulphonation could not be measured, the observed selectivity {{was related to the}} mass transfer coefficient determined by the simultaneous absorption of CO 2 and O 2 in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution...|$|R
30|$|In water- and {{ethylene}} glycol-based nanofluids, the surfactants predominating in {{the literature}} for non-covalent options are sodium dodecyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (SDBS) [16, 20 – 22], polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [23], and gum Arabic [14, 22], while the oxidation following the original version [24, 25] or modifications [26] of Hummers method {{are the most common}} with covalent functionalizations. The main downside of using non-covalent methods is that the addition of a surfactant considerably increases the viscosity of the nanofluid, leading to higher pressure drops in thermal equipment. As an example, Amiri et al. [16] found that the viscosity enhancement of non-covalent graphene/water nanofluids synthesized using SDBS doubles the values of covalent functionalized nanofluids at the same nanoparticle concentration. Regarding covalent functionalizations, although Paredes et al. [27] reported that good dispersions of graphene oxide (GO) can be obtained not only in water but also in other organic solvents such as ethylene glycol, acid treatment can lead to the formation of defect sites within the systematically arranged conjugated graphene structure of the nanosheets [28 – 30]. As these defects could reduce the thermal conductivity of graphene by an order of magnitude or more below its intrinsic value, some reaction conditions such as acid content, temperature, or time of exposure must be optimized in order to minimize overoxidation and subsequent defect formation [11]. Another peculiar property of graphene oxide is the high natural acidity of its aqueous solutions due to the generation of hydrogen cations resulting from GO-water interactions [31, 32]. Thus, a special attention must be paid to pH control in order to avoid possible damages to metallic elements of the installation [33].|$|R
40|$|Marpol oil waste {{composed}} of wasted oil with seawater which is challenging for waste treatment. Therefore, emulsified seawater {{has to be}} broken down for recovering the oil content involving chemical destabilizer to disperse water droplets or destroy emulsifiers. This study aims to evaluate 37 products of demulsifiers (cationic, non-ionic and anionic) based on ability of water removal from Marpol oil waste. The results show that anionic and nonionic surfactants {{were found to be}} effective demulsifiers exhibiting good property for oil and water separation. The efficiency of the nonionic demulsifiers increases with the dosage up to a certain extent after which the efficiency falls. However, anionic demulsifiers do not show any decrease in efficiency at higher doses. Among all the tested anionic demulsifiers, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O 70 PG), sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O CONC 60 %) and Oligoguluronate (DP 9 - 6661) were with most outstanding performance. Additionally there is a general improvement in the performance of screened demulsifiers with increased temperature (70 °C). Sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O 70 PG), sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O CONC 60 %) and sodium dodecyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (DP 9 - 6661) reached water removal performance percentage as 75 %, 66. 3 % and 56. 7 % respectively after 30 h. When the water content of recovered oil was reduced to a certain level (below 10 %), the heat valve was about 40 MJ/kg. The recovered Marpol oil waste was suggested to apply for low-quality fuel usage such as cement kilns and waste incinerators with its property of high energy value, low sulphur content and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) ...|$|R
