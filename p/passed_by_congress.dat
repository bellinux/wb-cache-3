5|$|The New York draft riots (July 13–16, 1863), {{known at}} the time as Draft Week, were violent {{disturbances}} in Lower Manhattan, widely regarded as the culmination of working-class discontent with new laws <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> that year to draft men to fight in the ongoing American Civil War.

5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act.

Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement.

5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It {{soon became clear that}} this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} annexation of Texas {{stems from the fact that}} Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E
5|$|After {{assessing}} the devastation in Florida and Louisiana, U.S. President George H. W. Bush initially proposed a $7.1billion aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, agricultural recovery, food stamps, and public housing {{for victims of}} Hurricane Andrew. After the House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, the cost was later increased to $11.1billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> as House Resolution5620 on September18, and {{signed into law by}} President Bush on September23. The state of Florida alone received $9billion through the disaster relief bill.|$|E
5|$|White supremacists, {{such as the}} Ku Klux Klan (KKK), used {{paramilitary}} {{violence to}} prevent blacks from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. The Enforcement Acts were <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment. However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court ruled {{that the federal government}} did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not state actors.|$|E

5|$|During Reagan's presidency, {{federal income}} tax rates were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> and signed by Reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E
5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East {{and eastern}} Mediterranean, two ongoing {{international}} disputes developed into crises. The Cyprus dispute {{turned into a}} crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both {{the effect of this}} on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress,</b> which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid {{until the end of the}} year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978.|$|E

5|$|The Bland–Allison Act, <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> on February 28, 1878, {{required}} the Treasury {{to purchase a}} minimum of $2million in domestically mined silver per month and coin it into silver dollars. The Mint used a new design by engraver George T. Morgan, and struck {{what became known as}} the Morgan dollar. Many of the pieces quickly vanished into bank vaults for use as backing for paper currency redeemable in silver coin, known as silver certificates. In 1890, the purchases required under the Bland–Allison Act were greatly increased under the terms of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Although the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, it was not until 1904 that the government struck the last of the purchased silver into dollars. Once it did, production of the coin ceased.|$|E
5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress.</b> The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could choose {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>Congress</b> in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
