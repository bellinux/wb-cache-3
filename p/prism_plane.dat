Samples oriented for basal slip (Type I 1 samples) could be plastically deformed at tempera-tures as low as 400 °C but showed more complicated defor-mation behavior, inasmuch as the sample orientation also allowed for the activation of basal twinning {{and two of the}} three rhombohedral twin systems. The temperature depen-dence of the critical resolved shear stress (I ~ ~ J, InT,, = lnT 0 - B- T for basal slip was significantly greater than that for <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> slip (Bbasal>BpriPmplane), causing the latter system to b...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePlasticity in {{zirconium}} {{is controlled}} by 1 / 3 screw dislocations gliding in the prism planes of the hexagonal close-packed structure. This prismatic and not basal glide is observed for a given set of transition metals like zirconium and {{is known to be}} related to the number of valence electrons in the d band. We use ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory to study the core structure of screw dislocations in zirconium. Dislocations are found to dissociate in the <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> in two partial dislocations, each with a pure screw character. Ab initio calculations also show that the dissociation in the basal plane is unstable. We calculate then the Peierls barrier for a screw dislocation gliding in the <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> and obtain a small barrier. The Peierls stress deduced from this barrier is lower than 21 MPa, which is in agreement with experimental data. The ability of an empirical potential relying on the embedded atom method (EAM) to model dislocations in zirconium is also tested against these ab initio calculations...|$|E

This study {{investigates the}} changes in radial micro-texture via Kearn’s f-factors during single cold pilger {{reduction}} of a titanium Ti- 3 - 2. 5 alloy {{as a result of}} strain path changes from tooling modifications. EBSD results confirm that the texture intensity as well as the radial f-factors can be increased by modifications of pilgering tooling. In addition a switch between the secondary <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> which lie normal to the pilger direction in the starting tube to primary <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> after pilgering has been observed. Background For many years the aerospace industry has used hydraulic power to drive actuators that constantly adjust the aircraft control surfaces. Operating under high hydraulic pressure, the tubing used in the system requires high strength to weight and good impulse fatigue strength- particularly with respect to hoop strength. These reasons led the aerospace industry to adopt the Ti- 3 - 2. 5 alloy as the standard for titanium hydraulic tubing [1 - 3]. This material is a near alpha alloy which contains 3 % aluminum and 2. 5 % vanadium. When cold worked the alpha close pack hexagonal structure can slip predominantly on the basal, <b>prism</b> and pyramidal <b>planes.</b> All three planes are said to slip in one direction that is normal to the basal pole.

40|$|The typical {{shapes of}} snow {{crystals}} of low temperature types {{that are known}} at present are "Gohei twins", "Sea gull", "Spearhead" and so on. Although they were named {{by one of the}} authors (K. K.) tentatively, these names appear to be accepted by scientists in the fields of cloud physics, crystal growth and so on. On the other hand, their formation mechanisms except for the gohei twin crystals have not been clarified. In this paper, the correlation between the gohei twin, sea gull, and spearhead type crystals has been considered based on a number of microphotographs taken by a polarizing microscope during the observation period from December 25, 1985 to January 23, 1986 at Inuvik (68 ° 22 ′N, 133 ° 42 ′W), N. W. T., Arctic Canada. As a result, although we have pointed out that the gohei twin type crystals are two kinds that have tip angles of 56 and 78 °, they have another difference besides the difference of their tip angles. Namely, the gohei twin crystals having the tip angle of 56 ° have a certain kind of finlike appendages along the crystalline boundary of two extended <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> of the crystals. On the other hand, other twin crystals that have the tip angle of 78 ° are devoid of finlike appendages along the crystalline boundary. The angles of 13 and 20 ° between two extended <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> of the gohei twin crystals pointed out in our previous papers were clarified by the measurement of the tip angles of individual extended <b>prism</b> <b>planes.</b> Furthermore, it was noted that the gohei twin crystals that have the tip angle of 56 ° are similar to the spearhead type crystals, and the spearhead type crystals were one of the wings of the sea gull type crystals seen from a right angle. However, some parts of the formation mechanisms of snow crystals of low temperature types are obscure and {{it would be difficult to}} understand their exact correlation as of this report...|$|R

40|$|Graphitic layers have {{previously}} been conjectured {{to play an}} active role in diamond nucleation by Lambrecht et al. and may also be involved in a mechanism for homoepitaxial diamond growth since the surfaces of diamond may partially graphitize under high-temperature conditions typical of growth processes. Recent molecular dynamics simulations of the diamond { 111 } surface, briefly reviewed and discussed here, indicate a progressive graphitization with increasing temperature which is strongly facilitated by any kind of surface perturbation or roughness such as step-like adsorbates. Here we show specifically that also twin boundaries promote graphitization. The process of debonding of the surface layer which is a simple displacive motion of the outer layer is also shown to be closely related to the delamination of the tetrahedrally bonded icosahedral C 100 molecule into two concentric C 20 and (fullerene-like) C 80 fragments. In contrast, the tetrahedrally bonded icosahedral C 300 molecule which contains one more concentric shell, does not spontaneously graphitize into a bucky onion (consisting of concentric C 80 and C 240 fullerenes) although the latter has lower energy. Progressive graphitization at a surface towards deeper layers before the top layer is delaminated can occur under certain conditions and then may lead to graphite/diamond <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> interfaces similar to those previously investigated in connection with nucleation. The structural stability of the <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> interface between graphite and diamond is re-investigated here.

40|$|Experimental {{results show}} that fish {{antifreeze}} glycopeptides (AFGPs) 8 and 7 (with 4 and 5 repeats respectively of the Ala-Ala-Thr backbone sequence) bond onto ice <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> aligned along a-axes, and inhibit crystal growth on <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> and on surfaces close to that orientation. The 9. 31 -A repeat spacing of the AFGP in the polyproline II helix configuration, deduced from NMR studies, matches twice the repeat spacing of ice in the deduced alignment direction, 9. 038 A, within 3 %. A specific binding model is proposed for the AFGP and for the alpha-helical antifreeze peptide of winter flounder. For AFGP 7 - 8, two hydroxyl groups of each disaccharide (one disaccharide is attached to each threonine) reside within the ice surface, {{so that they are}} shared between the ice crystal and the disaccharide. This provides 24 hydrogen bonds between AFGP 8 and the ice and 30 for AFGP 7, explaining why the chemical adsorption is virtually irreversible and the crystal growth can be stopped virtually completely. The same scheme of sharing polar groups with the ice works well with the alpha-helical antifreeze of winter flounder, for which an amide as well as several hydroxyls are shared. The sharing of polar groups with the ice crystal, rather than hydrogen-bonding to the ice surface, may be a general requirement for adsoprtion-inhibition of freezing...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. March 2014. Major: Geological Sciences. Advisor: Dr. Viki L. Hansen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 46 pages. Structural fabrics within the Vermilion district, northeastern Minnesota, including metamorphic foliation and elongation lineation (Le), are well established {{and can be}} summarized as near-vertical foliation striking northeast containing oblique to vertical Le. The oblique to vertical lineations are present throughout the Vermilion district, yet areas of subhorizontal lineation orientations are also present locally. Despite broad agreement in structural data, first-order interpretations including vorticity axis orientation and shear sense {{have yet to be}} agreed upon. Two different interpretations emerge from previous studies: 1) dextral transpression associated with terrane accretion and 2) Le-parallel shearing consisting of regional dip-slip shearing and later, more focused, strike-slip shearing. The Kawishwi Shear Zone (KSZ), one of several Vermilion district shear zones, shows structural relationship particularly well. Foliation consistently strikes east-northeast and dips vertically. Le is broadly down-dip with discrete areas of subhorizontal orientation. Goodman (2008) performed a structural and kinematic analysis of the KSZ and interpreted lineation-parallel shearing with dip-slip shearing followed by strike-slip shearing. However, previous studies do not specifically constrain flow within L-S tectonites relative to Le. This study aims to characterize the kinematic pattern of flow through use of quartz fabric analysis of c- and a-axis petrofabrics. The data acquired reveal the dominant slip planes and direction of flow during deformation, and also provide information about deformation temperature and strain geometry. Oriented samples from the KSZ were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope and electron backscatter diffraction (SEM/EBSD) system. Sample KS 7 J contains a vertical Le and quartz petrofabric data indicate flow nearly parallel to Le, thus dominantly dip-slip displacement. Quartz microstructures are consistent with greenschist-facies deformation. Sample KS 6 U 1, collected from a localized zone with strike-parallel lineation, displays quartz petrofabric data indicative of slip along the <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> with flow parallel to Le. Activation of the higher temperature <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> is attributed to conditions of the quartz vein emplacement. The results of this study support the lineation-parallel shearing hypothesis for deformation within the KSZ. Similar to the results of Goodman (2008), data of this study support at least two shearing events in the Kawishiwi Shear Zone. Sample KS 7 J is interpreted to record the pervasive, broad dip-parallel deformation, whereas sample KS 6 U 1 is interpreted to record a late-stage localized strike-parallel deformation. The general shear flow geometry of sample KS 7 J indicates displacement near-parallel to Le and does not contain a significant strike-parallel component. Data of this study are in line with regional displacement parallel to Le resulting in dominantly vertical movements...|$|E

Such preferential growth is consistent with anisotropic grain growth in alumina, where platelets form because of faster growth of the prism orientations than the basal orientation. The simulations also show the mechanism by which Ca ions in the IGF inhibit growth on the basal surface. At compositions with high or low Ca/Al ratios, growth along each surface normal is equivalent, indicating isotropic grain growth, although the attachment rates are quite different, which may indicate differences between normal grain growth and abnormal, but isotropic, grain growth.

40|$|Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) protect certain organisms from freezing by {{adhering to}} ice crystals, thereby preventing their growth. All AFPs depress the nonequilibrium freezing temperature below the melting point; however AFPs from overwintering insects, {{such as the}} spruce budworm (sbw) are 10 – 100 times more effective than most fish AFPs. It has been proposed that the exceptional activity of these AFPs depends {{on their ability to}} prevent ice growth at the basal plane. To test the hypothesis that the hyperactivity of sbwAFP results from direct affinity to the basal plane, we fluorescently tagged sbwAFP and visualized it on the surface of ice crystals using fluorescence microscopy. SbwAFP accumulated at the six <b>prism</b> <b>plane</b> corners and the two basal planes of hexagonal ice crystals. In contrast, fluorescently tagged fish type III AFP did not adhere to the basal planes of a single-crystal ice hemisphere. When ice crystals were grown {{in the presence of a}} mixture of type III AFP and sbwAFP, a hybrid crystal shape was produced with sbwAFP bound to the basal planes of truncated bipyramidal crystals. These observations are consistent with the blockage of c-axial growth of ice as a result of direct interaction of sbwAFP with the basal planes...|$|E
40|$|Using first {{principles}} methods we calculated the entire γ-surface {{of the first}} order pyramidal planes in α-titanium. Slip on these planes involving dislocations with c + a dislocations is one means by which α-titanium polycrystals may supplement slip on <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> with a-type Burgers vectors to maintain ductility. We find two stable intrinsic stacking faults with relatively small energies. We show that dissociation of c + a dislocations into two dislocations with Burgers vectors (c + a) / 2 is not possible in α-titanium {{because there is no}} stable stacking fault at (c + a) / 2. Instead we propose a possible dissociation of a c + a dislocation into three partial dislocations separated by the two intrinsic faults we have identified. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn due to a computational error in generating the first-order pyramidal gamma surface. 9 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} {{dependence of}} pitting in single crystal beryllium (Be) {{is compared to}} the observations for single crystal zinc (Zn) reported by other investigators. The pit walls in stable propagating pits for <b>prism</b> <b>planes</b> were always square; in the (ioio) surface the walls were normal to the [0001] and [{bar 1 } 2 {bar 1 } 0] directions while in the (110) surface the walls were normal to the [0001] and [{bar 1 } 100] directions. In addition, for the (ioio) and (11 {bar 2 } 0) surfaces the pit interiors were characterized by crystallographically oriented parallel plates of unattacked Be. The orientation of these lamella was quite different than those observed in Zn. To explain this difference, the electron density distributions in the metal lattices are analyzed. A conceptual model for crystallographic pitting is introduced. In this model it is proposed that the crystallographic pits observed in single crystal hcp metals reflects the bond energy in the lattice...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we present}} first results of {{high-resolution}} EBSD for ice with a spatial resolution down to 0. 25 μm. The study highlights {{the potential of}} EBSD to significantly increase our understanding of deformation and annealing processes associated with the build-up of internal stresses due to strain incompatibility between grains. Two polycrystalline samples were analyzed: a natural sample of polar ice from the Vostok ice core (Antarctica) and an experimentally deformed sample of laboratory grown columnar ice. In summary, we observe the following: (1) inhomogeneous deformation through the grains is translated into lattice distortions that are concentrated mainly at grain boundaries and triple junctions (natural and experimental sample), (2) these distortions may be continuous (natural and experimental sample) or may form distinct tilt boundaries and sub-grains of 10 – 50 μm size (experimental sample). These form mainly by rearrangement of basal edge dislocations into low-energy configurations (i. e. tilt boundaries) in various <b>prism</b> <b>planes.</b> Continuous lattice distortions originate from screw or mixed edge and screw dislocations lying in the basal plane...|$|R
