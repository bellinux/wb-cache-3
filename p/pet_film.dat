25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of <b>PET</b> <b>film</b> capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester film capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitor types.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic drivers {{consist of}} a thin, {{electrically}} charged diaphragm, typically a coated <b>PET</b> <b>film</b> membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal {{is applied to the}} electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000volts.|$|E
25|$|Modern marching {{bands and}} drum corps use multi-tenors, which consist of several {{single-headed}} tom-toms {{played by a}} single drummer. The bottoms of the shells are open and beveled to project {{the sound of the}} drum forward. Double-ply <b>PET</b> <b>film</b> heads are typically used for increased sound projection and durability. They are typically played with wooden- or aluminum-shafted mallets that have disc-shaped heads made of nylon. Mallets with felt or fleece heads, drum sticks, drum brushes, and other implements are occasionally used to achieve different timbres. The playing technique used for multi-tenors is somewhat different from that of a snare drum, and more like that of a timpani because the drumhead is struck closer to the edge instead of in the center. This creates a sound with more overtone, as opposed to striking the drumhead in the center, which produces a very short, dull sound with few overtones that is considered undesirable for multi-tenors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) of various different molecular weights was grafted onto <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> using plasma surface grafting modification. The surface structure of PEG-grafted <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> was analyzed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), {{suggesting that the}} surface structure and composition of <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> changes due {{to the presence of}} PEG.

The tests of platelet adhesion and coagulation factors in vitro suggest that PEG grafted onto polymer surfaces can improve the blood compatibility of <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> remarkably. The modified <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> were pre-coated with albumin and fibrinogen respectively; platelet adhesion tests in vitro then indicated that samples pre-coated with albumin have better blood compatibility than with fibrinogen, resulting in the conclusion that the albumin can improve blood compatibility.

25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in paper capacitors. This allows the manufacture of plastic film capacitors with only a single layer of plastic film, whereas paper capacitors need a double layer of paper. Plastic film capacitors were significantly smaller in physical size (better volumetric efficiency), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable paper capacitors. Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by <b>PET</b> <b>film</b> capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|E

Methods. Classical microbiological methods; attachment assay; surface tension measurements; molecular techniques: DNA extraction, PCR; confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM); micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (µCT). Results. We first show, using the model soil and rhizosphere bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 and P. putida KT 2440, that bacteria are able to attach and detach from <b>PET</b> <b>films,</b> and that pre-conditioning with a filtered soil suspension improved the levels of attachment. Bacteria attached to the films were viable and could develop substantial biofilms. <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> buried in soil were rapidly colonised by microorganisms which could be investigated by CLSM and recovered onto agar plates. Secondly, we demonstrate that µCT can be used to non-destructively visualise soil aggregate contact points and pore spaces across the surface of <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> buried in soil. Conclusions. <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> are a successful development of Cholodny’s glass slides and can be used to sample soil communities in which bacterial adherence, growth, biofilm and community development can be investigated.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (<b>PET)</b> <b>films</b> are modified by a dielec. barrier discharge (DBD) in a helium/air mixt. at medium (6. 6 kPa) and atm. pressure. Surface anal. and {{characterization of the}} plasma-treated <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> is performed using contact angle measurements, XPS and At. Force Microscopy (AFM). The polymer films, modified with the DBD at medium and atm. pressure, show {{a significant decrease in}} water contact angle due to the incorporation of oxygen-contg. groups, such as C-O and O-C=O. Results also show that the surface treatment is uniform at micron scales, {{despite the fact that the}} discharge consists of a series of microdischarges. It is shown that at low energy densities (< ± 200 mJ/cm 2), plasma treatment at medium pressure is more energy-efficient in incorporating oxygen functionalities than plasma treatment at atm. pressure. This effect could be induced by the larger diam. of the microdischarges at medium pressure than at atm. pressure (factor 3. 92) and/or by the lower quenching of at. oxygen in three-body collisions at medium pressure. The ageing behavior of the plasma-treated <b>PET</b> <b>films</b> during storage in air is also studied in this paper.

40|$|Abstract. A {{complete}} and permanent hydrophilic modification of poly (ethyleneterephthalate) (<b>PET)</b> <b>films</b> {{is achieved by}} argon-plasma irradiation, subsequently grafting acrylic acid (AA) in vapor phase onto their surface. Both Ar plasma irradiation alone and post grafting AA rendered a complete hydrophilicity to PET surfaces.

In contrast, <b>PET</b> <b>films,</b> irradiated by the Ar plasma, exposed to air, and subsequently grafted with AA monomer, are permanently hydrophilic. Degradation of polymer chains on the plasma-irradiated surface is proportional to time of exposure.

2500|$|Gas flow {{proportional}} counters {{are used}} mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where {{there are multiple}} detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane ("P10"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to {{the ratio of the}} detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector.
