5|$|Once in the engine, the <b>propellants</b> {{flow through}} {{low-pressure}} fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the <b>propellants</b> take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|Rocket {{propellant}}: Solid {{fuel rocket}} propellant began during the 1200s during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty {{at a time}} when bows, arrows, and catapult-based projectile launchers were state of the art military technology in medieval Europe. The Song Chinese invented solid propellant rockets in 1232 during the military siege of Kaifeng. The rocket <b>propellants</b> were powered by solid gunpowder fuel.|$|E

In {{order to make}} their thrust performance higher and to feed <b>propellant</b> more effectively, we have been developing a new type PPT using powdered <b>propellant.</b> To estimate its thrust performance, {{we have made a}} test model thruster for comparing the thrust performances of PPTs with solid <b>propellant</b> and powdered <b>propellant.</b> And we measured their impulse bits and <b>propellant</b> consumptions using “Thrust Mass Balance ” we made. As a result, it was revealed that a PPT using powdered <b>propellant</b> showed as high thrust performance as a PPT using solid <b>propellant</b> in the case that <b>propellant</b> surface was formed enough uniformly...|$|R
40|$|A laser ignition/ablation {{propulsion}} system that captures {{the advantages of}} both liquid and solid propulsion. A reel system is used to move a <b>propellant</b> tape containing a plurality of <b>propellant</b> material targets through an ignition chamber. When a <b>propellant</b> target is in the ignition chamber, a laser beam from a laser positioned above the ignition chamber strikes the <b>propellant</b> target, igniting the <b>propellant</b> material and resulting in a thrust impulse. The <b>propellant</b> tape is advanced, carrying another <b>propellant</b> target into the ignition chamber. The <b>propellant</b> tape and ignition chamber are designed to ensure that each ignition event is isolated from the remaining <b>propellant</b> targets. Thrust and specific impulse may by precisely controlled by varying the synchronized <b>propellant</b> tape/laser speed. The laser ignition/ablation {{propulsion system}} may be scaled for use in small and large applications...|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powder, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved <b>propellants</b> to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, {{phosphorus}} and selenium {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket <b>propellants,</b> bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (<b>propellants</b> and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the concept of {{sustainable}} <b>propellant</b> collection. The concept consists of gathering ambient gas while on-orbit and using it as <b>propellant.</b> <b>Propellant</b> collection could potentially enable operation in very-low Earth orbits without compromising spacecraft lifetime. This work conducts a detailed analysis of <b>propellant</b> collection from a physics perspective in order to test the assertions of previous researchers that <b>propellant</b> collection can dramatically reduce the cost of <b>propellant</b> on-orbit. Major design factors for <b>propellant</b> collection are identified from the fundamental <b>propellant</b> collection equations, which are derived in this work from first principles. A sensitivity analysis on the parameters in these equations determines the relative importance of each parameter to the overall performance of a propellant-collecting vehicle. The <b>propellant</b> collection equations enable the study of where <b>propellant</b> collection is technically feasible as a function of orbit and vehicle performance parameters. Two case studies conducted for a very-low Earth orbit science mission and a <b>propellant</b> depot-type mission serve to demonstrate the application of the <b>propellant</b> collection equations derived in this work. The results of this work show where <b>propellant</b> collection is technically feasible {{for a wide range of}} orbit and vehicle performance parameters. <b>Propellant</b> collection can support very-low Earth operation with presently available technology, and a number of research developments can further extend propellant-collecting concepts' ability to operate at low altitudes. However, <b>propellant</b> collection is not presently suitable for <b>propellant</b> depot applications due to limitations in power. Ph. D...|$|R

5|$|The {{official}} mission countdown {{began on}} Monday, April 10, 1972, at 8:30 AM, six {{days before the}} launch. At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11. On April 15, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen <b>propellants</b> were pumped into the spacecraft, while the astronauts rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.|$|E
5|$|Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, <b>propellants</b> and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, during World War II, Charles Allen Thomas, {{a chemist}} and {{director}} of research at Monsanto in St. Louis, joined the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) as the deputy chief of its Division 8, which was responsible for <b>propellants,</b> explosives and the like. Early in 1943, he traveled to the east with Richard C. Tolman, a member of the NDRC, and James B. Conant, the president of Harvard University {{and the chairman of the}} NDRC, to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive. Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas' background. He was then invited to a meeting in Washington D.C., with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the wartime Manhattan Project responsible for building an atomic bomb. When he got there, Thomas found Conant was also present.|$|E
40|$|Accurate <b>propellant</b> gauging is {{of prime}} {{importance}} insatellite industries. This paper explores {{the possibility of}} using a new <b>propellant</b> tank configuration, consisting of a truncated cone centrally mounted within a spherical <b>propellant</b> tank, to measure the amount of liquid <b>propellant</b> present within the tank. The liquid <b>propellant</b> present within the <b>propellant</b> tank orients itself in geometry by virtue of its dominant surface tension force in 0 g condition, which minimizes its total surface energy. This study reveals that the amount of liquid <b>propellant</b> present in the tank can thus be estimated by measuring the height of the <b>propellant</b> meniscus within the central cone. It is also observed that, for the proposed configuration, the precision of the estimated <b>propellant</b> fill-fraction increases towards the end of life of the spacecraft...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} solve some {{problems}} on PPTs, especially on <b>propellant</b> feed, we achieved {{an entirely new}} idea of a PPT with powdered <b>propellant.</b> We roughly estimated the thrust performance of a powdered <b>propellant</b> PPT comparing with a traditional solid <b>propellant</b> PPT. And we obtained a reliable result that the former could show as high performance as the latter in some cases that the <b>propellant</b> feed was sufficiently uniform. Next we made a prototype model of <b>propellant</b> feed system for a powdered <b>propellant</b> PPT. We tested the uniformity of feed system and it was proved that this system provided <b>propellant</b> uniformly enough.

The <b>propellant</b> system includes a dual compartment <b>propellant</b> tank with independent surface tension acquisition channels in each compartment to provide gas-free flow of pressurized liquid <b>propellant</b> from one compartment to the other in one direction only...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the <b>propellants</b> are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the <b>propellants</b> to enter the engine.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the <b>propellants.</b> A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E

However, there are no detail data and information on the low burning rate AP based solid <b>propellant.</b> This thesis discusses the study {{of development}} AP based solid <b>propellant.</b> The objective of the study is to develop low burning rate AP based solid <b>propellant</b> including the selection of a <b>propellant</b> formulation, preparation and development of the <b>propellant,</b> and <b>propellant</b> burning rate experiments with the strand burner at atmospheric pressure. Together with the literature study and theoretical performance, five sets of different mixture were chosen based on their efficiency of <b>propellant</b> mixture. The <b>propellant</b> was a mixture of AP as an oxidizer, aluminum (Al) as fuel and hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as a binder.

5|$|Kistiakowsky {{was unhappy}} {{with the state of}} American {{knowledge}} of explosives and <b>propellants.</b> Conant established the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL) near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania in October 1940, and Kistiakowsky initially supervised its activities, making occasional visits; but Conant did not formally appoint him as its Technical Director until the spring of 1941. Although initially hampered by a shortage of facilities, the ERL grew from five staff in 1941 to a wartime peak of 162 full-time laboratory staff in 1945. An important field of research was RDX. This powerful explosive had been developed by the British before the war. The challenge was to develop an industrial process that could produce it on a large scale. RDX was also mixed with TNT to produce Composition B, which was widely used in various munitions, and torpex, which was used in torpedoes and depth charges. Pilot plants were in operation by May 1942, and large-scale production followed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed {{with the use of}} the shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from <b>propellants</b> to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.|$|E

Early <b>propellants</b> {{were identified by}} a two-digit number. As the number of experimental variations increased, each improved military rifle propellant was identified by a four-digit number. In addition to the canisters available from DuPont, the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM) sold surplus improved military rifle <b>propellants</b> {{to members of the}} National Rifle Association. By 1936 improved DuPont process control produced batches conforming to published reloading data rather than requiring different charge specifications for each batch; and those <b>propellants</b> have remained in production.
