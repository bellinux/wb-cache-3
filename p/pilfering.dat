5|$|Lamason's {{leadership}} {{boosted the}} airmen's spirits {{and gave them}} hope while instilling a level of discipline and bearing. One of the first assignments Lamason gave was to mount a guard detail, both day and night, to prevent <b>pilfering</b> by other inmates, which had begun during their first night at camp. During their incarceration, Lamason insisted the airmen march, parade and act as a military unit.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} the {{secondary}} capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With {{a population of about}} a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and <b>pilfering.</b> An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.|$|E
25|$|An early {{mechanical}} {{cash register}} {{was invented by}} James Ritty and John Birch following the American Civil War. James {{was the owner of}} a saloon in Dayton, Ohio, USA, and wanted to stop employees from <b>pilfering</b> his profits. The Ritty Model I was invented in 1879 after seeing a tool that counted the revolutions of the propeller on a steamship. With the help of James' brother John Ritty, they patented it in 1883. It was called Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier and it was invented for the purpose to stop cashiers of <b>pilfering</b> and eliminating employee theft or embezzlement.|$|E
50|$|After {{a lineup}} change, which saw the {{replacement}} of the rhythm section, <b>Pilfers</b> disbanded in 2001. Ranx began a solo career, recording and playing shows around the world with Fear Nuttin' Band as his new backup band. In November 2005, he and the other four original members of <b>Pilfers,</b> reunited at the Knitting Factory in New York City for a sold-out performance. The <b>Pilfers</b> have since performed about a half a dozen shows since the 2005 reunion.|$|R
5000|$|After {{leaving the}} Toasters, Ranx co-founded a band called <b>Pilfers.</b> In <b>Pilfers,</b> he shared vocal duties with Vinny Nobile. <b>Pilfers</b> played a {{combination}} of third wave ska music, punk rock, and reggae that they called [...] "raggacore". After self-releasing their first album, the band signed to Mojo Records, who released the band's second album, Chawalaleng. He made frequent guest appearances on the albums of other third wave ska bands, such as Spring Heeled Jack USA, Metro Stylee and Mojo labelmates Reel Big Fish.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, the <b>Pilfers</b> {{performed}} nine shows {{outside of}} NYC, including six shows in November with Sonic Boom Six. The <b>Pilfers</b> performed two {{shows on the}} second leg of the Ska is Dead 4 tour. They played on November 14, 2009 at the Showcase Live in Foxboro, MA, and November 15, 2009 at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, NJ. The <b>Pilfers</b> performed for a Haiti benefit concert at the Knitting Factory on April 23, 2010 with Karen Gibson Roc, Tsunami Rising, and Across The Aisle.|$|R
25|$|According to Rudolph's own writings, {{he survived}} {{during his years}} as a {{fugitive}} by camping in the woods, gathering acorns and salamanders, <b>pilfering</b> vegetables from gardens, stealing grain from a grain silo, and raiding dumpsters in a nearby town.|$|E

The site was initially replaced with a Presbyterian Theological Seminary.|$|E
25|$|By the 1870s Stepney {{contained}} {{many small}} houses with small backyards and no drainage. They {{were considered to}} be hotbeds of disease and fever. These houses, however, gave Stepney much of its racy nature with its inhabitants developing strength in their inevitable struggles with life. In the late 1870s these struggles evidenced themselves in the <b>pilfering</b> of firewood and the subsequent use of dynamite in planted logs by the firewood owners, to exact retribution.|$|E

25|$|After {{attempting}} to leave Spring Heeled Jack, Karcich temporarily filled in on drums for Mephiskapheles. He {{went on to}} audition for several other bands, including 2 Skinnee J's, before {{he was invited to}} join <b>Pilfers</b> who were looking to replace their rhythm section. Karcich performed as part of the second <b>Pilfers</b> lineup until they too disbanded. Afterward, he was a founding member of Cenzo with Pellegrino and former <b>Pilfers</b> bandmates, Vinny Nobile and Carl Barc. At the time of his death, {{he was a member of}} Avoid One Thing with Bosstones bass player, Joe Gittleman, Amy Griffin of Raging Teens and Paul Delano of Darkbuster. Although featured in the artwork for their self-titled debut, Karcich does not actually perform on the album.|$|R
25|$|It {{also gave}} the NA great power. Many independents {{walked away from}} the 1901 meeting. The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and {{submitted}} to the will of the 'majors.'

Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.|$|E
25|$|The October 26, 1929, {{edition of}} the Rhinebeck Gazette {{describes}} bins found in the top story or garret of the house. These were traditionally used to store grain {{out of the reach}} of <b>pilfering</b> Indians. However, there are more practical reasons that local grain was stored in the garret of the house. It was more secure from rodents in the barn and would have been a dryer atmosphere, because even when heat was not required, a fire for cooking was always burning in the fireplace.|$|E

25|$|When Curtis was eight, he and {{his brother}} Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a {{neighborhood}} gang whose main crimes were playing hooky from school and minor <b>pilfering</b> at the local dime store. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp, where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.|$|E
25|$|Group-foraging common ravens hoard {{their food}} {{in a number of}} places, and also raid the caches made by others. Cachers {{withdraw}} from conspecifics when hiding their food and usually place their caches behind structures, out of sight of potential observers. Raiders remain inconspicuous, keeping at a distance from cachers near their cache sites, but within sight. In response, cachers often interrupt caching, change cache sites, or empty their caches. These behaviours suggest that ravens can withhold information about their intentions, which may qualify as tactical deception. Similarly, if a Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) is being watched by another jay, it tends to cache food behind an opaque barrier rather than a transparent barrier, apparently to reduce the likelihood of other jays <b>pilfering</b> their caches.|$|E
25|$|Feeding {{intensity}} varies {{throughout the}} year, and is strongly correlated {{to changes in}} the precipitation and wind during cyclical shifts in the climate. Young fish tend to feed intensively throughout the year, but show a peak in the spring and autumn months, while adults intensify their feeding during the dry and rainy seasons, with feeding declining during intermediate periods (winter and early summer). Daily intakes during the period of intensive feeding reach 3–7% of the fishes body weight, and during the periods of decline to 0.5–2%, with the annual intake being 1000–1500% of the body weight. In a 1993 paper, Troy Baird reported a foraging association between bar jacks and puddingwife wrasse, Halichoeres radiatus, in which a jack followed a single wrasse while it foraged for food. These associations were initiated by both jacks and wrasse, with apparently little <b>pilfering</b> of uncovered items, suggesting a beneficial relationship to both parties. While foraging with the wrasse, the jack increases its prey detection levels, which is useful for a species which is more adept at pelagic hunting, allowing it to be more efficient at this less common mode of food gathering.|$|E

25|$|The role {{of forests}} in the {{national}} economy and in ecology was further emphasized in the 1988 National Forest Policy, which focused on ensuring environmental stability, restoring the ecological balance, and preserving the remaining forests. Other objectives of the policy were meeting the need for fuelwood, fodder, and small timber for rural and tribal people while recognising the need to actively involve local people {{in the management of}} forest resources. Also in 1988, the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was amended to facilitate stricter conservation measures. A new target was to increase the forest cover to 33% of India's land area from the then-official estimate of 23%. In June 1990, the central government adopted resolutions that combined forest science with social forestry, that is, taking the sociocultural traditions of the local people into. The cumulative area afforested during the 1951-91 period was nearly 179,000 square kilometres. However, despite large-scale tree planting programmes, forestry is one arena in which India has actually regressed since independence. Annual fellings at about four times the growth rate are a major cause. Widespread <b>pilfering</b> by villagers for firewood and fodder also represents a major decrement. In addition, the 1988 National Forest Policy noted, the forested area has been shrinking as a result of land cleared for farming and development programmes.|$|E
