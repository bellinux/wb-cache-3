5|$|The press {{themselves}} came in {{for some}} criticism in this respect, with the group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting complaining that the Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate on white, upper-middle-class women, and excluded the <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual immigrant childcare workers.|$|E
5|$|Women in Plymouth Colony {{had more}} {{extensive}} legal and social rights compared to 17th-century European norms.

5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often {{taught about}} the Raëlian <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body and sexuality. She {{discussed}} these topics from a biological perspective, arguing {{that humans are}} essentially robots {{because they can be}} reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.|$|E
5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} {{require that the}} official scorer view the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer {{is less likely to}} be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E

5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, Blue Shift is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment.|$|E

After release, a new capture the flag mode with additional levels, items and powerups, was created by Gearbox for the game.|$|E

5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socio-political systems and cultural {{distribution of the}} Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of Indus Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E
5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E
5|$|In Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of the {{animated}} film in which Sleeping Beauty is retold from the <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villain, Aurora is portrayed by actress Elle Fanning, while actress Janet McTeer voices an elderly {{version of the}} character {{in the role of}} film's narrator. The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by the fairy in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; Aurora affectionately refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, Aurora is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss to her forehead as opposed to a prince's. Aurora defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and the fairy kingdom known as the Moors.|$|E
