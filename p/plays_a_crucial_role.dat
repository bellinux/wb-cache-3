5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{far from}} land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space, usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land, {{it can be}} observed by land-based Doppler weather radar.

5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the immune system. The microorganisms {{that make up}} the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} has been adopted {{recently}} in Albanian folklore (around the 18th century), the clarinet, or gërneta as it is called, {{is one of the}} most important instruments in Albania, especially in the central and southern areas. The clarinet <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in saze (folk) ensembles that perform in weddings and other celebrations. It is worth mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental Albanian Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list) is characteristic of these ensembles. Prominent Albanian clarinet players include Selim Leskoviku, Gaqo Lena, Remzi Lela (Çobani), Laver Bariu (Ustai), and Nevruz Nure (Lulushi i Korçës).|$|E

5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
5|$|While the {{long-term}} potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems {{to provide an}} elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning {{at the level of}} the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from in vitro studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in fear processing.|$|E
5|$|In Episode One players {{make their}} way through a linear series of levels and {{encounter}} various enemies and allies. The gameplay is broken up between combat-oriented challenges and physics-based puzzles. Episode One integrates tutorial-like tasks into the story to familiarize the player with new gameplay mechanics without breaking immersion. A head-up display appears on the screen to display the character's health, energy, and ammunition. Throughout the course of the game, the player accesses new weapons and ammunition that are used to defend the character from enemy forces. Unlike in Half-Life 2, where Gordon's initial weapon is the crowbar, Gordon first acquires the Gravity Gun, which <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the game by allowing the player to use physics to manipulate objects at a distance in both combat and puzzle-solving scenarios.|$|E

5|$|Nicole also wreaked {{widespread}} property damage: of the 2,169 homes affected, 474 sustained {{severe damage}} while 54 were beyond repair. The losses totaled J$274.3million (US$3.2 million), J$75.6 million (US$890,000) hereof to replace destroyed housing units. With {{much of the}} island's crops and livestock washed away, including 40 percent of the season's banana produce, the agricultural sector suffered J$576.5 million (US$6.8million) in losses. The storm had a discernible impact on the environment, which <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the Jamaica's economy and tourism sectors. Surface runoff and spills along industrial zones and sewage systems infiltrated large stretches of land, leading to soil contamination, coastal erosion, and deteriorated ecosystems. In addition, there were traces of light damage to vegetation, such as uprooted trees.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes {{the cost of the}} base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
