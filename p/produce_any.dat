5|$|In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842, Ernest married 21-year-old Princess Alexandrine of Baden. She was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden, {{daughter of the}} deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father was disappointed that his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage did not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please her mother in one aspect – she did not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> surviving children.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September, the Allies {{commenced}} a 232 gun and 24 howitzer artillery barrage on the Bulgarian positions between Vardar and Doiran.

On the night of 17–18 September, Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine salvos of gas shells, however the attack failed to <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate training of the defenders.|$|E

5|$|Prince Henry {{showed no}} {{interest}} in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> children.

This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E
5|$|The low {{gradually}} weakened {{and became}} less conducive for severe weather development on May 6. Nonetheless, the SPC issued a moderate risk for severe storms over parts of central Kansas and northern Oklahoma as the trough remained in place.

The system finally left the area on May 7 and did not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> more significant severe weather.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{continued}} across Sydney Harbour {{and changed}} direction slightly {{to be heading}} north. It weakened after travelling over the Harbour, and was downgraded from a severe storm at 8:15pm. The Bureau of Meteorology had concluded that the storm would weaken after heading across Sydney Harbour, believing it was dissipating and would therefore not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> more substantial hail as it moved northward; therefore it did not issue warnings for the northern suburbs.|$|E

As part of the contract with Eon, McClory received 20% of the film's profits and undertook not to <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> other films based on the Thunderball story {{for a period of}} ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version in 1965.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E

5|$|After Aliens, id Software did not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> {{more games}} in the Commander Keen series besides the co-developed Galaxy. Another trilogy of episodes, titled The Universe Is Toast, was planned for December 1992, but was {{cancelled}} after the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. A final Keen game, Commander Keen, was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision. Aliens was included with the other id-developed series {{games in the}} 1996 id Anthology compilation release, but as the game had not been published through Apogee, it {{was not included in}} the 1998 Apogee Commander Keen compilation release, or the 2014 3D Realms Anthology release.|$|E
5|$|Around 1997, {{a number}} of Rare {{employees}} left to establish separate companies. The first was Eighth Wonder, underwritten by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which did not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary written sources about Mindaugas {{are very}} scarce. Much {{what is known}} about his reign is {{obtained}} from the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle and the Hypatian Codex. Both of these chronicles were produced by enemies of Lithuania and thus have anti-Lithuanian bias, particularly the Hypatian Codex. They are also incomplete: both of them lack dates and locations even for the most important events. For example, the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle devoted 125 poetry lines to Mindaugas's coronation, but failed to mention either the date or the location. Other important sources are the papal bulls regarding baptism and coronation of Mindaugas. The Lithuanians did not <b>produce</b> <b>any</b> surviving records themselves, except for a series of acts granting lands to the Livonian Order, but their authenticity is disputed. Due to lack of sources, some important questions regarding Mindaugas and his reign cannot be answered.|$|E
