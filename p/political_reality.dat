5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King. The High King was drawn {{from the ranks of}} the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E
5|$|King Philip, who {{ascended the}} Spanish throne in 1556, {{acknowledged}} the new <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> and cultivated his sister-in-law. She {{was a better}} ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, {{who had grown up}} in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir. On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E

5|$|The ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}} {{within the}} kingdom of Somairle's predecessors was the far-flung Diocese of the Isles. Little is known of its early history, although its origins may well lie with the Uí Ímair imperium. In the mid twelfth century, {{during the reign of}} Ragnall's maternal uncle Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles (died 1187), the diocese came to be incorporated into the newly established Norwegian Archdiocese of Nidaros. In effect, the <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> of the Diocese of the Isles—its territorial borders and nominal subjection to Norwayappears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles. Before the close of the twelfth century, however, evidence of a new ecclesiastical jurisdictionthe Diocese of Argyllbegins to emerge during ongoing contentions between the meic Somairle and the Crovan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed with Russia's lack {{of support}} for any serious reforms in Poland, he shifted to favoring an {{alliance}} with the Kingdom of Prussia instead. Although this resulted in the split of the anti-royalist opposition, he {{was seen as the}} leader of opposition (the Patriotic Party) when the Great Sejm begun in 1788. After some initial political manevrouving, the issues of a closer relation with Prussia (that would eventually grew into the Polish-Prussian alliance) and a major reform of the government, both with which he was closely involved, begun accelerating in 1789. At first supportive more of a republican form of a government, <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> (such as royal faction victory at the elections of 1790) resulted in his acceptance of a more constitutional monarchy approach. In 1790, through the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, the king and Potocki begun drifting closer together, working on a draft document that would eventually become the 3 May 1791 constitution. Alongside Poniatowski, Kołłątaj and Piattoli, he is seen as one of the major authors of that document. He supported the quasi-coup d'état in which the constitution was passed on 3 May 1791.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s the Czech {{poet and}} former Esperantist Ladislav Podmele (1920–2000), also known under his {{pseudonym}} Jiří Karen, worked {{for several years}} {{with a team of}} prominent interlinguists on an elaborate project, Mežduslavjanski jezik ("Interslavic language"). Among other things, they wrote a grammar, an Esperanto–Interslavic word list, a dictionary, a course and a textbook. Although none of those were ever published, the project gained some attention of linguists from various countries. Probably due to the <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> of those days, this language was primarily based on Russian.|$|E

Meanwhile, in the 17 years since the original law, Spanish society had undergone many cultural, technological and socioeconomic changes that affected people's ways of life and affected the country's patterns of disease and illness. These posed new challenges to the National Health System.|$|E
25|$|Growth spilled {{past the}} city's {{southern}} boundary, into Groesbeckville, an unincorporated hamlet of the Town of Bethlehem. It went from almost no residents in 1845 to {{over a thousand}} ten years later. Its streets, too, were organized on a grid pattern, but one slightly offset from Albany's, a pattern still visible today. By the 1860s, residents of the hamlet were being listed in Albany's city directory and considered themselves socially and culturally {{to be part of}} the city. In 1870 their petition to make this a legal and <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> was accepted and the city's boundary was extended a mile (1.6km) to the south, to its present location along the Normans Kill, creating the area of Albany known as the First Ward.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, many camp residents ended up living in temporary shelters elsewhere. The camp itself became the site of intense efforts at documenting, recording and expressing the experiences of those displaced and affected by the incursion. In discussing how to properly honor those who had fallen, one proposal suggested leaving the destruction, at least in the Hawashin neighborhood, exactly as it was, as a memorial and testament to struggle and sacrifice. Camp residents, however, insisted that the camp be rebuilt almost exactly as it had been, while also establishing a museum of memory in the Old Hijaz Railway building. They rejected the proposal of the Israeli housing minister to rebuild the camp at a nearby site with enlarged roads, viewing it as an attempt to erase the <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> of the camps whose existence they see as living testaments to the 1948 Palestinian exodus.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} frontier cities once {{marked the}} boundary of the Land of Israel, or the extent of places repopulated after the return from Babylonian exile. In a broader sense, the list of frontier towns and villages herein named represent the geographical limits of regulations imposed upon all agricultural produce, making them fully liable to tithing and to sabbatical-year restrictions within that same border, or, {{in the event of}} being purchased from the common people of the land, to separate therefrom only the demai-tithe. As one moved further east of Achziv, the border extended northward, into what are now portions of south Lebanon, and as far east as places in the present-day Kingdom of Jordan. While the settlements here named reflect a historical reality, bearing heavily on Jewish legal law (Halacha), they did not always reflect a <b>political</b> <b>reality,</b> insofar that the political borders have since changed owing to a long history of occupiers and conquerors.|$|E
25|$|It {{may have}} been {{in the context of this}} ecclesiastical crisis in the Isles that Guðrøðr {{undertook}} his journey to Norway in 1152. Guðrøðr's overseas objective, therefore, {{may have been}} to secure the patronage of a Scandinavian metropolitan willing to protect the Diocese of the Isles. Certainly, Guðrøðr's stay in Norway coincided with the Scandinavian visit of the papal legate Nicholas Breakspeare, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano (died 1159), a man who had been tasked to create Norwegian and Swedish ecclesiastical provinces in order to further extend the papacy's authority into the northern European periphery. Eventually the newly created Norwegian provincethe Archdiocese of Niðaróssencompassed eleven dioceses within and outwith mainland Norway. One such overseas diocese was that of the Isles, officially incorporated within the province in November 1154. Although Óláfr did not live long enough to witness the latter formality, it is evident that the remarkable overseas statecraft undertaken by Óláfr and Guðrøðr secured their kingdom's ecclesiastical and secular independence from nearby Dublin. The establishment of the Norwegian archdiocese bound outlying Norse territories closer to Norwegian royal power. In effect, the <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> of the Diocese of the Islesits territorial borders and nominal subjection to far-off Norwayappears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles.|$|E

500|$|In {{the order}} of {{precedence}} King's Serjeants came before all other barristers, even the Attorney-General, until the introduction of King's Counsel. This state of affairs {{came to an end}} as a result of two changes – firstly, during the reign of James I, when a royal patent gave the Attorney General precedence over all King's Serjeants [...] "except the two ancientiest", and secondly in 1814 when the Attorney General of the time was a barrister and the Solicitor General (politically junior to the Attorney General) a King's Serjeant.
