Accurate {{estimates}} of the errors on the cosmological <b>parameters</b> <b>inferred</b> <b>from</b> cosmic shear surveys require accurate esti-mates of the covariance of the cosmic shear correlation functions. Aims. We seek approximations to the cosmic shear covariance that are as easy to use as the common approximations based on normal (Gaussian) statistics, but yield more accurate covariance matrices and parameter errors. Methods. We derive expressions for the cosmic shear covariance {{under the assumption that}} the underlying convergence field follows log-normal statistics. We also derive a simplified version of this log-normal approximation by only retaining the most important terms beyond normal statistics. We use numerical simulations of weak lensing to study how well the normal, log-normal, and simplified log-normal approximations as well as empirical corrections to the normal approximation proposed in the literature reproduce shear covariances for cosmic shear surveys. We also investigate the resulting confidence regions for cosmological <b>parameters</b> <b>inferred</b> <b>from</b> such surveys. Results. We find that the normal approximation substantially underestimates the cosmic shear covariances and the <b>inferred</b> <b>parameter</b> confidence regions, in particular for surveys with small fields of view and large galaxy densities, but also for very wide surveys.

These systems show a spuriously large correlation amplitude, an effect that is present and even stronger in a subsample whose angular positions coincide with 3 -dimensional identified clusters.

Further investigation is devoted to special classes of homeoidally striated ellipsoids, defined as homeoidally striated, Jacobi ellipsoids. In particular, virial equilibrium configurations with constant anisotropy parameters are studied with more detail, including both flattened and elongated, triaxial configurations, and {{the determination of the}} related bifurcation points. The explicit expression of different rotation parameters is also determined. An application is made to dark matter haloes hosting giant, galaxies, with regard to assigned initial and final configuration, following and generalizing to many respects a procedure conceived by Thuan & Gott (1975). The dependence of the limiting axis ratios, below which no configuration is allowed for the sequence under consideration, on the change in mass, total energy, and angular momentum, during the evolution, is illustrated in some representative situations. The dependence of axis ratios and rotation parameters on an additional parameter, related to the initial conditions of the density perturbation, is analysed in connection with a few special cases. Within the range of Peebles (1969) rotation <b>parameter,</b> <b>inferred</b> <b>from</b> high-resolution numerical simulations, the shape of dark matter haloes is mainly decided by the amount of anisotropy in residual velocity distribution.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) radiation have shown an apparent tension with the present value of the Hubble <b>parameter</b> <b>inferred</b> <b>from</b> local observations of supernovae, which look closer, i. e. brighter, than what is expected in a homogeneous model with a value of $H_ 0 $ equal to the one estimated from CMB observations. We examine the possibility that such a discrepancy is the consequence of the presence of a local inhomogeneity seeded by primordial curvature perturbations, finding that a negative peak of the order of less than two standard deviations could allow to fit low red-shift supernovae observations without the need of using a value of the Hubble parameter different from $H_ 0 ^{CMB}$. The type of inhomogeneity we consider does not modify the distance to the last scattering, making it compatible with the constraints of the PLANCK mission data. Our calculation is fully relativistic and non perturbative, and for this reason shows important effects which were missed in the previous investigations using relativistic perturbations or Newtonian approximations, because the structures seeded by primordial curvature perturbations can be today highly non linear, and relativist Doppler terms cannot be neglected. Comparison with studies of local structure based on galaxy surveys and luminosity density analysis reveals that the density profile we find could in fact be compatible with the one obtained for the same region of sky where is located most of the Cepheids used to calibrate the luminosity distance of the supernovae employed for the local $H_ 0 $ estimation, suggesting a possible directional dependence and calibration bias which could be partially attributed to the presence of the Sloan Great Wall. Comment: New updated references have been added. Some more information has been included about the region of sky in which the density profile predicted by our model is in agreement with luminosity density and galaxy surveys observations. Our model predicts the consequent overall supernovae luminosity distance calibration bias effect due to the presence in that region of the Cepheid...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy balance}} of the Earth is {{regulated}} in part by ice clouds, which both reflect shortwave solar radiation and absorb infrared radiation from the Earth. These clouds appear frequently worldwide, with up to 70 % coverage in tropical regions. The microphysics of ice clouds determines their radiative properties, and is important for accurately predicting the role of ice clouds in Earth?s energy balance. However, describing the microphysics of ice clouds remains a challenging problem, {{especially with regard to}} the shape of ice particles and the degree of ice particle surface roughening. In-situ studies have found evidence for ice surface roughness and have found many complex ice geometries; however, these studies are limited spatially and temporally. An approach which allows large-scale analysis is to retrieve these properties via theoretical modeling using satellite observations of polarized reflectance from ice clouds, since polarized reflectance is sensitive to the shape and roughness of ice particles. The theoretical model requires the scattering properties of simulated ice particles. These properties are obtained for 10 different ice shapes and 17 different levels of surface roughness. Simulations are performed for 3 different effective ice particle diameters: 30, 60 and 90 ?m. Overall, the retrieved shape is dominated by the compact aggregate of columns. Although the exact composition of shapes varies from month to month, the compact aggregate of columns remains the most commonly retrieved shape. The retrieved roughness varies from moderately rough at ? = 0. 1 to severely rough at ? = 0. 5. Retrieved roughness varies more than shape, and smooth surfaced ice is most prominent in January. Tropical regions tend to have ice particles that are more roughened, while the midlatitudes and polar regions tend to have more smooth ice. In almost all cases, roughened ice represents > 60 % of the total retrievals. The asymmetry <b>parameter</b> <b>inferred</b> <b>from</b> the retrieval of ice particle shape and roughness has a mean value near 0. 77, with only small differences based on assumed ice effective diameter.

40|$|The {{surface of}} the solid Earth is {{effectively}} stress free in its subaerial portions, and hydrostatic beneath the oceans. Unfortunately, this type of boundary condition is difficult to treat computationally, and for computational convenience, numerical models have often used simpler approximations that do not involve a normal stress-loaded, shear-stress free top surface that is free to move. Viscous flow models with a computational free surface typically confront stability problems when the time step is bigger than the viscous relaxation time. The small time step required for stability (< 2. Kyr) makes this type of model computationally intensive, so there remains a need to develop strategies that mitigate the stability problem by making larger (at least ~ 10 Kyr) time steps stable and accurate. Here we present a new free-surface stabilization algorithm for finite element codes which solves the stability problem by adding to the Stokes formulation an intrinsic penalization term equivalent to {{a portion of the}} future load at the surface nodes. Our algorithm is straightforward to implement and can be used with both Eulerian or Lagrangian grids. It includes α and β parameters to respectively control both the vertical and the horizontal slope-dependent penalization terms, and uses Uzawa-like iterations to solve the resulting system at a cost comparable to a non-stress free surface formulation. Four tests were carried out in order to study the accuracy and the stability of the algorithm: (1) a decaying first-order sinusoidal topography test, (2) a decaying high-order sinusoidal topography test, (3) a Rayleigh-Taylor instability test, and (4) a steep-slope test. For these tests, we investigate which α and β parameters give the best results in terms of both accuracy and stability. We also compare the accuracy and the stability of our algorithm with a similar implicit approach recently developed by Kaus et al. (2010). We find that our algorithm is slightly more accurate and stable for steep slopes, and also conclude that, for longer time steps, the optimal α controlling factor for both approaches is ~ 2 / 3, instead of the 1 / 2 Crank-Nicolson <b>parameter</b> <b>inferred</b> <b>from</b> a linearized accuracy analysis.
