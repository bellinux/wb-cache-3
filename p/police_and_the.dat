5|$|Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had {{put forward}} three {{options for the}} future of the mounted police: the force could be absorbed into the Canadian military; the remit of the force could be reduced to simply {{policing}} the far north; or the force could be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.|$|E
