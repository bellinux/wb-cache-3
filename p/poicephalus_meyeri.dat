50|$|Meyer's parrot {{or brown}} parrot (<b>Poicephalus</b> <b>meyeri)</b> is a smallish (about 21 cm, 90-130g) but stocky African parrot. Meyer's parrots display the black head, back and tail, green or blue-green abdomen, blue rump and bright yellow {{markings}} on the carpal joint of the wings. Most subspecies have some yellow {{on the top}} of the head as well. Forshaw (1989) recognizes six subspecies of P. meyeri which vary in home range, size and in markings, including the extent of yellow markings to the head and wings and the intensity of turquoise markings on the abdomen and rump. Its name commemorates the German ornithologist Bernhard Meyer.|$|E

Studies on Zebra Finches Poephila guttata suggest that the juveniles learn their songs from a vocal tutor, their father. In this study we examine the subsongs in six captive-born Meyer's Parrots <b>Poicephalus</b> <b>meyeri,</b> from fledging time to weaning. Recordings of songs from chicks and fathers were analyzed for similarities in frequency and time parameters. With age, the subsongs of the chicks became more similar to the vocalizations of the fathers with 20 % similarity rating in the first week after fledging to 100 % at weaning time. Moreover, fledged chicks were exposed {{to a wide range of}} stimuli from several species of parrots breeding pairs caged nearby but chicks exclusively learned their fathers' songs. Our data support the hypothesis that Meyer's Parrots are vocal learners and use their father as their tutor. Os ''subsongs'' são ensaios vocais emitidos pelas aves jovens para exercitar suas vozes. Nos pássaros canoros, ''subsongs'' são exibidos por indivíduos em seu primeiro ano de vida. Estudos com Poephila guttata sugerem que os jovens aprendem seus cantos de um tutor vocal, seu pai. Neste trabalho examinamos os ''subsongs'' em seis papagaios <b>Poicephalus</b> <b>meyeri</b> nascidos em cativeiro, desde a saída do ninho até a emancipação. Gravações dos cantos dos filhotes e dos pais foram analisadas para medir as similaridades nos parâmetros de freqüência e tempo. Com a idade, os ''subsongs'' dos filhotes viraram mais semelhantes às vocalizações dos pais, com 20 % de similaridade na primeira semana após a saída do ninho até 100 % na hora da emancipação. Ademais, os filhotes foram expostos a uma grande variedade de estímulos de várias outras espécies de papagaios nidificando em gaiolas vizinhas, mas eles aprenderam somente os cantos de seus pais. Nossos dados confirmam a hipótese de que esta espécie de papagaio tem aprendizagem vocal e utilizam o pai como tutor...|$|E
