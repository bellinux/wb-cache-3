40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of different polishing methods on color stability of posterior, universal and nanohybrid composite resin restorative materials upon exposure to a staining agent. Twenty-five specimens were prepared for each of 5 different composite resins (Filtek Z 250, Filtek P 60, Quadrant LC, Grandio and Filtek Supreme). Specimens were divided into 5 groups and different polishing procedures, including <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> (Pd), <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> then diamond <b>polishing</b> paste (PdP), <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> then a liquid polishing system (Biscover) (PdB), and combinations of these (PdPB) were used. Unpolished specimens served as the control (C). The specimens were stored for 48 h in a coffee solution. The color of all specimens was measured before and after exposure with a colorimeter, and total color change (DE*) were calculated. The data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA and the means were compared by Tukey HSD test (a= 0. 05). The lowest color difference was observed in the groups PdP and C, while the highest color difference was observed in PdPB, and PdB. When comparing the five different restorative materials, no significant difference was observed between FiltekP 60 and FiltekZ 250, and these materials demonstrated significantly less color change than Quadrant LC and the nanohybrid materials (Grandio, Filtek Supreme). The posterior (Filtek P 60) and universal (Filtek Z 250) composite resin restorative materials, which do not contain tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), were found to be less stainable than the nanohybrid (Grandio, Filtek Supreme) and universal (Quadrant LC) composite resins, which contain TEGDMA.

Key words: Polishing, surface roughness, microhybrid composite, nanocomposite, Sof-Lex XT, Spiral Wheels, Enhance, Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Zircon-Brite, Dura-White stones, Mylar strips Methods: The composites {{used in this}} study were Filtek Supreme XTE (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) and Z 100 (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA). Thirty-five composite samples were made from each of the two composites. Uncured composite was placed into an aluminium ring mould, 10 mm X 2 mm. Both the upper and lower surfaces of the composite were covered with Mylar strips and glass plates, before the specimens were cured for 40 seconds from both sides. Samples were randomly divided into seven groups. The groups were: 1. Mylar polyester strip (control) 2. Sof-Lex XT finishing and <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 3. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 4. Dura-White stones (Shofu Inc, Kyoto, Japan) 5. Intensiv UniglossCellbrush (Intensiv SA, Montagnola, Switzerland) 6. Enhance finishing and polishing system (Dentsply, Milford, USA) 7. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels combined with Zircon-Brite (Dental Ventures of America, Corona, USA) The polishing of the specimens was performed by a single operator according to manufacturer s instructions. The mean surface roughness of each specimen was determined using a profilometer (Surftest SJ 210, Mitutoyo, Tokyo, Japan). Three readings were collected from each specimen. Data was statistically analysed using ANOVA. Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL JSM- 5800 LV, Tokyo, Japan) photos were taken of the representative samples. Results: Statistically significant differences in surface roughness were observed between the following groups: Z 100 and Filtek Supreme XTE with the polishing systems combined (p= 0. 005); Control group vs all the polishing systems; Sof-Lex XT finishing and <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv Unigloss Cellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Dura-White stones vs Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system, Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001); Intensiv UniglossCellbrush vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p< 0. 0001); Enhance finishing and polishing system vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Filtek Supreme XTE displayed significantly better polishability and lower surface roughness values after polishing than Z 100. The composite samples cured against the Mylar polyester strip produced significantly smoother surface roughness values than all the polishing systems tested in this study. The following polishing systems led to the smoothest surfaces after polishing: Sof-lex Spiral Wheels in combination with Zircon-Brite, as well as the Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels and Sof-Lex finishing and <b>polishing</b> <b>discs.</b> These systems were significantly smoother than the Enhance system used in combination with Prisma Gloss polishing paste, and also the one-step polishing system Intensiv UniglossCellbrush.

40|$|Background/purpose: There {{is a lack}} of {{information}} in the few studies reporting on the stainability of dental porcelain materials. However no studies have been found that investigated effects of polishing methods and staining agents on the color stability of dental porcelains. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of different polishing techniques on the color stability of various dental porcelains. Materials and methods: Fifty-five specimens were prepared for each of feldspathic (Vita VMK 95, Ceramco III), low-fusing porcelain (Matchmaker), and machinable feldspathic porcelain blocks (Vitablocs Mark II). The prepared specimens were divided into 11 groups (n =  5) representing different polishing techniques including a control (no surface treatment), glaze, and nine other groups which were finished and polished with a <b>polishing</b> <b>disc</b> (Sof-Lex), two porcelain polishing kits (NTI, Dialite II), a diamond polishing paste (Sparkle), a zirconium silicate-based cleaning and polishing prophy paste (Zircate), an aluminum oxide polishing paste (Prisma Gloss), and combinations of these. Specimens were stored for 48  hours at 37 °C in a coffee solution. The color of all specimens was measured with a colorimeter before and after exposure, and color changes (ΔE) were calculated. Data were analyzed with a two-way analysis of variance, and mean values were compared by the Tukey’s honest significant difference test (α =  0. 05). Results: When comparing the four different porcelain materials, Ceramco III demonstrated the highest ΔE value. No significant difference was observed among the porcelain material groups of Mark II, Matchmaker MC, and VMK 95 (P =  0. 074). When comparing the polishing techniques, the lowest ΔE values were observed in Group Gl for all porcelain materials tested. No significant difference was observed among Groups Sl, Di, and Pk, (P =  0. 883), and these Groups demonstrated significantly higher ΔE values than Group Gl (P <  0. 05). Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, the results suggest that feldspathic and low-fusing porcelain specimens were found to be more color-stable for glazed specimens versus polished specimens regardless of whether they were stained with the coffee solution. Glazed and polished specimens with different polishing materials demonstrated that the ΔE values were at an acceptable level for all of the porcelain materials tested (1  < ΔE <  3. 7) ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies are}} {{being done to}} {{understand}} acoustic to electromagnetic conversion in rocks, [1], {{mainly because of the}} so-called seismo-electromagnetic phenomena (SEMG). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, most of them disregard a preliminary analysis of the electrical transport occurring in these rocks. These are, in fact, crucial to understand any electromagnetic process occurring in the materials since they clarify the transport mechanism (typically in rocks it is ionic, but it could also be tunnelling, among others), the energies involved (typically 1 - 100 meV), charge accumulation effects, and many other aspects. Thus, we believe that it deserves more attention by researchers. The objective of this work is, indeed, to initiate a detailed analysis of the electrical transport in various rocks using our experience with other materials [2]. As a start three different granitic samples with different mineralogical content have been studied: the ﬁrst is a coarse grained biotitic granite, yellow coloured and characterized by an abundance of large feldspar megacrystals usually showing poorly deﬁned shapes, the second is a quartz diorite grey coloured and medium grained rock with homogeneous appearance, dominantly biotitic, and the third is a medium grained homogeneous pophyroid granite, with light rosy colour determined by the tonality of the feldspar crystals that stand out from a greyish with matrix containing dark grains. Moreover, granites are abundant in the lithosphere and should, in principle, play a fundamental role in (SEMG). Circular samples with approximately 24 mm diameter and 2 - 4 mm in thicknesses were prepared. Once cut and carefully polished (with a 15 m <b>polishing</b> <b>disc)</b> the samples here heated from room-temperature up to 400 K and after cooled down again. Circular electrodes with a diameter of 20 mm were then established using silver conductive paint. The samples were submitted again to a heat treatment at 400 K to evaporate the silver paint solvent. After this preparation procedure the samples were attached to a sample holder and inserted in a bath cryostat. Moreover, the focus of this work is to elucidate the effect of conﬁned water in the electrical transport properties for temperatures ranging from 80 K up 400 K. The presence of conﬁned water was observed through an anomaly in the dielectric behaviour near T ~ 220 K. This temperature is typical of the super-cooled phase transition of strongly conﬁned water affecting electronic devises [3]. Thus, in this work we explore this anomaly in the three different natural rock samples mentioned above. Other techniques used in the literature can also be considered like thermal stimulated depolarization current [4] to characterize transport mechanisms. [1] F. Vallianatos, and D.

When comparing the 4 different porcelain materials, the machinable feldspathic porcelain block group (Mark II) demonstrated statistically significantly less Ra values than the other porcelain materials tested (p< 0. 05). No significant difference was observed between the VMK 95 and Ceramco III porcelain groups (p= 0. 919), also these groups demonstrated the highest Ra values. CONCLUSION: Subjected to surface roughness, the surfaces obtained with polishing and/or cleaning-prophy paste materials used alone were rougher compared to the surfaces finished using Sof-lex, Dialite, and NTI polishing kit. <b>Polishing</b> kits and <b>discs</b> were found more effective than the polishing pastes used alone or combined use with Sof-lex discs, thus improving surface smoothness...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Objectives:Substances {{leaching}} from denture- {{base polymers}} {{have been associated}} with cytotoxicity and allergic reactions. This study examined the effect of polishing,mixing ratios, water immersion temperatures and different thicknesses on the sorption and solubility of a heat-polymerized, denture-base polymer. The effect of different water immersion temperatures on the flexural strength of the denture base, was tested as well. The next component of this study, is the testing of the most significant sorption and solubility findings on in vitro cell viability. Materials and Methods:Disc shaped specimens from a heat-polymerized, denture-base polymer (Vertex®) were prepared, based on ISO 1567 specifications for sorption and solubility testing, following the manufacturers’ instructions. The following tests were performed: 1) Sorption and solubility of two groups (n = 12 each) of <b>polished</b> and unpolished <b>discs</b> were established and compared by means of the Mixed procedure; 2) Sorption and solubility of three groups (n = 12 each) with different mixing ratios were compared by means of the Mixed procedure; 3) Four groups (n = 14 each) were immersed in water at different temperatures, sorption and solubility were compared by means of pairwise comparison and the Median test; 4) Specimens with different thicknesses (n = 36) were compared, again, by means of pairwise comparison and the Median test; 5) To test the influence of different water-soaking temperatures on the flexural strength of the disc, strips were prepared from the disc used in test no. 3. The flexural strength was compared, by means of the Median test; 6) To test the influence of no postpolymerization treatment, polishing and water immersion on the cytotoxicity of mouse fibroblast cells, (n = 9) for each test group, were prepared. A preliminary test was performed beforehand, over a period of 24 hours, up to a maximum period of four weeks. The Balb/c 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast cells were cultured and incubated for 24 hours in Eagles medium. Eluates prepared from the disc and medium without any disc (control) replaced the medium. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-assay. Optical density values were obtained at 24 and 48 hour intervals. The data was analyzed by means of the Means procedure. Results:In the entire thesis, the data was analyzed using SAS on a 0. 01 probability level. Between polished and unpolished groups, no significant difference in water sorption (p> 0. 01) was found, but there was a difference in solubility (p< 0. 01). Different mixing ratios did not alter sorption (p = 0. 34) or solubility (p = 0. 68). However, a difference (p< 0. 01) in sorption and solubility was found among the different temperature and thickness groups. Soaking the denture base in water at different temperatures did not alter its flexural strength (p = 0. 48). Cell viability levels were noted in all the experimental groups in the MTT assay test. The analysis was a two-factor study, with one factor being the group, and the other, being time. The interaction between these factors was found to be significant, indicating that the effect of the groups varied by time (and vice versa). Conclusion:The processes of the soaking in warm water and the polishing of a denture-base polymer, reduce its solubility. Therefore, it is recommended that dentures are soaked in warm water before polishing. Within the limits of this study, the mixing ratios may be changed without affecting sorption or solubility. As solubility increases within the increasing denture-base thickness, it is recommended that unnecessarily thick dentures be avoided. Short- and long-term exposure to eluates of a PMMA, has a negative effect on cell viability. For water-stored and <b>polished</b> <b>discs,</b> this effect is time-dependent, with a higher viability for 48 hours’, than for 24 hours eluates. Polishing is associated with lower solubility. At 24 hours, the <b>polished</b> <b>discs,</b> indeed, had a lower cytotoxic effect than the untreated discs: it may be recommended that dentures be polished on the fitting surface as well. The cytotoxic potential of PMMA-eluates appears to fluctuate over time...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{hypothesis}} tested {{was that}} processing, pre-cementation and cementation techniques can modify the profilometrically measured deformation of a ceramic. Methods: Three-point flexural moduli of a resin-cement were characterised following light irradiation at 430 and 180 mWcm- 2. Thirty IPS e. max Ceram discs were prepared and a reference surface produced by <b>polishing.</b> <b>Discs</b> were annealed, alumina particle air abraded and resin-coated. Profilometric evaluation was performed following each pre-cementation or cementation operative technique using a contact diamond stylus profilometer. Bi-axial flexure {{strength of the}} resin-coated discs, light irradiated at 430 and 180 mWcm- 2 (Groups A and B), and the un-coated discs (Group C) was determined. Data were analysed by a {{one-way analysis of variance}} with post-hoc Tukey tests (P < 0. 05), or repeat measure analyses when appropriate. Results: Annealing (at 510 degC for 40 mins) resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0. 001) in the characterised mean deflection, as did alumina particle air-abrasion (P < 0. 001). Resin-cement coating significantly increased the mean deflection for Group A and B (P < 0. 001) specimens against the uncoated state. Furthermore no significant impact of increasing time or irradiation intensity on the mean deflection was identified. The mean bi-axial flexure strength was significantly increased (P < 0. 001) after resin-coating (Groups A and B) when compared with Group C specimens although no difference between Groups A and B specimens (P = 0. 291) was identified. Conslusion: The results of the profilometric technique in combination with the strength supported a strengthening mechanism sensitive to shrinkage stress generation associated with the polymerisation of resin-cements...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{such thing}} as a {{standard}} technique for composite finishing and polishing. Many methods can create a high-shine polish. Composite surfaces are finished and polished to improve their esthetic quality and to protect them against the aggressive oral environment and colonization by microorganisms. Patients want their restorations to feel smooth against their tongues and to have a pleasing appearance. Excess composite can be removed with scalpels, scalers, or abrasive stones and discs. Interproximal areas can be treated with interdental strips or oscillating systems with diamond-coated inserts. Normally, dentists also use rotary instruments. Suitable types of carbide finishers have a clear advantage over fine-grit diamond burs in this step: they work selectively, which means they “differentiate ” between soft composite and hard enamel and thus help to conserve the natural tooth structure. In contrast to diamonds, carbide finishers perform a cutting, rather than grinding, action: ie, they remove material in the form of chips. The hardened metal blades act by means of plastic de-formation of the substrate and deformation-associated shear forces occurring between blades and surface. 1 As a result, car-bide finishers with a sufficient number of blades (20, 30, or 40) produce smoother surfaces than diamond finishers. Surprisingly, the roughness values may be better than those obtained by the use of aluminum oxide-coated <b>polishing</b> <b>discs,</b> which are fre-quently regarded as the standard tools for composite polishing. 2 SUITABLE AND UNSUITABLE FINISHERS However, not all carbide finishers are equally suitable. Working parts with nonrounded angles may damage composite and, in particular,enamel surfaces. 3 This disadvantage applies to burs wit...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the nanoleakage patterns of four dentin bonding systems. Methods: The dentin bonding systems used in this study were: Single Bond, One Coat Bond, Prime & Bond NT/Non Rinse Conditioner (NRC), and PermaQuik. Flat occlusal dentin surfaces from extracted human molars were finished with wet 600 -grit silicon carbide paper, and bonded with one of the dentin bonding systems. After 24 h storage at 37 °C in water, margins were finished with <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> and the surrounding tooth surfaces coated with nail varnish. The samples were immersed in a 50 % (w/v) solution of silver nitrate for 24 h, and exposed to photodeveloping solution for 8 h. The samples were cut longitudinally, polished, and mounted on stubs, carbon coated and observed in a Field Emission-SEM using backscattered electron mode. Results: Different nanoleakage patterns were observed with the different adhesive systems. However, accumulations of silver particles were often noted at the base of the hybrid layer for all materials. Single Bond and One Coat Bond demonstrated uptake of silver particles both within the hybrid layer and the adhesive resin. Prime & Bond NT/NRC showed silver staining throughout almost the entire thickness of the hybrid layer. The leakage pattern of PermaQuik revealed loose silver deposition within the hybrid layer. The composition of each adhesive system may play a role in forming the different leakage patterns. Significance: The current dentin bonding systems used in this study do not achieve perfect sealing at the restoration/dentin interface, which may influence the durability of the bond to dentin. © 2000 Academy of Dental Materials.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess enamel surface under {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) after resin removal and enamel polishing procedures following brackets debonding, as well as compare the time required for these procedures. METHODS: A total of 180 deciduous bovine incisors were used. The enamel surface of each tooth was prepared and brackets were bonded with light cured Transbond XT composite resin. Brackets were removed in a testing machine. The samples were randomized and equally distributed into nine groups according to the resin removal and polishing technique: Group 1, 30 -blade tungsten carbide bur in high speed; Group 2, 30 -blade tungsten carbide bur in high speed followed by a sequence of 4 Sof-lex <b>polishing</b> <b>discs</b> (3 M); Group 3, 30 -blade tungsten carbide bur in high speed followed by Enhance tips (Dentsply). All groups were subdivided into (a) unpolished; (b) polished with aluminum oxide paste; and (c) polished with water slurry of fine pumice. Subsequently, the enamel surface was assessed and statistical analysis was carried out. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in enamel roughness and removal time among all groups. Groups 3 a, 3 b and 3 c {{appeared to be the}} most efficient methods of removing resin with low damages to enamel. Groups 2 a, 2 b and 2 c were the most time consuming procedures, and Group 2 a caused more damages to enamel.

MethodsThirty patients received sixty different restorations. The distributions of materials and the teeth locations were randomized. Class V cavity was prepared according to caries extension. For cavities to be restored with composite a 1  mm bevel {{was placed on the}} enamel margin to increase the surface area for bonding. adhesives were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Grandio SO with its adhesive and Ketac N 100 restorative materials were applied following manufacturer's instructions. Finishing and polishing was performed using finishing burs and <b>polishing</b> <b>discs.</b> Each restoration was clinically evaluated at base line (24  h), 6 months and after one year using USPHS criteria. ResultsThe recall rate was (81. 7 %) after 1 year. Survival rate for Grandio SO restorations were (85. 185 %) while for Ketac N 100, it was (100 %) after one year of clinical service. Using Friedman test, a significant difference was recorded between the tested materials when the effect of time was tested on restoration fracture, color match, anatomic form, marginal adaptation and recurrence of caries. Using Fischer's exact test, a significant difference was recorded between tested groups regarding restoration fracture, color match. Anatomic form, recurrence of caries, marginal discoloration and postoperative hypersensitivity. ConclusionMost of the restorations maintained good quality during the observation period, which was considered a short evaluation time. Clinical implicationsGrandio SO and Ketac N 100 achieved clinically acceptable results after one year of service. So both materials may be used with confidence in Class V carious lesions. A longer evaluation period may be recommended to decide the use of restorative material safely in Class V cavities...|$|R
