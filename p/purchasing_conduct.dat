Hundreds of summary proceedings led to administrative fines ranging from 500 to 3000 euros. The standard rate for the illegal sale of one bottle of spirits is 1500 euros. Thus, alcohol trap purchases bring a return of around €2 million annually.

Let us further assume there are only two facilities, i.e., M_ 1 = { A, B}, then the choice set is { (A, 10),..., (B, 10),...,(B, 30)}. A choice of (A, 20) means that the customer chooses to make a purchase of € 20 at facility A. Note, the choice set must be exhaustive and the choice alternatives have to be mutually exclusive.

With respect to the general investigation of auctions, the request for quote is the mirror image of a first price sealed bid auction and has the same symmetric Nash equilibrium. However, the request for quote allows identification of simple behavioral rules such as always bidding a percentage of your signal, which is indistinct from Nash equilibrium strategies in the sell auction counterpart. Consequently we estimate that one-fourth of the subjects follow a simple mark-up rule and approximately two-thirds follow a strategic Nash equilibrium strategy...|$|R

Results from a pilot study and two mixed design experiments indicate that, on average, consumers focus more on brand equity than on sustainability levels when they make brand choices. While the disclosure of credible information for brands within a product category affects brand-level sustainability perceptions, there are limited effects on brand purchase intentions and choices. Results also reveal a consumer misconception that nationally recognized brands are more sustainable. Implications of results are offered for producers, retailers, and public policy makers...|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyse the risks and benefits of this development to poor urban consumers in Vietnam. The analysis is based on surveys of food <b>purchasing</b> practices <b>conducted</b> in Hanoi from 2004 to 2006. It shows that poor consumers depend on a diversified network of formal and informal outlets to ensure food accessibility, credit opportunities and low prices. Poor consumers purchase very little from supermarkets due to material constraints (price, transport, etc.), although they have a high opinion of supermarkets and in particular the quality of the products sold. In order to be favourable to poor consumers, food distribution policies should aim to maintain the balance of the different forms of outlets and enforce public quality standards to guarantee the right of all to safe food.

40|$|As {{developing}} nations look {{to become more}} competitive in world agricultural markets, genetically modified (GM) crops are one avenue of pursuit. However, fears of primary export market loss, negative media attention, and adverse government regulations often hinder GM crop implementation and increase GM food risk perceptions among domestic consumers. In this study we analyze consumer surveys of GM food <b>purchase</b> propensity <b>conducted</b> in the developing countries of Romania and China. Through the examination of marginal effects and the drivers of purchase propensity, we find {{that in spite of}} demographic and psychographic similarities, consumer willingness to purchase GM foods is quite different between the two samples. Consumer preferences are largely dependent on risk perceptions, which are high in the Romanian sample, but low in the Chinese sample. Additionally, the effect of regressors on GM purchase propensity is invariant across foods in Romania, but distinctly different across foods in China, possibly due to the stated nutritional enhancement (vitamin A) in GM rice.

Results from an online hypothetical <b>purchase</b> experiment <b>conducted</b> in a sample of US smokers reveal that over a third of smokers are willing to pay a price premium to purchase in smaller quantities. Further, a desire to quit smoking and high self-control is associated with preference for a smaller pack. While we provide some preliminary evidence that smaller packs may be beneficial to certain types of smokers, further research should be conducted to assess whether the smaller pack size should be considered in the arsenal of tobacco control policies to help current smokers quit (JEL: I 18; I 12; D 12) ...|$|R
