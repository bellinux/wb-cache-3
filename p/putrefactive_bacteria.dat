Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the <b>putrefactive</b> <b>bacteria</b> within the carcass to kill the vegetative B. anthracis cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.|$|E

40|$|By definition, “cured meat {{products}} ” contain curing salts, usually salt (sodium chloride) and either nitrites or nitrates. The use of nitrites as a curing agent provides the cured meat colour, the cured meat flavour, and, {{in combination with}} other factors, slows or prevents growth of bacterial pathogens. Nitrites exert a concentration-dependent antimicrobial effect in cured {{meat products}}, including inhibition of the outgrowth of spores of <b>putrefactive</b> and pathogenic <b>bacteria</b> such as Clostridium botulinum. Their antimicrobial effects are pH-dependent, increasing ten-fold for each unit fall in pH. In most cured meat products, the addition of nitrites (or nitrates) is necessary to prevent the growth and toxin production by C. botulinum. The extent of protection provided to cured meats against microbial growth has been attributed by different researchers to many factors including the input concentration of nitrite, the residual nitrite concentration, the salt concentration of the product, the addition of sodium ascorbate (or isoascorbate / erythorbate), the heat treatment applied, the storage temperature, the initial pH of the meat, and the spore load initially present.

Two methods may be employed for recovering in culture Bacillus lepræ from the tissues. In one (the direct), tryptophane or a mixture of albumen and trypsin are employed with a culture medium; in the other (indirect), bacterial species capable of digesting the albumen constituent of the culture medium are introduced into the medium.

Subjects were 88 patients who visited “the Fresh Breath Clinic”, Dental Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University. They were classified into malodor (n = 67) and non-malodor (n = 21) groups. After collecting saliva, the amounts of the total proteins and carbohydrate were determined. Molecular size distributions of salivary proteins/glycoproteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The amount of the total salivary proteins was significantly higher in the malodor group.

40|$|Microorganisms have {{traditionally}} been selected for fermentation of milk {{on their ability to}} grow in milk. However nowadays the trend is towards including probiotic bacteria, i. e. those bacteria that have been suggested to provide additional health benefits to the consumer. Probiotic microorganisms have beneficial effects when ingested such as lowered incidence of colon cancer, the suppression of <b>putrefactive</b> and pathogenic <b>bacteria</b> by competitive exclusion and the production of organic acids, diacetyl and bacteriocins and a hypocholesterolemic effect, to mention but a few. To be more effective, the proposed microorganisms must be of human origin. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, which are two of the most successful probiotic bacteria used commercially, are normal inhabitants of the intestine of many animals including humans. They must however maintain their viability and activity in the bio-product in which they are formulated to be available at the right level at the time of consumption. A number of factors affect their viability, including low pH, the type of culture used and availability of essential amino acids. The choice of ingredients in the mix is crucial since it affects a number of mix properties such as pH and availability of nutrients. The demand for low fat products is a very strong driving force on the market place. However, reducing the fat content of such complex products as frozen dairy desserts is very difficult, since fat forms {{an integral part of the}} product. Removing fat poses a number of challenges as to which other ingredients to add in its place. Microparticulated whey protein concentrates have been formulated by food technologists to mimic the functionalities of fat especially as far as creaminess is concerned. Little information is available on fat replacement in frozen yoghurt, in terms of both its effects on the survival of probiotic bacteria and on some important quality parameters. Likewise, little research, if any, has been done on the perception of strawberry flavour in fat-free ice-creams and similar products. The purpose of the present study was thus to provide information on fat replacement by a microparticulated whey protein concentrate (Simplesse® 500) in frozen yoghurts and its influence on the survival of 1. acidophilus and B. bifidum. Several quality parameters of the frozen yoghurts were also evaluated. Frozen yoghurts were prepared by inoculating the mix with an ABT (acidophilus, bifidum and thermophilus) culture. Four mixes were formulated to contain 10 % (m/m) milk fat, 5 % (m/m) milk fat, 5 % (m/m) of the microparticulated whey protein concentrate (WPC) and 3. 4 % (m/m) of the microparticulated WPC respectively. Decreasing milk fat from 10 % to 5 %, together with the addition of more milk solids-not-fat, did not lead to a significant increase (p > 0. 05) in the acidity of the mix. Likewise the buffering capacity in both alkaline and acidic conditions were not significantly different (p > 0. 05). Substituting fat with Simplesse® 500 at 3. 4 % levelled to a significant decrease in the pH of the mix (p 0. 05) since whey proteins are only weak acids. The viability of all three the bacteria types present in the ABT culture did not seem to be related to the presence or absence of the microparticulated WPC. The numbers of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, 1. acidophilus and of B. bifidum did not differ significantly (p > 0. 05) between the four yoghurt mixes after incubation, ageing, whipping and freezing and three weeks of storage. However, only S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and 1. acidophilus increased in numbers during fermentation in all the yoghurt mixes and only S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus increased significantly (p < 0. 05) as a result of ageing in all the yoghurt mixes. Although the addition of the microparticulated WPC led to an increase in the acidity of the yoghurt mixes it also led to an increase in the buffer capacity, which thus helped to maintain the numbers of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and 1. acidophilus at the same level as in the mixes containing milk fat. While S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and 1. acidophilus grew to numbers greater than 107 cfu/g, B. bifidum did not grow at all in any of the yoghurt mixes and the results suggest that they might not be available at the right level to have any therapeutic benefits to the consumers. Decreasing fat content led to an obvious increase in coarseness of frozen yoghurts (p < 0. 05). The increasing perceived coarseness could be related to the amount of ice nuclei formed during whipping and freezing. The addition of the microparticulated whey protein concentrate could have resulted in a decrease in the freezing point, low enough to lead to a decrease in the amount of ice nuclei formed as a result of whipping and freezing. Therefore, the amount of unfrozen water available to freeze during hardening increased, thereby leading to an increase in the size of ice crystals. Fat is also known to decrease the size of ice crystals and the presence of more fat could also have led to an increased perception of smoothness. Increasing fat content led to a decrease in the perception of strawberry flavour and an increased perception of an aftertaste (p < 0. 05). Fat is known to bind lipophilic compounds as well as decrease the melting rate and mass transfer, both of which will decrease the release of flavour compounds.

40|$|Introduction. Prebiotic factor, such as inulin, is able {{to stimulate}} the growth of {{bifidobacteria}} selectively {{at the expense of}} more <b>putrefactive</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Chemical structure - Inulin has been defined as carbohydrate material consisting of â (2 - 1) fructosyl-fructose links. Physical and chemical properties - Chicory inulin is available as white, odourless powders. The taste is neutral or slightly sweet. Caloric value - The value of 1. 5 kcal/g is generally used. Improvement of lipid metabolism - The consumption of fructans reduces serum triglycerides and sometimes also cholesterol in healthy volunteers who were hyperlipidemic. Modulation of gut microflora - Inulin induces effects on gut function, such as a reduction of intestinal pH, relief of constipation, increased stool weight and frequency. Intestinal acceptability - Osmotic effect leads to an increased presence of water in the colon. The second effect is caused by the fermentation products. Suitability for diabetics - Inulin has been shown to reduce postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. Reduction of cancer risk - The production of toxic metabolites may be reduced by increasing the proportion of healthier colonic micro flora, which competes with pathogenic bacteria to reduce the levels of toxin and carcinogenic-producing enzymes. Increase in mineral absorption. The increase in calcium absorption did not negatively alter the absorption of other minerals. Food applications - Inulin improves organoleptic quality and a better-balanced nutritional composition. Perspectives - Fundamental mechanisms governing the nutritional benefits of inulin need to be further investigated. Conclusion. Inulin represents a key ingredient that offers new opportunities to food industry, which is constantly seeking well balanced, yet better tasting...|$|E

They are gram negative, orange to yellow pigmented rods widely distributed in the fresh and marine water. This paper deals with an analytical investigation on the significance of genus Flavobacterium as the bacteria causing spoilage of food. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Fifty six strains of Flavobacterium were isolated from fish materials. After the cultural characteristics of all isolates were tested in detail, taxonomical analysis was carried out. Only eleven strains were classified into species according to the key of Bergey 2 ̆ 7 s manual (1948), but others could not be identified because of their atypicality. In our collection, the author found three strains characterized for their urease activity. Especially Strain S 30 (one of them) rapidly produced large amount of urease, therefore this strain was named Flavobacterium Urea Nov SP. 2. Deterioration of texture and appearance in the food samples which were preserved at 27 ℃ after single inoculation of each strain were observed. Fish and fish products were easily attacked by many species of the genus, but in general the bacterial decomposition on fish meat was rather. weak comparing with Pseudomonas.

40|$|AbstractThe {{different}} {{sections of}} the broiler chicken intestinal tract are inhabited by specialist microbiota adapted to the physicochemical conditions, host physiology and available nutrients of the specific habitat. The small intestine is dominated by lactic acid bacteria which have complex nutrient requirements resembling those of the chicken host itself. Lactobacilli are unable to synthesise amino acids for their anabolism and are therefore highly dependent on amino acid availability in the growth environment. Thus, in the small intestine there is competition for amino acids between the microbiota and the chicken host. According to rough estimates, lactobacilli in the small intestine may assimilate 3 – 6 % of total dietary amino acids. If the protein is highly digestible and amino acids are largely absorbed in the upper small intestine, where bacterial growth is suppressed, the proportion captured by the host may be higher. Exogenous enzymes which promote protein digestion {{are also likely to}} provide a competitive advantage to the chicken, offering less growth potential for amino acid-dependent bacteria. Protein escaping the ileum comprises resistant protein of dietary origin, protein assimilated to intestinal bacteria and endogenous protein synthesised and secreted by the host, the latter synthesised in host tissues from dietary amino acids and thus representing true endogenous protein. Activities of small intestinal bacteria affect the size of the microbial protein fraction and also the production of endogenous proteins originating from mucin, epithelial cells and antibodies. Ileal bypass protein is subject to fermentation by <b>putrefactive</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the caecum. Putrefaction produces many harmful and toxic compounds, which in high concentrations may have adverse effects on chicken growth and performance. The protein fermentation products include amines, indoles, phenols, cresol and ammonia, which can all negatively affect host or cell health. All actions {{to reduce the amount of}} ileal bypass protein potentially also reduce production of toxic protein fermentation metabolites in the caecum. Enzymes which facilitate protein digestion in the upper intestine and soluble carbohydrates resistant to ileal digestion both reduce caecal putrefaction. In the distal intestine, saccharolytic fermentation is preferred and putrefaction accelerates only when utilisable carbohydrates are depleted. Soluble oligo- and polysaccharides are produced in situ by non-starch polysaccharide degrading enzymes and can also be added directly to the diet as health-promoting prebiotics...|$|E
40|$|Parenteral {{introduction}} of {{amounts of the}} culture filtrate of Bacillus botulinus greatly {{in excess of the}} minimum lethal dose has been observed to cause the practically immediate death of mice. This result is due to the presence in the filtrates of a chemical poison possessing properties distinct from those of the contained botulinus toxin which itself acts only after a well defined period of incubation. This chemical poison is not neutralized by botulinus antitoxin; it is effective only when large amounts of the culture filtrate are given; it is thermostable, not being destroyed when heated in the autoclave in a sealed tube, though when it is heated in an open container its toxicity diminishes with a coincidental volatilization of basic material. The volatile substance can be identified as ammonia. Death resulting from the injection of comparatively large amounts of ammonium salts (0. 1 gm.) is easily distinguished from that due to botulism, both through the character of the symptoms and the absence of an incubation period. However, when the amount of toxic salts injected is smaller (0. 01 gm.), the symptoms of poisoning are not so characteristic and death may be delayed long enough to suggest a period of incubation similar to that observed in botulism (Table IV). This circumstance is of importance in connection with the examination of partly decomposed food products in which the presence of botulinus toxin is suspected. As a rule such suspected material is injected in massive doses (0. 5 to 1 cc.) in mice. It is conceivable that such spoiled foods may be contaminated with common <b>putrefactive</b> <b>bacteria</b> yielding ammonia during their growth and thus may cause death of the test animals. If in such tests mice passively protected by the preliminary injection of an excess of antitoxin be used in addition to normal animals, the chances of an error in the interpretation of the results will be materially reduced, though not ruled out. Unfortunately for such a procedure, botulinus antitoxin is not readily available, while furthermore, recent findings indicate that it may not always be effective owing to the existence of a group of toxin-producing bacteria very similar to Bacillus botulinus, but not homologous immunologically with either of the known types of the latter. The test of thermostability of the toxic constituents of suspected food may conceivably help to determine {{the true nature of the}} poison...|$|E
40|$|From {{the team}} {{surveying}} and data collection, production conditions and product quality problems of Namprik or chili paste product made by Thai SMCE (Small and Micro Community Enterprise) in the OTOP (One Thumbon One Product) project were evaluated. Four types of Namprik product include chili paste for curry cooking, fried chili paste, {{ready to eat}} moist chili paste and ready to eat dried chili paste were sampled and analyzed especially for food safety purpose. Laboratory results show that aw (water activity number) of the ready to eat dried chili paste was the lowest at 0. 58 which fungi, anhydrous tolerance type, {{will be able to}} survive and aw of chili paste for curry cooking was the highest at 0. 96 which most of the <b>putrefactive</b> <b>bacteria</b> would remain alive and cause product deterioration problem later. From microbial analysis results, most of Namprik products were considered as good microbial quality products except for some of them still having spoilage problems caused by yeast and mould. However the amount of antimicrobial agent, Sodium Benzoate, in the products were found in the quantity of about 3 times exceeds the regulation limit of allowable antimicrobial agent utilization in food. The recommendations of good anufacturing practice were on-site conducted to Namprik producers by the project team in order to improve both production technique and production place sanitation. Packaging, include graphic design, of Namprik product especially for the ready to eat dried chili paste was also developed. Four-side seal package prototypes 7 x 10 cm. were made from three different types of plastic film include OPP/CPP, OPP/MCPP and PET/CPP and 12 grams of product was filled incorporated with two different head space gas filling, air and Nitrogen. The samples were separated and stored in two different temperature conditions, 30 0 C and 50 0 C for 6 weeks. Physical change of Namprik product every 1 week in 50 0 C condition and every 2 weeks in 30 0 C conditions were determined. The results showed that no development of mold and C. perfringen were found in all packages at both storage conditions. Packing with nitrogen gas retained the quality of Namprik product better than the air pack. Namprik that was packed in OPP / MCPP plastic pouch with nitrogen gas and storage in 30 deg C condition for 6 weeks had the lowest of moisture content, aw and TBA (4. 38 %, 0. 300 and 1. 12 mg Malonaldehyde / kg, respectively). The structure and graphic design of a set of 10 single serve Namprik packages prototype are also included...|$|E
