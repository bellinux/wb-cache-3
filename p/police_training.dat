5|$|The Grosvenor Sanatorium {{opened in}} 1915 to help {{patients}} suffering from tuberculosis, and could cater for 110 male patients, and 78 female.

5|$|In 1934, {{a statue}} of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was {{declared}} an obstruction to traffic and removed. A proposal that it be installed {{in front of the}} Bank of England fell through, and in 1952 it was erected in Postman's Park. In 1971 the Metropolitan Police requested that the statue be moved to the new Peel Centre <b>police</b> <b>training</b> complex, and the Corporation of London agreed. In place of Peel's statue, a large bronze sculpture of the Minotaur by Michael Ayrton was unveiled in 1973. Dominating the small park, in 1997 the Minotaur sculpture was moved to a new position on the raised walkway above London Wall.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{indicate}} the importance of community <b>policing</b> <b>training</b> programs for implementation of community policing. Community policing requires a transition from traditional policing methods to proactive and problem-oriented policing which is constructed upon police-citizen partnership. For the successful implementation of community policing, the change process needs to be fully realized throughout the organization. Suitably appropriate methods of training will help both officers and citizens to fully understand the goals of community policing. This study focuses on the types of existing community training methods as well as the obstacles that complicate training efforts. Consequently, this study provides some recommendations on community <b>policing</b> <b>training</b> programs to make them more helpful for police departments...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, in England and Wales, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in <b>police</b> pre-employment <b>training</b> and education programmes. The shift from the traditional post-employment training model to a pre-join approach is being driven by economic imperatives as well as by an aim to professionalise the police. Yet when examined from broader and international perspectives self-funded pre-entry training for other professions is nothing new and in other countries, such as the U. S. A., mandatory pre-employment <b>training</b> for <b>policing</b> has existed for decades. Although the subject of <b>police</b> pre-employment <b>training</b> featured significantly in two recent and influential reports into policing in England and Wales (Neyroud 2011, Winsor 2012), {{there has been}} relatively few academic articles about <b>police</b> pre-employment <b>training</b> in the <b>police</b> studies scholarly literature. This paper adds to the extant literature and compares emerging approaches to <b>police</b> pre-employment <b>training</b> in the U. K. with the more established system of <b>police</b> pre-join <b>training</b> in the U. S. A. The paper is informed by a review of key literature relating to <b>police</b> entry-level <b>training</b> in both countries and empirical research conducted by the author in the U. S. A. The research finds that a mixed-market model of <b>police</b> entry-level <b>training</b> has evolved in America which reflects its diverse and radically decentralised system of policing, whereby nearly half of all basic training takes place in police academies operated by academic institutions. The paper concludes that there are lessons to be learnt from the American approach which may help inform the development of pre-join training in the U. K...|$|R
