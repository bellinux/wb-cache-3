40|$|<b>Purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> (Echinaceae purpurea (L.) Mnch) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} medicinal plants used by pharmaceutical industries in industrialized countries. The active substances of this plant are antiviral and are used as human immunostimulant. The plant of <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> is not included in the Iranian flora. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the adaptability of the plant to the conditions in the north of Tehran (Zardband region). The results from this research should contribute to large-scale production as a raw material for Iranian pharmaceutical industries. Comparison of means of the different characteristics was carried out using t-test at 5 % level. Results showed that <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> is adaptable to the climatic conditions in the north of Tehran and can be produced on a large scale. The suitable time for transplanting the seedling in the field was from 5 August to 5 September. Maintaining the <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> until its fourth vegetative period is economical.

The number of viruses known to infect <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> increased {{significantly in the}} last years in many countries. However, there is no any review about the viral diseases of this valuable medicinal crop. Therefore, the aim {{of this article is to}} summarize the main information about the viruses affecting <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> plants (Echinacea purpurea L. Moench.). An analysis of the literature data showed that <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> could be infected by 10 viruses. These viruses belong to the families Bromoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Secoviridae, Potyviridae, Vir­ga­vi­ri­dae, and almost all of them are considered to be highly harmful plant viruses. Additionally, four of them (TMV, TSWV, CMV, PVY) are in the top 10 of the most economically important plant viruses in the world and occupy the first places. Such distribution and harmfulness of these viruses are explained by a wide range of sensitive host-plants, wild plants and weeds – reservoirs of an infection, and also a large number of vectors. The data from a few countries show that the viral diseases of <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> are becoming more severe from year to year. The appearance of new viruses is registered on coneflower every year that complicates prognosis and risk estimation of epiphytoties in these regions which, for example, were revealed in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Ukraine.

Įvertinti rausvažiedės ežiuolės preparatų imunostimuliuojančio poveikio mechanizmus ir nustatyti, nuo kokių šio augalo sudėtinių dalių priklauso poveikis organizmo imuninei sistemai. Tyrimo medžiaga ir metodai. Rausvažiedės ežiuolės žolės ir šaknų preparatų buvo injekuota triušiams 1 ml/kg. T limfocitų stimuliacija {{in vitro}} buvo tiriama inkubuojant triušių kraują įvairiomis preparato koncentracijomis (10, 50, 100 mg/ml fiziologinio tirpalo) ir vertinama spontaninių rozečių metodu nustatant, kiek limfocitų prisijungia heterogeninius eritrocitus. Norint įvertinti vietinį veikimą, 30 ml ežiuolės šaknų preparato, kur 95 mg sausų medžiagų viename milimetre, buvo skiriama burnai skalauti. Po fitoimunostimuliatoriaus pavartojimo in vitro ir in vivo vertinta fagocitozės reakcija naudojant latekso daleles: fagocitozės aktyvumas (Fa) ir fagocitozės indeksas (Fi). Rezultatai. Rausvažiedės ežiuolės preparatai, pagaminti iš jos šaknų, buvo veiksmingesni fitoimunostimuliatoriai negu pagaminti iš žolės. Jie reikšmingai padidino in vivo leukocitų skaičių ir limfocitų, ypač T limfocitų, kiekį triušių periferiniame kraujyje lyginant su kontrolinio tyrimo duomenimis (p 0, 05).

The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the mechanisms of action of <b>Purple</b> <b>Coneflower</b> (Echinacea purpurea (L.)

The extracts from overground parts and roots of <b>Purple</b> <b>Coneflower</b> were injected into rabbits at the dose of 1 ml/kg. The stimulation of T lymphocytes in vitro was tested by incubation of rabbit blood with the different concentrations of the <b>Purple</b> <b>Coneflower</b> preparation (10, 50, 100 mg/ml) and assessed by the method of spontaneous rosettes. The number of lymphocytes, which bind to heterogenic erythrocytes, was counted. In order to determine the local effect, 30 ml of <b>Purple</b> <b>Coneflower</b> preparation (95 mg of dry material/ 1 ml) was used for the rinsing of mouth cavity in humans. The reaction of phagocytosis was assessed by using latex particles and calculating phagocytosis activity and phagocytosis index.

They significantly increased in vivo the number of leucocytes and lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, in peripheral blood of rabbits as compared with the control group (p 0. 05 with control). <b>Purple</b> <b>Coneflower</b> preparations activated phagocytosis of neutrophils in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Background: <b>Purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> (Echinaceae purpurea L.) is a {{perennial}} herbaceous with astringent properties, disinfectant, antimicrobial and anti intoxication activity. The main {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of shoot essential oil of <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> against some microorganisms including gram positive, gram negative bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeasts. Material and Methods: In this experimental and laboratory investigation, plant samples were collected in full blooming stage. Shoot essential oil was extracted by hydro-distillation technique using Clevenger apparatus. The chemical constitutes of this oil was analyzed by GC and GC/MS method. Anti microbial properties of the essential oil were determined using micro broth dilution and well disk diffusion methods. At the end, data were analyzed by the SPSS version 15 software, using the T-test and Duncan s' test. Results: Twenty nine components were identified by GC and GC/MS in the essential oil of <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> representing 96. 21 % of total oil. The major components were Germacrene D (53. 30 %), -Cymene (9. 78 %), β-Caryophyllene (7. 52 %), α-Humulene (5. 22 %), β-Bisabolene (4. 43 %) and α-Pinene (4. 23 %), respectively. This oil exhibited strong antifungal activity against filamentous fungi and yeast with average of inhibition zone (AIZ) 39. 63. Microorganisms differ in their resistance to <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> oil. All of the bacteria including gram positive and gram negative bacteria are more resistant than fungi and gram negative bacteria are more resistant than gram positive bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium were more resistant than others. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that coneflower essential oil with significant antimicrobial effects and can be used instead of synthetic antibiotics that microbial resistance towards them is increasing...|$|R

Bismarck Germplasm narrow-leaved <b>purple</b> <b>coneflower</b> is released as a selected class of certified seed (natural track). There is no adapted, consistent, commercial seed source of this species in the Northern Great Plains. There are no known formal varieties or prevarietal releases. Seed of this species is needed for wildlife seedings, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) plantings, prairie restoration and various other revegetation projects. Roots and other plant parts of this species are presently in great demand for medicinal purposes. Seed to establish fields for root harvest would ease pressure from digging in native rangeland. Digging often accelerates erosion and degrades natural plant diversity. Collection Site Information: Seed was collected from 11 North Dakota locations. Collection information is found in Table 1. Sites varied in soils and other climatic conditions. Most sites, however, were dry native rangeland.
