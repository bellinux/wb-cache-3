Next, appellants Micah and Hein, in a threatening manner, shouted words demanding that McLoren {{turn over the}} key to the locked desk drawer. Appellant Micah, when threatening McLoren and demanding the key, shouted, “Give me the key fool” and “Give me the key, ese. You want shit with Gumbys, ese?” McLoren refused to relinquish the key.|$|E
500|$|Each {{trainset}} {{consisted of}} two power cars (which included seating), two coaches and a bar/grill. The trains were powered {{by a pair of}} [...] Turbomeca turbines. The cars rode on Creusot-Loire trucks. The bar/grill, located {{at the center of the}} trainset, had table seating for 24. The vestibules between the cars were partitioned by sliding doors: one at each end of the car, and a double set between the cars themselves. A passenger moving between cars thus had to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> three sets of doors. The trains were not intended for use with high-level platforms, and there were no traps covering the steps down to platform level.|$|E
2500|$|Salli Frattini, the {{executive}} producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled {{a phone call from}} the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. [...] "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. [...] "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s. What just happened?'" [...] Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. [...] "I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay", he said. [...] "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." [...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song". The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.|$|E

When he fired the gun and they all fell as if dead, she with difficulty suppressed a small scream and clapped her hands over her ears; but poor Billy never minded it a bit, for he was pale and quaking with the fear of [...] "heaven's artillery" [...] thundering overhead, and as a bright flash of lightning seemed to run down the tall tent-poles he hid his eyes and wished with all his heart that he was safe with mother.|$|E

Don't try so much to form your character--it's like trying to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> a tight, tender young rose. Live as you like best, and your character will take care of itself. Most things are good for you; the exceptions are very rare, and a comfortable income's not one of them." [...] Ralph paused, smiling; Isabel had listened quickly. [...] "You've too much power of thought--above all too much conscience," [...] Ralph added. [...] "It's out of all reason, the number of things you think wrong. Put back your watch. Diet your fever. Spread your wings; rise above the ground. It's never wrong to do that." ...|$|E

60|$|The King's {{commands}} {{could not}} {{in the nature of}} things be disobeyed: the same stroke of the pen which was about to send half a hundred young countrymen to the gallows granted them M. le duc's gracious pardon and their liberty: the only exception to this general amnesty being Pierre Adet, the son of the miller. M. le duc's servants had deposed to seeing him <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> the door of the coach and stand for some time half in and half out of the carriage, obviously trying to terrorise Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle refused either to corroborate or to deny this statement, but she had arrived fainting at the gate of the château, and she had been very ill ever since. She had sustained a serious shock to her nerves, so the doctor hastily summoned from Paris had averred, and it was supposed that she had lost all recollection of the terrible incidents of that night.|$|E
60|$|At {{the moment}} Sewell reached his desk, with a spirit disciplined to the {{sacrifice}} required of it, {{he heard his}} wife's step outside his study door, and he had just time to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> a drawer, throw the letter into it, and shut it again before she entered. He did not mean finally to conceal it from her, but {{he was willing to}} give himself breath before he faced her {{with the fact that he}} had received such a letter. Nothing in its way was more terrible to this good man than the righteousness of that good woman. In their case, as in that of most other couples who cherish an ideal of dutiful living, she was the custodian of their potential virtue, and he was the instrument, often faltering and imperfect, of its application to circumstances; and without wishing to spare himself too much, he was sometimes aware that she did not spare him enough. She worked his moral forces as mercilessly as a woman uses the physical strength of a man when it is placed at her direction.|$|E
60|$|After I had had {{the little}} Mias about three weeks, I {{fortunately}} obtained a young hare-lip monkey (Macacus cynomolgus), which, though small, was very active, and could feed itself. I placed {{it in the same}} box with the Mias, and they immediately became excellent friends, neither exhibiting the least fear of the other. The little monkey would sit upon the other's stomach, or even on its face, without the least regard to its feelings. While I was feeding the Mias, the monkey would sit by, picking up all that was spilt, and occasionally putting out its hands to intercept the spoon; and as soon as I had finished would pick off what was left sticking to the Mias' lips, and then <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> its mouth and see if any still remained inside; afterwards lying down on the poor creature's stomach as on a comfortable cushion. The little helpless Mias would submit to all these insults with the most exemplary patience, only too glad to have something warm near it, which it could clasp affectionately in its arms. It sometimes, however, had its revenge; for when the monkey wanted to go away, the Mias would hold on as long as it could by the loose skin of its back or head, or by its tail, and it was only after many vigorous jumps that the monkey could make his escape.|$|E

60|$|It {{has been}} {{sometimes}} {{argued that there}} is no truer criterion of the vitality of any given art-period than the power of the master-spirits of that time in grotesque; and certainly in the instance of Gothic art there is no disputing the proposition. Weatherbury tower was a somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental parapet in parish as distinct from cathedral churches, and the gurgoyles, which are the necessary correlatives of a parapet, were exceptionally prominent--of the boldest cut that the hand could shape, and of the most original design that a human brain could conceive. There was, so to speak, that symmetry in their distortion which is less the characteristic of British than of Continental grotesques of the period. All the eight were different from each other. A beholder was convinced that nothing on earth could be more hideous than those he saw on the north side until he went round to the south. Of the two on this latter face, only that at the south-eastern corner concerns the story. It was too human to be called like a dragon, too impish to be like a man, too animal to be like a fiend, and not enough like a bird to be called a griffin. This horrible stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a wrinkled hide; it had short, erect ears, eyes starting from their sockets, and its fingers and hands were seizing the corners of its mouth, which they thus seemed to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> to give free passage to the water it vomited. The lower row of teeth was quite washed away, though the upper still remained. Here and thus, jutting a couple of feet from the wall against which its feet rested as a support, the creature had for four hundred years laughed at the surrounding landscape, voicelessly in dry weather, and in wet with a gurgling and snorting sound.|$|E

50|$|Oromandibular {{dystonia}} (OMD) {{is a form}} of focal dystonia {{that affects}} varying areas {{of the head and neck}} including the lower face, jaw, tongue and larynx.

It is often associated with dystonia of the cervical muscles (Spasmodic Torticollis), eyelids (Blepharospasm), or larynx (Spasmodic Dysphonia).|$|E

50|$|Electro-pneumatic chests, however, {{frequently}} have sealed wood channels (tubes) in their wooden structural elements and bottom boards, usually consisting of wind channels running between the pipe valve {{and the primary}} with its electromagnets. Organ builders harnessed the difference in air pressures {{inside and outside the}} organ to do heavier work, taking the weak force of an electromagnet and multiplying its effect pneumatically to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> pipe valves. In a sense, therefore, part of the tubular-pneumatic heritage was developed in later non-tracker organ building.|$|E
50|$|Although a crude road made of {{dirt and}} wooden boards was {{constructed}} to run from this area to Tallahassee, a railroad was sorely needed. (In the early 1850s an upgraded plank road was constructed). By 1835 a rail connection was launched from Tallahassee {{to the town of}} St. Marks situated a little farther south on the St. Marks river. The rail effectively by-passed Magnolia. Although the rail line was very crude and initially relied on mules to <b>pull</b> <b>open</b> cars along loosely anchored rails, this connection gave St. Marks a transportation advantage over Magnolia.|$|E
