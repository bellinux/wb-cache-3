25|$|Both {{morphine}} and its hydrated form, C17H19NO3H2O, are {{sparingly soluble}} in water. In five liters of water, only one gram of the hydrate will dissolve. For this reason, pharmaceutical companies produce sulfate and hydrochloride salts of the drug, {{both of which}} are over 300 times more water-soluble than their <b>parent</b> <b>molecule.</b> Whereas the pH of a saturated morphine hydrate solution is 8.5, the salts are acidic. Since they derive from a strong acid but weak base, they are both at about pH = 5; as a consequence, the morphine salts are mixed with small amounts of NaOH to make them suitable for injection.|$|E

40|$|Dec. 2003, to be {{published}} in COMETS II) The composition of cometary ices provides key information on the chemical and physical proper-ties of the outer solar nebula where comets formed, 4. 6 Gyr ago. This chapter summarizes our current knowledge of the volatile composition of cometary nuclei, based on spectroscopic observations and in situ measurements of <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> and noble gases in cometary comae. The processes that govern the excitation and emission of <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> in the radio, infrared (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) wavelength regions are reviewed. The techniques used to convert line or band fluxes into molecular production rates are described. More than two dozen <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> have been identified, and we describe how each is investigated. The spatial distribution of some of these molecules has been studied by in situ measure-ments, long-slit IR and UV spectroscopy, and millimeter wave mapping, including interferometry. The spatial distributions of CO, H CO, and OCS differ from that expected during direct sublimation from the nucleus, which suggests that these species are produced, at least partly, from extended sources in the coma. Abundance determinations for <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> are reviewed, and the evidence for chemical diversity among comets is discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{radicals}} and ions {{observed in}} comets result from photodissociation and photoionization of molecules. According to current models, a comet is composed chiefly of a large, solid nucelus of frozen gases (<b>parent</b> <b>molecules)</b> such as H 2 O, HCN, and NH 3. It is believed comets were formed {{at the same}} time and in the same region of space as the major planets and that their chemical composition is the same as that of the early solar system. As the comet nears the Sun, the surface heats up, liberating the frozen gases as well as dust particles. Solar radiation photodissociates the <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> into fragments that are observed by resonance fluorescence.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of detecting IR molecular line emission from cometary <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> is explored. Due to the non-LTE {{conditions in the}} inner coma and {{the large amount of}} near IR solar flux, IR fluorescence will be a significant source of cometary emission and, in fact, will dominate the grain radiation in a sufficiently high resolution instrument. The detection of this line emission will be difficult due to absorption in the terrestrial atmosphere, but it appears possible to measure cometary H 2 O emission from airplane altitudes. As IR molecular line emission represents one of the few promising methods of detecting cometary <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> directly, further research on this problem should be vigorously pursued.

However, by comparing the product ion branching ratios obtained at two reduced electric field values (90 and 170 Td) for two reagent ions (H 3 O+ and NO+) to those of the pure chemicals, we show that identification is possible with a much higher level of confidence then when relying solely on the m/z of protonated <b>parent</b> <b>molecules.</b> A rapid and highly selective analytical identification of the constituents of a recreational drug is particularly crucial to medical personnel for the prompt medical treatment of overdoses, toxic effects or allergic reactions...|$|R

An alternate hypothesis is that the precursors are not molecules, but icy particles stripped from the nucleus by the evaporating gases. By evaporating within an icy halo, the grains would liberate either <b>parent</b> <b>molecules</b> with very short lifetimes or some of the radicals themselves. Recent laboratory work suggests that the grains could be made of clathrate hydrates of gases or of radicals.
