5|$|The 1990s saw the Echo take a huge {{technological}} leap forward when a £12million printing <b>press</b> <b>was</b> installed. It {{was used for}} the first time in December 1996 and was capable of printing up to 70,000newspapers an hour. The <b>press</b> <b>was</b> part of a multimillion-pound revamp, which also saw journalists making up full news pages on computer screens for the first time. The Echos first internet news service was also launched in 1996. A further £5million was spent on updating the pre-press and press hall area in 2004, to improve printing quality and speed of production.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{object in}} the British Library is the Perkins D {{cylinder}} press developed by Jacob Perkins and patented in 1819. This <b>press</b> <b>was</b> one of several used to print the first postage stamps of Great Britain and Ireland which were issued in 1840. The <b>press</b> <b>was</b> used for printing many early stamps for British Colonial territories from 1853 including for Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, Mauritius, St Helena, Trinidad, Western Australia, Ionian Islands, New Brunswick, New South Wales, New Zealand and Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Due to the overshadowing {{issue of}} the Soviet vs. U.S. Space Race, the ethical issues raised by this {{experiment}} went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper clippings from 1957 show, the <b>press</b> <b>was</b> initially focused on reporting the political perspective, while the health and retrieval—or lack thereof—of Laika only became an issue later.|$|E

5|$|Hess's flight, {{but not his}} {{destination}} or fate, {{was first}} announced by Munich Radio in Germany {{on the evening of}} 12 May. On 13 May Hitler sent Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to give the news in person to Mussolini, and the British <b>press</b> <b>was</b> permitted to release full information about events that same day. On 14 May Ilse Hess finally learned that her husband had survived the trip when news of his fate was broadcast on German radio.|$|E
5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and {{encouraged them to}} register to vote annually, as mandated by the Act. Press coverage of national politics in the local <b>press</b> <b>was</b> joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves {{as part of a}} national political movement during the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|Percy Bysshe Shelley was in Italy and did {{not hear}} of the {{massacre}} until 5 September. His poem, The Masque of Anarchy, subtitled Written on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester was sent for publication in the radical periodical The Examiner but because of restrictions on the radical <b>press,</b> <b>was</b> not published until 1832, {{ten years after the}} poet's death.|$|E

5|$|A devastating fire in 1890 gutted the {{interior}} of University College and destroyed thirty-three thousand volumes from the library, but the university restored the building and replenished its library within two years. Over the next two decades, a collegiate system took shape as the university arranged federation with several ecclesiastical colleges, including Strachan's Trinity College in 1904. The university operated the Royal Conservatory of Music from 1896 to 1991 and the Royal Ontario Museum from 1912 to 1968; both still retain close ties with the university as independent institutions. The University of Toronto <b>Press</b> <b>was</b> founded in 1901 as Canada's first academic publishing house. The Faculty of Forestry, founded in 1907 with Bernhard Fernow as dean, was Canada's first university faculty devoted to forest science.

5|$|According to {{an article}} in the New Rochelle Pioneer the film was {{produced}} in New Rochelle and according to a news release the film was shot in the mountains during real blizzard weather. Bowers believes this film was shot during the winter and kept for its later June release. The winter of 1909 through 1910 contained two notable snow events that might have possibly been used in the production. A major snow storm from December 25 to December 26, 1909, would make its way through New York City with snow total of about 10 inches and wind gusts up to 58mph. A second major snow event occurred three weeks later, on January 14 through 15, 1910, with New York City getting 15 inches of snow. Another lesser snow event, deemed a blizzard in the <b>press,</b> <b>was</b> recorded in early February.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{feared that}} they would be assassinated, and taught their {{followers}} that their deaths would be {{similar to those of the}} two witnesses of the Book of Revelation. Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's treatment by the <b>press</b> <b>was</b> a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.|$|E
5|$|Cape {{announced}} that he had stopped publication, but he secretly leased the rights to Pegasus Press, an English-language publisher in France. His partner Wren Howard took papier-mâché moulds of the type to Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus <b>Press</b> <b>was</b> shipping its edition to the London bookseller Leopold Hill, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves soon {{came to the attention of}} the Home Office. On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the book to be seized.|$|E
5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The <b>press</b> <b>was</b> eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E

5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public {{because of his}} perceived sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself {{as a champion of}} national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi <b>press</b> <b>was</b> on Göring's side. Other Nazi leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, there were those who viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} <b>press</b> <b>was</b> that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians {{suffered}} about 225,000 casualties, including 30,000 killed, 173,000 {{wounded and}} 70,000 taken prisoner. They reported that 200 of their officers were taken prisoner {{during the battle}} and more than 130 cannon, 70 heavy machine-guns and a large quantity of matériel were captured. The Serbs also suffered heavy casualties, with 22,000 killed, 91,000 wounded and 19,000 missing or captured. The Western <b>press</b> <b>was</b> appalled with the scale of atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian troops against Serbian civilians, including women and children. William Shepard, of the United Press, confirmed as an eyewitness that at least eighteen towns were fully abandoned, and the whole of northwestern Serbia was nearly depopulated.|$|E

A hardcover edition title An Illustrated Short History of Progress was released with a print run of 15,000 copies in 2006.|$|E
5|$|While {{out to sea}} in August of the 1965 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, Stormfury meteorologists {{decided that}} Hurricane Betsy was {{a good candidate for}} seeding. However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on September 1, the planned flights were canceled. For some reason, the <b>press</b> <b>was</b> not notified that there were no seedings, and several newspapers reported that it had begun. As Betsy passed close to the Bahamas and smashed into southern Florida, the public and Congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury. It took two months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not seeded, and the project was allowed to continue. A second candidate, Hurricane Elena, stayed too far out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Across Cuba, anti-Batista groups {{carried out}} bombings and sabotage; police responded with mass arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions. In March 1957, the DR {{launched}} a failed {{attack on the}} presidential palace, during which Antonio was shot dead. Frank País was also killed, leaving Castro the MR-26-7's unchallenged leader. Although Guevara and Raúl were well known for their Marxist–Leninist views, Castro hid his, hoping to gain the support of less radical revolutionaries. In 1957 he met with leading members of the Partido Ortodoxo, Raúl Chibás and Felipe Pazos, authoring the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, in which they demanded that a provisional civilian government be set up to implement moderate agrarian reform, industrialization, and a literacy campaign before holding multiparty elections. As Cuba's <b>press</b> <b>was</b> censored, Castro contacted foreign media to spread his message; he became a celebrity after being interviewed by Herbert Matthews, a journalist from The New York Times. Reporters from CBS and Paris Match soon followed.|$|E
