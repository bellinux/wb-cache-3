Two kinds of arrangement schemes for high-pressure value used in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> system are proposed in this study. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> effects are examined under different arrangement of high-pressure value. Here, theoretical <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> distance formulas of mineral particles affected by different airflow directions are derived and validated {{by a series}} of numerical simulations and orthogonal experiments. In the following analysis, the effects of gangue diameter (d), conveyor velocity (v 0), and the height difference between conveyor belt and air nozzle (hp) are mainly considered. The numerical simulation and experimental results indicate that <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> effects under the condition of u and v 0 being in the opposite direction will be better than that of u and v 0 being in the same direction. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> distance ΔS shows a decreasing trend with the increasing of the three factors. The study also shows that gangue diameter has the most significant influence on separation distance, followed by conveyor velocity v 0 and height difference hp...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{first part}} of the present study deals with some {{physical}} properties for sunflower seeds components (seeds, hulls and kernels) related to <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> which are evaluated as a function of change in moisture content from 8 % to 14 % (d. b.). Simple linear empirical equations were developed to predict sunflower seeds components properties according to moisture content. All dimensions, mass, angle of repose, coefficient of fraction, and terminal velocity increased linearly with the moisture content increased up to 14 %, while the bulk density decreased linearly with the moisture content increased. The second part was carried out on a series of experiments to specify the optimum conditions of separating operation which ensure the highest grade of separation efficiency with minimum kernel losses. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> equipment was tested under different combinations of the following factors: air stream velocity, feed rate, broken kernels percentage and moisture content by using indices separation efficiency and kernel losses. The combination of air velocity, feed rate, broken kernels % and moisture content affected significantly the separation efficiency and kernel losses. Air stream velocity of 3. 5 m/s combined with 30 kg/h feed rate, 10 % broken kernels and (10 – 12 %) moisture content can be considered the most favorable combination values.

40|$|Advances {{in the use}} of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) {{have opened}} up a wide range of {{applications}} in the field of nanotechnology. The knowledge of the properties of PMMA has contributed a lot to the recent boosts in the synthesis, modification, and applications of the polymer. However, {{there is a need to}} condense these developments in the form of an article for better understanding and easy access. This review highlights the fundamental physical properties of PMMA, coupled with experimental evidence of its essential chemistry, such as solubility, hydrolysis, grafting, combustion reactions, reactions with amines, and thermal decomposition. The recent developments in the applications of PMMA in biomedical, optical, solar, sensors, battery electrolytes, nanotechnology, viscosity, <b>pneumatic</b> actuation, molecular <b>separations,</b> and polymer conductivity were also revealed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> we use as {{separating}} characteristics aerodynamic properties of particles, their critical velocity being the characteristic value. The investigations were carried out on a pneumatic separator whose design enabled {{a wide range of}} regulations of parameters. Based on the study results the essential fa- ctors that affected the course of the process were identified and the theoretical correlation between them, deciding about the efficacy of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation,</b> were determined. The main aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the separation process in an air stream of broken-up lupine seeds, chiefly involving theoretical considerations of movement and behaviour of mixture particles in a pneumatic canal. Investigations and observations gave ground for an attempt at determining a deriving a movement equation of particles in an unrestrained, uniform air stream. The equations obtained can be used for calculating the parameters of particle movement in pneumatic canals. The velocities of air stream, then, can be a few times higher than the critical velocity /convection/ of individual particles. While working out the above problems there were consi-dered, on the one hand possibilities of obtaining the greatest effectiveness of the separation process, and on the other, the smallest possible losses of valuable material in the discard-ed lot...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{the size and shape}} of a {{selected}} group of herbs (dried juniper berries – Juniperus communis, dry blueberries – Vaccinium myrtillus, petals of cornflower – Centaurea cyanus) on the value of the volatility coefficient, the coefficient of sphericity and the critical speed was analysed in the presented research. A laboratory anemometer to measure the speed of air was used. The determination of the volatility coefficient of particular size fractions was conducted on the basis of critical speed values, calculated as an average established after five measurements. The established aerodynamic properties of particular mixtures allow the determination and the assessment of differences among fractions of valuable resources and different impurities. The presented data might constitute a basis to determine the scope of differences among them and establish interrelations which allow the application of proper parameters for the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> process in practice...|$|E
40|$|In thermal {{processing}} of oil shale in vertical retorts huge quantities {{of a solid}} waste – semicoke are formed. It {{has been shown that}} circulating fluidized bed combustion of semicoke could be a promising technology allowing utilization of its high residual energy potential. Tests in combustion of pure semicoke and semicoke with a small addition of oil shale (up to 20 %) were carried out using a fluidized bed device with a thermal capacity of 50 kWth. The main parameters of combustion process and the additional heat produced were determined and calculated. The experiments indicated that semicoke with low moisture content (below 10 %) could be burnt in fluidized bed without adding of oil shale. For the combustion of semicoke with higher moisture content (over 10 %) about 10 % of oil shale must be added. One possibility for utilizing residual carbon present in semicoke could also be production of carbon-rich materials in order to obtain, for example, activated carbon. A series of experiments accompanied by SEM X-Ray and EDAX analysis was carried out in order to elucidate the distribution of carbon and mineral part in semicoke and to find possibilities for their separation and subsequent enrichment. Different separation methods – selective grinding and subsequent screening, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation</b> and triboelectroseparation method were analyzed. It was shown that due to close integration of mineral and organic part in semicoke, the separation of carbon-rich ingredients by the methods used was not enough effective to obtain enriched products suitable for the production of activated carbon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of {{pomegranate}} arils <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separation,</b> the aerodynamic characteristics of pomegranate aril, rind and locular septa are essential. The main {{aim of this study}} was to measure and compare the aerodynamic characteristics of these materials to provide the data and to facilitate the design and adjustment of machines that perform separation of pomegranate arils from rind and locular septa based on aerodynamic characteristics (terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number). To achieve this objective, Ashraf variety pomegranate fruit during its maturity stages was studied. The obtained results showed that the variation in maturity stage significantly influenced the terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number (P< 0. 05). During the fruit maturity, the terminal velocity of locular septa, rind and pomegranate aril increased from 1. 05 to 1. 16, 3. 16 to 3. 73 and 5. 89 to 6. 70 ms− 1, respectively. The corresponding value of drag coefficient of the three studied materials decreased from 0. 92 to 0. 79, 0. 75 to 0. 59 and 0. 53 to 0. 36, respectively with advancing fruit maturity. Also these ranges for Reynolds number were 403. 24 – 617. 75, 1213. 44 – 1986. 37 and 2261. 76 – 3568. 02, respectively. Consequently, aerodynamic separation of pomegranate aril from locular septa and rind is theoretically possible if the air velocity value is adjusted according to the terminal velocity of pomegranate aril. Also the obtained equations can be used for calculating the parameters of pomegranate aril movement in pneumatic tunnels or in the design and development of air conveyor and pneumatic separator of pomegranate aril...|$|E
