5|$|Hand {{was also}} a {{founding}} member of the American Law Institute, where he helped develop the influential Restatements of the Law serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields. One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality, for which reason the July–August 1955 issue of the Mattachine Society Review, the magazine of the country's first nationwide homosexual organization, published a salute to Judge Hand featuring his <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> the cover.|$|E

5|$|In late September, Tropical Storm Gilda killed 29people after {{drenching}} northern Honduras. A {{tropical depression}} in early October {{was captured by}} a high-altitude <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> a rocket, thus producing the first large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. The strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Hazel, which killed thousands in Haiti before striking near the North Carolina/South Carolina border in October. It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming extratropical and affecting Ontario. Intense rainfall affected Toronto with severe flooding, leaving significant damage. The season officially ended on November15, although another hurricane named Alice developed on December30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles; it lasted until January6 of the following year. In total, there were 16tropical storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|It {{stayed with}} an eight-column format until September 7, 1976, years after other papers had {{switched}} to six, {{and it was}} one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> the front page appearing on October 16, 1997. In the absence of a major headline, the day's most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham. The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial.|$|E
5|$|The oldest <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> {{record in}} Denmark is {{credited}} to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} telegraphy. His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was normal for daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together with the camera. Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} the Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E

5|$|The {{inventor}} Nicéphore Niépce {{produced the}} first permanent <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably {{to the development}} of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> the right, {{stages of}} {{flowering}} and fruit {{development in the}} noni or Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia) can be observed on a single branch. First an inflorescence of white flowers called a head is produced. After fertilization, each flower develops into a drupe, and as the drupes expand, they become connate (merge) into a multiple fleshy fruit called a syncarp.|$|E

The resulting collection includes over 11,000 specimens.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical orderly}} was {{originally}} believed, including by Moore-Jones, {{to be the}} Australian John Simpson Kirkpatrick, {{who served in the}} early stages of the Gallipoli Campaign before being killed by a sniper and who was well known for his use of donkeys to transport wounded soldiers from the front lines. However, by 1937 it became known that the man the subject of the <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> which the painting was based on was not Simpson but Richard Alexander Henderson, a stretcher-bearer in the New Zealand Medical Corps.|$|E
25|$|The {{monument}} {{was constructed}} in co-operation between an architect and a sculptor: Roger of Crundale, who was the senior royal mason, and Master Alexander of Abingdon, respectively. It is still standing, {{although it has been}} restored on several occasions, and the original statues of Eleanor were replaced by replicas during the last major restoration in the 1950s. The original statues were kept for some years at Cheshunt Public Library; but they were removed, possibly in the 1980s, to the Victoria & Albert Museum. A <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> the Lowewood Museum website shows one of the original statues in front of a staircase at the library.|$|E
25|$|His second {{marriage}} {{was to the}} Dutch actress, model and style icon Talitha Pol (stepdaughter of Augustus John's daughter Poppet) on 10 December 1966. The two posed for an iconic <b>photograph</b> <b>on</b> a roof-top in Marrakesh, Morocco in January 1969. The photo, taken by Patrick Lichfield, shows Talitha Getty crouched down leaning on a wall and {{her husband in the}} background in hood and sunglasses. The photo appeared in American Vogue and again in the September 1999 issue of American Vogue and is part of the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London. Two and a half years after the photo was taken, Talitha died of a heroin overdose on 14 July 1971.|$|E
