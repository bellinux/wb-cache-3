40|$|This study investigates sociolinguistic {{variation}} {{and change in}} the dialect of Ha’il city, a dialect that belongs to the Najdi type of dialects, especially Northern Najdi. Two traditional linguistic features of Ha’ili Arabic (HA) are examined: the realisation of the feminine ending (ah) and realisation of the <b>feminine</b> <b>plural</b> <b>suffix</b> (a:t), in relation to three social factors: age (Younger, Middle-aged, Older), gender (Male, Female) and levels of contact (High, Low) with people from different dialectal backgrounds. Raising of the feminine ending -ah is defined as: fronting and raising of short /a/ to /ɛ/ or /e/. In traditional Ha’ili Arabic, /a/ is raised unconditionally in all environments even after guttural and emphatic sounds (Abboud, 1979). The results, however, show progressive lowering of the (ah) variable, constrained by social and linguistic factors. Younger female speakers especially those with high level of contact lead the change toward the innovative and supra-local variant [a], while older speakers, even those with high level of contact, maintain {{the use of the}} traditional variant [e] at a very high rate (96...|$|R

5000|$|The word “ajatar” is {{possibly}} {{derived from the}} Finnish word ajaa, “to pursue" [...] (also, [...] "to drive"). The <b>feminine</b> <b>suffix</b> “-tar-” appears in several Finnish names, including a variation of Louhi (Louhetar, Loviatar, Louhiatar) and Syöjätär (syoda ‘to eat,’ with the <b>feminine</b> <b>suffix</b> of -tar, means ‘devourer, vampire’).

2500|$|Like another {{indirect}} German borrowing, fraŭlo (bachelor), which {{derives from}} fraŭlino (Miss, from [...] "fräulein") less the <b>feminine</b> <b>suffix</b> -in-, edzo {{appears to be}} a back-formation of edzino (wife). Zamenhof said the latter derives from kronprincedzino (crown princess), borrowed from the German Kronprinzessin, and then internally analyzed as kron- (crown) princ- (prince) edzino (wife). [...] However, Vilborg's Etimologia Vortaro argues that edzino is more likely to have come from Yiddish רביצין rebbetzin (rabbi's wife, Mrs.), reanalysed as rebb-etzin, and that Zamenhof made up the German etymology after the fact to avoid anti-Semitic prejudice against Esperanto. That would mean that edz- ultimately derives from the Slavic <b>feminine</b> <b>suffix</b> -its(a). Regardless, few words have histories this convoluted.|$|R
