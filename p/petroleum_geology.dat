25|$|In petrochemistry, <b>petroleum</b> <b>geology</b> {{and organic}} chemistry, {{cracking}} {{is the process}} whereby complex organic molecules such as kerogens or long-chain hydrocarbons are broken down into simpler molecules such as light hydrocarbons, by the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds in the precursors. The rate of cracking and the end products are strongly dependent on the temperature and presence of catalysts. Cracking is the breakdown of a large alkane into smaller, more useful alkanes and alkenes. Simply put, hydrocarbon cracking {{is the process of}} breaking a long-chain of hydrocarbons into short ones. This process might require high temperatures and high pressure.|$|E
