Finally, it will uncover the implications of tensions between <b>project</b> and <b>portfolio</b> controls {{and their impact on}} the management of IS <b>project</b> <b>portfolios.</b> This work contributes to the advancement of control theory and provides new insights for theory and practice by integrating the study of tensions and control...|$|R

40|$|Constraint {{programming}} (CP) is an emergent {{software technology}} for declarative description and effective solving of large combinatorial problems {{especially in the}} area of integrated production planning. In that context, CP can be considered as an appropriate framework for development of decision making software supporting small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the course of <b>projects</b> <b>portfolio</b> prototyping. The problem considered aims at finding a computationally effective approach for scheduling a new <b>projects</b> <b>portfolio</b> subject to constraints imposed by an availability of time-constrained resources. The problem belongs to a class of multi-mode project scheduling problems where the problem of finding a feasible solution is NP-complete. The aim of the paper is to present a CP modeling framework providing a prompt service to a set of routine queries stated both in straight and reverse way, e. g., concerning the <b>projects</b> <b>portfolio</b> makespan implied by a given resources allocation, and the feasible resources allocation guaranteeing an assumed <b>projects</b> <b>portfolio</b> makespan.

40|$|A {{new methods}} of {{selecting}} efficient <b>project</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{in the presence of}} hybrid uncertainty has been presented. Pareto optimal solutions have been defined by an algorithm for generating <b>project</b> <b>portfolios.</b> The method presented allows us to select efficient <b>project</b> <b>portfolios</b> taking into account statistical and economic dependencies between projects when some of the parameters used in the calculation of effectiveness can be expressed {{in the form of an}} interactive possibility distribution and some in the form of a probability distribution. The procedure for processing such hybrid data combines stochastic simulation with nonlinear programming. The interaction between data are modeled by correlation matrices and the interval regression. Economic dependences are taken into account by the equations balancing the production capacity of the company. The practical example presented indicates that an interaction between projects has a significant impact on the results of calculations. (original abstract...|$|R
