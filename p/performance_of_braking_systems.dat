An established scaling methodology was used in this study to scale the brake pads based on constant energy density.

Brake pads with four different aspect ratios were used against the scaled disc and these were scaled relative to the brake disc and pads of a medium sized passenger car.

The tests were conducted using a conventional brake dynamometer. Temperatures were measured using thermocouples on the disc and pad and, for specific tests a thermal imaging camera was also used. The experimental results showed that a strong dependency exists between the maximum rotor temperature and the pad aspect ratio. This suggests that consideration of pad aspect ratio be reflected within the scaling process. A relationship between the circumferential and radial dimensions of full scale and reduced scalebrake pads was established based on their measured thermal performance.

Conventional brakes require complex mechanical parts to dissipate energy, they are having more weight, produce less braking torque and the time of response is about 300 - 500 milliseconds and hence brake distance is high. A Magneto-rheological fluid brake is efficient than conventional <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> in terms <b>of</b> the weight reduction, and response time. In this paper MR fluid is prepard and an improved MRB design is made, taking into account the temperature effects and more accurate description of the material properties as well. The proposed work is concerned with {{the development of a new}} Brake-by-wire system which employs MRF as working medium. The design procedure comprises the selection of materials for MRB, creating an analytical model for finding the braking torque produced by the MRB and Finite Element Analysis of the MRB. Finite element models are built to provide a means to analyze the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the magneto-rheological <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> The formulation <b>of</b> these models (including the definition of the geometry, material properties, boundary conditions and meshing process, as well as necessary assumptions) are described. The results obtained with the finite element models are presented and analyzed using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> current {{antiskid}} <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> {{operating under}} {{adverse weather conditions}} was analyzed {{in an effort to}} both identify the causes of locked-wheel skids which sometimes occur when the runway is slippery and to find possible solutions to this operational problem. This analysis was made possible by the quantitative test data provided by recently completed landing research programs using fully instrumented flight test airplanes and was further supported by tests performed at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility. The antiskid <b>system</b> logic for <b>brake</b> control and for both touchdown and locked-wheel protection is described and its response behavior in adverse weather is discussed in detail with the aid of available data. The analysis indicates that the operational <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> the antiskid logic circuits is highly dependent upon wheel spin-up acceleration and can be adversely affected by certain pilot braking inputs when accelerations are low. Normal antiskid performance is assured if the tire-to-runway traction is sufficient to provide high wheel spin-up accelerations or if the system is provided a continuous, accurate ground speed reference. The design of antiskid systems is complicated by the necessity for tradeoffs between tire braking and cornering capabilities, both of which are necessary to provide safe operations in the presence of cross winds, particularly under slippery runway conditions...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> many {{antilock}} <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (ABS) deteriorate on rough, non-deformable surfaces due to a number of factors such as axle oscillations, wheel speed fluctuations and deficiencies in the algorithms. Rough terrain excitation further contribute to tyre problems such as loss of vertical contact and poor contact patch generation that leads to reduced longitudinal force generation. In this study, a slightly modified version of the Bosch ABS algorithm is implemented in Matlab/Simulink using co-simulation with a validated full vehicle ADAMS model that incorporate a valid high-fidelity FTire model. A non-ABS test vehicle is fitted with a commercial ABS modulator controlled by an embedded computer. The co-simulation model is validated with vehicle test data on both flat and rough terrains. Initial results show that wheel speed fluctuations on rough terrain cause inaccuracies in the estimation of vehicle velocity and excessive noise on the derived rotational acceleration values. This leads to inaccurate longitudinal slip calculation and poor control state decisions respectively. It is concluded that, although the correlation is not yet as desired, the combined use of a simulation model and test vehicle can be a useful tool in the research of ABS on rough terrains.
