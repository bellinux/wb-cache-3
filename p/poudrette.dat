50|$|Poudretteite is an {{extremely}} rare mineral and gemstone that was first discovered as minute crystals in Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec, Canada, during the 1960s. The mineral was named for the <b>Poudrette</b> family because they operated a quarry in the Mont St. Hilaire area where poudretteite was originally found.|$|E
5000|$|Normandite is a brittle orange brown sorosilicate mineral {{discovered}} in 1997 by Charles Normand (born 1963), of Montreal. Normandite occurs in Khibiny Massif, Kola, Russia; in <b>Poudrette</b> quarry, Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec (type locality) and Tenerife, Canary Islands. It {{is found in}} nepheline syenite and in miarolitic cavities in nepheline syenite, associated with nepheline, albite, microcline, aegirine, natrolite, catapleiite, kupletskite, eudialyte, cancrinite, villiaumite, rinkite, and donnayite-(Y).|$|E
5000|$|Quintinite {{is found}} as 2H and 3T, or 2-hexagonal and 3-trigonal, polytypes, which were {{originally}} approved as separate species, {{but have not}} been considered species since 1998. These hexagonal and trigonal forms of quinitinite are both from the hexagonal crystal systems, meaning they both have similar lengths of their crystal axes and the same angles between these axes. As a hexagonal mineral, quintinite has three axes of equal length at 60 degree angles {{to one another and}} a c axis perpendicular to these three axes of a different length. 2H occurs in carbonatite at Jacupiranga, São Paulo, Brazil, in the Jacupiranga mine and 3T occurs with minerals like gonnardite and donnayite. Both polytypes occur in hydrothermal vents in alkaline rocks. Herg (1977) interpreted the Jacupiranga area as related to a hotspot. The 3T polytype was originally found in the <b>Poudrette</b> quarry at Mont Saint-Hilaire, which is a rare alkaline intrusive complex. The 2H polytype is pleochroic, meaning that the mineral changes colors (in this case yellow and light yellow) when viewed at different angles under a polarizing petrographic microscope. [...] The 3T polytype, however, is not commonly pleochroic but can show green pleochroism if it is high in iron. [...] The 3T polytype has a positive index of refraction whereas the 2H polytype can possess crystals with either a positive or a negative index of refraction.|$|E

40|$|Nepheline syenite {{represents}} the highly differentiated product of fractional crystallization in the <b>Poudrette</b> quarry at Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec. It also records a significant subsolidus overprint due to circulation of post-magmatic fluids. Annite, the ferrous-iron-dominant {{member of the}} biotite series, represents up to 20 % of the typical nepheline syenites. Hand samples cover the complete range of freshness, from unaltered to hydrothermally modified rocks. Identification of minerals and estimation of their abundances and compositions were obtained with optical microscopy and electron-microprobe analysis. I also used a combined approach of X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. With respect to annite composition, Fe/(Fe + Mg) varies from 0. 74 (porphyntic nepheline syenite) to 0. 98 (poikilitic nepheline syenite). Concerning the habit of annite, the melt composition controls the order of crystallization, which then in turn controls whether the annite is bladed and skeletal or oikocrystic. The rock from the <b>Poudrette</b> dyke is a hypersolvus nepheline syenite in which the bladed annite was a liquidus phase; therefore, the order of crystallization was "normal" (mafic mineral first), whereas in poikilitic nepheline syenite, this order was reverse. The proportion of Ti decreases with Fe/(Fe + Mg), whereas that of Mn increases; F and Cl contents are very low {{in spite of their}} availability. The application of n-alkylammonium cation exchange reveals the presence of planar structural defects as a result of dehydrogenation-type reactions. The annite records the results of oxidation during cooling, i. e., open-system behavior in this degassing pluton...|$|E
40|$|The Tartu <b>Poudrette</b> factory or Why the WaterSupply System in Tartu was {{constructed}} so lateAt times the sanitary problems grew quite grave {{in the fast}} growing cities of the 19 th century. Technology and medicine also developed swiftly {{but it was not}} always that the different fields provided support to each other at the right time and according to necessity. The University of Tartu is known as an innovative centre of medicine. The city had been studied by chemists (e. g., the research on the wells of Tartu by Carl Schmidt), physicians (medical topography already since the early 19 th century), demographers (biostatisticians),etc. Considering this, it is somewhat surprising that the sanitary conditions in Tartu were rather poor at length even for those times. The University constructed its own water supply system already in 1889 but institutions and classes were unable to reach an agreement with regard to the city water supply. The newly emergent body of active Estonians responsible for building the grand and modern Vanemuine theatre house was willing to live in quite modest conditions in view of hygiene. In order to solve the city’s issue of human waste a <b>Poudrette</b> factory was built on the territory of the Jaama city estate in 1866. This solution was somewhat outdated already then. The factory produced a fertilizer mix of dry night soil, which sold quite well. Gustav Post, the lessee and later owner, became a rich man. The factory was municipalizedeven before WW I and it developed to be a substantialsource of income for the city in independent Estonia. Tartu was the only city in Estonia where this part of the city’s economy brought a profit. This is likely {{one of the reasons why}} a water supply system that covered the entire city was built only in the 1930 s in Tartu...|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} {{the occurrence of}} Fe-bearing trioctahedral micas in the <b>Poudrette</b> quarry in the Mont Saint-Hilaire alkaline intrusion, characterize them by microprobe analysis, M 6 ssbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and optical measurements, describe their mineral chemistry, and discuss their petrological significance. In the nepheline and sodalite syenite, biotite and annite occur as coarse crystals characterized by low A 1 content (typically 2 atoms per formula unit, a. f. u.), high Mn content (typically 0. 2 to 0. 8 a. f. u.) and variable Fe/(Fe+Mg) values from 0. 61 to 0. 97. In the gabbro, biotite is less Fe-rich, has lower Mn content and high Ti content. Phlogopite is found as small metamorphic crystals in marble xenoliths within the syenite and siderophyllite occurs as large crystals in a metasomatized albitite dyke. Fe 3 +/Fetot values extend from 0. 079 in the siderophyllite o 0. 282 in a high-Fe 3 + annite. All of the micas except for the phlogopite have high contents of (Fe 3 +) iv (~ 0. 13 to 0. 45 a. f. u.) despite the high availability of A 1 in the rocks. We suggest hat the high (Fe 3 +) iv amounts are caused by the high Mn abundance via a local structural mechanism. The great variety of mica encountered at Mont Saint-Hilaire reflects the highly heterogeneous conditions that prevailed uring magmatic and postmagmatic crystallization i this intrusion...|$|E
