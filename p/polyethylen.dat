40|$|Abstract: The {{functionalization}} and cross-linking of polyethylene is synthetically challenging, commonly {{relying on}} highly optimized radical based postpolymerization strategies.

Upon heating the copolymer to common polyethylene processing temperatures, the thermolysis of Mel-drum’s acid to ketene provides the desired reactive group. This simple and versatile methodology does not require small molecule radical sources or catalysts, and the dimerization of the in situ generated ketenes is shown to provide tunable cross-linking densities in polyethylene.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Experiments {{were done}} in the {{freezing}} chamber with <b>polyethylen</b> specimens sliding on ice using a tribometer. The coefficient of friction was measured {{as a function of}} the surrounding temperature (varyied between- 25 °C and O°e) and the pressure on the slider (varyied between 50 MPa and 300 Mpa). The coefficient of friction is strongly depending on the temperature of the ice surface. It is on its minimum around- 3 °C. In the temperature range between- 3 °C and O°C the coefficient of friction is increasing with increasing temperature. In the temperature range between- 3 °C and- 25 °C the coefficient of friction is increasing with decreasing temperature. The results correspond well to the idea of three different components forming the overall kinetic friction. At low temperatures dry friction dominates, whereas with increasing temperature a more lubricated friction decreases the coefficient of friction and for even higher temperatures capillary drag effects increase the friction again...|$|E

Methods: For gastric sampling, animals were anesthetized and a <b>polyethylen</b> tube was introduced into the stomach through esophagus. A cannula was also inserted into the pyloroduodenal junction and passed up into the stomach. Results: Our data showed that administration of bromocriptine (2 mg/kg), 60 minutes before histamine infusion, did not affect basal acid secretion but significantly reduced histamine-induced GAS (P< 0. 01). Also, simultaneous application of bromocriptine and histamine-infusion (0. 8 mg/ 100 g/h) {{had no effect on}} histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The inhibitory effect of bromocriptine on GAS did not change by sulpiride, a D 2 dopamine antagonist. Plasma glucose level was constant in our experimental conditions.

Fickian diffusion in polymers is an idealized case of mass transport, corresponding to a free diffusion of permeant without interactions with the molecular conformation of the polymer and then with its structural relaxation. There is a direct relationship between the diffusion and relaxation of the polymer and on whether we place ourselves below (glassy state) or above (rubbery state) of the glass transition temperature Tg, the diffusion mechanisms are very different. There are two types of models to describe the variation of the diffusion coefficient D. In this contribution, we will review the different behaviors of the distribution function of the Tg and show us the Deborah number D-defined as the ratio of characteristic times of diffusion and relaxation, to indicate the nature of dissemination and to apply the model.
