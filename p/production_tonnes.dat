The value of directly dependent crops attributed to all insect pollination (2009 USD) decreased from $ 14. 29 billion in 1996, the first year for value data in this study, to $ 10. 69 billion in 2001, but increased thereafter, reaching $ 15. 12 billion by 2009. The values attributed to honey bees and non-Apis pollinators followed similar patterns, reaching $ 11. 68 billion and $ 3. 44 billion, respectively, by 2009. The {{cultivated area}} of crops grown from seeds resulting from insect pollination (indirectly dependent crops: legume hays, carrots, onions, etc.) was stable from 1992 through 1999, but has since declined. Production of those crops also declined, albeit not as rapidly as the decline in cultivated area; this asymmetry was due to increases in aggregate yield. The value of indirectly dependent crops attributed to insect pollination declined from $ 15. 45 billion in 1996 to $ 12. 00 billion in 2004, but has since trended upward. The value of indirectly dependent crops attributed to honey bees and non-Apis pollinators, exclusive of alfalfa leafcutter bees, has declined since 1996 to $ 5. 39 billion and $ 1. 15 billion, respectively in 2009. The value of alfalfa hay attributed to alfalfa leafcutter bees ranged between $ 4. 99 and $ 7. 04 billion.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{offsetting}} effect of a rise in productivity and decline in harvested area, the world sorghum <b>production</b> (<b>tonnes)</b> has been on a horizontal trend. The combined effect of a decline in area harvested and a rise in yield productivity have resulted in an overall increase in world millet <b>production</b> (<b>tonnes)</b> trend. During the last three decades, significant numbers of breeding lines, parental stocks, germplasm and cultivars have been released through INTSORMIL/host countries collaboration around the world. Some of the remarkable breeding success stories include the release of the first hybrid sorghum Hageen Dura (HD- 1) and Striga tolerant varieties in Sudan; the introduction and release of Sureno sorghum variety in Honduras; and numerous other releases in various other African and Latin American countries such as Mali (Malisor lines with excellent head bug resistance, N 2 ̆ 7 Tenimissa-tan plant guinea type cultivars), Niger (high yielding varieties as well as drought resistant hybrids), Nigeria (LCICMH-I -a pearl millet hybrid with early maturing characteristic), Zambia (improved varieties such as Kuyuma and Sima and hybrids such as MMSH- 928 for drought prone areas, MMSH- 1324 for resistant to most diseases, and MMSH- 1256 widely adapted to most of the country) and Ethiopia (Striga resistant varieties such as Gubiye, Abshir and Brhan), Columbia (two varieties, Sorgo Real 40 and Sorgo Real 60 that are tolerant to Al and salt). On a global coverage, the average rate of return to sorghum and millet agricultural R 2 ̆ 6 D investments is about 60 percent per year which is in the range of the average rate of return estimated for agricultural R 2 ̆ 6 D investments. Despite the positive and promising returns to investment in sorghum and millet researches, there appears to be limited economic analysis done in such endeavors. It is important to increase the impact assessment studies to provide empirical support to investments in sorghum and millet improvement technologies. INTSORMIL host countries have benefited from a significant amount of cultivar releases over the last three decades. Based on INTSORMIL reports and successful releases as well as potential adoptions, more impact assessment type of studies should be done in general in Asia (India) and the United States as well. Other countries for that deserve economic impact assessment are: Honduras (for example the variety Sureno), Columbia (aluminum/salt tolerant varieties), Mali, Niger and Zambia (all with multiple cultivars) particularly based on the significant amount of varietal releases in record during the life span of INTSORMIL. Analysis of dynamics of the data on the area harvested during INTSORMIL’s lifespan would also show that Nigeria, Niger- for example SEPON 82 is the most adapted cultivar in Southern Maradi region of Niger 7 -, Mali, Senegal, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Uganda have seen an increase in the area harvested (ha) to Sorghum that lends support to the need to undertake impact assessment studies. So many reports reveal that quite significant amount of releases are already out there for farmers to use. In spite of the successful research and development progress shown through INTSORMIL in particular and local and international research centers in general, nonetheless, the lack of functional technology transfer institutions continue to pose significant impediments for the overall solutions to development in agriculture. In general, it is observed {{that the majority of the}} economic impact assessment studies were evaluations of past R 2 ̆ 6 D investments (ex-post type analyses) and even more so in the Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Even though, the amount of such ex-post studies is by no means enough, it is essential to consider that adequate economic impact assessment studies (ex-ante type) be undertaken to help aid in the crafting of effective technology introductions and policy designs...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new methods}} to improve open stope hangingwall (HW) design based on knowledge gained from site visits, observations, and data collection at underground mines in Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan. The data for analysis was collected during 2 months {{of research at the}} Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Ltd. Callinan Mine in Flin Flon, Manitoba, a few trips to the Cameco Rabbit Lake mine in northern Saskatchewan, and 3 years of research and employment at the Xstrata Zinc George Fisher mine near Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. Other sites visited, where substantial stope stability knowledge was accessed include the Inco Thompson mines in northern Manitoba; BHP Cannington mine, Xstrata Zinc Lead Mine, and Xstrata Copper Enterprise Mine, in Queensland, Australia; and the Kazzinc Maleevskiy Mine in north-eastern Kazakhstan. An improved understanding of stability and design of open stope HWs was developed based on: 1) 	Three years of data collection from various rock masses and mining geometries to develop new sets of design lines for an existing HW stability assessment method; 2) 	The consideration of various scales of domains to examine HW rock mass behaviour and development of a new HW stability assessment method; 3) 	The investigation of the HW failure mechanism using analytical and numerical methods; 4) 	An examination of the effects of stress, undercutting, faulting, and time on stope HW stability through the presentation of observations and case histories; and 5) 	Innovative stope design techniques to manage predicted stope HW instability. An observational approach was used for the formulation of the new stope design methodology. To improve mine performance by reducing and/or controlling the HW rock from diluting the ore with non-economic material, the individual stope design methodology included creating vertical HWs, leaving ore skins or chocks where appropriate, and rock mass management. The work contributed to a reduction in annual dilution from 14. 4 % (2003) to 6. 3 % (2005), an increase in zinc grade from 7. 4 % to 8. 7 %, and increasing <b>production</b> <b>tonnes</b> from 2. 1 to 2. 6 Mt (Capes et al., 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|In Papua New Guinea, {{oil palm}} is {{regarded}} as a crop with great economic importance and is now the dominant export cash crop in terms of export revenue. It is grown in six provinces in PNG which are Hoskins and Bialla in West New Britain Province, Popondetta in Oro Province, Higaturu in Milne Bay Province, Poliamba in New Ireland Province and Ramu in Madang Province. The study examined the effectiveness of OPIC extension services provided to smallholder oil palm growers in Hoskins. The research included growers in the Hoskins land settlement scheme (LSS) and village oil palm (VOP) growers in the Hoskins project area. The LSS subdivision studied was Buvussi and the VOP subdivisions were Bubu and Lilimo. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to identify the factors hindering smallholders’ productivity on oil palm as their <b>production</b> (<b>tonnes</b> per hectare) was considerably below the estate plantations managed by the company. To investigate smallholder production, factors such as smallholder block population, education levels of grower families, leaseholder status, type of production strategy, adoption rate of extension messages and productivity were investigated. The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate these aspects of smallholder production and extension. The findings of the study indicate that there was low extension contact between the extension officers and smallholders with most visits because of sexava infestations. The low ratio of extension officers to blockholders was a factor in limiting OPIC (the extension agency) capacity for block visits. The majority of blockholders received their extension information through their visits to the OPIC office. However, the study revealed that the majority of blockholders were knowledgeable about oil palm and had excellent management skills on oil palm production. The study revealed that the education level of children in secondary households was adversely affected as priority was given to children in primary households. Due to population and income pressures, the single household block has been replaced with multiple household blocks and this has led to changes in the production strategies pursued on blocks. The harvesting strategy has shifted from the traditional harvesting method (wok bung) to makim mun, skelim hecta and some blocks practising a mixture of all three strategies. However, wok bung was found to be the most productive method of harvesting in terms of tonnes/ha/year. The study also found that population and income pressures have influenced blockholders’ decision-making process to adopt extension messages on fertilizer and replanting, thus there was low adoption levels. The low level of fertilizer application was due to increases in fertilizer prices over the last five years and also was due to disputes over block management which has led to falling productivity. The makim mun strategy of harvesting was also found to have an influence on adoption. However, reluctance to replant was because most blockholders were ferarful of debt accumulation and financial constraints due to loss of income after replanting. Therefore, the study recognised that smallholders’ low production was not due to lack of knowledge and skills on oil palm but was due to stresses associated with rising population pressures, together with the ineffectiveness of extension services provided by OPIC to smallholders...|$|E

40|$|Every {{year more}} and more Africans are {{choosing}} to eat rice. Consumption is rising by 5 % a year and although this is a decelerating increase compared to the ' 70 s, there is an ever-widening gap between demand and local supply. Until now this gap has been filled by imports of rice from the distant horizons of Asia but the economic climate in Africa has changed considerably within the last few years. While imports may remain the most sensible option for the vast urban populations who live close to an ocean port, {{people who live in}} towns far from the coast may find themselves increasingly dependent on local rice production. In West Africa, the most significant rice production area of sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of rice farmers are poor, cultivating no more than one hectare, and yet the most sophisticated tools and techniques available anywhere in the world are being used to help such farmers. It is with Africa's own genetic resources that their problems are being solved. Rapid urbanization has created the increased demand for rice. Quicker and easier to prepare than traditional staples such as sorghum or millet, rice is the cereal that urban working people prefer. Rice in Africa is no longer a luxury food and a survey in Burkina Faso, typical of several other West African states, shows that the poorest third of urban households obtain 33 % of their cereal-based calories from rice. Availability and price are major issues for consumers, and therefore also for rice producers, in West Africa. Liberalization While governments were able to import rice from South East Asia at very low prices there was little incentive to farmers to increase production beyond their own needs. State monopoly on imports was an opportunity to balance a controlled price to concentrated and politically active urban consumers, and a controlled profit to the government exchequer. Those who did not prosper were rural producers. The effect of devaluation has been to strengthen rice production in areas where it is already successful, such as in Mali. Where production is weaker, for example in Senegal where production has been in decline since 1991 and in Niger where the public sector has been experiencing some difficulties, devaluation has made the situation worse. Structural adjustment has loosened the grip of government on pricing, as it affects both producers and consumers. If producers can sell their rice at the farm gate to whichever trader will pay the best price, and if consumers can choose the quality of rice they consume according to preference and ability to pay, does this mean that local production will improve? Results of recent research conducted by WARDA (West Africa Rice Development Association) show that it is unrealistic to believe that local rice production can ever meet the demand of the coastal capital cities. Even if it were possible to raise production levels sufficiently, the cost of transporting rice from the hinterland to the coast, for the most part on inadequate roads, would quickly price it above imported rice. However, there are viable opportunities for local farmers to supply the many cities and towns away from the coastal ports. This means that the cost of transport is transferred to the imported rice, favouring the competitive edge of the local supplier. The economic prospects for rice production {{are in a state of}} transition. It is not easy to exchange decades of state control to a private sector where, by and large, market forces will determine the direction of development. But for farmers, the day to day farming constraints that they face may be more immediate and more challenging than the effects of fiscal policy. Environmental pressures Throughout much of Africa soil fertility is in decline. Adding imported inorganic fertilizer has never been an option available to most farmers in the region. It has cost too much in the past and now it costs even more. Pressure on land in the last two decades has had the effect of reducing the fallow period of forest bush from 12 - l 15 years to 3 - 5 years in high population areas, 5 - 7 years elsewhere. In the savanna, similar pressures are forcing farmers to double (4 - 6 from 2 - 3) the number of crossings between fallow periods. Not only has this had the effect of depleting the soil of nutrients, reducing organic matter and increasing soil erosion, but farmers now have an even greater struggle with what has always been a major problem with rice production: weeds. The upland soils on which rainfed rice has traditionally been grown are inherently fragile. Currently upland rice represents nearly 60 % of the total regional rice area. Forced to intensify cultivation without access to improved inputs, farmers' current practices are degrading these soils and contributing to declining productivity. What hope is there that such farmers could increase rice production without exacerbating an already destructive system? New demands In the first place, farmers need upland rice varieties that yield more for less. In other words they must produce better yields than those achieved with present varieties under the same poor growing conditions. At the same time, any new varieties must have the capacity to reward farmers with much higher yields in return for modest improvements to their farming system. In the second place, there are areas of land that at the present time are under exploited. If the constraints which currently inhibit rice production in such areas are overcome, not only is there potential for dramatically increasing overall rice production, there is also the considerable benefit of helping to protect the fragile upland environment on which the demand for rice production currently falls. The most sophisticated tools available to plant breeders today are being used to develop varieties that meet the needs of resource poor farmers. Unless those needs are met through the seed that farmers plant, there is very little hope of increasing productivity because farmers cannot afford fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, herbicides or machinery. One of the most exciting achievements has been the successful crossing of African and Asian rice species at WARDA. This work is receiving international recognition for its importance, not only by rice breeders within Africa but also by breeders in other major rice producing areas of the world, notably China and Vietnam. Throughout Africa it is the Asian rice species, Oryza sativa, that has predominated in modern times. This is because it has much higher yield potential than the indigenous African rice, Oryza glaberrima. O. glalberrima is now grown only in small pockets of land for domestic consumption, because many people prefer its taste. The principal reason for the greater yield of O. sativa is the number of grain holding spikelets that form on the panicle. Unlike O. glaberrima, which has only primary branching, O. sativa forms secondary, grain-holding spikelets. The more spikelets there are, the more grain the panicle can produce. But O. glaberrima has advantages too. One advantage is that it has droopy leaves which shade the ground and reduce competition from weeds. O. glaberrima also has very rapid seedling growth and produces many more tillers than O. sativa. This too has the effect of reducing the space in which weeds can grow. Not only is weeding labour intensive but the three week window in the farming calendar when it must be done is too short for most farmers to finish the job. Rice which is weeded late does not recover, even if it is cleared of weeds later in the season. The droopy leaves of African rice also help to conserve soil moisture and, because it has evolved over 3, 500 years in African conditions, O. glaberrima is better adapted to the biological stresses and poor soils of the African environment and is therefore more robust than Asian varieties. Breeding new varieties The successful crossing of African and Asian rice species using conventional breeding techniques has been a scientific achievement that owes much to the persistence of WARDA's team of breeders. They have achieved varieties which combine the best characteristics of the two rice types. What has astonished the plant breeding world is not that these new varieties show characteristics of both rice types but that they show changes in plant structure through the plant's development stages, from one plant type to the other. The new progeny develop like O. glaterrima in the early growth stages, with thin droopy leaves which help smother weeds. As the rice plant grows, becomes more like O. saliva. The leaves become thicker and more upright and so capture solar radiation more efficiently, a trait that is critical for high yield potential. The new varieties have also inherited the thicker stem of the sativa parent and are therefore less susceptible to lodging. Their panicles develop with secondary spikelets and most of the new progeny have substantially larger panicles than either of their parents. These new varieties, like their O. glaberrima parent, continue tillering even in drought conditions (O. sativas increases in height in preference to tillering when under stress). The new progeny have proved to be an excellent starting point for subsequent breeding programmes because they have within them genes from both O. glaterrima and O. sativa. The first season's field trials of the newly created plant types were conducted last year on two sites in Cote d'lvoire. One was on soil that had been continuously cropped for the previous three years and before that was on short threeyear fallow. Even on this exhausted soil, with no added nitrogen, the new progeny significantly outyielded the best O. sativa varieties. 011 better soil, with nitrogen added at 80 kg/ha, yields of 5. 6 t/ha were obtained. Expanding the production area 1 here are 20 - 30 million hectares of inland valleys in West Africa of which less than 1 15 % is cultivated and less than 5 % is used for rice. It is not known precisely why these lowlands are so underexploited. There have been suggestions ranging from the risk of crop failure due to erratic flooding, the risk of diseases such as malaria or schistosomiasis or the traditional belief that men who work in the valleys risk impotence. The most likely reason is that uplands are easier to cultivate, requiring less land clearance because there is less weed growth than in the more fertile inland valleys. Population pressure, the need to protect fragile uplands and increasing demand for rice all make lowland cultivation more attractive. In a single decade, lowlands have the potential to produce ten crops of at least twice the yield compared to the three crops (allowing for fallow) achievable 011 uplands. The new varieties developed by WARDA have the genetic potential to resist some of the very different agronomic constraints experienced in lowland cultivation, particularly Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV), blast and African rice gall midge. Rice yellow mottle virus RYMV is a new threat to African rice production. First described in Kenya in 1966, it is Africa's only known rice viral disease and it has noow spread throughout most of sub Saharan Africa where rice is grown in lowland, humid conditions. It has spread very fast in the last five to seven years and affects the improved, irrigated varieties based on O. saliva. At its worst RYMV causes 100 % loss. The virus is highly virulent. If inoculation by the virus occurs early in the life of the plant, its height is reduced by 60 % and the number of tillers is also reduced. The panicles do not open up properly and the percentage of filled grain is very low. It is still not known for sure whether the virus can be transmitted within the seed. Sites where the virus is most persistent have been identified and varieties that are similar to those preferred in the region are being tested at these 'hot spore' with the help of national scientists through WARDA's Task Force mechanism which involves the NARS of its member states. These and a further 60 varieties (112 in total) are being tested in special screen houses. These varieties have been challenged with the virus by the simple process of grinding leaves from infected plants and wiping the crushed residue, by hand, on to the leaves of the varieties to be tested. Those that are most resistant have been selected and, provided they prove to be suitable in all other respects, will be available for release in 1997. Perhaps most promising of all are the new varieties, some of which carry not just resistance but natural immunity to RYMV. Farmer options for improving production are not limited to variety choice, even though this may be the single most significant decision. Whichever varieties are chosen, all will respond better if crop management is improved. To ensure that the shift to more intensified rice based cropping systems is sustainable, improved crop and resource management practices that are socially and economically acceptable are urgently required. Rice farmers in Africa have already demonstrated that they can respond to demand. What they need is continued support from the agricultural research conummunity to ensure that this response is not detrimental to the natural resource base of the region. Recent advances in rice research have the potential to deliver real improve meets to the rice production sector in Africa. This should benefit rural producers, l urban consumers and those between who are involved in trading and milling. The challellges that African producers face may, in l detail, be specific to their region, but some - of the solutions could find wider application, beyond the continent of Africa. New horizons could be opening up for African rice. Proportion of rice (hectares) grown under different production systems in W.
