50|$|Cork, on the {{southern}} coast of Ireland, has a long-standing association with animal produce and, from the 17th century {{to the end of}} the 19th century, was a major supplier of butter and salted (<b>preserved)</b> beef and <b>pork</b> to the British Empire and specifically the armed forces. The beef and pork industry meant a plentiful supply of offal. Offcuts were available at affordable prices for local consumption by the poor and underprivileged. An entire Cork cuisine developed based on offal - particularly pig offal. Examples include crubeens/cruibín (pigs' trotters); pigs' tails; drisheen - a boiled blood sausage traditionally served with tripe; bodice - plain or salted pig ribs, cooked as a simple white stew, or as a salted bacon dish cooked with cabbage and turnip.
