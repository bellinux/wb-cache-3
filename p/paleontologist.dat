5|$|The Aix Basin {{was first}} {{excavated}} for fossils in 1869 by French <b>paleontologist</b> Philippe Matheron. In the 1950s, Raymond Dughi and Francois Sirugue, {{a pair of}} French paleontologists working for the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle Aix-en-Provence, extensively studied the basin's fossil eggshells. They divided the eggs they had found into ten different types, {{but they did not}} describe them in detail. In the 1970s and 1980s, further work was done by the French <b>paleontologist</b> P. Kerourio and the German <b>paleontologist</b> H. K. Erben.|$|E

50|$|There is {{consensus}} among <b>paleontologists</b> that birds are {{the descendants of}} coelurosaurs. Under modern cladistic definitions, birds are considered the only living lineage of coelurosaurs. Birds are classified by most <b>paleontologists</b> as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora.|$|R
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while <b>paleontologists</b> {{are interested in the}} characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and <b>paleontologists</b> may work together– for example <b>paleontologists</b> might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what the people who lived there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|R
5|$|Fossils now {{attributed}} to Dimetrodon were first studied by American <b>paleontologist</b> Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s. Cope had obtained the fossils {{along with those}} of many other Permian tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) from several collectors who had been exploring a group of rocks in Texas called the Red Beds. Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur <b>paleontologist</b> Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope's specimens went to the American Museum of Natural History or to the University of Chicago's Walker Museum (most of the Walker fossil collection is now housed in the Field Museum of Natural History).|$|E
5|$|Henry Fairfield Osborn – <b>paleontologist</b> and geologist, Osborn {{joined the}} US Geological Survey in 1890, {{and on one}} fossil-hunting trip to the West met Cope. He {{described}} numerous well-known dinosaur genera, including Ornitholestes, Tyrannosaurus, and Velociraptor.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the <b>paleontologist</b> John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the <b>paleontologist</b> Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the <b>paleontologist</b> Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the <b>paleontologist</b> Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the German <b>paleontologist</b> Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} {{variation}} tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.|$|E
5|$|On two occasions, species {{based on}} valid Albertosaurus {{material}} were reassigned {{to a different}} genus: in 1922 William Diller Matthew renamed A. sarcophagus into Deinodon sarcophagus and in 1939 German <b>paleontologist</b> Oskar Kuhn renamed A. arctunguis into Deinodon arctunguis.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyli {{became a}} {{commonly}} used {{name at the}} turn of the century. Paleontologists included both embolomeres and rhachitomes in the group. Cope's Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta fell out of use. In 1919, British <b>paleontologist</b> D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae. Embolomerous forms in the Carboniferous graded into rhachitomous forms in the Permian, and finally into stereospondyls in the Triassic. More importantly, Watson began using the term Labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups. The name Temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that followed. Swedish <b>paleontologist</b> Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh removed embolomeres from the group, narrowing its scope to rhachitomes and stereospondyls. His classification of labyrinthodonts was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paleontologists</b> {{looked at}} endocasts {{in order to}} study the {{increase}} in size of olfactory bulbs.Preservation of soft tissue is virtually impossible in fossils, therefore <b>paleontologists</b> rely on endocasts to study the brain.Some skulls have the brain pressed up against them, leaving impressions that allow the <b>paleontologists</b> to see possible structures that are soft tissue that are harder to see such as blood vessels.They found that the casts in Brasilitherium was larger than non mammaliaform cynodonts.This led to the suggestion that Brasilitherium had early evolution of the mammalian brain.|$|R

5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and <b>paleontologist</b> Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E

5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of Carcharocles, proposed in 2001 by <b>paleontologist</b> Michael Benton, is that the three other species are actually a single species of shark that gradually changed over time between the Paleocene and the Pliocene, making it a chronospecies. Some authors suggest that C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, and C. chubutensis should be classified as a single species in the genus Otodus, leaving C. megalodon the sole member of Carcharocles.|$|E

5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with <b>paleontologist</b> Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
5|$|Hatzegopteryx {{was named}} in 2002 by French <b>paleontologist</b> Eric Buffetaut, and Romanian paleontologists Dan Grigorescu and Zoltan Csiki.

5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} and debated.

Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E
