25|$|Fauci {{has made}} a number of basic {{scientific}} observations that contribute to the current understanding of the regulation of the human immune response, and is recognized for delineating the mechanisms whereby immunosuppressive agents adapt to the human immune response. He has developed therapies for formerly fatal diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. In a 1985 Stanford University Arthritis Center Survey of the American Rheumatism Association membership ranked the work of Fauci on the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis {{as one of the most}} important advances in <b>patient</b> <b>management</b> in rheumatology over the previous 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) uses coincidence detection to image functional processes. Short-lived positron emitting isotope, such as 18F, is incorporated with an organic substance such as glucose, creating F18-fluorodeoxyglucose, {{which can be}} used as a marker of metabolic utilization. Images of activity distribution throughout the body can show rapidly growing tissue, like tumor, metastasis, or infection. PET images can be viewed in comparison to computed tomography scans to determine an anatomic correlate. Modern scanners may integrate PET, allowing PET-CT, or PET-MRI to optimize the image reconstruction involved with positron imaging. This is performed on the same equipment without physically moving the patient off of the gantry. The resultant hybrid of functional and anatomic imaging information is a useful tool in non-invasive diagnosis and <b>patient</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E
25|$|The MBBS course {{starts with}} the basic pre and para-clinical {{subjects}} such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology.

The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management and thorough counselling skills.|$|E

2500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to resolve a}} periapical lesion of endodontic origin, {{it is essential to}} be conscious of these principles in order to effectively combat the infection. [...] Without proper consideration for the causes, the pulpal and periapical infection cannot be suitably treated, for effective <b>patient</b> <b>management</b> requires the correct diagnosis and removal of the cause of the infection of endodontic origin to correct the associated periapical lesion. [...] Because periapical disease is almost inevitably preceded by pulp disease, proper chemomechanical debridement of the infected root canals, together with incision and drainage of associated periradicular swellings, will usually allow for rapid improvement in patient signs and symptoms. [...] The same end can be accomplished by extracting the involved tooth.|$|E
