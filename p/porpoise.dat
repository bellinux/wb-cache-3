5|$|The Harbour <b>porpoise,</b> spectacled <b>porpoise,</b> Burmeister's <b>porpoise,</b> and Dall's <b>porpoise</b> are all {{listed on}} Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).

5|$|As of 2014, {{only five}} hundred and five Yangtze finless {{porpoises}} {{remained in the}} main section of the Yangtze, with an alarming population density in Ezhou and Zhenjiang. While many threatened species decline rate slows after their classification, population decline rates of the <b>porpoise</b> are actually accelerating. While population decline tracked from 1994 to 2008 has been pegged {{at a rate of}} 6.06% annually, from 2006 to 2012, the <b>porpoise</b> population decreased by more than half. Finless <b>porpoise</b> population decrease of 69.8% in just a 22-year span from 1976 to 2000. 5.3%. A majority of factors of this population decline are being driven by the massive growth in Chinese industry since 1990 which caused increased shipping and pollution and ultimately environmental degradation. Some of these can be seen in damming of the river as well as illegal fishing activity. To protect the species, China's Ministry of Agriculture classified the species as being National First Grade Key Protected Wild Animal, the strictest classification by law, meaning it is illegal to bring harm to a <b>porpoise.</b> Protective measures in the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve has increased its population of porpoises from five to forty in twenty five years. The Chinese Academy of Science's Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology has been working with the World Wildlife Fund to ensure the future for this subspecies, and have placed five porpoises in another well-protected area, the He-wang-miao oxbow. Five protected natural reserves have been established in areas of the highest population density and mortality rates with measures being taken to ban patrolling and harmful fishing gear in those areas. There have also been efforts to study <b>porpoise</b> biology to help specialize conservation through captivation breeding. The Baiji Dolphinarium, was established in 1992 at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan which allowing the study of behavioral and biological factors affecting the finless <b>porpoise,</b> specifically breeding biology like seasonal changes in reproductive hormones and breeding behavior.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour <b>porpoise</b> {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor <b>porpoise</b> dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the <b>porpoise</b> as a fish.|$|E

5|$|Harbor seals, {{northern}} fur seals, sea otters, harbor <b>porpoises,</b> Dall's <b>porpoises</b> and Steller {{sea lions}} are also seen in Glacier Bay.|$|R
5000|$|Harbour <b>porpoises</b> {{tend to be}} solitary foragers, {{but they}} do {{sometimes}} hunt in packs and herd fish together. [...] Young <b>porpoises</b> need to consume about 7% to 8% of their body weight each day to survive, which is approximately 15 pounds or 7 kilograms of fish. Significant predators of harbour <b>porpoises</b> include white sharks and killer whales (orcas). Researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland have also discovered that the local bottlenose dolphins attack and kill harbour <b>porpoises</b> without eating them due to competition for a decreasing food supply. An alternative {{explanation is that the}} adult dolphins exhibit infanticidal behaviour and mistake the <b>porpoises</b> for juvenile dolphins which they are believed to kill. Also grey seals attack harbour <b>porpoises</b> by biting off chucks of fat as a high energy source.|$|R
5|$|Porpoises, {{divided into}} seven species, live in all oceans, mostly near the shore. Probably best known is the harbour <b>porpoise,</b> {{which can be}} found across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank {{and access to}} females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, {{with a series of}} acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a <b>porpoise</b> expert researching similar cases of <b>porpoise</b> killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July, 2014, four attacks with three <b>Porpoise</b> fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay.|$|E
5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a <b>porpoise</b> bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a <b>porpoise</b> is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
40|$|The six {{species of}} <b>porpoises</b> inhabit the cold {{waters of the}} globe, {{displaying}} a textbook example of anti-tropical distribution in marine mammals. Nevertheless, the evolutionary history of the <b>porpoises</b> still remained poorly understood, but this knowledge is crucial to illuminate the conservation issues reported in these species (e. g. the nearly extinct vaquita, Yangzte finless porpoises; subspecies of harbour porpoises; poorly known spectacled and Burmeister <b>porpoises).</b> In this study, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the <b>porpoises</b> in relation to past climatic changes. We used Next Generation Sequencing to assemble the mitochondrial genomes of 57 <b>porpoises,</b> resulting in a 16303 bps alignments. In contrast to previous beliefs, phylogenetic and population genetic analyses revealed that spectacled and Burmeister’s <b>porpoises</b> share a more recent common ancestor than with the vaquita. The vaquita would have split from the other during the Pliocene and then collapsed 3000 years ago. We also observed unreported subspecies level of divergence within the Pacific harbour <b>porpoises</b> similar to those reported in the North Atlantic, suggesting a richer evolutionary history than previously thought for this species. Our results provide {{a new perspective on}} the divergence, adaptation and speciation processes involved in the diversification of the <b>porpoises...</b>|$|R
5|$|Recently {{discovered}} hybrids {{between male}} harbour <b>porpoises</b> and female Dall's <b>porpoises</b> indicate {{the two species}} may actually be {{members of the same}} genus.|$|R
50|$|Marine top predators like <b>porpoises</b> {{and seals}} {{accumulate}} pollutants such as heavy metals, PCBs and pesticides in their fat tissue. <b>Porpoises</b> have a coastal distribution that potentially brings them close to sources of pollution. <b>Porpoises</b> may not experience any toxic effects until they draw on their fat reserves, {{such as in}} periods of food shortage, migration or reproduction.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of other species of porpoises. A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids. A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing {{is known about}} the diet of the spectacled <b>porpoise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{as opposed}} to their dolphin counterparts, {{generally}} do not thrive in captivity, and {{are very difficult to}} maintain. The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three finless porpoises. In the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada), there is a harbour <b>porpoise</b> on display, Daisy, who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The finless <b>porpoise</b> {{is known}} to also follow {{seasonal}} migrations. It is known that populations {{in the mouth of}} the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour <b>porpoises</b> suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic <b>porpoises</b> are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's <b>porpoises</b> reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|R
40|$|March 5 - 6, 2009, Bangkok, ThailandThis {{study showed}} the {{preliminary}} results of two-dimensional localization of echolocating finless <b>porpoises</b> by two stereo acoustic data loggers, A-tags. We conducted passive acoustic observation from an anchored fishing boat using two separated A-tags. Five echolocating <b>porpoises</b> were tracked during a 1. 5 -hour monitoring. The estimated swimming speeds of the <b>porpoises</b> matched the previous study, which were measured using bio-logging technique. At least one track of <b>porpoises,</b> however, {{was considered to}} contain false localization because the swimming speed was faster than the maximum speed of <b>porpoises.</b> Stationary acoustic monitoring has a limited observation range compared to a moving platform. But it has advantages {{to be able to}} easily measure the swimming speed and observe under water movement of underwater <b>porpoises.</b> In the future work, it is necessary to observe wild behavior of this species and evaluate the accuracy of the localization method by using larger sample size...|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 the {{aquarium}} {{opened a new}} rehabilitation center for harbor <b>porpoises</b> in Duxbury, Massachusetts. The facility includes a [...] rehabilitation tank that can house three <b>porpoises</b> at a time.|$|R
5|$|The <b>porpoise</b> ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The <b>porpoise</b> ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge {{on top of the}} porpoises head is caused by the melon.|$|E
5|$|The <b>porpoise</b> eye is {{relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} <b>porpoise</b> are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|In {{another story}} further {{upstream}} the Yangtze, the baiji {{was the daughter}} of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin, and the general a <b>porpoise.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, the {{distribution}} of harbour <b>porpoises</b> Phocoena phocoena has undergone a southward shift in the North Sea, {{which has led to}} {{an increase in the number}} of stranded <b>porpoises</b> in its southern part. Since the changes in distribution and relative abundance of <b>porpoises</b> may be linked to the changes in prey availability, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether any changes in the feeding habits of harbour <b>porpoises</b> along the North Sea occurred in the past decade. The diet of harbour <b>porpoises</b> stranded along the southern North Sea (northern France and Belgian coast) was assessed through 3 complementary methods: stomach content analysis, stable isotopes (carbon and nitrogen) analysis determined from muscle samples, and fatty acids analysis determined from blubber samples. Fatty acid patterns and stable isotope values from 52 <b>porpoises</b> were compared to 14 potential prey species collected from the southern North Sea. Our results showed that the diet of <b>porpoises</b> along the southern North Sea comprises fish species that are among the most abundant and widely distributed in the area, except for the sardine Sardina pilchardus that appeared to be a new potential prey. Moreover, our results suggested that the decline in sandeel (Ammodytidae) in the northern parts of the North Sea along with the re-invasion of the southern North Sea by sardine species might affect {{the distribution of}} harbour <b>porpoises...</b>|$|R
5|$|Unlike most animals, <b>porpoises</b> are {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but <b>porpoises</b> cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, <b>porpoises</b> in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|R
40|$|Information on {{the life}} {{functions}} and ecology of harbour <b>porpoises</b> is still scarce. Only {{a limited number of}} animals are available for research in controlled situations. Satellite tracking allows to gather information on individual movements of harbour <b>porpoises,</b> hence providing direct insight into the individual lifestyle of a free-ranging animal. Moreover, satellite telemetry is a powerful method for directly identifying the cause-effect relationship between anthropogenic activities and the animal’s behaviour. Harbour <b>porpoises</b> have been tagged with satellite transmitters already for almost two decades. This document is intends to provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant aspects of telemetry studies in harbour <b>porpoises</b> in Dutch waters and also give an overview of the latest technical developments in this field. Based on this information the strategy for further development and use of telemetry in harbour <b>porpoises</b> can be shaped...|$|R
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a <b>porpoise.</b> To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{cetacean}} live in rivers and lakes, but are {{more closely related}} to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless <b>porpoise</b> Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in {{noise in the}} oceans. Marine mammals that make use of biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This {{may lead to a}} bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked, so-called decompression sickness. This effect, of course, only occurs in porpoises that dive to great depths, such as Dall's <b>porpoise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Harbour <b>porpoises</b> {{are killed}} with shotguns, and numbers taken must be {{reported}} to the relevant district sheriff. According to statistics, the number of harbour <b>porpoises</b> shot is very low — from 0 to 10 animals each year.|$|R
40|$|Harbour <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina), two {{representative}} top-predator {{species for}} the North Sea ecosystem, are good indicators of coastal pollution. Concentrations of sum PCBs were 1 - 2 {{orders of magnitude}} higher than concentrations of sum PBDEs and covered a large range of concentrations (up to 210 μg/g lw and 5. 9 μg/g lw for sum PCBs and sum PBDEs). A higher contribution of lower chlorinated congeners and non-persistent congeners, such as CB 52, CB 95, CB 101, CB 118 and CB 149 indicated that harbour <b>porpoises</b> are unable to metabolize these congeners. Similar to PCBs, a higher contribution of other PBDE congeners than BDE 47 was observed in harbour <b>porpoises,</b> suggesting that <b>porpoises</b> have more difficulties to metabolize these congeners. This is also supported by the higher concentrations of sum PBDEs in <b>porpoises.</b> In contrast, harbour seals show a higher ability to metabolize (non-persistent) PCBs...|$|R
50|$|Overfishing {{may reduce}} {{preferred}} prey availability for <b>porpoises.</b> Overfishing {{resulting in the}} collapse of herring in the North Sea caused <b>porpoises</b> to hunt for other prey species. Reduction of prey may result from climate change, or overfishing, or both.|$|R
5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a <b>porpoise</b> in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a <b>porpoise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour <b>porpoise</b> and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
40|$|Harbour <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena) {{stranding}} {{in large}} numbers around the southern North Sea with fatal, sharp-edged mutilations have spurred controversy among scientists, the fishing industry and conservationists, whose views about the likely cause differ. The recent detection of grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) DNA in bite marks on three mutilated harbour <b>porpoises,</b> as well as direct observations of grey seal attacks on <b>porpoises,</b> have identified this seal species as a probable cause. Bite mark characteristics were assessed in a retrospective analysis of photographs of dead harbour <b>porpoises</b> that stranded between 2003 and 2013 (n = 1081) on the Dutch coastline. There were 271 animals that were sufficiently fresh to allow macroscopic assessment of grey seal-associated wounds with certainty. In 25 % of these, bite and claw marks were identified that {{were consistent with the}} marks found on animals that had tested positive for grey seal DNA. Affected animals were mostly healthy juveniles that had a thick blubber layer and had recently fed. We conclude {{that the majority of the}} mutilated harbour <b>porpoises</b> were victims of grey seal attacks and that predation by this species is one of the main causes of death in harbour <b>porpoises</b> in The Netherlands. We provide a decision tree that will help in the identification of future cases of grey seal predation on <b>porpoises...</b>|$|R
50|$|SOS Dolfijn is an {{independent}} foundation based in the Dolfinarium dedicated to the saving of stranded <b>porpoises,</b> dolphins and whales. <b>Porpoises</b> (85%) {{are the most common}} patients at the recovery facilities in the Dolfinarium. The goal of saved animals is to let them recover and then release them into the wild again. If <b>porpoises</b> are deemed unfit to be released into the wild, they are sent to the Bruinvisbaai or to facilities at Ecomare on the island of Texel.|$|R
2500|$|When swimming, several {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, <b>porpoises</b> and pinnipeds, {{frequently}} leap {{above the water}} surface whilst maintaining horizontal locomotion. [...] This is done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save dolphins and <b>porpoises</b> energy as there is less friction while in the air. This type of travel is known as [...] "porpoising". Other reasons for dolphins and <b>porpoises</b> performing <b>porpoising</b> include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites. [...] In pinnipeds, two types of <b>porpoising</b> have been identified. [...] "High porpoising" [...] is most often near (within 100 metres) the shore and is often followed by minor course changes; this may help seals get their bearings on beaching or rafting sites. [...] "Low porpoising" [...] is typically observed relatively far (more than 100 metres) from shore and often aborted in favour of anti-predator movements; {{this may be a}} way for seals to maximize sub-surface vigilance and thereby reduce their vulnerability to sharks ...|$|R
