5000|$|In many {{competitions}} (such {{as regular}} club competition, or in pool games in FIH international tournaments {{such as the}} Olympics or the World Cup), a tied result stands and the overall competition standings are adjusted accordingly. Since March 2013, when tie breaking is required, the official FIH Tournament Regulations mandate to no longer have extra time and go directly into a penalty shoot-out when a classification match ends in a tie. However, many associations follow the <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> consisting of two periods of 7.5 minutes of [...] "golden goal" [...] extra time during which the game ends {{as soon as one}} team scores.|$|E

The Head of the Administration is appointed by the President following consultations with the District Assembly. Previously, the Head was appointed from among the District Assembly members, but without consultations, but in practice the President would often appoint an acting Head from without who was subsequently elected to the Assembly. The current procedure was adopted by the People's Assembly of Abkhazia on 29 January 2016, over competing proposals to elect the Head directly by the District's population or by Assembly members, and after voting almost unanimously not to change the <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> on 30 July 2015.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{judicial}} {{authority of the}} year 1310 for the proposition that dower was favoured by law, and at a less remote period it {{was said to be}} with life and liberty one of three things which [...] "the law favoreth". In England in the late 18th century, it became common for men to hold land with a trust that prevented their wives' acquiring dower. Accordingly, the English statute, the Fines and Recoveries Act 1833 was passed to impair the inviolability of dower by empowering husbands to cut off by deed or will their wives from dower. Wives married before the Act still had (in certain cases) to acknowledge the deed before a commissioner to bar their right to dower in property which their husband sold. This was simpler than the <b>previous</b> <b>procedure,</b> which had required a fine to be levied in the Court of Common Pleas, a fictitious proceeding, by which she and her husband formally remitted their right to the property to the purchaser.|$|E

40|$|Control and {{prediction}} of wind erosion require {{knowledge of the}} effectiveness of surface vegetative cover. The effectiveness is usually referenced to as small-grain equivalent. The procedure used to convert mixed vegetation to small-grain equivalent was found faulty. Im-proper weighting of regression coefficients caused the conversion pro-cedure to predict that adding crop residue decreased small-grain equivalent. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to improve the conversion of mixed vegetation to a small-grain equivalent. The new expression derived for this purpose gave a logical conversion where the <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> failed. It did not predict a decreasing small-grain equivalent with increased soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr. ] residue in the 0 to 300 kg/ha range as did the former method.
