40|$|We {{present an}} {{asymptotic}} {{analysis of the}} thickness of the liquid film that coats a smooth solid substrate when it is withdrawn from a bath of non-Newtonian fluid, and compare our results with experimental measurements. The film thickness is, to a good approximation, uniform above the point where the film is withdrawn from the fluid bath, and depends on the rotation rate, the fluid properties and the substrate geometry. Theoretical predictions of the film thickness for a number of different sub-strate geometries (an inclined <b>plate,</b> <b>roller</b> and fiber) are presented, and are compared with experimental measurements in a single roller geometry. Results are obtained for two different limits of the Criminale-Ericksen-Filbey constitutive equation in which the fluid rheology is either weakly elastic and dominated by shear-thinning, or strongly elastic and dominated by elastic stresses. A lubrication analysis yields a thin-film equation which characterizes the film thickness as a function of spatial position. The rheological properties of the test fluids are measured independently using steady and oscillatory shearing deformations. The viscometric parameters are then used, in conjunction with the governing thin-film equation, which is solved using matched asymptotics, to give a quantitative prediction of {{the thickness of the}} fluid coating. The onset of an instability which causes the film thickness to vary with axial position along the roller is also observed experimentally. 1...|$|E

For this purpose I have analyzed the chronological decay of roof structure elements and made a parametrical study of six static roof structure models. The basic model has four frames with a trapeze shaped triple roof static system Mechanical parameters for the calculation of spruce elements (compressive strength, bending strength, elastical mosulus, shear modulus) for statical analysis were gained by laboratorical testing of spruce samples. I have researched how gradual decay of the roof structure have influenced the deformation of the underlying stone walls. The northern walls are the most damaged with the widest cracks and are almost completely seperated from the rest of the house. Vertical reactions and displacemants of the roof wall <b>plate</b> <b>roller</b> supports were therefore the main focus of this analysis. Dead load, live load, snow load and wind load are assesed using Eurocode standards. Static analysis is based on the method of limit state load (MSN). Analysis shows that the main reason for the north wall deformation is the influence of deformed roof structure and ground setlement. The house is without a foundation and its walls sit directly on rocks that are laying in in soft gravel soil. The house was without gutters and drainage for a long time. Rainwater was therefore able to wash away the soft subgrade causing additional subgrade subsidence. The roof wall plate had to be supported at some point in time, which means that the north wall was without vertical load and consequently constant compressive stress, that had a positive effect on it. As a result the northern wall was able to deform even more. Point supported roof wall plate caused greatly increased horizontal reactions in NE and NW corner of the north wall, that have triggered the beginning of the formation of cracks...|$|E

40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} dry granulation process for producing free flowing granules {{in order to}} increase the bulk density and uniformity of pharmaceutical formulations. It is a complicated process due to the diversity of powder blends and processing parameters involved. The properties of the produced ribbon are dominated by a number of factors, such as the powder properties. friction, roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed, which consequently determine the properties of the granules (size distribution, density and flow behaviour). It is hence important to understand the influence of these factors on the ribbon properties. in this study, an instrumented roller press developed at the University of Birmingham is used to investigate the effect of lubrication on the density distribution of the ribbons. Three different cases are considered: (1) no lubrication, (2) lubricated press. in which the side cheek <b>plates</b> of the <b>roller</b> press are lubricated, and (3) lubricated powder, for which a lubricant is mixed into the powder. In addition, how the powders are fed into the entry region of the roller press and its influence on ribbon properties are also investigated. It is found that the method of feeding the powder into the roller press plays a crucial role in determining the homogeneity of the ribbon density. For the roller press used in this Study, a drag angle (i. e., the angle formed when the powder is dragged into the roller press) is introduced to characterise the powder flow pattern in the feeding hopper. It is shown that a sharper drag angle results in a more heterogeneous ribbon. In addition, the average ribbon density depends upon the peak pressure and nip angle. The higher the peak pressure and nip angle are, the higher the average ribbon density is. Furthermore, the densification behaviour of the powder during roller compaction is compared to that during die compaction. It has been shown that the densification behaviour during these two processes is similar if the ribbons and the tablets have the same thickness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a geometry-based {{optimization}} method for machine components {{by means of}} the finite element analysis (FEA) is built up which is capable of satisfying geometrical constraints in the context of spline representation. FE-based optimization methods are already supported by the consideration of some selected geometric criteria. In contrast to FE-based approaches a new mesh is generated for each structural variation of a geometry-based optimization. This guarantees a high mesh quality, even if there are big changes in the CAD-model. Moreover, the results of a geometry-based optimization are directly applicable in the engineering design process by a parameterized CAD-model. However, an approach for the geometry-based optimization is still missing which is able to return a directly applicable CAD-model of a geometric feasible optimum back to the engineering design process. The basis of a geometry-based shape optimization is the mathematical description of the component boundaries. As a suitable mathematical representation Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) have been chosen which are industrial standard in technical applications and capable of representing conic sections and other free-form geometries, such as B-splines and Bézier curves exactly. By the consideration of geometric constraints geometric instabilities of the CAD-system and intersections of the available installation space are excluded. Furthermore, in evolution strategies (ES) the established algorithms offer a rapid and robust generation of NURBS which fulfill the defined mass and geometrically describable manufacturing constraints. For gradient based approaches a linearization method was investigated which permits a consideration of geometric constraints on a finite number of points located on the NURBS curve. In contrast to gradient based methods, an ES facilitates a search for the global extremum, even for multimodal optimization tasks. Besides a self-adaptive adjustment of the strategy parameters to the conditions of the current optimization cycle, different modifications and extensions of the ES were investigated which led to an improvement of the convergence speed and search ability. Moreover, metamodels were developed which, through an approximation of already calculated solutions, offer a prediction of the structural properties. Hereby, a metamodel-assisted evolution strategy (MAES) was built up using the metamodels for a local optimization of solutions recommended by the ES. A sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as gradient based approach for the local optimization was chosen. Only in conjunction with the research of new heuristics for the control of the MAES and an adaption of the active set method was a serious acceleration of the convergence speed achieved. By the implementation of the established optimization system a completely automated structural optimization program for machine components was realized. The integration of parameter optimization, parallel to shape optimization with free-form geometries, permits an optimization of dimensions, such as wall thicknesses, which have a significant influence on structural behavior. Thereby, an integration of discrete parameters, such as the number of ribs, enabled a limited change of the topology of a machine component. The combination of the different optimizations methods necessitated the formulation of parameter dependencies for the mathematical representation of geometric relations to avoid problematical intersections in the CAD-model and to include physical interrelationships. Since only geometric permissible NURBS are transferred to the CAE-system, only geometric feasible structural variants are evaluated by the time-consuming FE-analysis. By means of practical examples taken from power train and machine tool engineering, the mechanical properties of the components were improved significantly without violating of the defined geometric constraints. Besides a performance analysis of the developed MAES, the impact of different spline representations and number of interpolation points was investigated in the example of the inner <b>plates</b> of a <b>roller</b> chain. As a second example taken from power train engineering the stress in the tooth root of a pinion was reduced by more than 5 % with approximately 30 % lower material usage. Furthermore, two typical components derived from machine tool engineering were optimized. The increase of the first eigenfrequency of a boring bar by more than 14 % demonstrates that the computational effort for the generation of geometrically feasible solutions is reduced significantly by the established methods. Finally, a cross beam of a portal milling machine was optimized by varying its dimensions, shapes and topology. Thereby, the initial mass was reduced up to 18. 5 % while retaining the structural stiffness. Through the MAES, the number of FE-calculations was reduced to less than 94 % for a comparable solution of the developed ES...|$|R
