40|$|A {{method of}} {{manufacturing}} polymer-infiltrated ceramics (<b>PICs)</b> is to pre-infiltrate a porous ceramic with a liquid monomer and subsequently polymerize the organic component inside the ceramic structure. The volume reduction during polymerization leads {{to the formation of}} pores (defects), which has a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of <b>PICs.</b> To avoid the generation of defects, a new polymerization method that uses pressure during polymerization was developed. To investigate the influences of pressure and heating rate on strength and microstructure, both parameters were varied. The influences of both parameters on the strength of <b>PICs</b> were studied using a biaxial test. The influence on the microstructure was investigated through microscopy. Fracture toughness and R-curve behavior of the manufactured <b>PICs</b> were determined with the SEVNB method. The process parameters have a strong influence on strength and microstructure of <b>PICs.</b> Defect-free <b>PICs</b> with improved strength could be manufactured using elevated pressure during polymerization. As expected, a distinct R-curve behavior and enhanced fracture toughness relative to composites manufactured using conventional methods was found. The developed manufacturing method leads to defectless <b>PICs</b> with increased mechanic behaviors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{present data}} {{indicating}} that a host protein {{is important for}} function of HIV- 1 preintegration complexes (<b>PICs)</b> in vitro. <b>PICs</b> partially purified from infected cells were subjected to gel filtration in 600 mM KCl, which removed a factor required for integration without fully disrupting <b>PICs.</b> Addition of an extract from uninfected cells restored activity. Fractionation of the complementing activity yielded HMG I(Y), a nonhistone chromosomal protein important for transcriptional control and chromosomal architecture. Complementing activity could be isolated from <b>PICs,</b> and activity could be depleted from such fractions with an antibody against HMG I(Y). Recombinant HMG I(Y) also complemented salt-stripped complexes.

Armand crashed into the turn one barriers on the same lap, resulting in the safety car's second appearance. Most drivers elected to make their mandatory pit stops during the safety car period. Marciello remained ahead of Matsushita and maintained the lead when the safety car drove into the pit lane shortly afterwards. Marciello fended off a challenge by Matsushita to retain first position. <b>Pic</b> squeezed Markelov towards the turn five barrier on the ninth lap and both drivers damaged their cars, causing Markelov to retire. <b>Pic</b> drove on for a short distance before retiring because of the damage resulting from the collision. The safety car was sent onto the track for the third time. Marciello maintained his lead at the restart, while Matsushita ran wide at the first turn, allowing Jeffri to pass him for second place. Matsushita dropped to fifth position. Rowland passed both drivers by taking the inside line. Marciello {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} nexus between {{economic}} growth and oil price in small Pacific Island countries (<b>PICs).</b> Except Papua New Guinea, none of the 14 <b>PICs</b> has fossil any fuel resources. Consequently, the other 13 <b>PICs</b> are totally dependent on oil imports for their economic activities. Since <b>PICs</b> have limited foreign exchange earning capacities, as {{they have a very}} narrow range of exports and are highly dependent on foreign aid, high oil prices in recent months have seriously tested their economic resilience. This paper applies the ARDL bounds testing methodology to four selected <b>PICs,</b> Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, which have consistent and reliable time series of data, with a view {{to assess the impact of}} oil price on economic growth. The findings are that oil price, gross domestic product and international reserve are cointegrated in all the four <b>PICs.</b> Further, both in the long and short runs, we observe that there is a uni-directional relationship as causality linkage runs only from oil price and international reserves to economic growth.

5|$|Stanaway drifted at La Rascasse corner {{after his}} car's {{rear-end}} gave way and narrowly avoided hitting the {{wall on the}} race's final lap. He regained control {{of his car and}} crossed the start/finish line to win the race. Marciello finished second, two seconds behind the race winner and Sirotkin took third. Canamasas secured fourth, and Leal was fifth. <b>Pic,</b> Rossi and Vandoorne filled the remainder of the points-scoring positions and were all separated by 2.5 seconds. Yelloly and Gasly rounded out the top ten. Lynn, de Jong, ViÈ™oiu, Markelov and Berthon followed in the next five places, while Binder, NegrÃ£o, StÃ¶ckinger, Matushita, SÃ¸rensen and Nato were the last of the classified finishers. The victory was Stanaway's first in the GP2 Series and the maiden triumph for his team Status Grand Prix following its take over of the former Caterham Racing entry.

Piquet benefited from his late stop by moving ahead into eighth after everyone had pitted and having more power left to use {{towards the end of the}} race. Heidfeld ran into additional trouble during the second half of the race, losing two positions during the final laps to both LoÃ¯c Duval (Dragon Racing) and the fast running Piquet, who managed to finish fifth from thirteenth on the grid, even closing on Duval on the final lap. Meanwhile, di Grassi won comfortably from d'Ambrosio, the gap being more than twelve seconds.|$|E
5|$|The two drivers {{pulled away}} {{from the rest of the}} field. Giovinazzi was unable to use his DRS because it was {{affected}} by a malfunction. He made attempts to overtake Gasly in the closing stages of the event. On the final lap, Giovinazzi drove on the outside line on the start/finish straight and moved to the inside heading into the first corner. Gasly ran wide by missing his braking point while defending, which allowed Giovinazzi to take over the lead. He maintained the position for the remainder of the race to clinch his second consecutive victory. Gasly finished second, with Sirotkin in third. King took fourth, ahead of Markelov in fifth.

40|$|Purpose â€“ The main aim of {{this paper}} is to empirically test a model that has central {{government}} health expenditure and advancement in medical technology as two separate determinants of economic growth rates in the Pacific island countries (<b>PICs).</b> Design/methodology/approach â€“ The data used in this research have been collected from WHO and ADB database for the periods between 2000 and 2012. The model used to test the main research question is based on the variant Cobb-Douglas production function with constant returns to scale. Findings â€“ This research found that health expenditure has a significant impact on the economic growth rate of the <b>PICs.</b> This study also found that the contemporary level of usage of advanced medical technology in the <b>PICs</b> is relatively low as compared to the total population of the country. If the <b>PICs</b> need to achieve high levels of economic growth rates, governments of the <b>PICs</b> need to improve its expenditure in the health sector. Good and qualified doctors need to be hired and the medical education has to be made more competitive. Improvement in the health services in the <b>PICs</b> will reduce mortality, improve per capita health and improve the national economic welfare of Oceania region. Research limitations/implications â€“ Data availability was the major limitation in this research. Data were available for only seven <b>PICs.</b> Practical implications â€“ This research has implications for the academics, practitioners, and policy makers. Social implications â€“ The research findings from this research have implications for the society as it shows that health expenditure is positively related to economic growth rates. Originality/value â€“ In the context of the <b>PICs,</b> no studies have been conducted that have analysed the relationship between health expenditure, medical technology advancement and the economic growth rate of the <b>PICs.</b> This research seeks to build and extend the existing state of research on augmented Cobb-Douglas production function and health economics in the <b>PICs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Small {{countries}}, such as Pacific islands countries (<b>PICs),</b> {{vary considerably}} {{in the extent}} and in {{the ways in which}} they are linked to the global economy. Particularly within <b>PICs,</b> households and families, and different social groups also differ in their dependence on markets, cash and foreign exchange incomes for their economic welfare. A dualistic economic model is inadequate as a means for specifying the distribution of this dependence. There is a need to analyse the distribution of such dependencies more precisely using, amongst other things, relative frequency distributions. It is hypothesised that increased integration of <b>PICs</b> into the global economy combined with global economic reforms can be expected to result in reduced private investment in many <b>PICs,</b> mainly because of outflows of investible funds from <b>PICs</b> to take advantage of higher economic returns elsewhere. In turn, this is liable to reduce real wages and employment in these countries. At the same time, there are likely to be increasing pressures for emigration from <b>PICs</b> as income differentials between them and higher income countries, such as Pacific Rim countries, grow, and political demands to allow freer international movements of labour are likely to magnify as <b>PICs</b> demand full commitment to the globalisation concept and as various employer groups in higher income countries seek to cope with growing international economic competition brought about by increasing globalisation by importing labour. The possible implications of these trends for the economic development/future of <b>PICs</b> are considered.
