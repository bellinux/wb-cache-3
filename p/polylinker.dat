40|$|We have {{constructed}} and functionally tested a cassette-vector-system for the transcription and translation of open reading frames (ORFs) in cells of higher eukaryotes. The vectors {{are derived from}} the plasmid pBR 322 and can be selected and amplified in Escherichia coli. Alternative eukaryotic promoters can be inserted between the restriction sites SphI and KpnI, translation initiation motifs between KpnI and BglII, linkers for the adjustment of the translation reading frame and the insertion of genes or gene segments between BglII and HindIII, followed by a HindIII-EcoRI segment with splicing and polyadenylation signals derived from SV 40. A prototype vector system, pORFEX 11, 12 and 13, contains the strong cytomegalovirus immediately early promoter and a 10 -bp motif of the SV 40 T-antigen translation start. <b>Polylinkers</b> derived from pUC 18 permit the insertion of ATG-less ORFs downstream from the ATG of the vector. Either of the three alternative <b>polylinkers</b> adjusts the appropriate translation frame. A similar construct contains the regulatable promoter of the Drosophila heat shock gene 70. We inserted genes or gene segments, that code for the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, the bacterial gene conferring resistance against hygromycin, and the ORF E 7 of the human papillomavirus type 18 into these vectors. After transfection of mouse L fibroblasts, all proteins and functions were expressed {{in accordance with the}} prediction.

40|$|We {{describe}} new vectors {{suitable for}} P-element mediated germ line transformation of Drosophila melanogaster using passenger genes whose expression does {{not result in}} a readily detectable phenotypic change of the transformed flies. The P-element vectors contain the white gene fused to the heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) gene promoter. Expression of the white gene rescues the white phenotype of recipient flies partly or completely even without heat treatment. Transformed descendents of most founder animals (GO) fall into two classes which are distinguishable by their orange and red eye colours. The different levels of white expression are presumably due to position effects associated with different chromosomal sites of insertion. Doubling of the gene dose in orange eyed fly stocks results in an easily visible darkening of the eye colour. Consequently, the generation of homozygous transformants is easily possible by simple inbreeding due to the phenotypic distinction of homo- and heterozygous transformants. Cloning into these P-element vectors is facilitated {{by the presence of}} <b>polylinkers</b> with 8 and 12 unique restriction sites...|$|R
50|$|A {{multiple}} {{cloning site}} (MCS), also called a <b>polylinker,</b> is a short segment of DNA which contains many (up to ~20) restriction sites - a standard feature of engineered plasmids. Restriction sites within an MCS are typically unique, occurring only once within a given plasmid. MCSs are commonly used during procedures involving molecular cloning or subcloning. Extremely useful in biotechnology, bioengineering, and molecular genetics, MCSs let a molecular biologist insert a piece of DNA or several pieces of DNA into {{the region of the}} MCS. This can be used to create transgenic organisms, also known as genetically modified organisms (GMOs).|$|E
50|$|All cloning vectors have {{features}} that allow a gene to be conveniently {{inserted into the}} vector or removed from it. This may be a multiple cloning site (MCS) or <b>polylinker,</b> which contains many unique restriction sites. The restriction sites in the MCS are first cleaved by restriction enzymes, then a PCR-amplified target gene also digested with the same enzymes is ligated into the vectors using DNA ligase. The target DNA sequence can be inserted into the vector in a specific direction if so desired. The restriction sites may be further used for sub-cloning into another vector if necessary.|$|E
50|$|They {{are used}} to assist {{insertion}} of genes into plasmid vectors during gene cloning and protein production experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short <b>polylinker</b> sequence (called the multiple cloning site, or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since {{it is necessary to}} avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a DNA ligase.|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been directed toward the development of multipurpose lambda vectors for cloning ever since the potential of using coliphage lambda as a cloning vector was recognized in the late 1970 s. An understanding of the intrinsic molecular organization and of the genetic events which determine lysis or lysogeny in lambda has allowed investigators to modify it to suit the specific requirements of gene manipulations. Unwanted restriction sites have been altered and arranged together into suitable <b>polylinkers.</b> The development of a highly efficient in vitro packaging system has permitted the introduction of chimeric molecules into hosts. Biological containment of recombinants has been achieved by introducing amber mutations into the lambda genome and by using specific amber suppressor hosts. Taking advantage of the limited range of genome size (78 to 105 % of the wild-type size) for its efficient packaging, an array of vectors has been devised to accommodate inserts of a wide size range, the limit being 24 kbp in Charon 40. The central dispensable fragment of the lambda genome can {{be replaced by a}} fragment of heterologous DNA, leading to the construction of replacement vectors such as Charon and EMBL. Alternatively, small DNA fragments can be inserted without removing the dispensable region of the lambda genome, as in lambda gt 10 and lambda gt 11 vectors. In addition, the introduction of many other desirable properties, such as NotI and SfiI sites in <b>polylinkers</b> (e. g., lambda gt 22), T 7 and T 3 promoters for the in vitro transcription (e. g., lambda DASH), and the mechanism for in vivo excision of the intact insert (e. g., lambda ZAP), has facilitated both cloning and subsequent analysis. In most cases, the recombinants can be differentiated from the parental phages by their altered phenotype. Libraries constructed in lambda vectors are screened easily with antibody or nucleic acid probes since several thousand clones can be plated on a single petri dish. Besides the availability {{of a wide range of}} lambda vectors, many related techniques such as rapid isolation of lambda DNA, a high efficiency of commercially available in vitro packaging extracts, and in vitro amplification of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction have collectively contributed to lambda's becoming one of the most powerful and popular tools for molecular cloning...|$|R
40|$|The N-terminal SH 2 {{domain of}} protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase 1 C (SHN 1 C) was expressed in E. coli as a fusion to maltose-binding protein (MBP) using two different <b>polylinkers,</b> one comprising {{of the traditional}} recognition motif for FXa (IEGR) {{and the other for}} thrombin (FNPR), {{as part of an effort}} to resolve its three-dimensional solution structure by NMR spectroscopy. The construct encoding the thrombin cleavage site provided a fusion protein that exhibited superior proteolytic cleavage efficiency. This allowed the production of sufficient SHN 1 C to allow us to examine its behavior in aqueous solutions. Purification of SHN 1 C from MBP and other cleavage products could only be accomplished by allowing the protein of interest to precipitate at pH 7. 0. Likewise, SHN 1 C is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents, particularly between pH 5. 5 - 7. 0, thus making it impossible to perform proton resonance assignments. Binding studies between the SHN 1 C-containing fusion protein and two phosphotyrosyl-containing peptides (derived from the C-terminal end of PTP 1 C), pNPP, and pTyr were performed using NMR methods. No evidence for binding was found for each case. It is therefore postulated that SHN 1 C may regulate the catalytic activity of PTP 1 C by interacting with specific regions of the full length enzyme via a phosphotyrosine-independent mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 103 - 126). This study {{relates to}} the development of an alkaliphilic, thermo-tolerant, Gram-positive isolate, Bacillus halodurans Alk 36, for the over-production and surface display of chimeric gene products. This bacterium harbors the endogenous genetic background to over-produce flagellin protein continuously. In order to harness this ability, key genetic tools, such as gene targeted inactivation, were developed for this strain. The hag gene which codes for flagellin was inactivated on the chromosome giving rise to the B. halodurans BhFC 0 l mutant. This strain was non-motile as determined on motility plates and confirmed by PCR analysis. Motility was, however, restored through complementation of the expression vector carrying a functional hag gene. <b>Polylinkers</b> were inserted as in-frame, chimeric, flagellin sandwich fusions in order to identify the permissive insertion sites corresponding to the variable regions of the flagellin protein. Flagellin expression and motility were evaluated for these constructs. Two sites were identified for possible peptide insertion in the flagellin gene, one of which produced functional flagella and was able to restore the motility phenotype to a non-motile mutant. Peptides encoding a poly-histidine peptide and the HIV-l clade C gpl 20 epitope were respectively incorporated into both of the permissive sites as in-frame fusions and found to be successfully displayed on the cell surface. The poly-His peptide was shown to be functional through metal binding and affinity purification studies. The display of the HIV- 1 subtype C gp 120 V 3 loop was also shown to be functional through immunological studies using peptide specific antibodies. Surface display of the poly-His and HIV-l epitope was shown to have improved metal binding and enhanced expression levels of the chimeric flagellin when the peptides were insel 1 ed at amino acid position 180 (pSECNC 6). This specific site is the only insertion point that falls within the re-defined variable domain of the FliC protein from B. halodurans Alk 36...|$|R
50|$|Plasmids are the most-commonly used {{bacterial}} cloning vectors. These cloning vectors {{contain a}} site that allows DNA fragments to be inserted, for example a multiple cloning site or <b>polylinker</b> which has several commonly used restriction sites to which DNA fragments may be ligated. After the gene of interest is inserted, the plasmids are introduced into bacteria by a process called transformation. These plasmids contain a selectable marker, usually an antibiotic resistance gene, which confer on the bacteria an ability to survive and proliferate in a selective growth medium containing the particular antibiotics. The cells after transformation {{are exposed to the}} selective media, and only cells containing the plasmid may survive. In this way, the antibiotics act as a filter to select only the bacteria containing the plasmid DNA. The vector may also contain other marker genes or reporter genes to facilitate selection of plasmid with cloned insert. Bacteria containing the plasmid can then be grown in large amounts, harvested, and the plasmid of interest may then be isolated using various methods of plasmid preparation.|$|E

40|$|The FhuA {{receptor}} in {{the outer}} membrane of Escherichia coli K- 12 {{is involved in the}} uptake of ferrichrome, colicin M, and the antibiotic albomycin and in infection by phages T 1, T 5, and phi 80. Fragments of up to 16 amino acid residues were inserted into FhuA and used to determine FhuA active sites and FhuA topology {{in the outer}} membrane. For this purpose antibiotic resistance boxes flanked by symmetric <b>polylinkers</b> were inserted into fhuA and subsequently partially deleted. Additional in-frame insertions were generated by mutagenesis with transposon Tn 1725. The 68 FhuA protein derivatives examined contained segments of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 22 additional amino acid residues at 34 different locations from residues 5 to 646 of the mature protein. Most of the FhuA derivatives were found in normal amounts in the outer membrane fraction. Half of these were fully active toward all ligands, demonstrating proper insertion into the outer membrane. Seven of the 12 - and 16 -amino-acid-insertion derivatives (at residues 378, 402, 405, 415, 417, 456, and 646) were active toward all of the ligands and could be cleaved by subtilisin in whole cells, suggesting a surface location of the extra loops at sites which did not affect FhuA function. Two mutants were sensitive to subtilisin (insertions at residues 511 and 321) but displayed a strongly reduced sensitivity to colicin M and to phages phi 80 and T 1. Four of the insertion derivatives (at residues 162, 223, 369, and 531) were cleaved only in spheroplasts and probably form loops at the periplasmic side of the outer membrane. The number and size of the proteolytic fragments indicate cleavage at or close to the sites of insertion, which has been proved for five insertions by amino acid sequencing. Most mutants with functional defects were affected in their sensitivity to all ligands, yet frequently to different degrees. Some mutants showed a specifically altered sensitivity to a few ligands; for example, mutant 511 - 04 was partially resistant only to colicin M, mutant 241 - 04 was reduced in ferrichrome and albomycin uptake and showed a reduced colicin M sensitivity, and mutant 321 - 04 was fully resistant to phage T 1 and partially resistant to phage phi 80. The altered residues define preferential binding sites for these ligands. Insertions of 4 to 16 residues at positions 69, 70, 402, 530, 564, and 572 resulted in strongly reduced amounts of FhuA in the outer membrane fraction, varying in function from fully active to inactive. These results provide the basis for a model of FhuA organization in the outer membrane...|$|R

Hpleu 2 gene was used as marker and to target the integration of plasmids into the corresponding Hansunela polymorpha genome locus. LacZ and Hpleu 2 genes insert into <b>polylinker</b> site of pBluscript II ks. Expression was obtained with regulatable MOX promoter. Utility of the vector was illustrated by expressing the bacterial lacZ gene. The vector constructed are potentially useful {{for the construction of}} efficient producers of heterologous proteins in Hansunela polymorpha...|$|E
40|$|Two {{bacterial}} {{antibiotic resistance}} genes, one coding for the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT I) from Tn 903, {{and the other}} coding for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from Tn 9 were used as plant selectable markers. Both genes were introduced into the Nicotiana tabacum genome in a new plant expression vector, using the direct gene transfer method. The vector pDH 51, used in these experiments contains a plant expression unit as a movable cassette, consisting of the strong cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S RNA promoter and transcription terminator separated by a <b>polylinker</b> containing several unique restriction sites...|$|E
40|$|The size {{of repair}} patch made by E. coli DNA {{polymerase}} I (Poll) following {{the removal of}} a thymine-psoralen monoadduct by E. coli (A) BC excinuclease was determined by using an M 13 mp 19 DNA with a single psoralen monoadduct at the <b>polylinker</b> region. Incubation of this substrate with (A) BC excinuclease, Poll and a combination of 3 dnTP plus 1 dNTP(alpha S) for each nucleotide, and DNA ligase resulted in a repair patch with phosphorothioate linkages. The preferential hydrolysis of phosphorothioate bonds by heating in iodoethanol revealed a patch size [...] with minimal nick translation [...] equal in length to the 12 nucleotide gap generated by this excision nuclease...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of PCR product cloning {{depends on the}} nature of the DNA polymerase employed because amplicons may have blunt-ends or 3 ′ adenosines overhangs. Therefore, for amplicon cloning, available commercial vectors are either blunt-ended or have a single 3 ′ overhanging thymidine. The aim of this work was to offer in a single vector the ability to clone both types of PCR products. For that purpose, a minimal <b>polylinker</b> was designed to include restriction sites for EcoRV and XcmI which enable direct cloning of amplicons bearing blunt-ends or A-overhangs, respectively, still offering blue/white selection. When tested, the resulting vector, pPCV, presented high efficiency cloning of both types of amplicons...|$|E
40|$|A {{circular}} plasmid {{containing a}} complete Tetrahymena thermophila rRNA gene (rDNA), with a tandem repeat of a 1. 9 -kilobase-pair segment encompassing the replication origin and the rRNA promoter, and a <b>polylinker</b> in the 3 ' nontranscribed spacer, {{was used to}} transform T. thermophila by microinjection. Most (20 / 21) stable transformants contained only recombinant linear palindromic rDNA molecules carrying rDNA sequences from both the donor plasmid and the recipient cell, as shown previously. However, in one transformant, the circular plasmid initially outreplicated the endogenous rDNA and was the major rDNA form for up to 65 generations. Stable circular replicons have not been reported previously in Tetrahymena. A single point mutation (+G) was identified in the repeated promoter of the plasmid maintained in this transformant. After recovery from the Tetrahymena transformant and recloning in Escherichia coli, the mutated circular plasmid again transformed Tetrahymena with stable maintenance of the circular rDNA plasmid. Transformants containing circular replicons were also obtained by using a similar plasmid from which the repeated promoter, but not the repeated replication origin, had been removed by BAL- 31 deletion. We therefore propose that repeated rRNA promoters are deleterious in vivo in Tetrahymena, which normally lacks them. Transformants were obtained in 2 - 5 days compared with the 7 - 14 days required for transformation with unmutated rDNA plasmids by recombination. Similar results were obtained when a 550 -base-pair segment containing the telomerase RNA gene of T. thermophila was inserted in the <b>polylinker</b> of the plasmid. We suggest that this plasmid is a useful vector system for transformation of Tetrahymena...|$|E
40|$|A 53 basepair {{deletion}} {{was constructed}} within the 3 ' untranslated region (3 ' UTR) of the yeast pyruvate kinase (PYK) gene borne upon a centromeric plasmid. Various modular assemblies of the pUC 13 <b>polylinker</b> DNA (single unit = 44 bp) {{were used to}} replace the deleted region, {{and the effects of}} these modifications upon both transcript stability and translation ascertained in yeast. The use of a differential probing stratagem, based on the hybridisation of specific oligonucleotides to either pUC 13 <b>polylinker</b> or unaltered PYK 3 ' UTR sequences, allowed for discrimination between mutant (plasmid borne) and wild-type (chromosomal) PYK transcripts. In no construct was there any significant alteration in mRNA stability, but translation of the PYK mRNA was severely curtailed by truncation of the 3 ' UTR or the presence of a strong hairpin-loop structure in the 3 ' UTR. A specific mutation in the N-terminal coding sequences, which created a premature termination codon in both a 3 ' 'tagged' PYK plasmid and a PYK/LacZ fusion gene, aborted the translation of a majority of their transcripts but left their chemical half-lives unaltered. This observation is at variance with some previously published data (Losson & Lacroute (1979) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 76, 5134; Pelsey & Lacroute (1984) Curr Genet 8, 277), but is consistent with our own earlier observation that there is no obvious link between ribosome loading and mRNA stability in yeast (Santiago et al. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res 14, 8347). Possible reasons for this disparity are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{regulatory}} networks {{control the}} state of a cell. Models of such networks have been produced for sea urchin development and suggest that cell type may be defined by distinct network kernels. Such kernels are composed {{of a set of}} sequence specific DNA-binding transcription factors (SSTFs) that maintain each other’s expression through cell type-specific cis-regulatory modules. Ectopic expression of some individual SSTFs leads to trans-differentiation, or the conversion of one cell type to another. Our hypothesis is that trans-differentiation will be more efficient and targeted if specific SSTF combinations, corresponding to those of a network kernel, are expressed ectopically. A transient, polycistronic, cassette-based expression system was designed and built. This system allow for Lbx 1 -dependent network kernels to be transiently introduced into heterologous cells. Transfecting a cell with a specific combination of SSTFs may trigger establishment of the corresponding endogenous network kernel and thereby lead to trans-differentiation. Five SSTF ORFs (Lbx 1, Lmx 1 b, Pax 2, Pax 8, and Isl 1) were PCR amplified with gene-specific primers that included AsiSI and PacI restriction sites. A base bacterial vector was created with a custom <b>polylinker</b> to receive the PCR-generated minimal ORFs. This custom <b>polylinker</b> was constructed so that PCR-generated minimal ORFs could readily be transferred to other vector systems by classic recombinant methods. The AsiSI/PacI minimal ORF fragments are transferred to a pcDNA 575 / 576 mammalian expression vector containing the IRES ORF cassette to generate IRES-ORF or ORF-IRES expression cassettes. Polycistronic expression cartridges of fluorescent proteins and SSTF kernels need to be completed before functional tests can be done...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{construction}} of two vectors for Escherichia coli: pUC 72, for molecular cloning, and pPLT 7, for thermal-induced expression. The main feature of pUC 72 is a novel <b>polylinker</b> region that includes restriction sites for Nde I and Nco I which provide an ATG codon for proper translation initiation of expressed genes. Vector pPLT 7 is ideal for thermo-inducible expression in host cells that carry the cI 857 repressor gene. The use of pPLT 7 was validated by the successful expression of the genes encoding carp and porcine growth hormones. These vectors provide novel cloning possibilities in addition to simple, non-expensive, high level expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} two new promoter probe vectors which carry a <b>polylinker</b> {{derived from}} plasmid pUC 19 proximal to the 5 ' {{end of a}} promoter-less galactokinase gene. Using these two vectors we have demonstrated that the ColE 3 imm gene and the ColE 8 imm gene present on the ColE 3 -CA 38 plasmid have their own promoters, independent of the SOS promoter of the colicin E 3 structural gene. The activity of two terminators, one located proximal to the 5 ' end of the ColE 8 imm gene, the other located proximal to the 5 ' end of the lys gene, were shown by {{a comparison of the}} galactokinase activity conferred by several of the recombinant plasmids...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a rapid and efficient microscale method for in vitro site-directed mutagenesis by gene synthesis. Mutants are constructed by "shot-gun ligation" of overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides yielding double stranded synthetic DNA {{of more than}} 120 nucleotides in length. The terminal oligonucleotides of the DNA segment to be synthesized are designed to create sticky ends complementary to unique restriction sites of a <b>polylinker</b> present in an M 13 vector. The oligonucleotides are hybridized and ligated to the M 13 vector without any purification of the synthetic DNA segment. After cloning, {{about half of the}} progeny from such shot-gun ligations contained the predicted sequence demonstrating the efficacy of this method for gene synthesis and its potential for the extensive mutational analysis of genes...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid vectors were {{constructed}} to study promoters of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. Plasmid pCCBSelect contains the promoterless reporter {{genes in the}} order cat-nifHDK. In pCCBSelect/a, the nifHDK operon precedes the cat gene. Putative promoter sequences were cloned into a <b>polylinker</b> region upstream of the reporter genes. Activity in heterocysts was determined by complementation of a strain containing a deletion of the nifH gene. Activity in vegetative cells was determined by measuring resistance to chloramphenicol. The promoter of the nifHDK operon was active only in heterocysts; the promoter of the nifJ gene was active only in iron-depleted medium; and the promoters of the psbB gene, the ntcA gene, and a newly found transcription factor gene were all active in both cell types...|$|E
