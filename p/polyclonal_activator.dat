40|$|Endotoxin protein (EP) {{has been}} shown to be a mitogen and <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> of human {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes. EP stimulates proliferation of B lymphoyctes in the absence of T cells, and this activation is nonspecific by a number of parameters. Additionally, EP mitogenesis, but not polyclonal activation, is inhibited in the presence of human serum, suggesting that these events are dissociable. In these studies, EP appears to be equivalent to or better than pokeweed mitogen in stimulating nonspecific antibody production in vitro...|$|E

This phenomenon was further analysed by preparing cell walls, peptidoglycans and teichoic acids from Staphylococcus aureus Wood 46 and Bacillus subtilis and studying their capacity to stimulate human adult and newborn lymphocytes to proliferate and to produce leucocyte inhibitory factor (LIF). All these bacterial surface components acted as <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators.</b> In our opinion these findings further strengthen the view that in infections {{there are a variety}} of bacterial products capable of inducing a polyclonal response of the host...|$|R

This stimulation is observed only with T-cell-dependent <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> of immunoglobulin production and its mechanism {{appears to be}} associated with TFX-induced activation of T-helper cells. On the other hand, antibody production in vitro of lymphocytes already involved in high humoral responses is inhibited by thymosin. TFX has similar activity both in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The use of nonspecific {{polyclonal}} {{activation of}} lymphocytes {{has long been}} used {{as a model for the}} study of antigen-induced responses. Essential to the study of bone marrow-derived (B) cell activation is the ability to reproducibly induce and detect antibody production in vitro. <b>Polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> offer the unique ability to stimulate a greater percentage of the total B cell population. In addition to generating a greater understanding of B cell physiology in vitro, tests that can be used to selectively analyze human B and thymus-derived (T) cell function represent important tools for evaluating the immunological status of patients with various diseases. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) a has been extensively used to trigger the in vitro production and secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) by human B cells. Workers have demonstrated Ig production by measuring intracytoplasmic Ig levels (1), the presence of Ig in culture supernates (2), and by local hemolysis in gel (3, 4). In addition to plant lectins, substances derived from bacteria (5, 6) and viruses (7) have been shown to be potent <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> for human B cells. It has recently been shown that the Fc region of Ig, whether in the form of an Fc fragment (8 - 10), aggregated I...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthetic}} 23 -amino acid peptide {{derived from}} the CH 3 domain of human IgG 1 {{was found to be}} a potent adjuvant as well as a <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator.</b> The Fc peptide was found to enhance human and murine humoral, and T cell-mediated immune responses.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the invasin {{molecule}} of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis stimulates human peripheral B cells in vitro. In this work we evaluated the in vivo role of invasin as <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> of B lymphocytes in the mouse experimental model, by comparing strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis expressing invasin and isogenic inv mutants. Swiss mice were infected intravenously with two strains expressing invasin (YpIII pIB 1 and an isogenic virulence plasmid-cured strain, YpIII) and with two invasin mutant strains (Yp 100 pIB 1 and Yp 100, plasmid-cured). Spleen cells were sampled on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after infection. Immunoglobulin (Ig) -secreting spleen cells were detected by protein A plaque assay and specific antibodies were detected in sera by ELISA. The virulent strain YPIII pIB 1 (wild type) did not provoke polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes in vivo. In general, fewer Ig-secreting spleen cells of all isotypes {{were found in the}} infected animals than in the control animals. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in the sera of animals infected with all strains. The peak response occurred on the 21 st day post-infection, and the Yp 100 strain provoked the highest level of these antibodies. We concluded that invasin is not a <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> of murine B cells...|$|E

We also discuss the efficiency of various types of mitogen with particular regard to their capacity to produce monoclonal antibodies and serum antibodies. A specific immune response against soluble antigens is increased by pretreating mice with PPD. This preactivation permitted us to obtain monoclonal antibodies against weak antigens in a few days. No monoclonal antibodies were obtained by inoculating weak antigens or the activators by themselves...|$|R
40|$|Two antigen systems (L 29 & L 30) {{expressed}} on {{two distinct}} human B cell subpopulations {{were identified by}} using BL 1 - 4 D 6 and TB 3 - 7 D 5 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. L 29 was expressed on approximately one-third of B cells in human lymphoid tissues. These B cells associated with L 29 were large activated B cells located in the germinal centres of lymphoid follicles. L 30, on the other hand, existed on approximately two-thirds of B cells mainly located in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles, most of which also expressed IgM and IgD on their cell membrane. In addition, L 30 was shared on mature granulocytes. With the use of <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> such as pokeweek mitogen (PWM) and protein A-bearing staphylococci (SAC), L 29 antigen was inducible on PWM- or SAC-stimulated B cells in correspondence {{with the emergence of}} Tac and T 10 antigens of these B cells. In contrast, L 30 antigen on the B cells stimulated by the <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> was decreased in its expression and was finally lost from these B cells. Although none of L 29 and L 30 was expressed on normal, non-activated human thymus and peripheral T cells, L 29 but not L 30 was expressed on concanavalin A-activated T cells. Immunochemical studies showed that L 30 consist of a single polypeptide with mol. wt of 40, 000. L 29 antigen is presently under study...|$|R

The critical culture requirements have been delineated and a new highly sensitive ultrathin gel assay method has been described. Under these conditions a substantial and highly reproducible plaque-forming cell response was detected in normal human peripheral blood.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} frequencies of autoantibody-producing B cells in GVHD and in normal mice has been undertaken by generating collections of hybridomas of activated B cells. These hybridomas secreted sufficient quantities of Ig to allow binding analyses on a panel of autoantigens. B cells have been activated {{in a variety of}} ways. In vivo they were activated by injection of alloreactive T cells of one parent, leading to GVHD by a foreign antigen, sheep erythrocytes, in a secondary response, or by the <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> LPS. B cells from an experimentally unstimulated animal were used for an analysis of the normal background. In vitro B cells were activated by alloreactive T cells or by LPS. The frequencies of hybridomas and, therefore, of activated B cells producing autoantibodies to DNA or to kidney were not significantly different in mice activated by a graft- vs. -host T cell response as compared with B cell populations activated by any of the other procedures. They were found to compose 7. 1 - 17. 1 % of the total repertoire of activated B cells. Moreover, the frequencies of autoantibody-producing activated B cells does not change with time after induction of the graft-vs. -host reaction. The pattern and frequencies of autoantigen-binding specificities to cytoskeleton, smooth muscle, nuclei, mitochondria, and DNA were not found to be different in any of the groups of hybridomas. The single notable exception, found in GVHD mice, were hybridomas producing autoantibodies to kidney proximal tubular brush border. These results allow the conclusion that autoantigen-binding B cells exist in an activated state in GVHD mice, as well as in mice activated by a foreign antigen or by a <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator,</b> in B cell populations activated in vitro either by alloreactive T cells or by a <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator,</b> and even in the background of experimentally unstimulated animals. T cell-mediated graft-vs. -host activation, in large part, does not lead to a selective expansion of autoantigen-binding B cells. The main difference between the graft-vs. -host-activated B cell repertoire and all others is that approximately 90 % of teh autoantibodies were of the IgG class, whereas al autoantibodies found in the other groups were IgM...|$|E
40|$|Mild {{alkaline}} hydrolysis {{was found to}} enhance the mitogenicity of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin for murine B lymphocytes. Alkaline treated lipopolysaccharide also retained its property as a <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator.</b> Whereas this treatment reduced the lethality of endotoxin for mice, its toxicity for lymphocytes cultured {{in the absence of}} fetal calf serum was increased. Lipid analysis indicated that there were no significant changes in the fatty acids of lipid A, but particle size was significantly reduced and the material was more homogeneous and soluble than untreated lipopolysaccharide. The relationship of these effect on the structure of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin to the mechanism of B-lymphocyte activation is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO) and the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine (NE) on murine B-cell activation. Cells were stimulated either by anti-mouse mu-chain antibodies (anti-mu), or by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or a membrane proteoglycan of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp MPG), a T-independent <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> distinct from LPS, which induces B-cell proliferation and Ig synthesis. ISO and NE enhanced LPS- and Kp MPG-induced B-cell proliferation and maturation into IgM-, IgG- and IgA-secreting cells. The enhancement was prevented by prior addition of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. Earlier events in the LPS- and Kp MPG-stimulated B-cell activation, such as increases in Ia antigen expression and RNA synthesis, were not modified by the catecholamines. Unlike ISO and NE, the membrane-permeant cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate (cAMP) analogue dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), and the potent adenylate cyclase activator forskolin did not enhance but even inhibited DNA synthesis and Ig secretion stimulated by LPS and Kp MPG. In addition, ISO and NE did not enhance but strongly inhibited anti-mu-induced B-cell proliferation, and these effects were mimicked by dbcAMP and forskolin. Collectively, the data demonstrate that beta-agonists differently modulate B-cell activation depending upon the <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator,</b> and provide additional evidence for distinct biochemical mechanisms of B-cell activation by anti-mu and LPS. Moreover, our results indicate that beta-adrenergic stimulation up-regulates B-cell responses to LPS and Kp MPG by a novel and cAMP-independent pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of Nocardia water-soluble mitogen (NWSM) and LPS were compared in several experimental systems, since both compounds are B-cell mitogens and <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> in vitro. The results reported here demonstrated that NWSM like LPS {{also has a}} strong adjuvant activity in vivo if administered in saline with a strong antigen (heterologous red blood cells) or even with a weak immunogen such as theta alloantigen. However, in contrast to LPS, NWSM administered to mice failed to induce in vivo proliferation of lymphocytes, polyclonal activation and PFC against syngeneic bromelain-treated erythrocytes and thymocytes. It is possible therefore, that different mechanisms {{may be responsible for}} adjuvant {{activity of}} NWSM and LPS...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine whether gram-negative bacteria frequently isolated from periodontally diseased sites contained <b>polyclonal</b> B-cell <b>activators.</b> <b>Polyclonal</b> B-cell activation, which results in nonspecific activation of multiple B-cell clones was analyzed by a hemolysis-in-gel assay designed to detect a broad range of antibody specificities. Extracts from numerous bacterial strains, including Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas sputigena, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were tested. Extracts of the above organisms were found to stimulate polyclonal antibody responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, although the magnitude of stimulation varied among the extracts. Optimal antibody-forming cell responses were found at stimulator doses between 5 and 1, 000 micrograms/ml. We conclude that the resident gram-negative subgingival flora associated with periodontal lesions possesses potent <b>polyclonal</b> B-cell <b>activators.</b> These activators may contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing B lymphocytes to produce antibody, osteolytic factors, or both and possibly other mediators of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} on the cellular and molecular basis for T cell dysfunction in aged mice is reviewed, with emphasis on defects in calcium signal generation and protein kinase function. The accumulation in older mice of memory T cells {{at the expense of}} naive T cells seems to account for most of the decline in the proportion of cells that can secrete or respond to interleukin 2. Memory T cells in mice of any age have an intrinsic resistance to increases in cytoplasmic free calcium ion concentration, which in turn interferes with their responses to <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators.</b> T cells from old mice also exhibit declines both in serine/threonine and in tyrosine-specific protein kinase signals after activation by either receptor-dependent or receptor-independent agonists...|$|R
40|$|An antigen {{preparation}} of Vibrioanguillarum, a salmonid pathogen, {{acts as a}} potent invitro mitogenic stimulator of splenic and pronephric (anterior kidney) lymphocytes from coho salmon (Oncorhynchuskisutch), chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and rainbow trout (Salmogairdneri). This antigen (VA) is comparable in its mitogenic activity to Concanavalin A (Con A), Escherichiacoli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). VA gives peak mitogenic responses in coho five days after initiation of cell culture. VA {{also appears to be}} a nonspecific <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> as determined by the generation of plaque forming cells to trinitrophenyl (TNP) and fluorescein (FI) haptenic determinants.

40|$|Echinococcus granulosus {{protoscolex}} (PSC) {{infection of}} BALB/c mice led, after 4 days, to raised numbers of cells forming plaques with trinitrophenyl-treated sheep red cells and bromelain-treated mouse red cells. The findings {{were similar in}} athymic and euthymic CBA mice. Activation of B cells was accompanied by secretion of immunoglobulin, {{as indicated by the}} reverse plaque technique. In addition, co-culture of PSC with the 7 OZ/ 3 pre-B-cell led to the induction of differentiation, resulting in the expression of surface immunoglobulin (Ig). It is concluded that E. granulosus is a <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> of B cells inducing both transformation and differentiation, and that the effect is thymus-independent...|$|E
40|$|The IgG subclasses {{secreted}} {{by human}} B cells in vitro {{in response to}} IL- 2 have been analysed. B cells were prepared from tonsil, blood and spleen, and cultured with recombinant IL- 2 in {{the presence or absence}} of two polyclonal activators: Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Secretion of all four subclasses and of IgM was stimulated by IL- 2, but the relative amounts varied according to (i) the tissue source of the B cells, and (ii) which <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> was used. The amount of IgG 1 tended to be higher and IgG 2 tended to be lower when SAC was the <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> (compared to LPS). This difference was most marked for tonsil B cells, and it was found that SAC had a negative effect on secretion of IgM and IgG 2 in these cultures, whilst synergizing with IL- 2 to stimulate the production of IgG 1, 3 and 4. When the degree of stimulation of different pairs of isotypes was analysed, several interesting positive correlations emerged. In tonsil B-cell cultures, stimulation of IgM and IgG 2 was linked with each other, but not with IgG 1, whilst in blood B-cell cultures all isotypes appeared to be stimulated co-ordinately. Stimulation of IgG 1 and IgG 3 were positively correlated in cultures of B cells from all tissues. The results emphasize that the effects of a single cytokine on immunoglobulin isotype production can be influenced by the source of the B cells, and by other signals delivered to the cells...|$|E
40|$|Spleen {{cells from}} adult mice were {{rendered}} "tolerant" to TNP by exposing cells in vitro to large concentrations of TNP 10 BSA.

In contrast when TNP-KLH was the antigen used to challenge TNP-BSA treated cells, no unresponsiveness was observed.

Both the inhibitory or the stimulatory effects were dose-dependent. The stimulatory effect of epimastigotes was also temperature-dependent producing increasedstimulation indexes as the temperature of parasite cultures was raised. Metabolically active,living parasites seemed to be necessary for an improved lymphocyte stimulation suggesting a potential role of secreted metabolites as <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> of mouse lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Following {{incubation}} with <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> such as PHA or concanavalin A, human {{peripheral blood}} lymphocytes show directional migration towards chemotactic {{factors such as}} endotoxin-activated plasma, casein or denatured proteins. This migration is inhibited by treatment of the cells with phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase C, but little affected by proteases or glycosidases. In addition, these lymphocytes migrate towards PHA and other lymphocyte activators when these reagents are used as chemoattractants at concentrations well below their mitogenic doses. They also migrate towards staphylococcal protein A. Migration towards PHA and protein A is reduced by pretreating the lymphocytes with proteases but not with phospholipase C. These results suggest two independent membrane interactions which initiate lymphocyte chemotaxis, one acting directly via the lipid bilayer, the other involving the binding of ligands to membrane proteins...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{exotoxin}} A (PA), {{a potent}} protein synthesis inhibitor, {{was found to}} be a weak T-cell mitogen for murine splenocytes. Maximal stimulation of [3 H]thymidine incorporation was obtained with 10 to 100 ng of toxin per ml following a 4 -day induction. PA was also shown to be a <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL), effective against concanavalin A-treated target cells. The effective PA dose for CTL induction was the same as that for mitogenic stimulation, only with a prolonged priming time (7 days). In contrast to other mitogens, PA could not reactivate memory CTL into secondary CTL. The stimulation of CTL by subcytotoxic doses of PA may be relevant to its modulatory effect on the immunocellular system...|$|E

Mesenteric lymph node T cells, however, were as responsive to the <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> phytohaemagglutinin as those from normal mice.

40|$|Various {{parameters}} of immune suppression are observed in astronauts {{during and after}} spaceflight, and in isolated immune cells in true and simulated microgravity. Specifically, polyclonal activation of T cells is severely suppressed in true and simulated microgravity. These recent findings with various <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> suggests a suppression of oligoclonal lymphocyte activation in microgravity. We utilized rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors that simulate aspects of microgravity for cell cultures to analyze three models of antigen-specific activation. A mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR), {{as a model for}} a primary immune response; a tetanus toxoid (TT) response and a B. burgdorferi (Bb) response, as models of a secondary immune response, were all suppressed in the RWV bioreactor.

40|$|Two lipid A-free {{fractions}} {{extracted from}} Brucella melitensis (fractions PI and SF) {{were shown to}} behave as B-cell non-specific mitogens for murine lymphocytes: they stimulated the uptake of tritiated thymidine by normal unsensitized murine splenic lymphocytes, by spleen cells from nude mice and by T-cell depleted but not by T-cell enriched and B-cell-deprived splenic populations. Since depletion of adherent cells leads to a two- to three-fold depression of PI- or SF-induced mitogenic responses these two fractions were shown to require accessory adherent cell participation for an optimal mitogenicity. Moreover they behaved as <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators</b> for murine spleen cells.

In contrast, the <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activator</b> pokeweed mitogen also stimulated IgM production, but only 1 % had IgM RF activity. A relation between the activator and IgM RF or hidden IgM RF is suggested. This {{is based on the}} positive correlation between IgM RF concentration in these preparations and their ability to stimulate lymphocytes to produce IgG, IgM, and IgM RF.

Over the cell culture period (12 days) the expression of membrane molecules was investigated by FACS analysis by using the corresponding monoclonal antibodies recognising the membrane antigens. The following markers were monitored at 2 day intervals: BoCD 4, BoCD 8, MHC II DR and gamma delta subset. The study was conducted from lymphocytes from 5 steers.

The greater the density of G protein in lipid vesicles or the degree of aggregation of isolated G protein, the more highly stimulatory it is for murine splenocytes. As G protein is spread out in artificial vesicles, it becomes less mitogenic. It is probable that other viral components are also stimulatory since the Triton-insoluble pellet and VSV from which the G protein has been enzymatically removed retain mitogenic activity.

The fragment of molecular weight 24, 000 turned out to be a potent <b>polyclonal</b> B-lymphocyte <b>activator</b> comparable to native protein I.

Further, non-adherent spleen-cell and T-cell depleted spleen cells induced in vitro anti-DNP antibody responses to DNP-histone H 1 {{to the same extent}} as normal spleen cells. These results suggest that anti-DNP antibody responses to DNP-histone H 1 are macrophage- and thymus-independent. It was also observed that IgG-type anti-DNP antibodies to DNP-histone H 1 were produced although most thymus-independent antigens were shown to induce predominantly IgM type antibodies but little, if any, IgG type antibodies.

40|$|The proliferative {{response}} of lymphocytes from {{patients with chronic}} lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to the <b>polyclonal</b> <b>activators,</b> phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) correlates inversely with the logarithm of the circulating lymphocyte concentration in vivo (P less than 0. 001). This suggests that the response is due primarily to residual normal cells in the circulation. In support of this postulate, dilution of normal cells reproduced the effect and also induced a delayed response to PHA, which is found frequently with CLL lymphocytes. A combination of autoradiography and immunofluorescence microscopy identified both B and T cells in the responding population in similar proportions from both normal and CLL donors. These data demonstrate that the 3 H-thymidine assay used in most mitogenic studies is not suitable alone for investigating the functional capacity of leukaemic lymphocytes in CLL and other diseases involving a gross perturbation of lymphocyte populations...|$|R
