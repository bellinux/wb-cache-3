In exchange, they were required to pledge to actively serve in essential civilian or federal government services for the duration of World War II. All state nursing schools were eligible to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> However, they needed to be accredited by the accrediting agency in their state, and connected with a hospital that had been approved by the American College of Surgeons.|$|E

A teacher, psychopathic sadist Kinpatsu Sakamochi, briefs the students: the class has been chosen to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program.</b> They have three days {{to kill each other}} until one stands as the victor, or the metal collars will detonate, killing them all (as Sakamochi gleefully demonstrates on one student). The students are issued survival packs and a random weapon/tool, and sent out onto the island one by one. While most of the students receive guns and knives, some acquire relatively useless items like boomerangs, dartboard darts, or a fork. Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar device that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.|$|E

The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later.
