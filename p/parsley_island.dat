40|$|On 11 July 2002 a dozen Moroccan armed police {{occupied}} <b>Parsley</b> <b>Island,</b> a {{rocky outcrop}} off the north Moroccan coast. Five days later Spanish armed forces intervened to ‘liberate’ {{the island and}} repatriated the Moroccans. On 20 July, following the intervention of US Secretary of State Colin Powell, the State Department drew up an agreement acceptable to both sides and Spain withdrew. This article examines why Morocco occupied the island, why Spain used force in reply and why the US became involved. As with many territorial disputes, the occupation and the responses to it were symptomatic of more deep-seated grievances between the disputants, while {{the involvement of the}} Bush administration was inspired by its own self-interest in the aftermath of 9 / 11...|$|E
40|$|El conflicto armado entre España y Marruecos por la isla de Perejil demostró que ni militares ni periodistas españoles, especialmente los segundos, estábamos preparados para tratar informativamente una crisis bélica en la que lo que se dirimía eran intereses territoriales nacionales directos. Por lo mismo, un conflicto de características diferentes a aquellos en los que bajo la forma de operaciones multinacionales habían participado las Fuerzas Armadas españolas en la década {{anterior}} y que habían sido cubiertos por los periodistas nacionales. Para unos y para otros, ese fracaso ha sido el resultado de la manera en la que han operado con los factores exógenos y endógenos al corresponsal de guerra, desde el punto de vista del cual se desarrolla este trabajo. A tal conclusión se llega a través del trabajo de campo durante la propia crisis y la investigación hemerográfica y bibliográfica. The {{military conflict}} between Spain and Morocco because Perejil (<b>Parsley)</b> <b>island</b> showed {{that neither the}} military men nor the journalists were prepared to treat from a communication and information approach such a military crisis in which direct territorial national interests were challenged. In this sense, there was a deep difference between what happened in Perejil and those other multinational military operations in which the Spanish Armed Forces have been involved during the last decade, the very ones that have been reported from the ground by the Spanish journalists. For both the military and newsmen this failure is the consequence {{of the way in}} which they have dealt with the external and internal factors regarding to the performance of a war correspondent, from whose point of view this paper has been written. Such a conclusion is the result of field work and library research...|$|E

5000|$|Anogramma ascensionis, the Ascension <b>Island</b> <b>parsley</b> fern, is {{a species}} of fern in the Pteridaceae family that is endemic to Ascension Island, a {{volcanic}} island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is one of eight [...] species in the Anogramma genus. It was thought to have become extinct due to habitat loss, until four plants {{were found on the}} island in 2010. Over 60 specimens were then successfully cultivated at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and on Ascension Island. It is now classified as Critically Endangered.|$|R
25|$|The endemic flora {{includes}} {{plants like}} Pteris adscensionis, Asplenium ascensionis, Euphorbia origanoides {{as well as}} the extinct species Oldenlandia adscensionis, Sporobolus durus and Dryopteris ascensionis. Anogramma ascensionis (Ascension <b>Island</b> <b>parsley</b> fern) was thought to have become extinct due to habitat loss, until four plants were found on the island in 2010. Over 60 specimens were then successfully cultivated. Portuguese explorers released goats in the 1500s which ate many species to extinction. The later introduction of rabbits, sheep, rats and donkeys, and over 200 imported species further marginalised the original flora.|$|R
