50|$|Freissler {{was born}} in Kujavy in {{northern}} Moravia, which {{was a part of}} Austrian empire. Freissler developed <b>paternosters</b> and elevators, which were sold very successfully throughout the empire and abroad.

50|$|The {{construction}} of new <b>paternosters</b> was stopped in the mid-1970s due to safety concerns, but public sentiment has kept many of the remaining examples open. By far most remaining <b>paternosters</b> are in Europe, with 230 examples in Germany, and 68 in the Czech Republic. Only two have been identified outside Europe: one in Malaysia, another in Peru.|$|R

5|$|The building's {{original}} {{design in the}} modernist New Objectivity style {{was the subject of}} a competition which was eventually won by the architect Hans Poelzig. On its completion, the complex was the largest office building in Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The IG Farben Building's six square wings retain a modern, spare elegance, despite its mammoth size. It is also notable for its <b>paternoster</b> elevators.|$|E
5|$|After its {{suspension}} {{with the}} December 1798 issue, the Analytical Review lay dormant {{until it was}} briefly revived as The Analytical Review (New Series) {{during the first six}} months of 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of <b>Paternoster</b> Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures. This series lasted only from January until June 1799.|$|E
5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining <b>Paternoster</b> Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E

50|$|The name <b>Paternosters</b> is {{connected}} with a legend relating to the colonisation of Sark in the 16th century. According to this legend a boatload {{of women and children}} was wrecked on the reef and their cries can still be heard {{from time to time in}} the wind. Superstitious sailors would say the Lord's Prayer when passing the rocks, hence the name <b>Paternosters.</b>|$|R

5|$|France's final match, against Chile, {{featured}} the first penalty kick {{of the tournament}} and World Cup history. The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thépot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match. In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martínez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando <b>Paternoster.</b> Guillermo Stábile scored a hat-trick in his international debut as Argentina won 6–3, {{despite the absence of}} their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam. Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti. Argentina won 3–1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.|$|E

50|$|<b>Paternosters</b> {{were popular}} {{throughout}} {{the first half}} of the 20th century because they could carry more passengers than ordinary elevators.

It is now the location of the London Stock Exchange which relocated there from Threadneedle Street in 2004. It is also the location of investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Nomura Securities Co., and of fund manager Fidelity Investments.

5|$|The {{reference}} to St. Peter's sister {{may be a}} substitution for St. Peter's daughter, St. Petronilla, known in England as St. Parnell.

25|$|During {{the middle}} ages, {{evidence}} suggests that both the Our Father and the Hail Mary were recited with prayer beads. In 13th century Paris, four trade guilds existed of prayer bead makers, who were referred to as paternosterers, and the beads were referred to as <b>paternosters,</b> suggesting a continued link between the Our Father (Pater noster in Latin) and the prayer beads.|$|R

And all the brothers who are {{under the command of}} that house where the brother has passed away should say the hundred <b>paternosters,</b> as is said above, after the death of the brother is known, by God's mercy. Also we pray and command by pastoral authority that a pauper be fed with meat and wine for forty days in memory of the dead brother, just as if he were alive.
