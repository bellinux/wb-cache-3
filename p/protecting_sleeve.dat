50|$|Navistar {{claims that}} the wet-sleeve design enhances {{durability}} because the consistent wall thickness of the sleeve allows for consistent heat transfer, ensuring the cylinders stay round during thermal expansion. Additionally, they state that the hardened cylinder sleeve is more durable and wear resistant than a softer, cast-in wall. Also, the replaceable cylinder <b>sleeves</b> <b>protect</b> the block from damage (e.g. in case of foreign objects entering the cylinder) and can easily be replaced, which Navistar claims enables simpler restoration to original specifications. The wet-sleeve design also allows the engine to be rebuilt easily to factory specifications, sometimes without even removing the engine from the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment (PPE), {{in particular}} radio-opaque fabrics, {{can be used}} to reduce wearer exposure to airborne radioactive particulates, but do not offer complete protection. The objective of this project is to create a realistic dosimetric model of the human arm, <b>protected</b> by a <b>sleeve,</b> which can eventually be developed into a tool to assess the full-body dose imparted to the wearer in the event of radiological particulate exposure. A two-fold approach will be employed whereby: (1) a particulate transport model will be used to determine the regional radioactive particulate concentrations; and (2) these concentration data will then be incorporated into a dosimetric model that will use the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code to determine the dose imparted to the tissue. Benchmarking experiments will be carried out to confirm the results generated by each computer model. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The prototype, nicknamed [...] "Mother", and {{the first}} {{production}} models of what would become {{referred to as the}} Mark I were designed to carry two six-pounder guns and three machine-guns. Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Swinton expressed the fear that tanks armed in such a way might be unable to protect themselves from attacks by large numbers of enemy infantry. In April 1916, it was therefore decided that half of the 150 tanks on order should be fitted with machine guns in place of the six-pounders. A new sponson was designed so that the tank could carry two Vickers machine guns, with their cooling jackets <b>protected</b> by armoured <b>sleeves,</b> {{on each side of the}} hull. Swinton's idea was that tanks should operate in pairs: a [...] "destroyer" [...] and a [...] "consort" [...] or [...] "man-killing" [...] tank, providing mutual protection. He stated that he then assigned the names [...] "male" [...] and [...] "female" [...] respectively. The designation [...] "male" [...] applied to those armed with six-pounder guns, whereas the [...] "female" [...] was the tank equipped only with machine guns.|$|R
40|$|Prospects for {{development}} of a wild silk industry in Africa would be improved if silkworm survival during mass production could be improved. A study on {{the survival of the}} Boisduval silkworm, Anaphe panda (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae) was conducted with and without protection by net sleeves in two different forest habitats (natural and modified) in the Kakamega forest of western Kenya. Overall, cohort survival was significantly higher (P < 0. 001) in the natural than in the modified forest, but larval survival was improved over threefold by protection with net sleeves in both habitat types. In the modified forest, only 16. 8 % of unprotected larvae survived to the pupal stage and formed cocoons, whereas 62. 3 % survived in the same environment when they were <b>protected</b> with net <b>sleeves.</b> In the natural forest, 20. 4 % of unprotected larvae survived, whereas 67. 7 % survived in net sleeves. There was also a significant effect of season; cohorts of larvae that eclosed in the wet season had significantly lower survival than those eclosing in the dry season (P = 0. 02). Sources of mortality appeared to be natural enemies (parasites, predators and diseases) and climatic factors...|$|R
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes <b>protected</b> by hessian <b>sleeves</b> worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|R
50|$|The first screwpile {{lighthouse}} type {{built in}} the United States was at Brandywine Shoal, Delaware Bay, an area served by a lightship since 1823 and an ordinary straightpile lighthouse which stood briefly there in 1828 but was destroyed by ice. Major Hartman Bache, a distinguished engineer of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, began work in 1848 and completed the task in 1850, at a construction cost of $53,317. Alexander Mitchell served as consultant. The screwpiles were turned by a 4-foot capstan worked by 30 men. To protect the structure from ice floes an ice-breaker consisting of a pier of 30 iron screwpiles 23 feet long and five inches in diameter was screwed down into the bottom and interconnected at their heads above the water reinforcing them together. Subsequently, though, the use of caisson lighthouses proved more durable in locations subject to ice.Screwpile lighthouses were relatively inexpensive, easy to construct, and comparatively quick to build. They became especially popular after the Civil War when the Lighthouse Board adopted a policy to replace inside (bays, sounds, and rivers) light vessels with screwpile lighthouses. Most screwpile lighthouses were made with iron piles, though a few were made with wooden piles covered with metal screw sleeves (these sleeves were probably adopted because they were less expensive and easier to insert into the bottom, plus the <b>sleeve</b> <b>protected</b> the wood from marine-boring invertebrates). The typical screwpile lighthouse was hexagonal or octagonal in plan consisting of a central pile which was set first and then the six or eight perimeter piles were screwed in place around it.|$|R
40|$|Die Dachtragwerke von wettkampftauglichen Sporthallen müssen in der Regel neben dem Sportfeldbereich auch den Tribünenbereich stützenfrei überspannen. Aufgrund der großen Spannweite von mehr als 28 Metern kann dieser Forderung bspw. durch Dachbinder in Stahl-, Holz- oder Spannbetonbauweise entsprochen werden, welche nach der Niedersächsischen Versammlungsstättenverordnung zudem feuerhemmend ausgebildet sein müssen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit sollen Dachbinder in Stahlbzw. hybrider Stahl-Holzbauweise hinsichtlich statischer, bau- und brandschutztechnischer sowie wirtschaftlicher Gesichtspunkte optimiert werden. Während die Kaltbemessung im Grenzzustand der Tragfähigkeit bei einem Stahlfachwerkbinder erfolgreich durchgeführt werden kann, ist eine Realisierung der Feuerwiderstandsdauer von 30 Minuten unter Ansatz der Einheits-Temperaturzeitkurve (ETK) nur durch die Verwendung von unwirtschaftlich überdimensionierten Profilabmessungen auf Bauteilebene möglich. Werden zudem die Zwangskräfte aus thermischer Dehnung angesetzt, ist der Nachweis für das Gesamttragwerk nicht möglich. Gerade bei Sporthallen, die bei ordnungsgemäßer Nutzung nur eine geringe Brandlastdichte aufweisen, kann über die Verwendung von Naturbrandmodellen gezeigt werden, dass die zu erwartenden Raumgas- und damit auch Stahltemperaturen deutlich unter jenen bei Ansatz der ETK liegen. Eine Heißbemessung des Stahlfachwerks gelingt dabei sowohl mit dem vereinfachten Naturbrandmodell Lokaler Brand als auch bei einem allgemeinen Naturbrandmodell mit thermodynamischer Berechnung in FDS. In einer Variantenstudie ist neben der erfolgreichen Bemessung eines mit DSBBS geschützten Stahlfachwerks ein im Firstbereich gekrümmter Holzbinder mit Stahlunterspannung nachgewiesen worden. Auch die Brandschutznachweise der Holzbauteile sind aufgrund des günstigen thermischen Verhaltens von Holz im Brandfall - durch die Pyrolyse des Holzes bildet sich eine schützende Kohleschicht aus - über eine entsprechende Dimensionierung möglich. Um diesen Schutzeffekt des Holzes an Stahlteilen nutzen zu können, sind experimentelle Brandversuche und numerische Simulationen an mit Holzmanschetten geschützten Stahlquerschnitten durchgeführt worden. Bereits wenige Zentimeter Holzschichtdicke reichen aus, um die Stahltemperatur deutlich unterhalb des kritischen Bereichs zu halten. Insgesamt scheint der Einsatz von Holzmanschetten alternativ zum einzigen auf kreisförmigen Zuggliedern zugelassenen DSBBS neben gestalterischen Aspekten gerade in Bezug auf Dauerhaftigkeit betrachtenswert zu sein. In {{compliance}} with the rules, the roof structures of sports halls that are suitable for competition also have to span the stands, {{in addition to the}} sports field, without support. Due to the large span of more than 28 meters, roof trusses in steel, wood or prestressed concrete constructions can fulfill this requirement, which must also be fire-resistant according to the Lower Saxony Assemblies Ordinance. It is the purpose of this work, to optimize roof trusses in steel or hybrid steel-wood construction in terms of static, construction and fire protection as well as economic aspects. While the dimensioning can be carried out successfully in the limit of the load carrying capacity of a steel truss, an implementation of the fire resistance duration of 30 minutes under the assumption of the uniform temperature time curve (UTTC) is only possible by using uneconomically oversized profile dimensions on the component plane. If the restraining forces as a result of thermal expansion are applied, a proof for the entire support structure is not possible. Especially in sports halls that have a low fire load density when properly used, natural fire models can be used to show that the expected gas and steel temperatures are significantly below those under approach of the UTTC. In case of fire, a dimensioning of the steel truss is achieved with the simplified natural fire model local fire as well as with a general natural fire model with thermodynamic calculation in FDS. The successful dimensioning of a steel truss protected by an insulating layer-forming fire protection system was proved in a variety-study. In addition, a hybrid steel-wood construction is dimensioned, consisting on the upper side of a laminated timber beam curved in the ridge area and on the lower side of a steel rod. Due to the good thermal behavior of wood {{in the event of a}} fire – the pyrolysis of wood forms a protective carbon coating – the fire safety proofs of the wooden components are also possible through appropriate dimensioning. In order to be able to utilize this protective effect of wood on steel parts, experimental fire tests and numerical simulations have been carried out on steel cross-sections <b>protected</b> with wooden <b>sleeves.</b> Already a few centimeters of wood layer thickness are sufficient to keep the steel temperature well below the critical range. Overall, the use of wooden sleeves as an alternative to the only insulating layer forming fire protection system approved on circular tension members seems to be, in addition to design aspects, a considerable possibility with regard to durability...|$|R
