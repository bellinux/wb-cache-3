5|$|A {{contradictory}} figure, Caion was {{equated with}} infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context, and his evidently unsubstantiated allegations against Caragiale have traditionally <b>puzzled</b> literary historians.

5|$|Banksy's {{installments}} {{are located}} {{all across the}} five boroughs, with some being purely multimedia exhibits. On 6 October, {{as a way to}} have made an installment in Dumbo, Brooklyn, a primary arts district of the city, Banksy posted a video featuring the Walt Disney character Dumbo being shot down by Syrian rebels, the meaning behind which <b>puzzled</b> many.|$|E

View <b>Puzzle</b> allows players to view <b>puzzles</b> they have completed. <b>Puzzle</b> Initialize allows the player to release all <b>puzzle</b> pieces back to be found again.|$|R
5|$|Magda (Anna Crilly) is the Spleens' morose Eastern European housekeeper, who {{is often}} <b>puzzled</b> by British attitudes, {{language}} and, in her view, softness. She is a willing worker and generally suffers Rick's selfish eccentricities in sullen silence.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name, {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di Sicilia, and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were <b>puzzled</b> about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E
5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are <b>puzzled</b> and doubtful. They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E

50|$|Stave <b>Puzzles</b> is an American jigsaw <b>puzzle</b> company {{located in}} Norwich, Vermont. The company {{was started in}} 1974 by Steve Richardson and Dave Tibbetts, the name being a {{combination}} of their two first names. They manufacture hand cut jigsaw <b>puzzles</b> made from cherry-backed, 5-layered, 1/4 in wood. Stave produces several different <b>puzzles</b> types ranging from traditional <b>puzzles,</b> teaser <b>puzzles</b> which can have many open areas within the <b>puzzles,</b> trick <b>puzzles</b> in which the <b>puzzles</b> can be put together in two or more ways of which only one is correct. They also create three-dimensional <b>puzzles,</b> limited edition <b>puzzles</b> and complete custom <b>puzzles.</b> Each <b>puzzle</b> is provided in a green and blue rectangular box and does not include {{a picture of the}} completed <b>puzzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>puzzle</b> is a game, problem, or toy {{that tests}} a person's {{ingenuity}} or knowledge. In a <b>puzzle,</b> the solver {{is expected to}} put pieces together in a logical way, in order {{to arrive at the}} correct solution of the <b>puzzle.</b> There are different genres of <b>puzzles,</b> such as crossword <b>puzzles,</b> word-search <b>puzzles,</b> number <b>puzzles,</b> or logic <b>puzzles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city <b>puzzled</b> the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of Rashomon {{began on}} July 7, 1950, and, after {{extensive}} location {{work in the}} primeval forest of Nara, wrapped on August 17. Just one week was spent in hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics <b>puzzled</b> by its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was <b>puzzled</b> by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected {{to be on the}} trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E
5000|$|Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) {{identified}} the purchasing power and exchange rate disconnect <b>puzzle</b> {{as one of}} the six major <b>puzzles</b> in international economics. [...] These were the consumption correlation <b>puzzle,</b> home bias in trade <b>puzzle,</b> the equity home bias <b>puzzle,</b> the Feldstein-Horioka savings-investment correlations <b>puzzle,</b> and the exchange rate regime <b>puzzle.</b> The sixth <b>puzzle</b> is described as [...] "why exchange rates are so volatile and apparently disconnected from fundamentals". Here Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) quotes the Meese and Rogoff (1983) exchange rate forecasting <b>puzzle</b> and the Baxter and Stockman (1989) neutrality of exchange rate regime <b>puzzle.</b> These two <b>puzzles</b> are closely to the Mussa <b>puzzle</b> {{as well as the other}} real exchange rate <b>puzzles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>puzzle</b> globe (also called jigsaw globe, globe <b>puzzle,</b> <b>puzzle</b> ball, <b>puzzle</b> sphere or spherical <b>puzzle)</b> is a spherical {{assembly}} of <b>puzzle</b> pieces that, when put together, form a complete sphere or globe. <b>Puzzle</b> globes will generally have a one-piece spherical substrate {{that supports the}} <b>puzzle</b> pieces as they are laid in place. In some <b>puzzle</b> globes the substrate is steel and the <b>puzzle</b> pieces are magnetic, the magnetic attraction keeping pieces on the lower portion of the sphere from falling off.|$|R

5|$|An {{estate agent}} {{receives}} a video {{recording of the}} murders in the post, leaving Black <b>puzzled.</b> That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E
5|$|At Mars Investigations, Duncan and Lilly's mother, Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill) hires Keith to {{ascertain}} if her husband Jake {{is having an}} affair, despite her open contempt for both Keith and Veronica. Keith is busy with other projects, and Veronica takes it upon herself to follow Jake. Veronica takes photos of him at the Camelot hotel as he meets with an unseen woman after midnight. Once Keith sees the license plate number of the woman's car, he stops the investigation and files the photograph. <b>Puzzled</b> by his actions, Veronica finds the file and learns that Keith has continued his own personal investigation of Lilly's murder. Veronica discovers that the car belongs to her missing mother, Lianne, and begins to investigate the murder herself.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was <b>puzzled</b> by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
40|$|To invent new <b>puzzles,</b> {{we take a}} {{systematic}} approach called divergence via abstraction. Existing popular <b>puzzles</b> called permutation <b>puzzles</b> and cyclic <b>puzzles</b> are abstracted and converted into other media such as graphs, blocks, sounds, and robots, while preserving their logic. We implement <b>puzzle</b> generators on different media and variations of generated <b>puzzles</b> are shown. Merits and demerits of new <b>puzzles</b> are evaluated comparing with the original <b>puzzles.</b> This systematic approach can flexibly parameterize and creatively extend the <b>puzzles.</b> リサーチレポート（北陸先端科学技術大学院大学知識科学研究科...|$|R

5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were <b>puzzled</b> by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
5|$|His {{first foray}} into the {{international}} athletics circuit came in 2002, when he attended the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Dublin. Although he was wearing ill-fitting shoes and was somewhat <b>puzzled</b> at hearing a starting gun for the first time, he managed to finish in 30th place {{with a time of}} 36minutes and 37seconds. However, he remained some distance off the winner Kenenisa Bekele. He competed at his first IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in May of that year, finishing just outside the top twenty runners with a time of 1:03:05. He competed on the track at the African Athletics Championships, taking sixth place in the 10,000 metres race in Radès, Tunisia, rounding off a modest debut year.|$|E
5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca).

Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is <b>puzzled</b> to learn that Dylan has no recollection of their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane. Later, in a cryptic conversation, Adam asks Katherine if {{they made a mistake}} in moving back, and Katherine reminds him {{that they did not have}} a choice.|$|E

5|$|Rounding a corner, {{they see}} a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits {{on top of the}} basket for five hours, {{trapping}} the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is <b>puzzled</b> by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{from near}} Santa Fé {{included}} the horse tooth which had <b>puzzled</b> Darwin {{as it had}} been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon tooth and a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of the horse.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 1480 to 1482 has <b>puzzled</b> biographers; {{contradictory}} evidence exists suggesting either that Josquin {{was still in}} France, or {{was already in the}} service of the Sforza family, specifically with Ascanio Sforza, who had been banished from Milan and resided temporarily in Ferrara or Naples. Residence in Ferrara in the early 1480s could explain the Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae, composed for Ercole d'Este, but which stylistically does not fit with the usual date of 1503–4 when Josquin was known to be in Ferrara. Alternatively it has been suggested that Josquin spent some of that time in Hungary, based on a mid-16th-century Roman document describing the Hungarian court in those years, and including Josquin as one of the musicians present.|$|E
