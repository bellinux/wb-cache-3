40|$|Abstract: Collecting all {{failures}} during {{life cycle}} of vehicle is not easy way because its life cycle is normally over 10 years. Warranty period can help gathering failures data because most customers try to repair its failures during warranty period even though small failures. This warranty data, which means failures during warranty period, {{can be a good}} resource to <b>predict</b> initial <b>reliability</b> and permanence reliability. However uncertainty regarding reliability prediction remains because this data is censored. University of Wuppertal and major auto supplier developed the reliability prognosis model considering censored data and this model introduce to <b>predict</b> <b>reliability</b> estimate further “failure candidate”.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} how to {{automatically}} <b>predict</b> <b>reliability</b> of web {{pages in the}} medical domain. Assessing reliability of online medical information is especially critical as it may potentially influence vulnerable patients seeking help online. Unfortunately, there are no automated systems currently available that can classify a medical webpage as being reliable, while manual assessment cannot scale up to process {{the large number of}} medical pages on the Web. We propose a supervised learning approach to automatically <b>predict</b> <b>reliability</b> of medical webpages. We developed a gold standard dataset using the standard reliability criteria defined by the Health on Net Foundation and systematically experimented with different link and content based feature sets. Our experiments show promising results with prediction accuracies of over 80 %. We also show that our proposed prediction method is useful in applications such as reliability-based re-ranking and automatic website accreditation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Accelerated {{degradation}} testing (ADT) {{is usually}} conducted under deterministic stresses such as constant-stress, step-stress, and cyclic-stress. Based on ADT data, an ADT model is developed to <b>predict</b> <b>reliability</b> under normal (field) operating conditions. In engineering applications, the “standard ” approach for reliability prediction {{assumes that the}} normal operating conditions are deterministic or simply uses the mean values of the stresses while ignoring their variability. Such an approach may lead to significant prediction errors. In this paper, we extend an ADT model obtained from constant-stress ADT experiments to <b>predict</b> field <b>reliability</b> by considering the stress variations. A case study is provided to demonstrate the proposed statistical inference procedure. The accuracy of the procedure is verified by simulation using various distributions of field stresses. © 200...|$|R
