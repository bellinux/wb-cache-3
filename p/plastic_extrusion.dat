5000|$|Two-stage, {{where the}} rolls {{produced}} {{in the first stage}} are then processed a second time. For instance, all office stationery (e.g. A4 size in Europe, Letter size in US) is produced in such a process. The complication arises because the machinery in the second stage is narrower than the primary. Efficient utilisation of both stages of production is important (from an energy or material use perspective) and what is efficient for the primary stage may be inefficient for the secondary, leading to trade-offs. Metallised film (used in packaging of snacks), and <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> on paper (used in liquid packaging, e.g. juice cartons) are further examples of such a process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} custom manufactured gene guns (fabricated by Nelson Allen) used a 22 caliber {{nail gun}} cartridge to propel an extruded polyethylene cylinder (bullet) down a 22 cal. Douglas barrel. A droplet of the tungsten powder and genetic material {{was placed on}} the bullet and shot down the barrel at a lexan [...] "stopping" [...] disk with a petri dish below. The bullet welded to the disk and the genetic material blasted into the sample in the dish with a doughnut effect (devastation in the middle, a ring of good transformation and little around the edge). The gun was connected to a vacuum pump and was under vacuum while firing. The early design was put into limited production by a Rumsey-Loomis (a local machine shop then at Mecklenburg Rd in Ithaca, NY, USA). Later the design was refined by removing the [...] "surge tank" [...] and changing to nonexplosive propellants. DuPont added a <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> to the exterior to visually improve the machine for mass production to the scientific community. Biorad contracted with Dupont to manufacture and distribute the device. Improvements include the use of helium propellant and a multi-disk-collision delivery mechanism. Other heavy metals such as gold and silver are also used. Gold may be favored because it has better uniformity than tungsten and tungsten can be toxic to cells, but its use may be limited due to availability and cost.|$|E

The fibers terminate at the top of each extrusion in a manifold. An optical-fiber-light-guide connects the fibers in each manifold to a photo-detector. The photo-detector converts the light signals from the scintillator and optical fibers into electrical impulses for computer analysis. iv TABLE OF CONTENTS [...] ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} process of plastic production since 19 th century. Meanwhile, in <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> process, wide variation in temperature along the extrudate usually leads to scraps formation on the side of finished products. To avoid this situation, {{there is a need to}} deeply understand temperature distribution along the extrudate in <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> process. This work developed an analytical model that predicts the temperature distribution over the billet (the polymers melt) along the extrudate during extrusion process with the limitation that the polymer in question does not cover biopolymer such as DNA. The model was solved and simulated. Results for two different plastic materials (polyvinylchloride and polycarbonate) using self-developed MATLAB code and a commercially developed software (ANSYS) were generated and ultimately compared. It was observed that there is a thermodynamic heat transfer from the entry level of the billet into the die down to the end of it. The graph plots indicate a natural exponential decay of temperature with time and along the die length, with the temperature being 413 K and 474 K for polyvinylchloride and polycarbonate respectively at the entry level and 299. 3 K and 328. 8 K at the exit when the temperature of the surrounding was 298 K. The extrusion model was validated by comparison of MATLAB code simulation with a commercially available ANSYS simulation and the results favourably agree. This work concludes that the developed mathematical model and the self-generated MATLAB code are reliable tools in predicting temperature distribution along the extrudate in <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> process...|$|E

The system is designed with two different control techniques to control temperature at different set point changes and as well as to control sudden input disturbances. The first technique is mamdani type FLC controller and the proposed method is GA based FLC. In order to use a controller it must first be tuned to the system. This tuning synchronizes the controller with the controlled variable, thus allowing the process to keep at its desired operating condition. The simulation study shows that the proposed controller has good set point tracking and disturbances rejection properties. Also it is robust against changes in the system parameters and superior to the Fuzzy controlle...|$|E

The first order {{temperature control}} system in <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> comprises of coupling effects, long delay time and large time constants. Controlling temperature is very difficult as the process is multistage process and the system coupled with each other. In order to conquer this problem the system is premeditated with neuro fuzzy controller using LabVIEW. Approach: The existing technique involved is conventional PID controller, Neural controller, mamdani type Fuzzy Logic Controller and the proposed method is neuro fuzzy controller. Results: Manifest feature of the proposed method is smoothing of undesired control signal of conventional PID, neural controller and mamdani type FLC controller. The software incorporated the LabVIEW graphical programming language and MATLAB toolbox were used to design temperature control in <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> system.

40|$|Abstract. La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) tubular {{membranes}} {{with relative}} density more than 95 % were prepared using <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion</b> method, and their oxygen permeation properties were characterized in steady state. It {{was found that}} the permeation properties were influenced apparently by the sintering temperature for the resulting LSCF membranes. The as prepared LSCF membrane sintered at 1300 oC had a permeation rate by 5 ~ 6 times higher than that sintered at 1250 oC. The XRD results showed that the as prepared LSCF membrane sintered at 1250 oC had the content of impurity more than that sintered at 1300 oC. Namely the reasonable elevation of sintering temperature can reduce the impurity in LSCF membranes, which was produced during green process, and the effect of impurity reduction can improve the transport capability of LSCF membranes made by <b>plastic</b> <b>extrusion...</b>|$|E
