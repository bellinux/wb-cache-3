500|$|After some {{preliminary}} research, Fenwick {{decided to take}} the training as a participant rather than as a professional observer. She paid the $250.00 course fee and enrolled in a four-day est program to examine its methods and its appeal. She reports that the training was an [...] "extraordinary experience", but that she had [...] "serious concerns about the implications of the est phenomenon", and that <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> more about it. The book was first published September 16, 1976, by J. B. Lippincott Company. A second edition was published by Penguin Books in 1977. Fenwick went on to work as director of the Behavioral Medicine Clinic at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, before retiring in 1993 to set up Psybar, an online service to provide psychological experts for court cases.|$|E
2500|$|The final episode {{aired on}} January 13, 2012, with villainess Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick) narrating her {{views about the}} people of Llanview. During the last minutes of the episode, Todd Manning (Howarth) is put under arrest {{for the murder of}} twin brother Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John). The show ends with the {{discovery}} that Victor Lord, Jr. is still alive and has been kidnapped by Perkins. Perkins closes the 43-year-old soap opera by throwing the script of One Life to Live at Victor saying to him: [...] "But why spoil what happens next. You of all <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> things are rarely what they appear". The decision to conclude One Life to Live with an open-ended story is because the serial was supposed to continue on another network at the time the last scenes were taped (see section below).|$|E

[...] Ari Morgenstern, a spokesman for Middle East Truth, denied that it was intended to influence the election result. Gregory Ross, spokesman for the New York-based Clarion Fund stated: [...] "We are not telling people who to vote for, we're just saying no matter who gets in office, the American <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> radical Islam is a real threat to America.

2500|$|Chakraverti {{claimed to}} have cracked the mystic code that shrouds the Konark Sun Temple in Orissa, and its {{curative}} power. After years of research, she made this revelation in a documentary titled The Konark Code, which was premiered at the Nehru Centre in London in February 2008. Her theory was that the temple at Konark was a healing spot, a cure centre for various diseases. King Narasimha Deva started making the temple in 1253 AD and it took him 12 years to complete it. [...] "Myth says that Samba, the son of Krishna, went to the spot to get himself cured of leprosy. Till date, hundreds of leprosy patients flock to the temple to cure themselves. There are other factors that add to the temple's existence as a healing centre." [...] According to Chakraverti, solar rays and sound frequency also played {{an important part in}} healing. The dance that was part of worship was for a purpose. The vibration of the steps of the dancers energized the temple stones. The sun's rays, because of the particular corner in which the temple was constructed, also played an important part. In August, Chakraverti worked on a tele serial for ETV Bangla called Parapaar. The show was based on Chakraverti's life-journey and her encounters with the paranormal. A dramatized story, where actress Chandrayee Ghosh played the part, was aired from Monday to Friday, and on Saturday, Chakraverti herself interacted with audiences through phone-ins related to the story. She commented, [...] "I had reservations when I was approached for Parapaar because it’s important to convey the philosophy and atmosphere in Wicca in the right way. But I feel it’s time to reach Wicca to the masses, and since Bengal is the place where the Mother Goddess Durga is worshipped, it’s important that misconceptions about Dakinividya are shattered. <b>People</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> who a daini is and what she does." ...|$|E
