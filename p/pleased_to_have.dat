5|$|The {{original}} Mrs. Dow's School building {{remains as}} the co-ed residence hall Dow Hall at Pace University. Residents of Briarcliff Manor were initially <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> another educational institution at the site, although Pace illegally turned its 188-spot parking lot into an 800-spot one, and allowed an extensive {{number of cars}} to be parked on the neighboring streets. The village government and school eventually reached a compromise.|$|E
5|$|When Nick and Ashley (now Frankie Fitzgerald) {{reappear}} in Walford, Dot is <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{her family}} around and {{moves out of}} the Fowler household to live with them. However, Nick's feud with Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) causes Ashley's death after Nick cuts the brakes on Mark's motorbike and Ashley steals it and crashes. Dot disowns Nick after Ashley's funeral, having overheard the truth about Ashley's death during an earlier argument between Nick and Mark.|$|E
5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, Richard Taylor {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given free rein on material from The Lord of the Rings universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually {{for the first time}} in the game's cut scenes. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when telling a story, and he was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Weaving on the project as the primary storyteller.|$|E

30|$|Valley splittings are {{important}} in interpreting transport spectroscopy experiment data, where they relate to families of resonances, and in benchmarking other theoretical techniques more capable of actual device modelling.

5|$|Soon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was {{stillborn}} on 31 January 1510. About {{four months}} later, Catherine again became pregnant. On New Year's Day 1511, the child – Henry – was born. After the grief {{of losing their}} first child, the couple were <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a boy and festivities were held, including a two-day joust known as the 1511 Westminster Tournament. However, the child died seven weeks later. Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1514 and 1515, but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl, Mary. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.|$|E
5|$|Xenophon claims that, {{unwilling to}} {{challenge}} Sparta directly, the Thebans instead choose to precipitate a war by encouraging their allies, the Locrians, to collect taxes from territory claimed by both Locris and Phocis. In response, the Phocians invaded Locris, and ransacked Locrian territory. The Locrians appealed to Thebes for assistance, and the Thebans invaded Phocian territory; the Phocians, in turn, appealed to their ally, Sparta, and the Spartans, <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a pretext to discipline the Thebans, ordered general mobilization. A Theban embassy was dispatched to Athens to request support; the Athenians voted to assist Thebes, and a perpetual alliance was concluded between Athens and the Boeotian confederacy.|$|E

Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his {{beautiful}} wife, who are <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explains that the Green Chapel is less than two miles away and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle till then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.|$|E

60|$|The town is in a foam with politics. The {{report is}} that the Lords will throw out the Bill, and now, morning of 8th October, I learn it is quoited downstairs like a shovel-board shilling, with a plague to it, as the most uncalled-for attack upon a free constitution, under which men lived happily, which ever was ventured in my day. Well, it would <b>have</b> been <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had some share in so great a victory, yet even now I am glad I have been quiet. I believe I should only have made a bad figure. Well, I will <b>have</b> time enough <b>to</b> think of all this.|$|R

With help from Jack, Cora manages {{to get in touch with}} Rainie and {{arranges}} to meet her at a pub, but upon arriving, Rainie has sent her sponsor Olivia (Samantha Best), to the pub with a letter. Olivia explains that Rainie has been sober for 41 days and has a boyfriend. Rainie is <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been invited to the wedding but declines to attend, stating that Cora is the reason for her alcohol and drug addictions, requesting that she will leave her alone from now on.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which meant he was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E
5|$|As {{development}} continued, id Software hired {{their former}} Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud {{as an assistant}} artist, and moved the company out to Mesquite, Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ScubaVenture, so that id could focus on Wolfenstein. The game {{was intended to be}} released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day, using {{a modified version of the}} Commander Keen 2D map editor, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a dearth}} of behavioral-sciences-and-law (bsl) {{scholarship}} that employs an international, comparative, or cross-cultural perspective. Traditionally, bsl scholarship is national in its orientation. Thus, it is quite <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> assembled five articles for this “Special Issue on International Perspectives” that address bsl issues from a nontraditional perspective. The four core articles (there also is a “Special Perspective” that the Issue Editors have contributed) in the Special Issue represent the kinds of research, theorizing, and writing that can open the horizons and expand the boundaries of traditional scholarship in the bsl area...|$|R

25|$|Two days later, {{acting on}} {{information}} {{he had received}} of a large privateer cruising in the Bite or off the Skaw, Wood fell in with a large lugger that mounted 16 guns. After a chase of 14 hours, Hound succeeded in shooting away the lugger's main mast and driving her ashore between Robsnout and Hartshall. The wind was driving a heavy sea on the beach {{with the result that}} it soon dashed the lugger to pieces, and probably cost many of the lugger's crew their lives. Wood was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> destroyed his quarry however, as {{she was one of the}} largest and fastest vessels on the coast and when he encountered her was trailing a British convoy from the Baltic.|$|E

60|$|And, {{taking his}} time, {{he cleared his}} throat in {{preparation}} for speech. But before the singular muteness of this family sounds would not come. Finishing his tea, he tremblingly arose. Things that he might have said jostled in his mind. 'Very <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>'a</b> seen you. Hope you're in good health at the present time of speaking. Don't let me intrude on you. We've all a-got to die some time or other!' They remained unuttered. Making a vague movement of his skinny hand, he walked feebly but quickly to the door. When he stood but half-way within the room, he made his final effort.|$|R

Guillory went on {{to appear in the}} BBC production Take a Girl Like You, a television adaptation of Kingsley Amis's novel of the same name.

Guillory was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> played a more innocent character, saying [...] "I've played floozies, psychopaths, assassins, crackheads...
