40|$|The {{authors have}} {{conducted}} {{an evaluation of}} two high efficiency steel filters in the exhaust of an uranium oxide grit blaster at the Y- 12 Plant in Oak Ridge Tennessee. The filters were installed in a specially designed filter housing with a reverse air-pulse cleaning system for automatically cleaning the filters in-place. Previous tests conducted on the same filters and housing at LLNL under controlled conditions using Arizona road dust showed good cleanability with reverse air pulses. Two high efficiency steel filters, containing 64 pleated cartridge elements housed in the standard 2 {prime} x 2 {prime} {times} l{prime} HEPA frame, were evaluated in the filter test housing using a 1, 000 cfm slip stream containing {{a high concentration of}} depleted uranium oxide dust. One filter had the <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridges</b> manufactured to the authors specifications by the Pall Corporation and the other by Memtec Corporation. Test results showed both filters had a rapid increase in pressure drop with time, and reverse air pulses could not decrease the pressure drop. The authors suspected moisture accumulation in the filters was the problem since there were heavy rains during the evaluations, and the pressure drop of the Memtec filter decreased dramatically after passing clean, dry air through the filter and after the filter sat idle for one week. Subsequent laboratory tests on a single filter cartridge confirmed that water accumulation in the filter was responsible for the increase in filter pressure drop and the inability to lower the pressure drop by reverse air pulses. No effort was made to identify the source of the water accumulation and correct the problem because the available funds were exhausted...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{separation}} {{is an integral}} step in biopharmaceutical manufacture with diffusion-limited packed bed chromatography remaining the default choice for industry. Rapid bind-elute separation using convective mass transfer media offers advantages in productivity by operating at high flowrates. Electrospun nanofibre adsorbents are a non-woven fibre matrix of high surface area and porosity previously investigated as a bioseparation medium. The effects of compression and bed layers, and subsequent heat treatment after electrospinning cellulose acetate nanofibres were investigated using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) or carboxylate (COO) functionalisations. Transbed pressures were measured and compared by compression load, COO adsorbents were 30 %, 70 % and 90 % higher than DEAE for compressions 1, 5 and 10 MPa, respectively, which was attributed to the swelling effect of hydrophilic COO groups. Dynamic binding capacities (DBCs) at 10 % breakthrough were measured between 2000 and 12, 000 CV/h (2 s and 0. 3 s residence times) under normal binding conditions, and DBCs increased with reactant concentration from 4 to 12 mg BSA/mL for DEAE and from 10 to 21 mg lysozyme/mL for COO adsorbents. Comparing capacities of compression loads applied after electrospinning showed that the lowest load tested, 1 MPa, yielded the highest DBCs for DEAE and COO adsorbents at 20 mg BSA/mL and 27 mg lysozyme/mL, respectively. At 1 MPa, DBCs were the highest for the lowest flowrate tested but stabilised for flowrates above 2000 CV/h. For compression loads of 5 MPa and 10 MPa, adsorbents recorded lower DBCs than 1 MPa {{as a result of}} nanofibre packing and reduced surface area. Increasing the number of bed layers from 4 to 12 showed decreasing DBCs for both adsorbents. Tensile strengths were recorded to indicate the mechanical robustness of the adsorbent and be related to packing the nanofibre adsorbents in large scale configurations such as <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Compared with an uncompressed adsorbent, compressions of 1, 5 and 10 MPa showed increases of 30 %, 110 % and 110 %, respectively, for both functionalisations. The data presented show that capacity and mechanical strength can be balanced through compression after electrospinning and is particular to different functionalisations. This trade-off is critical to the development of nanofibre adsorbents into different packing configurations for application and scale up in bioseparation...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of {{hazardous}} air pollutants (HAPs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere are serious environmental issues. There were 0. 53 billion kg of HAPs and 15 billion kg of VOCs emitted to the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources during 2004 and 2002, respectively. Eighty-nine percent of those HAPs were emitted from point sources that can be readily captured by techniques such as adsorption. The cost to meet regulations for VOC control during 2010 was estimated at $ 2. 3 billion/yr. Environmental regulations encourage {{the development of new}} technologies to more effectively remove HAPs/VOCs from gas streams at lower cost. Electrothermal Swing Adsorption (ESA), as described here, is a desirable means to control these emissions as it allows for capture, recovery and reuse or disposal of these materials while providing for a more sustainable form of technological development. The Vapor Phase Removal and Recovery System (VaPRRS or ESA-R)) was initially evaluated for possible improvements. An automated bench-scale adsorption device using activated carbon fiber cloth (ACFC) was designed and built to study effects of select independent engineering parameters on the ability of the system to capture and recover an organic vapor (e. g., methyl ethyl ketone, MEK) from air streams. Factors that can increase the adsorbate liquid recovery with low energy costs were investigated using sequentially designed sets of laboratory experiments. Initially, the screening experiments were conducted to determine significant factors influencing the energy efficiency of the desorption process. It was determined that ???concentration of organic vapor???, ???packing density???, and ???maximum heating temperature??? are significant factors while ???nitrogen flow??? and ???heating algorithm??? are insignificant factors in the ranges of values that were evaluated. Experimental data provided from this work were then used as inputs by Kaldate (2005) to complete a response surface methodology using Central Composite Design to optimize the operation of the ESA system in a region where efficient liquid recovery can be achieved. These results were used by Kaldate (2005) {{to reduce the amount of}} power applied per unit mass of ACFC in the vessel and provide a scale-up model of the ESA system. A comparison between experimental bench-scale VaPRRS and a pilot-scale VaPRRS was also completed as part of this research. Results from this effort demonstrated that both the bench-scale and pilot-scale ESA systems had removal efficiencies of MEK > 98 %. The average electrical energy per unit mass of recovered liquid MEK was 4. 6 kJ/g and 18. 3 kJ/g for the bench unit and pilot unit, respectively. A new concentration controlled desorption device, known as ESA-Steady State Tracking (ESA-SS) desorption, was also designed and built as a bench-scale laboratory device as part of this research. This new system was demonstrated to operate over a wide range of conditions (i. e., type of organic vapor, concentration of organic vapor, ratio of desorption/adsorption cycle gas flow rates, fixed and dynamic desorption concentration set-points, constant and variable inlet concentration of organic vapor, batch and cyclic modes, and with dry and humid gas streams). It was shown that concentration of organic vapor that is generated during regeneration cycles can readily be controlled at concentration set-points for three organic compounds (MEK, acetone, and toluene). The average absolute errors (AAEs) were < 5 % when comparing the set-point and the measured outlet vapor concentrations. This is the first time that such performance has been demonstrated and this performance is not possible with other current technologies. Such capability of the system allows a secondary control device to be optimized for select constant concentrations and much lower gas flow rates (e. g., 5 % of the gas flow rate during the adsorption cycle) that is not possible without such pretreatment. An ESA-Concomitant Adsorption and Desorption (CAD) system was also developed as part of this research to readily control its outlet organic vapor concentration as the entire inlet gas stream passes through the CAD system. This bench-scale system adsorbed organic vapor from a gas stream and simultaneously heated the adsorbent using direct electrothermal energy to desorb the organic vapor at user-selected set-point outlet concentrations. CAD achieved a high degree of concentration stabilization with a mean relative deviation between set-point concentration and measured outlet vapor concentration of 0. 3 % to 0. 4 %. The CAD system was also evaluated to treat a humid gas stream (inlet relative humidity = 85 %) that contained a variable organic vapor concentration. CAD operated successfully at high inlet relative humidity conditions because the water vapor did not adsorb but penetrated through the adsorbent because of local warming of the adsorbent. Computational fluid dynamics was used for the first time to model the three-dimensional (3 -D) pressure drop, flow patterns, and heat transfer in an adsorption vessel with annular cartridges of ACFC. It was demonstrated that pressure drop and velocity contours are very uniform (e. g., within 5 %) in the porous zones of the ACFC cartridges within the vessel. The main pressure drop across the vessel is due to the ACFC cartridges. It was also demonstrated that electrothermal heating is much more energy efficient than heating with hot inert gas such as air. These results support the use of 1 -D or 2 -D modeling regarding mass and energy transfer in the ACFC while achieving sufficient accuracy. A fundamental mathematical model for simulation of ESA was also developed and evaluated. The model consists of: a) material balances for organic vapors in the adsorption vessel and b) energy balances for the adsorbent, carrier gas, vapor, and fittings. The model predicts outlet vapor concentrations, temperature profiles, power requirements, voltage requirements, and current requirements for ESA desorption cycles. The model is very helpful in the initial stages of design of an ESA system to reduce cost and time and to more effectively evaluate experimental results pertaining to energy and material balances. Future work that should occur includes the development and testing of VaPRRS, SST, and CAD at the full-scale. Results from these tests can then be used to compare these technologies to existing air quality control technologies and to evaluate these new systems under more realistic field conditions that exist in the laboratory. CFD simulations can also be developed and implemented to consider mass transfer within the adsorption vessels and to consider new adsorbent geometries, such as <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridges</b> in rectangular enclosures. ESA VaPRRS/SST/CAD should also be developed for indoor air quality control applications. Such technologies have the potential to remove particulate matter, organic gases, and biological materials from indoor air streams...|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to develop and {{validate}} a computer model for the design of <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> filters. Mathematical modelling of incompressible creeping flow and low permeability Darcy flow are well established and a number of reliable schemes for the simulation of these regimes are available in the literature. In the context of the present studies a computer model for modelling of combined Stokes/Darcy flows encountered in <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> filters has been developed. A two-dimensional simulation code that can model fluid hydrodynamics in permeable media as in dead-end <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> filters has been developed in FORTRAN. The developed code named as ACFAMP- Aircraft Cartridge Filter Analysis Modelling Program has been used to evaluate the performance and design of <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> filter elements. The governing equations of the flow model can be well represented by the Continuity, Stokes and Darcy equations respectively. Viscosity variations and non-Newtonian effects have been introduced to model the behaviour of shear-thickening fluids used in aircraft hydraulic circuits. The governing equations of the flow model are solved by using a weighted residuals finite element method. Two separate modelling approaches have been adopted in the model development. The first approach is based on modelling of flow through porous media by employing a slightly compressible form of continuity equation utilising nine-noded Lagrangian elements for domain discretisation in conjunction with a U-V -P finite element scheme. The second strategy is based on modelling of coupled Free/Porous regimes making the model industrially complaint. This scheme utilises the stabilised C 0 continuous Taylor-Hood element, which generates stable solutions for incompressible flows without any problems of numerical locking. Initial numerical experiments were based on simple geometries and the complexity of the geometries was finally extended to model the <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> filters. A permeability model that interprets medium compression effects and which is based on data obtained from flat sheets of the filter material used in the fabrication of the filter cartridge is incorporated within the main model. During pleating, bending and creasing the medium deforms and leads to a loss of permeability and/or effective filtering area results. The combined effects of compression and reduction in filtration area cause deviations from Darcy's law. The effects of medium compression, pleat deformation and pleat crowding have also been analysed. The present work is directed towards the prediction of accurate values of compression factors and percentage losses in the filtration area, which assist in designing <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> filter elements. The simulated results have been compared against the experimental data for purposes of validation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

As current scale-up techniques use the flat sheet membrane to predict the performance of the large-scale <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge,</b> the discrepancy in performance between flat sheet and <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> leads to inaccuracy in scale-up. This inaccuracy is accounted for by over-sizing of the equipment. In turn this reduces the efficiency of the bioprocess and increases capital costs. At the present time no accurate and reliable scale-up methodology exists that accounts for the effects of pleating. A systematic investigation into the effect of pleating has been conducted. By varying the key pleat characteristics: pleat height, type and packing density, the impact upon cartridge performance of these characteristics has been determined. Using this knowledge, new scale-down cartridge filters have been developed, fabricated and tested. When faced with both clean water and a pepsin protein solution, performance was within 10...|$|R

40|$|The {{cylindrical}} filters presently used in < 1000 m 2 {{drip irrigation}} systems are frequently clogged, increasing pressure loss and lowering the flow rate through the filters.

This proposed system is compatible with existing drip irrigation systems and could be made inexpensively with plastic bottle manufacturing equipment. To compare the proposed design to off-the-shelf options, a drip irrigation test setup was built to measure the pressure loss across different filters as particles accumulated. These experiments confirmed that <b>pleated</b> <b>cartridge</b> filters, with high effective surface area, incurred lower pressure losses than cylindrical filters. These tests revealed that the greatest reason for clogged performance was that filtered particles (not the cartridge filter itself) eventually restricted {{the flow of water}} through the system. This inspired the redesign of the filter housing such that the housing extended far below the filter, providing a catch basin away from the filter for the particles to settle. Fixing the filter independently of the bottom casing significantly improved the overall performance of the filtration system, reduced the maintenance requirement necessary from the user, and would enable inexpensive manufacturing via blow molding.

The filter system was subdivided into a number of smaller regions, so that the individual contribution of each region to the overall pressure loss could be evaluated. It is concluded that at higher flow rates the contribution of the filter-housing geometry to the overall pressure drop is much more than that of the filter cartridge. Simple correlations for estimating pressure drop of the heavy-duty filter system are derived from the results of the numerical model experiments. Finally, the use of computational fluid dynamics as a filter-housing design tool is demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have made}} further {{progress}} {{in developing a}} cleanable steel fiber HEPA filter. We fabricated a <b>pleated</b> cylindrical <b>cartridge</b> using commercially available steel fiber media that is made with 1 {mu}m stainless steel fibers and sintered into a sheet form. Test results at the Department of Energy (DOE) Filter Test Station at Oak Ridge show the prototype filter cartridge has 99. 99 % efficiency for 0. 3 {mu}m dioctyl phthalate (DOP) aerosols and a pressure drop of 1. 5 inches. Filter loading and cleaning tests using AC Fine dust showed the filter could be repeatedly cleaned using reverse air pulses. Our analysis of commercially optimized filters suggest that cleanable steel HEPA filters {{need to be made}} from steel fibers less than 1 {mu}m, and preferably 0. 5 {mu}m, to meet the standard HEPA filter requirements in production units. We have demonstrated that 0. 5 {mu}m steel fibers can be produced using the fiber bundling and drawing process. The 0. 5 {mu}m steel fibers are then sintered into small filter samples and tested for efficiency and pressure drop. Test results on the sample showed a penetration of 0. 0015 % at 0. 3 {mu}m and a pressure drop of 1. 15 inches at 6. 9 ft/min (3. 5 cm/s) velocity. Based on these results, steel fiber media can easily meet the requirements of 0. 03 % penetration and 1. 0 inch of pressure drop by using less fibers in the media. A cost analysis of the cleanable steel HEPA filter shows that, although the steel HEPA filter costs much more than the standard glass fiber HEPA filter, {{it has the potential to}} be very cost effective because of the high disposal costs of contaminated HEPA filters. We estimate that the steel HEPA filter will save an average of $ 16, 000 over its 30 year life. The additional savings from the clean-up costs resulting from ruptured glass HEPA filters during accidents was not included but makes the steel HEPA filter even more cost effective. We also present the results of our evaluation of competing technologies with metallic and ceramic powder filters, ceramic fiber falters, and reinforced glass fiber filters. In general, the metallic and ceramic powder filters have pressure drops in excess of 25 inches of water for HEPA grade efficiencies and are therefore not viable candidates. The ceramic fiber filters cannot meet the HEPA efficiency because the fiber diameters are too large. The reinforced glass fiber filter is a promising candidate for the cleanable HEPA filter but requires additional development and testing to confirm its potential to be repeatedly cleaned. This report is based upon material extracted from a DOE technical review of the Mixed Waste Integrated Program and from the final report of a systems analysis of cleanable steel HEPA filters...|$|R
