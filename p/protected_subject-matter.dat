40|$|In Article 3 of the “Proposal for a Directive on {{copyright}} in the Digital Single Market COM(2016) 593 final” the European Commission {{suggests an}} exception for text and data mining (TDM). While, in principle, a clear legal framework for TDM is to be welcomed, the proposed provisions are to be criticized regarding their scope and the applied regulatory method. This Position Statement develops an alternative proposal: Since TDM is {{to be seen as}} a normal use of works and other <b>protected</b> <b>subject-matter,</b> a field exemption is suggested allowing everyone to carry out TDM related to lawfully accessible works or other subject-matter. This includes the permission to extract contents of databases and to make reproductions for the sole purpose of TDM. Moreover, research organizations also need to carry out TDM regarding content to which they do not have lawful access. The proposal includes a specific provision obliging rightholders who market works or other subject-matter primarily for research purposes to provide datasets suitable for TDM only, for which they may request a reasonable payment...|$|E
40|$|Statutory {{licenses}} {{with reference}} to the broadcasting of sports events This thesis is focused on the topic of statutory licenses {{with reference to}} the broadcasting of sports events. As mentioned right {{at the beginning of the}} thesis, the statutory licenses belong together with the free use and compulsory licenses to the extra-contractual institutes. They enable any third person, while meeting statutory requirements, the use of a copyright work or a subject-matter of related rights without a consent of the rightholder. The main reason why they were introduced into the international, European and national legal systems, was especially the endeavour to achieve a fair balance of rights and interests between different categories of rightholders and users of <b>protected</b> <b>subject-matters.</b> The crucial document on the European level in the field of treatment of exceptions and limitations to the rights is the Directive 2001 / 29 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society which provides a comprehensive list of one mandatory and twenty facultative exceptions and limitations, as well as the so-called three-step test. This Directive is closely discussed throughout the whole thesis. Nevertheless, the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Aboriginal {{peoples in}} Canada have diverse and complex {{customary}} protocols regarding {{a wide range}} of intangible property. These customary protocols have operated within the distinctive Aboriginal cultures, often being critical aspects of Aboriginal economic, social and ceremonial life. In this paper we describe specific, concrete examples of customary protocols respecting intangible property in four of the major Aboriginal cultural regions of Canada: Northwest Coast (Kwakwaka’wakw and Coast Salish), Subarctic (Carrier), Arctic (Inuit) and Plains (Blackfoot, Blood and Peigan, as well as the nearby Crow and Hidatsa Native American Tribes). In this description, we investigated the published ethnographic literature to attempt to detail the following: • Purpose of the relevant customary protocols regarding intangible property • Scope of <b>subject-matter</b> <b>protected</b> by customary protocols • Scope of rights and responsibilities or obligations with respect to the customary protocols • Describing which individuals or social groups are generally the holders / custodians/ owners of rights / powers and responsibilities • Procedures for acquiring and sharing rights / responsibilitie...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, U. S. {{courts have}} {{recognized}} that a wide (and potentially limitless) range of subject matter may act as a trademark. These developments arguably comport both with a contemporary (global) consumer who is less reliant on linguistic forms of communication and with postmodern scholarship regarding the varied sources and development of meaning. This article addresses how trademark law should adapt to the reality that consumers identify and distinguish products using a range of symbols other than the traditional forms of words and pictorial images. I contend that, in order to regulate effectively the present-day marketplace, trademark law must recognize the limitless sources of meaning. But while nontraditional subject-matter may equally identify a product?s source, protecting that nontraditional matter as a trademark may give rise to very different consequences than <b>protecting</b> traditional trademark <b>subject-matter</b> such as words. If ontological restrictions upon trademark subject-matter are removed, {{a new set of}} limits must prudently be established if trademark protection is not to spawn adverse competitive effects from overprotection. I suggest that such limits can be found by tethering trademark law directly to its limited purposes, and by grounding protection not in over-generalized assumptions about classes of subject matter, but rather in the real present-day impact of particular symbols in society. The Article explores this (teleological model) through the vehicle of the nontraditional subject-matter generating the most trademark litigation and the most critical thinking, namely, product design features. The article systematizes the growing body of trade dress case law and scholarship and highlights the different premises that I detect underlying divergent schools of thought. I argue that the Supreme Court is cautiously moving, albeit without any express recognition, toward a postmodern vision of marketplace symbols, and that its recent opinions represent an incipient version of the teleological model that I espouse. Finally, I exemplify the operation of the teleological model by applying its lessons to the issue of functionality. Applying the teleological model to various hotly-debated aspects of the functionality doctrine leads me to endorse adoption of a transparent, purposive analysis of 2 ̆ 2 competitive need 2 ̆ 2 as the measure of functionality rather than any single doctrinal formulation. That inquiry, I argue, should be particularized and applied without categorical differentiation between aesthetic and utilitarian features. I also reject the prevailing view that a finding of functionality should foreclose the grant of any relief to a plaintiff producer, finding it insufficiently cognizant of the costs of confusingly similar source-identifying designs in an increasingly visual society. Instead, I propose that courts should explore the possibility of conditioning a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s right to copy a functional design on compliance with labeling or other requirements that minimize consumer confusion. Moderating the consequence for plaintiffs of a finding of functionality should embolden courts to apply a rigorous functionality analysis to a greater range of design features. An ontologically unlimited approach to trademark subject-matter sits well with our postmodern condition; but, in order to avoid over-protection, it must be accompanied by a heightened regard for the policy concerns embodied in the functionality doctrine...|$|R
