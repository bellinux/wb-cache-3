Data collected by the two Indian nanosatellites—the INS-1A and INS-1B—will be used by ISRO's Space Applications Centre and the Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems. The Dove satellites from the US are used to photograph the Earth for commercial, environmental, and humanitarian purposes. Eight LEMUR satellites, weighing [...] each, carried two different payloads, namely SENSE for vessel tracking purposes and STRATOS for atmospheric measurements. Al Farabi-1 satellite built by the students of Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Nayif-1 satellite built by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, Dubai, and PEASSS satellite built by an all-European consortium of Partners, are technology demonstrator satellites whereas DIDO-2 built by SpacePharma from Switzerland is a micro-research satellite. BGUSAT (Ben Gurion University SATellite) built by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in cooperation with Ben Gurion University is designed as a research satellite. The satellites objectives are to explore atmospheric and weather phenomena in the infrared wavelength by imaging atmospheric gaseous contents and atmospheric glow.|$|E

5000|$|The {{space segment}} of the TDRSS {{constellation}} is the most dynamic part of the system. Even with nine satellites on orbit, the system provides support with three <b>primary</b> <b>satellites,</b> while using the rest as on-orbit spares capable of immediate usage as primaries. The original TDRSS design had two <b>primary</b> <b>satellites,</b> designated TDE, for [...] "east", and TDW, for [...] "west" [...] and one on-orbit spare. The surge in user requirements during the 1980s allowed NASA to expand the network {{with the addition of}} more satellites, with some being co-located in a particularly busy orbital slot. See Tracking and Data Relay Satellite for more details on the satellites.|$|R
5000|$|A giant galaxy {{interacting}} with its satellites is common. A satellite's gravity could attract {{one of the}} primary's spiral arms, or the secondary satellite's path could coincide with {{the position of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>satellite's</b> and so would dive into the primary galaxy (the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy into the Milky Way being an example of the latter). That can possibly trigger a small amount of star formation. Such orphaned clusters of stars were sometimes referred to as [...] "blue blobs" [...] before they were recognized as stars.|$|R
2500|$|The USAF {{describes}} the Predator as a [...] "Tier II" [...] MALE UAS (medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft system). The UAS {{consists of four}} aircraft or [...] "air vehicles" [...] with sensors, a ground control station (GCS), and a <b>primary</b> <b>satellite</b> link communication suite. Powered by a Rotax engine and driven by a propeller, the air vehicle can fly up to [...] to a target, loiter overhead for 14hours, then return to its base.|$|E
2500|$|Each Predator air vehicle can be {{disassembled}} {{into six}} main components and loaded into a container nicknamed [...] "the coffin." [...] This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station {{and it is}} designed to roll into a C-130 Hercules. The Predator <b>primary</b> <b>satellite</b> link consists of a 6.1-meter (20-ft) satellite dish and associated support equipment. The satellite link provides communications between the ground station and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and is a link to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system needs 1,500 by 40meters (5,000 by 125ft) of hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to each end from the ground control station to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed to be located on the same airfield.|$|E

50|$|KH-11 {{satellites}} are {{in either}} of two standard planes in Sun-synchronous orbits. As shadows help to discern ground features, satellites in a standard plane east of a noon/midnight orbit observe the ground at local afternoon hours, while satellites in a western plane observe the ground at local morning hours. Historically launches have therefore been timed to occur either about two hours before or one hour after local noon (or midnight), respectively. The orbits are such that ground-tracks repeat after {{a certain number of}} days, currently each 4 days for the <b>primary</b> <b>satellites</b> in the East and West orbital plane.|$|R

50|$|Carpenter ants work {{to build}} the nests that house eggs in environments with usually high {{humidity}} due to their sensitivity to environmental humidity. These nests are called <b>primary</b> nests. <b>Satellite</b> nests are constructed once the primary nest is established and has begun to mature. Residents of satellite nests include older larvae, pupae, and some winged individuals. Only eggs, the newly hatched larvae, workers, and the queen reside in the <b>primary</b> nests. As <b>satellite</b> nests do not have environmentally sensitive eggs, the ants can construct them in rather diverse locations that can actually be relatively dry. Some species, like Camponotus vagus, builds the nest in a dry place, usually in wood.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAmbiguity {{resolution}} "on-the-fly" {{procedures are}} designed to deliver in real time the integer biases that give full access to the accurate pseudorange information contained within the GPS carrier phase measurements. The key performance parameters of these procedures are their time of convergence and error rate, usually estimated from experience but rarely analytically determined. Using results derived for a multiple hypotheses sequential test called the M-ary Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MSPRT), this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the performance parameters of the Maximum A Posteriori Ambiguity Search (MAPAS) procedure. In particular, expressions of bounds and asymptotic values of the expected stopping time and error probability of MAPAS are determined as functions of the decision threshold, thus providing a means to control the performances. This study shows {{the influence of the}} number of satellites as well as the importance of the mode of selection of the <b>primary</b> <b>satellites.</b> The figures obtained are checked against observed values, showing the validity of the determined bounds and the consistency of the asymptotic values, although they lack accuracy when the number of satellites is low...|$|R

40|$|The present work on radial {{electric}} field induced jet breakup {{is an extension}} of our recent work (Lakdawala et al., 20150) on surface tension force induced jet breakup. A Dual Grid Level Set Method (DGLSM) based numerical study on the non-linear breakup of viscous liquid jets immersed in another viscous fluid under radial {{electric field}} is carried out in this work. This leads {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanism of electrocapillary jet breakup and subsequent formation of <b>primary</b> and <b>satellite</b> drops, due to the temporal growth of surface perturbation. The influence of the electrical Bond number (B-oe) and Reynolds number (Re) on the growth rate, the breakup time, the volume of the <b>primary</b> and <b>satellite</b> drops, and the charge of both <b>primary</b> and <b>satellite</b> drops is analyzed. An excellent agreement of the present numerical with the published analytical results is obtained for different Reynolds numbers (Re = 10, 100), wave numbers (0 < k <= 1) and electric Bond number (0 < B-oe < 4). The results show that electrostatic stresses stabilize the long waves and destabilize the short waves which are in accord with linear stability theory: confirming the robustness of our DGLSM method in simulating two-phase electrohydrodynamic flow. The results indicate that nonlinear contribution from the electrostatic force is very important in analyzing the mechanism of satellite formation. The numerical results reveal that the satellite formation as well as the breakup time is affected significantly when the effect of conduction is weak. For large conduction, the evolution of the thread is close to those obtained for a perfectly conducting core fluid. Finally, we numerically show that the local dynamics may be altered when the conduction is weak compared to the perfect conductor limit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
