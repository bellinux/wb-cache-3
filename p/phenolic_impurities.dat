40|$|Chemically {{surface-modified}} (tosyl-functionalized) carbon nanoparticles (Emperor 2000 from Cabot Corp.) {{are employed}} for the extraction and electrochemical determination of <b>phenolic</b> <b>impurities</b> such as benzophenone- 3 (2 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxybenzophenone) or triclosan (5 -chloro- 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenol). The hydrophilic carbon nanoparticles are readily suspended and separated by centrifugation prior to deposition onto suitable electrode surfaces and voltammetric analysis. Voltammetric peaks provide concentration information over a 10 - 100 mu M range {{and an estimated}} limit of detection of ca. 10 mu M (or 2. 3 ppm) for benzophenone- 3 and ca. 20 mu M (or 5. 8 ppm) for triclosan. Alternatively, analyte-free carbon nanoparticles immobilized at a graphite or glassy carbon electrode surface and directly immersed in analyte solution bind benzophenone- 3 and triclosan (both with an estimated Langmuirian binding constants of K approximate to 6000 mol(- 1) dm(3) at pH 9. 5) and they also give characteristic voltammetric responses (anodic for triclosan and cathodic for benzophenone- 3) with a linear range of ca. 1 - 120 mu M. The estimated limit of detection is improved to ca. 5 mu M (or 1. 2 ppm) for benzophenone- 3 and ca. 10 mu M (or 2. 3 ppm) for triclosan. Surface functionalization is discussed {{as the key to}} further improvements in extraction and detection efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Modified {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) composite membranes {{in which}} a known mol% of the SiMe groups were replaced by a short methylene spacer group terminated {{by one of the}} four side-arm functional groups, acetate, -CO 2 Me; ethylether, OEt; dimethylamino, -NMe 2; and pyridyl, -py; were fabricated and tested in short term trials for the pervaporative recovery of cresols from aq. soln. The influences of functional group type, functional group loading, pH, temp. and purity of the feed soln. were investigated. Three com. available hydrophobic membranes were also examd. for comparison. It was found that significant performance enhancements, compared with an unfunctionalized PDMS membrane, were realized for all functionalized PDMS membranes, with dimethylamino and ethylether functionalities proving the most effective. A functional group loading level close to 20 % was found to be optimal for this application, The influence of feed pH in the range of 5 - 8. 5 was small on total flux but significant on selectivity for amine loaded membranes. By contrast, the effect of feed temp. was significant on total flux but negligible on selectivity. Low levels of <b>phenolic</b> <b>impurities</b> in a p-cresol feed soln. were found to have negligible effect on the sepn. Compared with com. available zeolite filled PDMS and PEBA membranes, the functionalized PDMS membranes showed a better overall performance. The PV performance of all new membranes followed the trend: o-cresol > p-cresol > phenol. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, the {{performance}} of copper naphthenate as a wood preservative has been in question. To understand the varying results of copper naphthenate in preventing wood decay, {{a closer look at}} eight naphthenic acid (NA) supplies was undertaken. Initial studies of NA samples from individual suppliers revealed large differences in chemical composition and wood preservation ability. Samples were rated from best to worst determined by percent weight loss due to fungal activity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that one of the intermediate quality wood preservatives from our wood decay studies contains a large portion of <b>phenolic</b> and aliphatic <b>impurities</b> in addition to the naphthenic acid components. To determine the effect of the impurities on the efficacy studies, we developed a method using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to remove them from the sample without changing the characteristics of the naphthenic acid composition. Comparison of NA SFE extracts continues. Background Copper naphthenate {{has been used as a}} wood preservative since the 1940 ’s, but has not been used as extensively as other preservatives such as penta chlorophenol, creosote, and chromated copper ars...|$|R
