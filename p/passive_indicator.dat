This is crucial for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to anticipate problems. Quality is subjective, and the complexity of today's pages challenges its measurement. OnLoad time and SpeedIndex are notable attempts to quantify web performance. However, these metrics are computed using browser instrumentation and, thus, are not available to ISPs. PAIN (<b>PAssive</b> <b>INdicator)</b> is an automatic system to observe the performance of web pages at ISPs. It leverages passive flow-level and DNS measurements which are still available in the network despite the deployment of HTTPS. With unsupervised learning, PAIN automatically creates a model from the timeline of requests issued by browsers to render web pages, and uses it to analyze the web performance in real-time. We compare PAIN to indicators based on in-browser instrumentation and find strong correlations between the approaches. It reflects worsening network conditions and provides visibility into web performance for ISPs...|$|E

40|$|Inefficient mixing in {{stirred vessels}} at low Reynolds numbers {{has been studied}} {{extensively}} over recent years. This paper investigates the mixing effects of square wave modulation protocol on isolated mixing regions (IMRs) in a stirred vessel using a Newtonian fluid. Glycerin was agitated using a standard six-bladed Rushton turbine inside an unbaffled tank. The impeller speed was modulated using a square wave protocol at two fixed amplitudes: A 1 = 20 (Re{max} = 60 to Re{min} = 40) and A 2 = 30 (Re{max} = 60 to Re{min} = 30) with different wave periods of 10 s and 40 s. The IMR structures was determined using a non-intrusive technique based on direct visualisation of an acid-base reaction with fluorescent green dye as a <b>passive</b> <b>indicator.</b> The volume of the IMR structures was determined using digital images taken during the mixing process. It was found that laminar mixing under Re < 100 could be enhanced by modulating the amplitude and also the wave period. It was also discovered that the IMR structures could be destroyed easily within Nt{m} (dimensionless mixing time) < 150 for upper envelope (UE) volume and Nt{m} < 463 for lower envelope (LE) volume using square wave protocol with shortest wave period and larger amplitude, thus producing a better mixing performance...|$|E
40|$|The isoprostane 8 -iso-PGF 2 α {{proved to}} be a {{valuable}} marker of conditions associated with oxidative stress in all three clinical studies (I-III). Somewhat surprising, no significant correlation with myocardial reperfusion events was found. Only the duration of severe ischemia correlated positively in patients with AMI undergoing primary PCI (II). Thus the first aim of this thesis was partly fulfilled. A particular finding was that other conditions than myocardial ischemia-reperfusion such as interventional (I) and surgical (III) traumas contributed to an apparent oxidative stress in the patient groups. In parallel, pro- or antioxidant drug effects seemed to have influenced the release pattern of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, underlining the versatility of this parameter of lipid peroxidation. The second aim of the thesis, to establish a relationship between oxidative stress and myocardial injury, was not fulfilled. Thus the present studies I-III seem to refute the hypothesis of a major ROS-involvement in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injuries as shown in animal experiments. Another interpretation is that an oxidation-injury relationship was masked in the more complex pathophysiology of a clinical setting. A further implication may be that 8 -iso-PGF 2 α behaved as a <b>passive</b> <b>indicator</b> of successful reperfusion rather than as an active indicator of severe and injury-inducing oxidative stress, reflecting the role as a ROS-imprint and not as an injury marker. The third aim of the thesis, to try out potent antioxidants on a rational basis, did not materialize as the studies went on. However, in the course of time new mechanisms of cardioactive or adjunctive drugs were recognized. Thus both ASA and heparin are two candidates which may have had a major impact on the results in all three studies. Concerning ASA both positive effects of an acute booster dose (II) and negative effects of withdrawal (III) warrant further attention. Although the study is limited by the low numbers of patients, it seems justified to suggest that the lack of success in translating principles of oxidative stress and antioxidant therapy from the experimental to the clinical stage of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion may now have found a more plausible explanation than hitherto proposed. Thus oxidative stress, if present, is a multifactorial process with complex interactions between pro- and antioxidant factors and with largely unrecognized protection by drugs in common use. </p...|$|E
5000|$|A carbon {{monoxide}} detector or CO detector is {{a device that}} detects {{the presence of the}} {{carbon monoxide}} (CO) gas in order to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. In the late 1990s Underwriters Laboratories (UL) changed their definition of a single station CO detector with a sound device in it to a carbon monoxide (CO) alarm. This applies to all CO safety alarms that meet UL 2034; however for <b>passive</b> <b>indicators</b> and system devices that meet UL 2075, UL refers to these as carbon monoxide detectors. CO is a colorless, tasteless and odorless compound produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials.

Elevated levels of CO can be dangerous to humans depending on the amount present and length of exposure. Smaller concentrations can be harmful over longer periods of time while increasing concentrations require diminishing exposure times to be harmful.|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{vaccine is}} needed to control the spread of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1). An in vitro assay that can predict the protection induced by a vaccine would facilitate the development of such a vaccine. A potential candidate would be an assay to quantify neutralization of HIV- 1. Methods and Findings: We have used sera from rhesus macaques that have been immunized with HIV candidate vaccines and subsequently challenged with simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). We compared neutralization assays with different formats. In experiments with the standardized and validated TZMbl assay, neutralizing antibody titers against homologous SHIVSF 162 P 4 pseudovirus gave a variable correlation with reductions in plasma viremia levels. The target cells used in the assays are not just <b>passive</b> <b>indicators</b> of virus infection but are {{actively involved in the}} neutralization process. When replicating virus was used with GHOST cell assays, events during the absorption phase, as well as the incubation phase, determine the level of neutralization. Sera that are associated with protection have properties that are closest to the traditional concept of neutralization: the concentration of antibody present during the absorption phase has no effect on the inactivation rate. In GHOST assays, events during the absorption phase may inactivate a fixed number, rather than a proportion, of virus so that while complete neutralization can be obtained, it can only be found at low doses particularly with isolates that are relatively resistant to neutralization...|$|R
40|$|In June 2008 the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General {{announced}} their Justice on Target strategy {{to reduce the}} amount of time and number of appearances required to resolve a case in the Ontario criminal court system. The premise put forth by this strategy suggested that the structural and administrative changes implemented by the Ministry would elicit greater court efficiency. However, this belief is in contradiction to recent research on court delay which suggests that such changes are only effective when there is a court culture in place that supports such practices. This new literature emphasizes the central importance of a local informal discretionary system of expectations, norms and relationships on the efficiency of case processing. This thesis examines the possible relationship between court culture and court efficiency. Through a comparison of two Eastern Ontario bail courts, this study explores a number of cultural characteristics of both an efficient and less inefficient court that have been identified in previous research on court culture, most notably Leverick & Duff's (2002) analysis of passive and proactive Scottish magistrate courts. In particular, detailed qualitative and quantitative data were gathered for this purpose through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. The study found that the efficient court had more proactive indicators and the inefficient court had more <b>passive</b> <b>indicators.</b> This finding suggests that courts of varying efficiency have distinct cultures and that Leverick & Duff's passive-proactive typology is an effective tool for measuring court culture in Ontario bail courts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{notion of}} work {{alienation}} {{and its consequences}} has fascinated scholars and practitioners for a long time. But most research focused on <b>passive</b> performance <b>indicators</b> (such as job satisfaction), while the effects on work alienation on active performance (work effort) and outside work are understudied. This paper therefore examines the impact of work alienation on passive performance (organizational commitment), active performance (work effort), and its impact outside work (workfamily enrichment). Hypotheses are formulated based on two research streams: sociology of work and organization in relation to work alienation and work-family literature in relation to enrichment. Two dimensions of work alienation are considered: powerlessness and meaninglessness. Both literature streams expect a negative impact of work alienation on employee outcomes. Hypotheses are tested on survey data collected among a national sample of midwives in the Netherlands (respondents: 790, response rate 61 %). Findings indicate that work alienation does not only {{have an impact on}} passive performance, but also on active performance and outside work. In particular work meaninglessness is relevant for outcomes. This underscores the importance of lowering the degree of work alienation, which has effects inside and outside the work context...|$|R

This model has clear active and <b>passive</b> performance <b>indicators</b> and includes technical guidance during consultation {{as well as the}} exit mechanism after consultation. This consultation model enables small- and medium-sized enterprises to achieve environmental improvements with minimum investment. Companies that improved after consultation have a mean ethylene oxide exposure concentration, for the time weighted average, that dropped from 7. 36 ± 16. 88 ppm to 0. 76 ± 1. 35 ppm (p< 0. 01). In addition, the overall company compliant item ratio for regulations increased from 34. 1 % to 89. 7 %. The above results demonstrate the integrated occupational health consultation model assists small- and medium-sized enterprises in reducing exposure concentrations at operational sites. Our results further demonstrate the feasibility of successfully implementing the proposed consultation model within Taiwan’s medical supply manufacturing industry...|$|R
40|$|Human-animal {{relationships}} have long existed, across cultures, in many varied forms. The associations {{between the two}} are integral to the creation, form, use and perception of landscapes and environments. Despite this, animals are all too often absent from our views of ancient landscapes. Humans experience their diverse environments {{through a variety of}} media, and animals regularly {{play an important role in}} this type of exchange. Landscape archaeology commonly emphasises the influences of humanity upon the physical world. However, such engagement is rarely unilateral. Whether herding domesticated mammals, hunting quarry, or merely experiencing the range of fauna which populate the world, many of these interactions leave physical traces in the landscape: the form and location of settlements, enclosures, pathways, woodland, pasture, and meadows. Also, in more subtle ways, human and animal actors work together in performances through which people subconsciously generate their perceptions of landscape and environment. These physical and psychological animal landscapes have the potential to inform on human society and ideology. This thesis seeks to utilise zoo archaeological evidence to examine this concept. Animalscape research could be applied to any place or period but as a case study this project will explore, through animal bone analysis, how landscape and environment were used to negotiate cultural identity during the Iron Age/Romano-British transition, a pivotal but poorly understood period in British history. Research focuses on a c. 200 km 2 area of land bordering the West Sussex coast. This is a complex and singular locale, encompassing a number of Iron Age and Romano-British sites - most notably the elite settlement at Fishbourne which originated in the late Iron Age and developed, towards the end of the 1 st century AD, into the largest 'Roman-style' domestic building north of the Alps. The site has been excavated a number of times in different areas since its discovery in 1960 until 2002; the various investigations producing a large quantity of animal bone. Yet this has, until now however, only been subjected to piecemeal analysis. The full re-analysis of the Fishbourne faunal assemblage is central to this project. To place these new data in their wider context, existing animal bone information from all pertinent published and 'grey' zoo archaeological literature is synthesised. The resulting datasets allow for a detailed examination of animal landscapes across the Iron Age/Romano-British transition at three nested scales: site and context; hinterland/region; and, Empire. Integrating the zooarchaeological data with evidence from landscape and environment studies, Iron Age/Roman archaeology, ancient history and, most importantly, social anthropology is key to this project. A new theoretical framework is adopted here, whereby animals are seen not simply as <b>passive</b> <b>indicators</b> of economy and environment but as active beings, providing visual, audio and physical experience, and it is through these novel approaches by considering the human-animal-landscape relationship, that a new insight into the cultural changes of the Iron Age to Romano-British transition will be obtained.

30|$|The north {{magnetic}} dip pole velocity {{has more than}} doubled in the last 30 years. This observation, together with the decrease in the Earth’s {{magnetic dip}}ole intensity over the last century has raised the concern of a possible approaching polarity reversal. We show that this rapid variation is in fact to be expected, and will not affect the dipolar field as a whole, but only the north magnetic pole. We demonstrate how this rapid displacement of the north magnetic pole is made possible by the horizontal field morphology. This rapid variation of north magnetic pole position does not imply any important modification of the core processes associated with field generation. The north magnetic pole position being very sensitive to small as well as rapid variations of the field, we show that it can very effectively be used as a <b>passive</b> tracer (or <b>indicator)</b> of field variations. Indeed, its velocity over the last century very accurately indicates the geomagnetic impulses (or jerks) that were so far observed only in observatory data.|$|R

Although not as exciting as a death-ray, the concept clearly had potential but the Air Ministry, before giving funding, asked for a demonstration proving that radio waves could be reflected by an aircraft. This was ready by 26 February and consisted of two receiving antennas located about 6 mile km away {{from one of the}} BBC's shortwave broadcast stations at Daventry. The two antennas were phased such that signals travelling directly from the station cancelled themselves out, but signals arriving from other angles were admitted, thereby deflecting the trace on a CRT <b>indicator</b> (<b>passive</b> radar). Such was the secrecy of this test that only three people witnessed it: Watson-Watt, his colleague Arnold Wilkins, and a single member of the committee, A. P. Rowe. The demonstration was a success; on several occasions a clear signal was seen from a Handley Page Heyford bomber being flown around the site. Most importantly, the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, was kept quietly informed of radar's progress. On 2 April 1935, Watson-Watt received a patent on a radio device for detecting and locating an aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{state-of-the-art}} technology {{to collect and}} analyse data has significantly improved the effectiveness of safety studies. Currently, {{despite the fact that}} there are many safety systems deployed at railway crossings, only limited research has been conducted to evaluate which of these systems is the most effective in terms of costs and safety. This paper demonstrates a way to evaluate safety at railway crossings using a twin-pronged approach: a driving simulator and traffic simulation software. A number of outputs have been observed from a driving simulator, such as driver compliance rate, vehicle speed profile, acceleration profile, initial braking position and final braking position. The compliance percentage at passive crossings (67 and 72 % for a stop sign and rumble strips, respectively) has lower compliance rates compared with active crossings (97 and 93 % for flashing red light and in-vehicle audible warning, respectively) at an 80 km/h approach speed. Using a statistical analysis it is shown that speed and acceleration profiles can be used to differentiate the effectiveness of active and <b>passive</b> crossings. These <b>indicators</b> are interpreted and used as input to a traffic simulation, which assists in determining which safety device is more efficient. By integrating driving simulator and traffic simulation models, this approach can be applied to evaluate and compare safety performance without the need to install costly test beds at real railway crossings...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, safety {{performance}} has been measured by metrics {{such as the}} OSHA recordable injury rate; days away, restricted work, or transfer injury rate; or the experience modification rating. Traditional metrics that provide historical information about the measures of {{safety performance}} are classified as lagging indicators. However, are these lagging safety metrics accurate predictors of future safety performance? In contrast, leading indicators are measures which are not necessarily historical in nature but rather {{can be used as}} predictors of future levels of safety performance. Leading indicators measure the building blocks of the safety culture of a project or company. When {{one or more of these}} measures suggest that some aspect of the safety process is weakening, interventions can be implemented prior to an incident, positively impacting the safety process before any injuries or suffering are sustained. This study identified the use and characteristics of leading indicators as well as evaluated the measures based on their impact on safety performance. To explore these questions, the investigator utilized two questionnaires regarding leading indicator practices as well as examined lagging safety measures from construction projects. The construction projects examined for this study were affiliated with several categories of members of the Construction Industry Institute (CII) including contractors, owners, insurance, and suppliers groups. The findings of the research regarding <b>passive</b> leading <b>indicators</b> show that safety performance improved as more safety policies/programs/practices were implemented. In the case of active leading indicators, the research showed that the assessment of the direct effectiveness of these programs are more difficult to measure. Through the creation of an analytical taxonomy of active leading indicators, the findings reveal that active leading indicators are affected by variables such as communication, leadership, and management. This taxonomy could be used by construction companies to better design and implement more effective safety programs. It is recommended that this taxonomy should be further examined in future research. Based on the greater understanding of the nature of leading indicators derived in this research, it is also recommended that the terms "passive" and "active" be respectively changed to "consistent" and "dynamic" to more accurately characterize them in practice...|$|R

40|$|A major {{unanswered}} {{question is}} whether direct cellular toxicity of homocysteine (Hcy) is causally involved in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in humans or whether homocysteinemia is simply a <b>passive</b> and indirect <b>indicator</b> of a more complex mechanism. Alternatively or additionally, the association between Hcy and CVD may result from its metabolic precursor S-adenosyl-Hcy (SAH), or from the altered ratio of S-adenosylmethionine SAM/SAH. This competition {{is based on the}} known effects of these adenosylated metabolites on cellular methylation, disturbances of which may lead to endothelial dysfunction and/ or CVD. Thus, it is of great significance to know how these adenosylated metabolites (SAM, SAH) and Hcy are interrelated, and how they relate to CVD. We measured SAM, SAH, their molar ratio, and tHcy in plasma and in red blood cells (RBCs) of 30 patients with proven CVD (age 64. 2  8. 4) and 29 healthy controls (age 61  7. 5). Plasma and RBCs SAM, SAH and tHcy levels were measured by HPLC method. We soon confirmed a significant increased of plasma levels of tHcy, SAM, and SAH in patients compared to the controls (13. 1 vs. 10. 9 micromol/l; 134 vs. 62. 0 nmol/l; 79. 2 vs. 24. 0 nmol/l, respectively), while the molar ratio of SAM/SAH was decreased in patients (1. 69 vs. 2. 58). In RBCs patients exhibited increased levels of SAH compared with controls (325 vs. 201 nmol/l) whereas SAM (3327 vs. 3635 nmol/l) and the molar ratio of SAM/SAH (10. 2 vs. 18. 0) were significantly decreased. Folic acid and vitamin B 12 in plasma were similar in patients and controls. We suppose that what we noticed might be {{due to the lack of}} remethylation in RBCs additionally to the inhibition of transmethylation reactions by elevation of SAH. Since the ratio of SAM/SAH is strongly linked with the activity of numerous enzymatic methylation reactions, these results suggest that methylation may be impaired in these patients. This increased intracellular SAH, when occurs in endothelial cells, would lead to excessive endothelial apoptosis, which is both pro-atherogenic and pro-thrombotic. Together, these results point out the importance of remethylation pathway in CVD...|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{forest loss}} {{estimates}} {{are important to}} understand the role of forest loss and deforestation in the global carbon cycle, for biodiversity studies, and to estimate the mitigation potential of reducing deforestation. To date, most studies have relied on optical satellite data and new efforts have greatly improved our quantitative knowledge on forest dynamics. However, most of these studies yield results for only a relatively short time period or are limited to certain countries. We have quantified large-scale forest loss over a 21 -year period (1990 – 2010) in the tropical biomes of South America using remotely sensed vegetation optical depth (VOD). This <b>passive</b> microwave satellite-based <b>indicator</b> of vegetation water content and vegetation density has a much coarser spatial resolution than optical data but its temporal resolution is higher and VOD is not impacted by aerosols and cloud cover. We used the merged VOD product of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) observations, and developed a change detection algorithm to quantify spatial and temporal variations in forest loss dynamics. Our results compared reasonably well with the newly developed Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) maps, available for the 2001 onwards period (r 2 [*]=[*]  0. 90 when comparing annual country-level estimates). This allowed us to convert our identified changes in VOD to forest loss area and compute these from 1990 onwards. We also compared these calibrated results to PRODES (r 2 [*]=[*]  0. 60 when comparing annual state-level estimates). We found that South American forest exhibited substantial interannual variability without a clear trend during the 1990 s, but increased from 2000 until 2004. After 2004, forest loss decreased again, except for two smaller peaks in 2007 and 2010. For a large part, these trends were driven by changes in Brazil, which was responsible for 56  % of the total South American forest loss area over our study period according to our results. One of the key findings of our study is that while forest loss decreased in Brazil after 2005, increases in other countries partly offset this trend suggesting that South American forest loss as a whole decreased much less than that in Brazil...|$|R
