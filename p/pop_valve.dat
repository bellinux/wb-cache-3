50|$|A <b>pop</b> <b>valve,</b> {{like the}} later forms of steam {{locomotive}} safety valve, only flows once a certain pressure has been reached. It then opens sharply, allowing full flow. This {{is used to}} make a sharp, abrupt start to fuel injection. This ensures that no fuel leaks into the cylinder until full combustion is imminent.|$|E

50|$|The anti dribble {{function}} or 'pressure pipe release' {{is achieved}} by not only stopping fuel flow after the main delivery phase, but also by lowering the pressure in the pipe at this point. Together with the <b>pop</b> <b>valve</b> in the fuel injector, this ensures that fuel flow stops abruptly when it needs to. This {{is the most important}} aspect of the valve, as the only device that provides this function.|$|E
50|$|These valves {{coincided with}} a change in firing behaviour. Rather than demonstrating their {{virility}} by always showing a feather at the valve, firemen now tried to avoid noisy blowing off, especially around stations or under the large roof of a major station. This was mostly {{at the behest of}} stationmasters, but firemen also realised that any blowing off through a <b>pop</b> <b>valve</b> wasted several pounds of boiler pressure; estimated at 20 psi lost and 16 lbs or more of shovelled coal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pop</b> <b>valves</b> {{derived from}} Adams's patent design of 1873, with an {{extended}} lip. R L Ross's valves were patented in 1902 & 1904. They were more popular in America at first, but widespread from 1920s.|$|R
25|$|Firstly the <b>pop</b> <b>valves</b> were a type used in industry; {{secondly}} the dead-weight type {{could be}} held down (so it would never work properly); and thirdly a dead-weight valve tends to bounce and thus waste steam.|$|R
50|$|Although showy {{polished}} brass covers over {{safety valves}} {{had been a}} feature of steam locomotives since Stephenson's day, the only railway to maintain this tradition into the era of <b>pop</b> <b>valves</b> was the GWR, with their distinctive tapered brass safety valve bonnets and copper-capped chimneys.|$|R
50|$|The main picture shows SAR no. 1478 at Worcester, c. 1930, with Cole's <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Belpaire boiler {{was fitted}} with Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire {{saturated steam}} boilers were fitted with Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard superheated steam boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Wakefield {{mechanical}} lubricator was mounted further {{back on the}} 502. These locomotives were also fitted with Ross <b>pop</b> safety <b>valves</b> as built. The 1913 batch had lever safety valves changed to Ross pop type after first major overhaul after 10 years.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one of the}} Class 5B locomotives, no. 725, was {{eventually}} reboilered with a Watson Standard no. 1 boiler and reclassified to Class 5BR. While the original boiler was fitted with Ramsbottom safety valves, the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> Even though the boiler pressure {{setting of the}} reboilered engine was lowered from , the tractive effort increased from 24860 to 25750 lbf kN at 75% of boiler pressure.|$|R
500|$|Maunsell {{initiated}} trials with Urie N15 No.442 in 1924, {{and proved}} that better performance {{could be obtained}} by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements. As a result, Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to [...] and replaced the safety <b>valves</b> with Ross <b>pop</b> <b>valves</b> set to [...] boiler pressure. The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater {{was replaced by a}} Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger steam chest and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere. Valve events (the timing of valve movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> The reboilered engines were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, {{compared to the}} conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs. Early conversions were equipped with copper and later conversions with steel fireboxes.|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of self-actuated pressurizer steam relief valve of the Shippingport PWR was tested within a prescribed setting of 2300 {{plus or minus}} 50 psig. The <b>valve</b> <b>popped</b> at 2265 psig and reseated at 2190 psig, with a time lapse of 12. 9 seconds between popping and reseating. Leak rates before and after <b>popping</b> of the <b>valve</b> were 0. 70 gallons/ hour and 1. 35 gallons/hour, respectively. The valve performed reliably in that it popped within the prescribed setting and reseated with no observable valve chatter or flutter. (auth...|$|R
50|$|Despite Robinson commencing the {{conversion}} to superheaters in 1912, {{the conversion}} was not actually completed until 1936. At the same time, any locomotive requiring cylinder replacement saw both larger cylinders and piston valves being fitted - 20 {{of the class}} would eventually receive this modification. From 1921, the Ramsbottom safety valves were phased out and removed, {{to be replaced by}} Ross <b>pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> Early conversions were equipped with copper and later conversions with steel fireboxes. After reboilering, {{the main difference}} between the Class 16B and Class 16C, Hendrie's combustion chamber behind the Class 16C's boiler, disappeared and Class 16B locomotives which were reboilered with Watson Standard boilers were also reclassified to Class 16CR.|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> Early conversions were equipped with copper and later conversions with steel fireboxes. In {{the process of}} reboilering they were also equipped with Watson cabs, with their distinctive slanted fronts compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs, to enable easier access to the firebox stays.|$|R
5000|$|They were {{numbered}} 850 and 851 in the CGR numbering sequence, {{but were}} not designated a classification. The two engines were not identical, no. 850 being equipped with the usual Ramsbottom safety valves while no. 851 had Coleâ€™s muffled type <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves,</b> both set to open at [...] boiler pressure. They were delivered with Type XJ tenders with a 6 lt 10 lcwt t coal and a 3500 imp gal water capacity.|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boilers were fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> The reboilered engines were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, {{compared to the}} conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs, to allow easier access to the firebox stays. The footplate was also modified to conform to SAR standard practice. Early conversions were equipped with copper and later conversions with steel fireboxes.|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boilers were fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> An obvious {{difference between an}} original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover, just {{to the rear of}} the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of the Class 10CR locomotives, an even more obvious difference was the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the reboilered locomotives.|$|R

50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> An obvious {{difference between an}} original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover just {{to the rear of}} the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of reboilered Class 14A locomotives, two even more obvious differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the reboilered locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|The Class 19D was {{delivered}} with a Watson Standard no. 1A boiler, fitted with Ross <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves</b> and set at [...] pressure. The regulator {{was of the}} multiple-valve type, with the valves arranged on the saturated steam side of the superheater header in accordance with SAR practice. The boiler {{was one of the}} range of standard type boilers which were designed by Day's predecessor as CME, A.G. Watson, as part of his standardisation policy. The locomotive was also equipped with a Watson cab with its distinctive inclined front.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} on 1+1/2 in plate frames. They were superheated and had piston valves, Walschaerts valve gear and Belpaire fireboxes which included combustion chambers. The boilers {{of the first}} two batches of 1919 and 1921 were equipped with Ramsbottom safety valves, while works pictures of the remainder show that they were equipped with Ross <b>pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> The feedwater supply of the third and subsequent batches was by a top feed arrangement through copper pipes which were run from the running boards on each side {{to the top of the}} boiler ahead of the steam dome.|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> Another obvious {{difference between an}} original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover, just {{to the rear of}} the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of the Class 15A and Class 15AR, two even more obvious differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the reboilered locomotives. In addition, during reboilering the early Class 15A models with curved down rear end running boards and narrow cabs were altered to straight rear end running boards with Watson cabs.|$|R
50|$|While the domeless boilers did {{not conform}} to the {{specified}} Watson Standard no. 1A boiler {{as far as the}} dome was concerned, they were accepted nevertheless, probably since all their other dimensions were identical to that of the Watson Standard boiler. It appears that Krupp had decided on their own accord that a dome was not necessary since there was no regulator in the dome, but merely a standpipe. Krupp substituted the dome with a manhole cover on which the two <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves</b> were mounted, while the steam was collected through a battery of collecting pipes, situated high up in the boiler in a similar manner to that which was used in the Class 16E.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves while, like the Watson Standard boilers, the Loubser boiler was fitted with two 3+1/2 in Ross <b>pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> Feedwater was supplied by two Davies and Metcalf injectors through a top-feed arrangement. At the firebox, the boiler was carried by a vertical transverse plate {{at the back}} and at the two front corners by sliding grease-lubricated shoes which rested on gunmetal liner plates which, in turn, were fixed to specially-designed steel brackets welded {{to the inside of}} the bridle casting. The boiler barrel was attached to the engine frame by four diaphragm plates, bolted to [...] "T" [...] sections which were riveted to the barrel.|$|R
50|$|When 29 of the Class 3 locomotives, {{all except}} no. 1457, were {{eventually}} reboilered with superheated Watson Standard no. 2 boilers, they were therefore reclassified to Class 3R. Their original Belpaire boilers were fitted with Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boilers were fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> The most obvious visual {{difference between an}} original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover on the smokebox of the reboilered locomotive just {{to the rear of}} the chimney, but this was not always the case, as illustrated below. In the case of the Class 3R locomotive, an even more obvious visual distinction is the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and the boiler.|$|R
50|$|The main picture shows no. 723 {{while it}} was still plinthed at Strand station. The first of the {{following}} pictures shows the Class 5B, as built with Coale safety valves, in the CGR's green livery with a polished brass dome cover, with its original low running boards with wheel fairings or splashers and its original Type YE1 tender. It is depicted here on a colourised CGR post card which also shows the CGR's crest. The second shows no. 724 in the all-black livery of the SAR, after being equipped with superheating, Ramsbottom safety valves, piston valve cylinders, raised running boards and a modified tender. The third shows Class 5BR no. 725 with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves</b> on a Watson Standard no. 1 boiler.|$|R
5000|$|When all ten Class 3B {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers, they were therefore reclassified to Class 3BR. Reboilering raised their boiler pitch by 1 in, while the boiler pressure {{was set at}} [...] Their original Belpaire boilers were fitted with Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with <b>Pop</b> safety <b>valves.</b> Probably at the same time, their Type TM tenders were rebuilt to the more attractive smooth-sided Type TL tenders. The most obvious visual difference between an original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover just {{to the rear of}} the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of the Class 3BR locomotive, an even more obvious visual distinction is the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and the boiler.|$|R
