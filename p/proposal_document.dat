40|$|Abstract]: This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} software development project completed for an ICT Solutions company called Data# 3. Customers utilise Data# 3 's expertise {{for a wide}} range of software and hardware projects. The aim of this project was to streamline the production of their project <b>proposal</b> <b>documents.</b> The Solutions Sales Specialists who prepare <b>proposal</b> <b>documents</b> identified the need to implement additional functionality into an existing piece of software. This piece of software, the ADCA (Automated Documentation Creation Application), loads into Microsoft Word as a tab on the Microsoft Word 2007 Ribbon Interface. The primary objectives of the project were: - Modify the ADCA to accommodate new information elements. - Allow information retrieval from an “Information Management Repository”. - Integrate support for the Master Proposal Template. A list of functions was formulated to satisfy the requirements. These functions were designed and developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, and the project was carefully managed in order to ensure a successful outcome. The functions were developed and tested concisely, and the piece of software was able to fulfil the objectives of the project. The tools are now available for the Solutions Sales Specialists to produce high quality documents more efficiently...|$|R

30|$|For the {{appraisal}} of benefits and {{impacts of the}} Thames Hub Vision we draw on the <b>proposal</b> <b>documents,</b> in particular the estimates of the costs, service provision and spatial footprints of the assets (Foster+Partners 2011 b). Some system effects can be estimated from these documents directly (for example, the use of electricity by the airport). However, others need further assessment. The most significant {{of these is the}} modal shift of air passengers between surface access modes. The Thames Hub Vision <b>proposal</b> <b>documents</b> suggest that 60 per cent of passenger arrivals and departures could be serviced by rail. This is a major increase from current levels at Heathrow (less than 30 per cent by rail or London Underground (Heathrow Airport Limited 2014)). A strict traffic management approach is proposed, limiting onsite parking and providing extensive park and ride facilities at the rail orbital stations, such that the orbital becomes an extended rail shuttle service. A model of potential surface access changes has been created based on origin–destination data for Heathrow (Civil Aviation Authority 2003), with passengers whose journey length has increased and who pass an orbital station on route to the airport, assumed to be open to a modal shift from car to rail. A full list of assumptions used within the modal shift analysis is included in the Additional file 1. The projections align well with the Foster[*]+[*]Partners proposal, with 43 per cent using the orbital and 18 per cent using central London tube and train services.|$|R

5000|$|The Koevoet {{issue was}} one of the most {{difficult}} the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) had to face. Because the unit was formed after the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 of 1978 (calling for South Africa's immediate withdrawal from Namibia), it was not mentioned in the eventual settlement proposal or related documents. Once Koevoet's role became clear, the UN Secretary-General took the position that it was a paramilitary unit and, as such, should be disbanded as soon as the settlement proposal took effect. About 2,000 of its members had been absorbed into SWAPOL before the implementation date of 1 April 1989 but they reverted to their former role against the SWAPO insurgents in the [...] "events" [...] of early April 1989. Although ostensibly re-incorporated into SWAPOL in mid-May, the ex-Koevoet personnel continued to operate as a counter-insurgency unit travelling around the north in armoured and heavily armed convoys. In June 1989, the UN Special Representative in Namibia and head of UNTAG, Martti Ahtisaari, told the Administrator-General (South African appointee Louis Pienaar) that this behaviour was inconsistent with the settlement proposal, which required the police to be lightly armed. Some Koevoet operators later maintained that where the SWAPOL-COIN police forces were weakened in order to meet the demand set by the <b>proposal</b> <b>document,</b> SWAPO had not yet relinquished its position and capabilities as an armed insurgent force, thus necessitating their cautious defiance.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid 1990s, {{as a part}} of the {{information}} security architecture project for a Fortune 100 corporation in the United States (the Anheuser-Busch Corporation), one of the members of the three-man architectural development team came up with a concept with regards to improving the overall security of the operating system to be used on all the computers within this networked system (a network system referred to as BudNET). Improving the overall security of an operating system is commonly referred to as [...] "OS Hardening." [...] The member of the team that was charged with this was SSgt. Donald R. Woeltje Jr. and the concept he came up with was the installation of special software (firewall software) on every BudNET server, workstation, and perimeter security device. Indeed, every single Windows system on the BudNET network. This is a concept that is now commonly referred to as [...] "personal firewall" [...] software. So, while SSgt. Woeltje did not invent personal firewall software, he did invent the idea of the [...] "personal firewall." [...] Evidence of this fact exists in the Anheuser-Busch Security Model <b>Proposal</b> <b>document</b> made by SSgt. Woeltje, at the time. When SSgt. Woeltje brought in all the leading firewall vendors for meetings concerning the products being considered for use for the perimeter security of the BudNET network, SSgt. Woeltje brought up the concept of the [...] "personal firewall" [...] with the vendors and asked them if they had any firewall product that could be used in this way. With the exception of the representatives from the Cyberguard Corporation, every vendor said that not only did that not have any firewall software that could be used in this way but they also said that the idea was crazy and unworkable. But, today we know they were wrong because the use of personal firewall software has become a de facto computer security standard. The companies that SSgt. Woeltje discussed [...] "personal firewall" [...] software with were, among others, Cisco, Checkpoint, Axent Technologies, Milkyway Networks, Cyberguard, Network ONE, Trusted Information Systems, and Secure Computing Corporation.|$|E
