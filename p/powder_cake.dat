40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Beverage powders can exhibit caking during storage {{due to high}} {{temperature}} and moisture conditions, leading to consumer dissatisfaction. Caking problems can be aggravated {{by the presence of}} sensitive ingredients. The caking behaviour of cocoa beverage powders, with varying amounts of a carbohydrate sensitive ingredient, as affected by climate conditions was studied in this work. Sorption isotherms of beverage powders were determined at water activities (a(w)) ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 6 in a moisture sorption analyser by gravimetry and fitted to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) or the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) equation. Glass transition temperatures (T(g)) at several a(w) were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry and fitted to the Gordon-Taylor equation. Deduced T(g) = f(a(w)) functions helped to identify stability or caking zones. Specific experimental methods, based on the analysis of mechanical properties of <b>powder</b> <b>cakes</b> formed under compression, were used to quantify the degree of caking.

40|$|Background: Caking is a {{recurrent}} problem in various industries, whether it occurs during the production,storage or transport of <b>powders.</b> <b>Caked</b> <b>powder</b> results in longer processing times and decreasedproduct quality, leading to significant economic loss. Several caking mechanisms {{have been described}} inthe literature. However, they are often difficult {{to take into account}} in an industrial context, given themany parameters which influence the overall caking phenomenon. Scope and approach: This review describes the three relevant caking mechanisms for food powders ingeneral. Focussing on predominantly crystalline lactose powder, we discuss how each of these mechanismscan explain caking and be prevented in the industrial context. The second part of this paperpresents a critical review of the methods used to characterise caking to date. Key findings and conclusions: The presence of amorphous material and other impurities must be assessedin crystalline lactose powders, as they can trigger amorphous and humidity caking. Particle size distributionis another key parameter requiring control as it can encourage caking through enhancement ofparticle interactions. In general, preventing caking in food powders can only be achieved by a thoroughunderstanding of the production process and storage conditions. Moreover, the characterisation of cakingremains a challenge as most methods published in the literature do not fit the needs of the food industry. The real demand is for a reliable method to predict caking which would be rapid and easy enough to beapplied to each batch for quality control...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of granular matter depends greatly {{on the size}} of its elementary components. Besides the well studied field of granulates made up of large sized particles which ignore the interaction of the particles with the fluid or gas environment, the physics of collection of tiny particles such as fine or superfine powders concerns a majority of industrial applications. This paper briefly outlines several basic {{behavior of}} powders showing that new features come into play when the particle interaction with the surrounding gas is taken into account. It starts from two key mechanisms: The first one arises when the typical particle velocity is in the order of the free fall velocity of that particle, which simply means that the fluid drag comes into play. The second one consists in considering the <b>powder</b> <b>cakes</b> as a porous material. Combining these two basic mechanisms with well-known granulate properties such as avalanching or heaping, leads to previously ignored sets of plugging effects or surface instabilities resulting from what we call the ”volcano effect”. Furthermore, we show that, up to a certain extent, the physics of fine powders interacting with gas, may mimic the physics of wetting liquids...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A strong fibrin-specific fibrinolytic enzyme was {{produced}} by liquid culture of Coprinus comatus YY- 20. Soybean <b>cake</b> <b>powder</b> and sucrose as substrates resulted in the highest fibrinolytic activity. The optimal temperature {{for the production of}} the enzyme was found to be 21 - 25 ℃ in the optimal medium (Soybean <b>cake</b> <b>powder</b> 50 g/L, sucrose 20 g/L). The optimal initial pH of the medium was found to be at the range of 5 - 8. The maximum fibrinolytic activity was observed at the stationary phase of cell growth. These results suggest that the culture liquid of Coprinus comatus YY- 20 has potential as a source of physiologically active fibrinolytic enzymes. Fibrin is the major protein component of blood clots, which is formed from fibrinogen by thrombin. The insoluble fibrin fiber is hydrolyzed into fibrin degradation products by plasmin, which is generated from plasminogen by plasminogen activiters, such as tissue plasminogen activator. In unbalanced state the clots are not lysed and thus thrombosis occurs...|$|R

40|$|I {{thoroughly}} enjoyed John Schunk’s article— “What Can Legal Writing Students Learn from Watching Emeril Live?”—in the Winter 2006 issue. We are big Emeril fans in our family, and we {{too have}} heard him distinguish {{the art of}} baking casseroles from the art of baking cakes. Baking a casserole is more art than science, because although there are basic ingredients, a creative cook can vary the recipe to please a variety of palettes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evaluation}} of recovery rates extracting dried milk and egg powder using eleven different extractants led to approximately similar results for both foods. Compared {{to the other}} extraction solutions investigated, " 1 % Tween 20 and 0. 4 % Triton X- 100 " and " 4 % SDS" are the most qualified extractants to isolate proteins of hen's egg or milk. Comparing calculated protein recovery rates of egg and milk powder extracts the results clearly indicate that {{the choice of a}} suitable extractant is of particular importance. Qualitative investigation of the extracts via LDS - PAGE followed by silver staining as well as immunoblotting confirmed the results of protein quantification. Hence, the immunoblots showed that the used extraction agents had no negative influence onto the antigenicity of the extracted allergenic proteins. In this study, variation of extraction temperature neither led to any benefit in extraction quality nor to degradation. Changing pH did not reveal any tendencies but a progressive protein hydrolysis at strong alkaline. Evaluation of recovery rates as well as results of unspecific and specific staining of the extracts revealed that an extraction duration of one hour is sufficient for an appropriate sample preparation. For investigations with and without food matrix different results were obtained. In summary, wheat starch did not influence the extraction quality within all examined materials and different extractants. In contrast, using fat <b>powder</b> and dry <b>cake</b> mix, respectively, led to different results in extraction procedure. When fat <b>powder</b> and dry <b>cake</b> mix were used as food matrices, some protein recovery rates decreased and some increased depending on the allergen material.

40|$|This study investigates binder {{distribution}} in wet granulation {{and focuses on}} the nucleation zone, which is {{the area where the}} liquid binder and powder surface come into contact and form the initial nuclei. An equipment independent parameter, dimensionless spray flux Psi (a), is defined to characterise the most important process parameters in the nucleation process: solution flowrate, powder flux, and binder drop size. Ex-granulator experiments are used to study the relationship between dimensionless spray flux, process variables and the coverage of binder fluid on the powder surface. Lactose monohydrate powder on a variable speed riffler passed under a flat spray once only. Water and 7 % HPC solution at two spray pressures were used as binders. Experiments with red dye and image analysis demonstrate that changes in dimensionless spray flux correlate with a measurable difference in powder surface coverage. Nucleation experiments show that spray flux controls {{the size and shape of}} the nuclei size distribution. At low Psi (a), the system operates in the drop controlled regime, where one drop forms one nucleus and the nuclei size distribution is narrow. At higher Psi (a), the <b>powder</b> surface <b>cakes</b> creating a broader size distribution. For controlled nucleation with the narrowest possible size distribution, it is recommended that the dimensionless spray flux be less than 0. 1 to be in the drop-controlled regime.
