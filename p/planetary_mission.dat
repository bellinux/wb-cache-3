5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to reach escape velocity was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, Venera 1 {{became the first}} planetary probe. It revealed {{the presence of the}} solar wind and performed the first fly-by of the planet Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus.

Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth.

2500|$|Mars Express is a space {{exploration}} mission {{being conducted by}} the European Space Agency (ESA). The Mars Express mission is exploring the planet Mars, and is the first <b>planetary</b> <b>mission</b> attempted by the agency. [...] "Express" [...] originally referred to the speed and efficiency with which the spacecraft was designed and built. However [...] "Express" [...] also describes the spacecraft's relatively short interplanetary voyage, {{a result of being}} launched when the orbits of Earth and Mars brought them closer than they had been in about 60,000 years.|$|E
2500|$|Precision guided entry {{made use}} of onboard {{computing}} ability to steer itself toward the pre-determined landing site, improving landing accuracy {{from a range of}} hundreds of kilometers to [...] This capability helped remove some of the uncertainties of landing hazards that might be present in larger landing ellipses. Steering was achieved by the combined use of thrusters and ejectable balance masses. The ejectable balance masses shift the capsule center of mass enabling generation of a lift vector during the atmospheric phase. A navigation computer integrated the measurements to estimate the position and attitude of the capsule that generated automated torque commands. This was the first <b>planetary</b> <b>mission</b> to use precision landing techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Aerocapture is a {{much more}} {{aggressive}} manoeuver, converting an incoming hyperbolic orbit to an elliptical orbit in one pass. [...] This requires a heat shield and much trickier navigation, because it must be completed in one pass through the atmosphere, and unlike aerobraking no preview of the atmosphere is possible. If the intent is to remain in orbit, then at least one more propulsive maneuver is required after aerocapture—otherwise the low point of the resulting orbit will remain in the atmosphere, resulting in eventual re-entry. Aerocapture has not yet been tried on a <b>planetary</b> <b>mission,</b> but the re-entry skip by Zond 6 and Zond 7 upon lunar return were aerocapture maneuvers, because they turned a hyperbolic orbit into an elliptical orbit. On these missions, because there was no attempt to raise the perigee after the aerocapture, the resulting orbit still intersected the atmosphere, and re-entry occurred at the next perigee.|$|E

40|$|The impacts {{upon the}} growth space station of several {{advanced}} <b>planetary</b> <b>missions</b> and a populated lunar base are examined. <b>Planetary</b> <b>missions</b> examined include sample returns from Mars, the Comet Kopff, the main belt asteroid Ceres, a Mercury orbiter, and a saturn orbiter with multiple Titan probes. A manned lunar base build-up scenario is defined, encompassing preliminary lunar surveys, {{ten years of}} construction, and establishment of a permanent 18 person facility with the capability to produce oxygen propellant. The spacecraft mass departing from the space station, mission Delta V requirements, and scheduled departure date for each payload outbound from low Earth orbit are determined for both the <b>planetary</b> <b>missions</b> and for the lunar base build-up. Large aerobraked orbital transfer vehicles (OTV's) are used. Two 42 metric ton propellant capacity OTV's are required for each the the 68 lunar sorties of the base build-up scenario. The two most difficult <b>planetary</b> <b>missions</b> (Kopff and Ceres) also require two of these OTV's. An expendable lunar lander and ascent stage and a reusable lunar lander which uses lunar produced oxygen are sized to deliver 18 metric tons to the lunar surface.
