40|$|This {{research}} was developed from information {{obtained from a}} damaging agent in {{the territory of the}} <b>Plant</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Station</b> (PPS) of Lajas in the province of Cienfuegos in the municipalities: Lajas, Palmira and Cruces. The spatial intensity of early blight (Alternaria solani Sor.) is analyzed in 2012 - 2013 campaign. An analysis of the requirements of stationarity required for the study was made, which included the adjustment to the normal distribution, identification of outliers, analysis of basic statistics to determine the existence of stationarity; subsequently the variogram map for analysis of anisotropy was represented, which accompanied by the directional semivariograms allowed to determine the directions of higher and lower spatial continuity, and theoretical model was fitted to the experimental semivariograms. As a result the map estimation was obtained with the best fit model which presented a determination coefficient greater than 95...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to conduct a spatial analysis of the incidence of Phytophthora nicotianae Breda de Haan and Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) De Bary, during five seasons of potato in Fields Company Miscellaneous Crops in Horquita, Cienfuegos (2003 - 2004 to 2007 - 2008). Information about pathogens, collected by the <b>Plant</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Station</b> of Yaguaramas, was used in order to do so. An alpha numerical database was made, oriented to a group of areas under center pivot irrigation machines (Kubans and Bayamón) and its quadrants. Parallel to this, mapping of center pivot machines and quadrants was generated in MapInfo GIS 8. 5. Several automatic geo codifications were made in order to relate the alphanumeric database and the mapping, and thematic maps were generated in {{the presence or absence of}} pathogens. The two study agents have presented high spatial variability during the five planting seasons. Both have influenced the same geographical area with similar appearance date. P. infestans has not expressed a defined dispersion pattern and it has spread at random from the primary source of incidence, while Phytophthora nicotianae has become an endemic agent which shows a dispersion pattern towards neighboring areas or areas connected by the road network from the primary sources, which have been associated with poor land leveling and late or intermediate planting seasons...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{addresses}} {{the transition of}} Ukrainian <b>Plant</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Stations</b> (PPS) from technical agencies in the Soviet command economy to a public service for farmers in an emerging market economy. It opens with {{an overview of the}} cir-culation of agricultural knowledge and information in Soviet agri-culture. During the transition, the fundamental knowledge-based problem for agricultural sector actors has been to recognize dis-tinct private and public sectors which balance market incentives with the maintenance of social welfare and allow for adaptive de-cision-making with respect to technical, environmental, social, and financial trade-offs. Two annual surveys of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> stakeholders designed to improve development and delivery of appropriate pest management information have demonstrated some success in the delivery of technical information services for a privatized agricultural sector. The analysis concludes, however, that recognition of the need to evaluate technical, environmental, social, and financial trade-offs of market-based alternatives has yet to be developed. Transformation of the Soviet command economy into a market economy is not as simple as once believed (Grabher and Stark...|$|R
40|$|Rice-infecting viruses {{have caused}} serious damage to rice {{production}} in Asian, American, and African countries, where about 30 rice viruses and diseases have been reported. To control these diseases, developing accurate, quick methods {{to detect and}} diagnose the viruses in the host plants and any insect vectors of the viruses is very important. Based on an antigen–antibody reaction, serological methods such as latex agglutination reaction (LAR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have advanced to detect viral particles or major proteins derived from viruses. They aid in forecasting disease and surveying disease spread and are widely used for virus detection at <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>stations</b> and research laboratories. From the early 2000 s, based on sequence information for the target virus, several other methods such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reverse transcription- loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) have been developed that are sensitive, rapid, and able to differentiate closely related viruses. Recent techniques such as real-time RT-PCR {{can be used to}} quantify the pathogen in target samples and monitor population dynamics of a virus, and metagenomic analyses using next-generation sequencing and microarrays show potential for use in the diagnosis of rice diseases...|$|R

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>protection</b> {{in organic}} farming has to {{simultaneously}} comply with {{two sets of}} regulations: regulations on organic production and pesticide legislation. This chapter describes the organic approach to <b>plant</b> <b>protection,</b> including the role of systems management versus direct interventions, the range of authorised substances and the procedures for authorising new substances and the withdrawal of old substances. External factors not related to organic farming also influence the availability of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> products. Scientific, regulatory and economic aspects may limit the registration of substances in a given country. On the other hand, {{there is an alternative}} route for the registration of fertilisers and plant strengtheners in some countries. As a result, the range of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> products available to organic farmers varies from one country to another. The history of the authorisation of sodium bicarbonate, spinosad, copper fungicides, clay minerals and granulosis viruses illustrates how the two sets of regulations can interact in very different ways, creating different patterns of availability. The practice of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> is illustrated for the prevention and control of apple scab, fire blight and codling moth in organic apple orchards. At the end of the chapter, research perspectives for a ‘self-regulating’ apple orchard where <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> fully relies on systems management are presented.

40|$|The Dutch <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> policy aims at {{reaching}} {{sustainable agriculture}} in the Netherlands. Operational goals {{with respect to the}} environment for the year 2010 compared to the year 1998 are: a reduction of 95 % of the environmental impact on surface water and a reduction of 95 % of bottle-necks in the production of drinking water from surface water. Midterm goals are 75 % and 50 % respectively. The calculated environmental impact as a result of drift emissions to surface water was reduced with 86 %. Drift reduction measures, imposed since 2000, contributed most to this calculated reduction. The second most important contribution came from the use of less toxic <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> products. Concentrations of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> product residues measured in surface waters declined over the study period, but still concentrations above maximum permissible levels occurred in 2004. The number of bottle-necks in the production of drinking water from surface water was diminished from 33 to 27; the midterm goal was not met. This was partly due to non-agricultural use of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> products and foreign sources.
