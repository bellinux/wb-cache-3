The most common navigation method for handheld displays is static <b>peephole</b> navigation: The <b>peephole</b> is static and we move the spatial layout behind it (scrolling). A more natural method is dynamic <b>peephole</b> navigation: here, the spatial layout is static and we move the <b>peephole</b> across it. In the experiment reported here, we compared dynamic and static <b>peephole</b> navigation in otherwise similar conditions.

Subjects had to discriminate line length by either moving a dynamic <b>peephole</b> across a static layout of the lines or by moving a dynamic layout behind a static <b>peephole.</b> In both conditions, they used mouse-cursor control to move either the <b>peephole</b> or the lines.

From there Altan Khan passed through the defences and raided the suburbs of Beijing. The Ming court put up minimal resistance and watched the suburbs burn as they waited for reinforcements to drive the invaders out.

In the second one, a mobile phone’s sensors are used to create a dynamic <b>peephole</b> that can be moved over static content. In the results of our formal analysis sensor-based dynamic <b>peephole</b> navigation performed twice as good in an orientation task, 75 % better in an object size discrimination task, and was preferred by 80 % of the users. Despite these advantages, additional usability studies indicate that if they are sitting, a majority of users resort to touch screen-based static <b>peephole</b> navigation when interacting. Our results therefore demonstrate benefits of dynamic <b>peephole</b> navigation for virtual reality panoramas but also illustrate its limitations depending on the current context of the user...|$|R

The frost-work had so covered the windowpanes that it was hardly possible {{to get a glimpse}} at the scenery outside. But, while waiting for breakfast, the small populace of Tanglewood had scratched <b>peepholes</b> with their finger-nails, and saw with vast delight that--unless it were one or two bare patches on a precipitous hillside, or the gray effect of the snow, intermingled with the black pine forest--all nature was as white as a sheet.

Before them lay a vast and fertile valley, much of which seemed to be under cultivation, and down it flowed a broad and placid river. Opposite to him and facing west a great tongue of land ran up to a wall of mountains with stark precipices of black rock that seemed to be hundreds, or even thousands, of feet high, and at the tip of this tongue a mighty waterfall rushed over the precipice, looking at that distance like a cascade of smoke. This torrent, which he remembered was called Raaba, fell into a great pool and there divided itself into two rushing branches that enclosed an ellipse of ground, surrounded on all sides by water, for on its westernmost extremity the branches met again and after flowing a while as one river, divided once more and wound away quietly to north and south further than the eye could reach. On the island thus formed, which may have been three miles long by two in breadth, stood thousands of straw-roofed, square-built huts with verandas, neatly arranged in blocks and lines and having between them streets that were edged with palms.|$|E

There were, however, marvels to stir her, strange landscapes, cities, seas, and ships,--once a fire in the forest of a western reserve with gigantic tongues of orange flame leaping from tree to tree. The movies brought the world to Hampton, the great world into which she longed to fare, brought the world to her! Remote mountain hamlets from Japan, minarets and muezzins from the Orient, pyramids from Egypt, domes from Moscow resembling gilded beets turned upside down; grey houses of parliament by the Thames, the Tower of London, the Palaces of Potsdam, the Tai Mahal. Strange lands indeed, and stranger peoples! booted Russians in blouses, naked Equatorial savages tattooed and amazingly adorned, soldiers and sailors, presidents, princes and emperors brought into such startling proximity one could easily imagine one's self exchanging the time of day! Incredible to Janet how the audiences, how even Eda accepted with American complacency what were to her never-ending miracles; the yearning to see more, to know more, became acute, like a pain, but even as she sought to devour these scenes, to drink in every detail, with tantalizing swiftness they were whisked away. They were <b>peepholes</b> in the walls of her prison; and at night she often charmed herself to sleep with remembered visions of wide, empty, treeshaded terraces reserved for kings.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were some}} years since {{a set of}} these ladies who were of quality, and gave out, that virginity was to be their state of life during this mortal condition, and {{therefore}} resolved to join their fortunes, and erect a nunnery. The place of residence was pitched upon; and a pretty situation, full of natural falls and risings of waters, with shady coverts, and flowery arbours, was approved by seven of the founders. There were as many of our sex who took the liberty to visit those mansions of intended severity; among others, a famous rake[5] of that time, who had the grave way to an excellence. He came in first; but upon seeing a servant coming towards him, with a design to tell him, this {{was no place for}} him or his companions, up goes my grave impudence to the maid: [...] "Young woman," [...] said he, [...] "if any of the ladies are in the way {{on this side of the}} house, pray carry us on the other side towards the gardens: we are, you must know, gentlemen that are travelling England; after which we shall go into foreign parts, where some of us have already been." [...] Here he bows in the most humble manner, and kissed the girl, who knew not how to behave to such a sort of carriage. He goes on; [...] "Now you must know we have an ambition to have it to say, that we have a Protestant nunnery in England: but pray Mrs. Betty----"--"Sir," [...] she replied, [...] "my name is Susan, at your service."--"Then I heartily beg your pardon----"--"No offence in the least," [...] says she, [...] "for I have a cousin-german whose name is Betty."[6]--"Indeed," [...] said he, [...] "I protest to you that was more than I knew, I spoke at random: But since it happens that I was near in the right, give me leave to present this gentleman to the favour of a civil salute." [...] His friend advances, and so on, till that they had all saluted her. By this means, the poor girl was in the middle of the crowd of these fellows, at a loss what to do, without courage to pass through them; and the Platonics, at several <b>peepholes,</b> pale, trembling, and fretting. Rake perceived they were observed, and therefore took care to keep Sukey in chat with questions concerning their way of life; when appeared at last Madonella,[7] a lady who had writ a fine book concerning the recluse life, and was the projectrix of the foundation. She approaches into the hall; and Rake, knowing the dignity of his own mien and aspect, goes deputy from his company. She begins, [...] "Sir, I am obliged to follow the servant, who was sent out to know, What affair could make strangers press upon a solitude which we, who are to inhabit this place, have devoted to Heaven and our own thoughts?"-- [...] "Madam," [...] replies Rake, (with an air of great distance, mixed with a certain indifference, by which he could dissemble dissimulation) [...] "your great intention has made more noise in the world than you design it should; and we travellers, who have seen many foreign institutions of this kind, have a curiosity to see, in its first rudiments, this seat of primitive piety; for such it must be called by future ages, to the eternal honour of the founders. I have read Madonella's excellent and seraphic discourse on this subject." [...] The lady immediately answers, [...] "If what I have said could have contributed to raise any thoughts in you that may make for the advancement of intellectual and divine conversation, I should think myself extremely happy." [...] He immediately fell back with the profoundest veneration; then advancing, [...] "Are you then that admired lady? If I may approach lips which have uttered things so sacred--" [...] He salutes her. His friends followed his example. The devoted within stood in amazement where this would end, to see Madonella receive their address and their company. But Rake goes on--"We would not transgress rules; but if we may take the liberty to see the place you have thought fit to choose for ever, we would go into such parts of the gardens as is consistent with the severities you have imposed on yourselves." ...|$|E
