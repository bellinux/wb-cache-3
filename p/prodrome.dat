5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least , muscle pain, malaise, headache and prostration. As the digestive tract is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The <b>prodrome,</b> or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions—small reddish spots called enanthem—appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{schizophrenia}} is difficult {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia. While {{there is some evidence}} that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years. Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the <b>prodrome</b> phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E

40|$|Background: This paper explores whether {{individuals}} with a mood disorder can identify the nature and duration of depressive and manic <b>prodromes.</b> Methods: Seventy-three publications of prodromal symptoms in bipolar and unipolar disorders were identified by computer searches of seven databases (including medline and Psyclit) supplemented by hand searches of journals. Seventeen studies (total sample= 1191 subjects) met criteria for inclusion in a systematic review. Results: At least 80 % of {{individuals with}} a mood disorder can identify one or more prodromal symptoms. There are limited data about unipolar disorders. In bipolar disorders, early symptoms of mania are identified more frequently than early symptoms of depression. The most robust early symptom of mania is sleep disturbance (median prevalence 77 %). Early symptoms of depression are inconsistent. The mean length of manic <b>prodromes</b> (&# 62; 20 days) was consistently reported to be longer than depressive <b>prodromes</b> (&# 60; 19 days). However, depressive <b>prodromes</b> showed greater inter-individual variation (ranging from 2 to 365 days) in duration than manic <b>prodromes</b> (1 – 120 days). Limitations: Few prospective studies of bipolar, and particularly unipolar disorders have been reported. Conclusions: Early symptoms of relapse in affective disorders can be identified. Explanations of the apparent differences in the recognition and length of <b>prodromes</b> between mania and bipolar depression are explored. Further research on duration, sequence of symptom appearance and characteristics of <b>prodromes</b> is warranted to clarify the clinical usefulness of early symptom monitoring...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is some {{evidence}} that teaching patients to recognise <b>prodromes</b> of manic and depressive episodes improved time to recurrence and hospitalization, social function, and performance in employment. Little information is available about which prodromal symptom patients with bipolar disorder recognise as being the very first symptom of recurrence. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to describe the very first symptoms in manic or depressive recurrence reported by patients with bipolar disorder and to explore associations between the ability to recognise these prodromal symptoms and the clinical characteristics of these patients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive design. SETTINGS: Five psychiatric outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 111 outpatients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, currently not in an episode. METHODS: Data were obtained through a face-to-face interview with open ended questions and a questionnaire for demographic and clinical characteristics. Reported <b>prodromes</b> were categorised in an instrument inductively constructed and based on literature review and expert opinion. Associations were calculated with chi squares. RESULTS: The first recognised symptom of recurrence in mania was change in energy level (21 %), sleep (17 %), and social functioning (16 %). In depression it was change in thought (15 %), mood stability (12 %), energy level (12 %), social functioning (11 %), and sleep (10 %). Twenty-eight percent of the patients were not able to recognise <b>prodromes</b> of recurrence in mania. Also 28 % was not able to recognise <b>prodromes</b> of depression, and 12 % was not able to recognise either of them. A significant association (p= 0. 033) was found between the ability to recognise <b>prodromes</b> of depression and the lifetime number of depressive episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of euthymic patients with bipolar disorder are able to recognise <b>prodromes</b> of recurrence. These warning signs often emerge early in the process of recurrence. Our results suggest that patients learn to recognise <b>prodromes</b> of recurrence rather by experience than from therapeutic interventions. Talking to patients and their relatives closely after recovered from an episode to construct the early phase of recurrence can be important to improve recognition and prevent future episodes of mania or depression...|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{exploration of}} prepsychotic detection and intervention in psychosis has just commenced. To identify developing psychosis at prodromal stages, {{it is important}} to learn how patients and families perceive initial <b>prodromes</b> naturalistically. We must understand better {{what we are going to}} detect, because the essential components of this phase, particularly the subjective experiences, remain unsettled. In a series of 19 first episode DSM-IV schizophrenia patients, we explore prodromal phenomena in depth and identify potential core dimensions. On the basis of our findings, we describe experiences and behaviors that appear to be essential components of initial <b>prodromes.</b> The subjects reported serious difficulties interpreting and talking about prodromal experiences at the time these occurred, causing delayed identification. We report detailed reasons for this, pointing out vulnerable aspects of at-risk assessments. From eight proposed groups of experiences, two are highlighted as tentative core dimensions: "disturbance of perception of self and "extreme preoccupation by and withdrawal to overvalued ideas. " Four potential dimensions of prodromal behavior are also identified: (1) quit school, university, or job, or major school truancy, (2) marked and lasting observable shift of interests, (3) marked and lasting social passivity, withdrawal, or isolation, and (4) marked and lasting change in global appearance or behavior. We argue that the findings, the phenomena, and their significance in <b>prodromes</b> are valid because they are logical and coherent in light of clinical experience as well as the empirical literature of a full century...|$|R

A semi-structured protocol was used for in-person interviews to both patients and observers. PS were found in 39 % of patients, the most frequent ones being behavioral, cognitive and mood changes. Both patients with focal and generalized epilepsies reported <b>prodromes,</b> although they were more frequently found in the former group. PS were mostly perceived preceding complex partial and generalized tonic–clonic seizures.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} on residual symptoms after apparently successful treatment The strong prognostic value of subthreshold symptomatology upon remission and the relationship between residual and prodromal symptomatology (the rollback phenomenon) have been outlined. Most residual symptoms also occur in the prodromal phase of depression and may progress to become <b>prodromes</b> of relapse. These findings entail important implications. It is necessary to closely monitor the patient throughout the different phases of illness and to assess the quality and extent of residual symptoms. A more stringent definition of recovery, which is not limited to symptomatic assessment, but includes psychological well-being, seems to be necessary. Wen therapeutic strategies for improving the level of remission, such as treatment of residual symptoms that progress to become <b>prodromes</b> of relapse and/or increasing psychological well-being, appear to yield more lasting benefits. The sequential model may provide room for innovative treatment approaches, including the use of drugs for specifically addressing residual symptoms. As occurs in other medical disorders (such as diabetes and hypertension), the active role of the patient in achieving recovery (self-therapy homework) should be pursued...|$|R

40|$|Syncope in Brugada {{syndrome}} (BrS) {{patients is}} a sign of increased risk for sudden cardiac death and usually is ascribed to cardiac arrhythmias. However, syncope often occurs in the general population, mostly from nonarrhythmic causes (eg, reflex syncope). The {{purpose of this study was}} to distinguish arrhythmic events from nonarrhythmic syncope in BrS and to establish the clinical relevance of nonarrhythmic syncope. We reviewed the patient records of 342 consecutively included BrS patients and conducted systematic interviews in 141 patients with aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) or syncope. In total, 23 patients (7 %) experienced ECG-documented ACA and 118 (34 %) syncope; of these 118, 67 (57 %) were diagnosed with suspected nonarrhythmic syncope. Compared to suspected nonarrhythmic syncope patients, ACA patients were older at first event (45 vs 20 years), were more likely to be male (relative risk 2. 1) and to have urinary incontinence (relative risk 4. 6), and were less likely to report <b>prodromes.</b> ACA was never triggered by hot/crowded surroundings, pain or other emotional stress, seeing blood, or prolonged standing. During follow-up (median 54 months), ACA rate was 8. 7 % per year among ACA patients and 0 % per year among suspected nonarrhythmic syncope patients. Syncope, especially nonarrhythmic syncope, often occurs in BrS. The high incidence of nonarrhythmic syncope must be taken into account during risk stratification. Arrhythmic events and nonarrhythmic syncope may be distinguished by clinical characteristics (absence of <b>prodromes</b> and, particularly, specific triggers), demonstrating the importance of systematic history takin...|$|R

40|$|Background: To compare head-up tilt testing (HUT) {{outcomes}} and hemodynamic responses, and the prevalence and correlates of <b>prodromes,</b> in elderly and younger patients with suspected vasovagal syncope (VVS). Methods: Consecutive outpatients {{with a history}} of recurrent unexplained syncope underwent HUT by being tilted to 70 °; the test was potentiated by the administration of 300 μg of nitroglycerine after 20 minutes. Occurrence of VVS and hemodynamic responses during passive and nitroglycerine phases of HUT were evaluated; symptoms preceding HUT-induced syncope were recorded, together with heart rate and arterial blood pressure values. Results: Four hundred and sixty of the 743 patients were HUT positive: 156 fainted during the unmedicated phase and 304 after nitroglycerine administration. The patients aged ≥ 65 years (n = 102) experienced VVS more frequently during the pharmacological stage of HUT; the overall rate of positive results was similar to that observed in the patients aged 36 - 64 years (n = 329) and only slightly lower than that observed in those aged ≤ 35 years (n = 312). In the older patients, who experienced fewer and mainly prodrome-free spontaneous syncopal episodes, HUT increased the number of premonitory symptoms, and there were no significant age-related differences in symptom prevalence or timing or the patients' hemodynamic characteristics. Conclusions: The rate of VVS induced by nitroglycerine-potentiated HUT is similar in elderly and younger patients. In the former, nitroglycerine- potentiated HUT significantly increases the prevalence of <b>prodromes</b> in comparison with spontaneous episodes, which suggests that it may be useful not only for diagnosis but also for patient counseling...|$|R
