50|$|In most {{theoretical}} literature, <b>price</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{is argued}} as result from spatial difference {{and the existence}} of significant search cost. With the development of internet and shopping agent programs, conventional wisdom tells that <b>price</b> <b>dispersion</b> should be alleviated and may eventually disappear in the online market due to the reduced search cost for both price and product features. However, recent studies found a surprisingly high level of <b>price</b> <b>dispersion</b> online, even for standardized items such as books, CDs and DVDs. There is some evidence of a shrinking of this online <b>price</b> <b>dispersion,</b> but it remains significant. Recently, work has also been done in the area of e-commerce, specifically the Semantic Web, and its effects on <b>price</b> <b>dispersion.</b>|$|E
50|$|In economics, <b>price</b> <b>dispersion</b> is {{variation}} in prices across sellers {{of the same}} item, holding fixed the item's characteristics. <b>Price</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{can be viewed as}} a measure of trading frictions (or, tautologically, as a violation of the law of one price). It is often attributed to consumer search costs or unmeasured attributes (such as the reputation) of the retailing outlets involved. There is a difference between <b>price</b> <b>dispersion</b> and price discrimination. The latter concept involves a single provider charging different prices to different customers for an identical good. <b>Price</b> <b>dispersion,</b> on the other hand, is best thought of as the outcome of many firms potentially charging different prices, where customers of one firm find it difficult to patronize (or are perhaps unaware of) other firms due to the existence of search costs.|$|E

40|$|Past {{studies in}} the {{literature}} of the law of one price (LOP) show statistically significant but economically subtle roles of geographical distance in regional <b>price</b> <b>dispersions.</b> In this paper, we challenge this empirical "death of distance" as a primary source of LOP violations investigating a unique daily data set of wholesale prices of agricultural products in Japan that enables us to identify source regions and observe product-delivery patterns to consuming regions. We build a simple structural model to explain the observed product-delivery patterns and argue that ignoring the underlying delivery choice results in a serious under-bias toward inferences on distance effects on regional <b>price</b> <b>dispersions</b> due to sample selection. Estimating a sample-selection model, on which theoretical restrictions of our structural model are imposed, with data of several agricultural products, we find quite large estimates of the distance elasticity of price differential compared with conventional estimates. This paper, hence, provides evidence that conventional estimates of the distance elasticity could be heavily biased downwards and spuriously underestimate the role transportation costs play in regional <b>price</b> <b>dispersions</b> and LOP violations. law of one price; regional price dispersion; transportation cost; geographical distance; agricultural wholesale price; sample-selection bias...|$|R

A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that indirect tax rate harmonization, convergence of nontraded input costs, and convergence of traded input costs (in the form of exchange rate stability and increased openness) are all important in explaining European price level convergence.

50|$|In economics, {{a market}} is {{transparent}} if much is known by many about: What {{products and services}} or capital assets are available, market depth (quantity available), What price, and Where. Transparency is important since {{it is one of}} the theoretical conditions required for a free market to be efficient. Price transparency can, however, lead to higher prices. For example, if it makes sellers reluctant to give steep discounts to certain buyers (e.g. disrupting <b>price</b> <b>dispersion</b> among buyers), or if it facilitates collusion, and price volatility is another concern. A high degree of market transparency can result in disintermediation due to the buyer's increased knowledge of supply pricing.|$|E
5000|$|The Bertrand model {{rests on}} some very extreme assumptions. For example, {{it assumes that}} {{consumers}} want to buy from the lowest priced firm.

The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result - that price is driven down to marginal cost - no longer holds.

5000|$|... 1. [...] "Money and the Dispersion of Relative Prices", Journal of Political Economy, April 1981.Variability {{over time}} in {{aggregate}} indices of price level, such as the CPI, {{is often associated with}} a greater dispersion in relative prices at a point in time. To model this phenomenon, Zvi Hercowitz uses a variant of the celebrated Lucas-Barro island model. In a world where people have incomplete information, individuals are confronted with the problem of determining whether price changes in specific goods are caused by general price inflation or by shifts in the supply and demand for this good. In the Lucas-Barro island model perfectly perceived money growth should not affect relative prices. Money growth has to be unperceived to have real effects. Using data from the German hyperinflation, an equation that relates price change dispersion to exogenous unperceived money shocks is estimated. Zvi finds that unperceived money growth does affect <b>price</b> <b>dispersion,</b> as the model predicts, while perceived money has no effect. This paper derives from Zvi's thesis at the University of Rochester.|$|E
40|$|We use the {{multi-sector}} and multi-country G-Cubed {{model to}} explore the potential role of three major shocks – to productivity, risk premia and US monetary policy – to explain the large movements in relative prices between 2002 and 2008.

The effect of US monetary policy shocks on relative prices was most pronounced in countries that fix their currency to the US dollar. Those countries that float were largely shielded from these effects. We conclude that the shocks we consider cannot fully capture the magnitude of the relative price movements over this period, suggesting that other driving forces could also be responsible, including those outside of the model. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between inflation rate and relative price variability using data of prices on 23 disaggregated food items since 1960 to 2003 in Chile. The behavior of inflation rate is quite variable in that country during that time span and more interestingly, there are periods of time in which prices were determined (fixed) by the economic authorities. We find consistent evidence that a larger inflation rate causes a larger relative price variability and this effect is much larger in periods in which prices were fixed. We interpret that result as firms over-reacting to inflation when setting their relative prices if they assume that {{it is unlikely to}} reset their prices in the near future. That result holds even if we follow different econometric approaches and it holds for all the food products considered. Inflation, <b>price</b> <b>dispersions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the optimal pricing strategies with reference effects in revenue management settings. We firstly propose a static pricing model with the properties of stochastic demand, finite horizon and fixed capacity, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution.

We present numerical examples in both low demand situations and high demand situations for different levels of reference effects and different updating frequencies. The results show that the dynamic pricing strategies are superior to a static one even when reference effects are taken into consideration.
