40|$|From an {{object-oriented}} perspective, {{this paper}} investigates the interdisciplinary aspects of problem representation {{as well the}} differences between representation of <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind and that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> machine. By defining an object as {{a combination of a}} symbol-structure and its associated operations, it shows how the representation of problems can become related to control, which conducts <b>the</b> search <b>in</b> finding a solution. Different types of representation of <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> machine are classified into four categories, and in a similar way four distinct models are distinguished for <b>the</b> representation of <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind.

In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert's fifth <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of compact groups.

5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures.

The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe.

5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E

Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
