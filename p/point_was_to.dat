5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was {{made clear that the}} Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E

American Woolen Company agreed {{to most of}} the strikers' demands on March 12, 1912. The strikers had demanded an end to the Premium System, where a portion of their earnings were subject to month-long production and attendance standards. The mill owners only concession on this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> change the award of the premium from once every four weeks to once every two weeks.

Two months later, on Garcia's fifteenth birthday, his mother bought an accordion for him, to his great disappointment. Garcia had long been captivated by many rhythm and blues artists, especially Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley: his one wish at this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have an electric guitar. After some pleading, his mother exchanged the accordion for a Danelectro with a small amplifier at a local pawnshop. Garcia's stepfather, who was somewhat proficient with instruments, helped tune his guitar to an unusual open tuning.|$|E

They would then proceed to Danville, Virginia, the destination of the fleeing Confederate government, and then south to join with the Confederate force in North Carolina under the command of General Joseph Johnston. After dark, Lee began the evacuation of his troops from Petersburg and Richmond. The city of Richmond was evacuated that night, and the Confederate government fled. Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell, in charge of the city's defenses, was ordered to destroy anything of military value. Civilians rioted and great conflagrations engulfed the city.|$|E

The prologue to the first film, for instance, features the History of the One Ring theme, Lothlórien theme, The Mordor accompaniments, Sauron's theme, the Servants of Sauron theme, the Fall of Men, Aragorn's theme and the Shire theme and variations and at some <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> feature the second-age Gondor theme and the Power of Mordor as well. The main Lord of the Rings theme appears on the main title, while the main theme of each individual episode appears on the second title. Shore used the first film to introduce the principle themes, the second film to add more themes and the third film to create conflict and cross-overs between the existing themes {{and bring them to}} a resolution, creating in the process new themes for the Forth Age.|$|E

Following his completion of the course, he reported to the 82nd Airborne Division in North Africa in 1943; he would participate in all four of its combat jumps in World War II. He was soon promoted to executive officer of the 2d Battalion. Two months later, he was again promoted, to S3 of the Regiment. He made his first of four combat jumps as an executive officer, participating in the Invasion of Sicily. After returning to North Africa, he made a second combat jump into Salerno, Italy, blocking German forces who were trying to attack US amphibious forces. His third jump was in support of the Invasion of Normandy on D-Day, June 4, 1944. In July of that year, he assumed command of the 3d Battalion; he was promoted the next month to G3 of the 82d Airborne Division.

The see of Gloucester lent their cathedral choir for this service, {{making it possible to}} hear choral music in Llandaff Cathedral {{for the first time since}} 1691. The restoration done up to this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> remove all traces of the Italian temple and to repair damages caused by the attempt to transform the cathedral by Wood.

500|$|The Hidden Planet by Malcolm Hulke was {{commissioned}} in December 1963 {{and at one}} <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be the seventh serial of Series 1. The story would have concerned a planet in an orbit opposite Earth's, with a parallel {{but in some ways}} opposite society to ours; for example, women were to be the dominant sex and all clovers would have four leaves. The original script was sent back for rewrites, and due to a pay dispute the rewrites were not made until after Susan had left the series; this necessitated further rewriting. A third submission was similarly rejected as Ian and Barbara were due to leave, and the script was dropped. [...] The story was the subject of an April Fool's Day prank in 1983, when Doctor Who Magazine issue 76 claimed that one episode had in fact been filmed and rediscovered, and would be integrated into a twentieth anniversary special co-starring the Fifth Doctor entitled The Phoenix Rises.|$|E

He elaborated, [...] "The main <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> ease the hearts and minds of anyone who have suffered from an unthinkable loss. I also originally wrote the song as comfort to the idea that death is a part of the cycle of life and a loved one's life should be celebrated. In New Orleans, a funeral in some ways is a parade. They march through the streets with the casket and play jazz. Think of it as one final celebration." [...] Beyoncé explained on her iTunes Radio channel that [...] "Heaven" [...] was about [...] "death and finding the strength in knowing that someone had an incredible life and that giving you some type of closure". Todd Tourso, the director of the song's music video, stated that [...] "Heaven" [...] was inspired by the death of her mother's best friend and its impact on her life.|$|E
500|$|By 20 February the RPF had {{advanced}} to within [...] of the capital, Kigali, and many observers believed {{an assault on}} the city to be imminent. The assault did not happen, however, and the RPF instead declared a ceasefire. Whether or not the RPF actually intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later stated that his aim at this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> inflict as much damage as possible on FAR forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory. Kagame told Stephen Kinzer that such a victory would end international goodwill towards the RPF and lead to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one. However, the increased presence of French troops on the ground and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant that an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation. Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory, but he overruled them. By the end of the February war, over one million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date.|$|E

The order of march was: CTroop to deal with any opposition on route, DTroop [...] who were to force an entrance into the battery, ATroop to [...] provide covering fire for the assaulting troops. In the assault ETroop would take the left hand guns, and FTroop the right. Bringing up the rear was the headquarters and the heavy weapons troop. The heavy weapons troop set up a fire base to support both the French and British attacks if needed. Progress along the road was rapid with only intermittent artillery fire slowing them down.

On the topic, Rhimes elabroated, [...] "The interns are residents now, with interns of their own. Except for George, poor George, who is stuck repeating his intern year. It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. Because he knows what he is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman." [...] Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot deal with all that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. [...] Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, [...] "Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all your words in, believe me." [...] Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former [...] "off the hook" [...] for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. [...] "She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women.
