It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
40|$|Publisher東京論文The {{notion of}} play {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of activities such as card games, digital games, hobbies, and sports. Although we consider such playful activities to be ordinary these days, the explicit meaning of play or difference between <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game is unclear. This paper attempts to understand the historical changes in the meaning of play that can be found in academic discourse in order to explore a new direction of play study within sociological contexts. By reviewing the various theories of both <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game, we can come {{to a better understanding of}} how the notions of play differ between English and Japanese because Japanese lacks an explicit translation for the words "game" and "ludic. " To achieve this outcome, we must first adjust the main difference between the two languages. Furthermore, this paper elucidates that sociology in Europe and the United States has focused on "game" to understand play. In contrast, Japanese sociology refers to neither game nor play, instead distinguishes between leisure and work. This paper seeks to bridge the gaps between the understanding of <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game in English and Japanese. In addition, this paper investigates the significant shift in the meaning of <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game brought about by the recent information technology revolution. It shows that the development of digital games can be seen as a starting point to form a new definition of <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game from interdisciplinary perspectives. In this phenomenon, new play researchers have begun to define <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game. This paper also reviews some definitions of <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game used in digital technologies and introduces the new direction of <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game studies, such as "Ludology. " Finally, by locating digital games as the central subject of play research, new definitions of <b>play</b> <b>and</b> game de-emphasize the division between <b>play</b> <b>and</b> work seen in previous sociological research...|$|R
