From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An advantage of the design is that users will not get splashed from below. Washout toilets have a shallow pool of water into which waste is deposited, with a trapped drain just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this pool of water by being swept over into the trap (usually either a <b>P-trap</b> or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. Washout pans were amongst the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in continental Europe. A washout toilet is a kind of flush toilet which were once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some regions}} of the United States, [...] "S" [...] traps are no longer {{accepted}} by the plumbing codes or are even illegal, as these traps tend to easily siphon dry even when well-vented. It is often possible to tell whether a household uses an S- or U-bend by checking {{for the presence of}} an overflow pipe outlet. What is required instead is a <b>P-trap</b> with proper venting. Certain drum-styled traps are also discouraged or banned.|$|E
50|$|In {{domestic}} applications, traps {{are typically}} U, S, or J-shaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture. An S-shaped trap {{is also known}} as an S-bend. It was invented by Alexander Cummings in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The new U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow. The most common of these traps in houses is referred to as a <b>P-trap.</b> It is the addition of a 90 degree fitting on the outlet side of a U-bend, thereby creating a P-like shape. It is also referred to as a sink trap because it is installed under most house sinks.|$|E
50|$|Water {{lines or}} kitchen systems can get gravel, {{deposits}} that break free, and other stray {{items in the}} line. Due to the velocity of the water pushing them, they can severely damage or clog devices installed in the flow stream of the water line, for example <b>p-traps</b> or pipes. A strainer is essentially a screen installed to allow water to pass through, but not larger items. The larger items fall to the bottom or are held in a basket for later clean out. They normally have an access that allows {{for them to be}} cleaned or have the strainer plate or basket replaced.|$|R

40|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in rivers can change intermittently within minutes {{depending on the}} weather and water discharge (Q), or activities in the watershed. Accordingly, accurate estimation of the annual DRP load requires frequent sampling or even continuous monitoring, which is laborious and cost-intensive. We present the design and laboratory evaluation of a new, robust, low-cost, low-tech device based on passive samplers (<b>P-traps).</b> The traps use Fe-(oxy) hydroxide coated quartz sand as an adsorbent enclosed in a vertical grid of individual cells separated from the river water by filter membranes. They are inexpensive, easy to handle, resistant to repeated desiccation and immersion and exposable for several months. They permit estimation of discharge dependent time weighted average DRP concentrations (C-Q relationships) and annual P loads of rivers characterized by highly variable DRP concentrations with a relative accuracy of +/- 3 %...|$|R
50|$|Alternately if moving sink to {{an island}} sink, install the <b>P-trap</b> below {{the floor of the}} island and vent {{off the top of the}} drain. Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain. Slope drain down, slope vent up, and attach to {{existing}} vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned. Patch previously existing drain to become vent. In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g. 1.25 inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|E

40|$|Six {{types of}} {{pheromone}} traps were tested between 2012 and 2014 in the High Tatra Mountains, northern Slovakia. Traps were baited with lures for attracting the European {{spruce bark beetle}} (Ips typographus L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae). Among the tested traps, four types are commercial products; Theysohn (T-trap), Ecotrap (E-trap), Lindgren funnel trap (L-trap), BEKA trap (B-trap) and two are our newly developed models; Funnel trap (<b>P-trap)</b> and Cross trap (K-trap). The traps were set up on ten selected sites and tested during three growing seasons (2012, 2013 and 2014). The newly developed models were compared to the commercially available models for trapping efficiency of target pest, {{easy to use and}} impact on non-target insect species. We found that the best commercially available model is the L-trap, however the bottom of L-trap is considered too shallow resulting in an accumulation of rainwater that increases the traps attractiveness for Silphids. In our experiment, the newly developed models; <b>P-trap</b> and K-trap performed better compared to commercially used models. <b>P-trap</b> caught 28 % more I. typographus and K-trap caught 57 % more beetles compared to T-trap in 2014.

In this investigation a number of reactive and alkaline sorbents were tested for their P removal efficiencies in the environment of anaerobic sediments. Batch, pot and column experiments were performed and simulated real bottom conditions. The calcium silicate material Polonite®, a commercial product for <b>P-traps</b> in wastewater treatment, performed best particularly as used for thin-layer placement. The by-product AOD slag also showed promising sorption capacity. The presence of P in the materials after four months use at sediment surfaces was documented by means of ESEM-EDS and the analysis with XANES revealed that for Polonite, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and apatite had formed when saturated with pore water from anaerobic sediments. This study shows promising results for reactive materials to be used as binding agents for the sequestration of P from sediment.

40|$|Background: In crops, {{inflorescence}} {{complexity and}} the shape {{and size of the}} seed are among the most important characters that influence yield. For example, rice panicles vary considerably in the number and order of branches, elongation of the axis, {{and the shape}} and size of the seed. Manual low-throughput phenotyping methods are time consuming, and the results are unreliable. However, high-throughput image analysis of the qualitative and quantitative traits of rice panicles is essential for understanding the diversity of the panicle as well as for breeding programs. Results: This paper presents <b>P-TRAP</b> software (Panicle TRAit Phenotyping), a free open source application for high-throughput measurements of panicle architecture and seed-related traits. The software is written in Java and can be used with different platforms (the user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) uses Netbeans Platform 7. 3). The application offers three main tools: a tool for the analysis of panicle structure, a spikelet/grain counting tool, and a tool for the analysis of seed shape. The three tools can be used independently or simultaneously for analysis of the same image. Results are then reported in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Comma Separated Values (CSV) file formats. Images of rice panicles were used to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the software. Compared to data obtained by manual processing, <b>P-TRAP</b> produced reliable results in a much shorter time. In addition, manual processing is not repeatable because dry panicles are vulnerable to damage. The software is very useful, practical an...|$|E
30|$|Panicle {{architectural}} {{traits in}} rice (branching, rachis length, spikelet number) are established between panicle initiation and heading stages. They vary among genotypes and {{are prone to}} Genotype x Environment interactions. Together with panicle number, panicle architecture determines sink-based yield potential. Numerous studies analyzed genetic and environmental variation of plant morphology, but the plasticity of panicle structure is less well understood. This study addressed the response of rice panicle size and structure to limited light availability at plant level for near-isogenic lines (NILs) with IR 64 or IRRI 146 backgrounds, carrying the QTL qTSN 4 (syn. SPIKE) for large panicles. Full light and shading in the greenhouse and two population densities in the field were implemented.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to better {{quantify}} the variation of panicle size and architecture caused by qTSN 4 and to assess to which extent its genetic background and environmental factors affect phenotypic plasticity. For this purpose, the NILs developed by Fujita et al. (2009, 2012, 2013) and their recurrent parents, differing in panicle size, were grown into two experiments with two treatments providing differential plant access to light: a greenhouse experiment (Montpellier, France) with a full light and shading treatment during panicle development, and a field trial (IRRI, Philippines) characterized with two population densities. Panicle structure was phenotyped using detached panicles characterized by the software <b>P-TRAP</b> (Panicle TRAit Phenotyping) developed by Al-Tam et al. (2013). The specific objectives were to (1) determine the plasticity of qTSN 4 phenotypes in the different environments, (2) analyze which structural traits of the panicle vary as panicle size varies, and (3) relate variation of panicle size to pre-floral stem growth rates.|$|E
30|$|The five plants {{harvested}} at maturity in GH {{were separated}} into panicles (after taken pictures for <b>P-TRAP</b> analysis), green leaf blades, senescent leaves, and productive stems (culms[*]+[*]sheaths). In the field, we harvested all the plants within a soil base area of 0.12  m 2 per plot that is 3 plants under LD and 12 plants under HD. They were then separated into panicles, green leaf blades, dead tissues and productive stems. The panicles were hand-threshed {{and then the}} filled spikelets were separated from the unfilled by a densitometric column (in GH) or submerging the spikelets in the water (in the field). Yield components were determined as panicle number per plant, 1000 filled grain dry weight (the grain number was counted by a grain counter in GH and manually up to 100 grain number in the field), filled grain weight and filled grain number per panicle (considering 1000 grain dry weight), filled grain weight per square meter (considering plant density). In the field, the filling rate per square meter (ratio of filled number on total spikelet number) was also determined.|$|E

The system’s proposed area of operation is the waters of Indonesia, as current antipiracy solutions are not feasible due to the region’s unique physical geography. Worldwide deployment is possible with minimal modifications. The systems engineering process was used to identify a system that effectively and economically prevents pirates from boarding commercial vessels. A model of the operational environment was developed in MATLAB to run simulations designed to estimate the relative effectiveness of each assessed countermeasure. A cost analysis was performed on the most effective system configurations to determine economic feasibility; the best-value system was recommended. The results of the project indicated that the <b>P-Trap</b> countermeasure, designed to entangle the pirate’s propellers with thin lines, is both effective and economically viable for wide-scale deployment.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for rapidly screening and quantitatively analyzing organic molecules is presented, {{in which a}} miniaturized solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge containing 0. 6 mg of graphitized carbon black (the GCB-mu-trap) is used for sample pretreatment. Then surface-assisted laser desorption ionization dine-of-flight mass spectrometry (SALDI-TOF-MS) screening is followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for robust quantitative analysis of samples containing analytes of interest. Liquid samples with volumes up to 100 mL were extracted using the GCB-mu-trap, and SALDI screening was performed by transferring a few particles of the GCB 4 sorbent from the mu-trap onto a stainless steel plate. Analytes were then simply ionized and desorbed by irradiating the GCB 4 particles without any further pretreatment. GCB 4 {{was found to be}} an excellent surface for the SALDI analysis of small molecules, providing spectra with very clean backgrounds. The small size of the cartridge (micropipet filter tip) results in enrichment of the analytes on a small surface area, affording low SALDI-TOF-MS detection limits. Furthermore, the removal of just a few particles from the <b>p-trap</b> does not significantly affect the subsequent quantitative determination. This approach offers considerable reductions in analytical costs by eliminating unnecessary SPE-LC/MS analyses...|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on two recipient lines (IR 64, IRRI 146) and their isolines (NIL) carrying qTSN 4 (syn. SPIKE), a QTL enhancing spikelet number per panicle (Fujita et al. 2009, 2012, 2013). This QTL was reported to improve, in addition to panicle size and sink capacity, assimilate source traits such as flag leaf size (Adriani et al. 2016) and carboxylation capacity (Fabre et al. 2016), owing to the association of Nal 1 gene within this QTL (Fujita et al. 2013). This might suggest that qTSN 4 effects on panicle size are not directly controlled by qTSN 4 but indirectly via whole-plant assimilate source-sink relations. If its effect on panicle size is indirect, we can {{expect it to be}} (1) highly prone to GxE interactions (Zhuang et al. 1997; Kobayashi et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2008), (2) non-specific with respect to panicle architectural traits (conservation of structural allometric relationships as panicle size varies), and (3) associated with pre-floral growth rate which is known to physiologically control panicle size (Horie et al. 2003; Kamiji et al. 2011). To test these hypotheses, we challenged NILs for qTSN 4 with variable light resources, focused on structural panicle traits and determined their relationship with pre-floral growth rates. The fine characterization of panicle architectural plasticity was made possible here by using an original, dedicated software <b>P-TRAP</b> (Al-Tam et al. 2013) and comparing i) control and shaded plants during panicle formation in a greenhouse experiment in Montpellier and ii) low and high-density crops in the field at IRRI in the Philippines.|$|E
40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has brought}} about {{tremendous}} changes in the nuclear complex of the Department of Energy. One of the many changes has been the shutdown or decommissioning of many facilities that performed nuclear work. One of the steps {{in the process of}} decommissioning a facility involves the decontamination or removal of drain lines or pipes that may have carried radioactive materials at one time. The removal of all these pipes and drain lines to a nuclear disposal facility could be quite costly. It was suggested by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) that a germanium spectrometer could be built that could fit through straight pipes with a diameter as small as 5. 08 cm (2 inches) and pass through curved pipes with a diameter as small as 7. 6 cm (3 inches) such as that of a 3 -inch <b>p-trap</b> in a drain line. The germanium spectrometer could then be used to simultaneously determine all gamma-ray emitting radionuclides in or surrounding the pipe. By showing the absence of any gamma-ray emitting radionuclides, the pipes could then be reused in place or disposed of as non-radioactive material, thus saving significantly in disposal costs. A germanium spectrometer system has been designed by PNNL and fabricated by Princeton Gamma Tech (PGT) that consists of three segments, each 4. 84 cm in diameter and about 10 cm in length. Flexible stainless steel bellows were used to connect the segments. Segment 1 is a small liquid nitrogen reservoir. The reservoir is filled with a sponge-like material which enables the detector to be used in any orientation. A Stirling cycle refrigerator is under development which can replace the liquid nitrogen reservoir to provide continuous cooling and operation...|$|E

The image analysis tool <b>P-TRAP</b> was {{used to analyze the}} architecture of detached panicles. Results: The qTSN 4 increased total branch length, branching frequency and spikelet number per panicle in IRRI 146 background in the field and greenhouse, and in IR 64 background in the greenhouse, but not for IR 64 in the field. In the field, however, qTSN 4 reduced panicle number, neutralizing any potential yield gains from panicle size. Shading during panicle development reduced spikelet and branch number but qTSN 4 mitigated partly this effect. Spikelet number over total branch length (spikelet density) was a stable allometry across genotypes and treatments with variation in spikelet number mainly due to the frequency of secondary branches. Spikelet number on the main tiller was correlated with stem growth rate during panicle development, indicating that effects on panicle size seemed related to resources available per tiller. Conclusions: The qTSN 4 effects on panicle spikelet number appear as indirect and induced by upstream effects on pre-floral assimilate resources at tiller level, as they were (1) prone to G x E interactions, (2) non-specific with respect to panicle architectural traits, and (3) associated with pre-floral stem growth rate.
