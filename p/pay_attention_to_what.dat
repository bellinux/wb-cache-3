500|$|The episode's script parodied {{parents who}} voiced strong {{opposition}} to South Park, portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that {{they fail to}} <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is actually {{going on in their}} children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the Terrance and Phillip show. This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, [...] "I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids." ...|$|E

He further commented that the song is [...] "genuine happy-feeling. It sounds lame at first but <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she's singing; that vocal smile changes everything."

Your chief of police doesn't want to interfere with the federal agents here, and the federal agents are instructed not to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is called 'spy hysteria,' and so they're letting things slide.

So I'll start out on my own responsibility." ...|$|E
60|$|The lady, {{whose name}} was Mrs. Shutterfield, shook hands with us and seemed very glad to see us, and the minister's wife took our hand bags from us and told the men where to carry our trunks. Mrs. Shutterfield took us into a little parlor {{on one side of}} the hall, and then we three sat down, and I must say I was so busy looking at the queer, {{delightful}} room, with everything in it--chairs, tables, carpets, walls, pictures, and flower-vases--all belonging to a bygone epoch, though perfectly fresh, as if just made, that I could scarcely <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the lady said. But I listened enough to know that Mrs. Shutterfield told us that she had taken the liberty of engaging for us two most excellent servants, who had lived in the house before it had been let to lodgers, and who, she was quite sure, would suit us very well, though, of course, we were at liberty to do what we pleased about engaging them. The one that I took for the minister's wife was a combination of cook and housekeeper, by the name of Miss Pondar, and the other was a maid in general, named Hannah. When the lady mentioned two servants it took me a little aback, for we had not expected to have more than one, but when she mentioned the wages, and I found that both put together did not cost as much as a very poor cook would expect in America, and when I remembered we as now at work socially booming ourselves, and that it wouldn't do to let this lady think that we had not been accustomed to varieties of servants, I spoke up and said we would engage the two estimable women she recommended, and was much obliged to her for getting them.|$|E

40|$|We can {{distinguish}} {{different forms of}} <b>attention,</b> for example <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we are thinking about, <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we hear, and <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we see or otherwise visually experience. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} form of <b>attention</b> paid <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we visually experience – visual attention. A natural way to think of visual attention is as sufficient for visual awareness: visually attending to an object is sufficient for being visually aware of it. (Plausibly, the relationship is closer. Visual attention is a way of being visually aware.) But we shouldn’t think of visual attention as necessary for visual awareness: we can be visually aware of objects that we are not visually attending to. In this thesis I provide a novel defence of the pre-theoretical conception of visual attention as sufficient, but not necessary, for visual awareness. Some psychologists have interpreted evidence, in particular from experiments involving subjects with blindsight, as proof that visual <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> an object is possible {{in the absence of any}} visual awareness of it. I argue we should not think of these results as proving that attention is not sufficient for awareness, but instead see them as motivation for a distinctively philosophical inquiry into the role of visual attention. I examine different explanations of the significance of visual attention for thought and action, ending with my own. Other psychologists have claimed, on the basis of experimental data, that visual attention is necessary for visual awareness. I argue this is inconsistent with the phenomenology of visual experience, and with other experimental data. I conclude that visual attention is sufficient but not necessary for visual awareness...|$|R
