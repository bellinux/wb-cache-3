50|$|Sinusoidal {{capillaries}} (also {{known as}} a discontinuous capillary) are a special type of open-pore capillary, that have larger openings (30-40 µm in diameter) in the endothelium. These types of blood vessels allow red and white blood cells (7.5 µm - 25 µm diameter) and various serum proteins to pass, aided by a discontinuous basal lamina. These capillaries lack pinocytotic vesicles, and therefore utilize gaps present in cell junctions to <b>permit</b> <b>transfer</b> between endothelial cells, and hence across the membrane. Sinusoid blood vessels are primarily located in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands. Some sinusoids are distinctive in {{that they do not}} have the tight junctions between cells.

40|$|Although embryo {{transfer}} techniques {{are widely used}} around the world, variability {{in response to the}} superstimulatory treatments remains an important limitation. With a better understanding of ovarian function has come a greater capability of controlling it. Recent protocols, designed to control both luteal and follicular function, permit the initiation of superstimulatory treatments at a self-appointed time and provide the possibilities for superstimulation of cows. Ultrasound guided follicle aspiration (superstimulation is initiated 1 or 2 days later) and estradiol and progesterone treatments (superstimulation is initiated 4 days later) have been widely used in superstimulation protocols, with equivalent embryo production to that of donor cows superstimulated using the traditional approach beginning 8 to 12 d after estrus.
