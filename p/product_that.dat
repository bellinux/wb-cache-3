5|$|Armillaria gallica {{can produce}} cyclobutane-containing {{metabolites}} such as arnamiol, a natural <b>product</b> <b>that</b> {{is classified as}} a sesquiterpenoid aryl ester. Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other Armillaria species are thought {{to play a role}} in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection.|$|E
5|$|Battarrea phalloides (as well as Battarrea stevenii) is {{typically}} described as unknown edibility, or inedible. In Cyprus, the immature egg-form {{of the fruit}} body is eaten. Older specimens may smell unpleasant. The spores of B.stevenii are used as a cicatrizant—a <b>product</b> <b>that</b> promotes healing through the formation of scar tissue–by the Criollo herdsmen of Gran Chaco in northern Argentina.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil <b>product</b> <b>that</b> is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E

The <b>products</b> <b>that</b> make the most profit are usually the core <b>products.</b> Other <b>products</b> <b>that</b> are not considered core {{products are}} called side projects, side products and experimental products.|$|R
5|$|Beer {{was spread}} through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes {{as far back}} as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on a {{domestic}} scale. The <b>product</b> <b>that</b> the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs. What they did not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 {{the firm}} {{received}} its first royal warrant, as tobacconist to Edward, Prince of Wales. Dunhill also supplied Winston Churchill and Siegfried Sassoon. The 1920s {{also saw the}} opening of shops in New York and Paris. Bloomberg Businessweek opined that Dunhill prefigured the modern luxury goods market with its international ambitions. In 1924 the company launched the Unique lighter, a <b>product</b> <b>that</b> Dunhill and his brother Herbert had much interest in developing, and was the world's first lighter that could be operated with just one hand.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, BK {{introduced}} its BK Baguette line of sandwiches designed {{to replace the}} Chicken Whopper. The sandwiches were introduced {{at the insistence of}} the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories. The line was a health conscious oriented <b>product</b> <b>that</b> got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK Baguette line of sandwiches, that replacing the Chicken Whopper sandwiches.|$|E

50|$|As {{encryption}} software {{is an important}} component in providing protection from cybercrime, there are many, many software <b>products</b> <b>that</b> provide encryption. Because there are so many software <b>products</b> <b>that</b> provide encryption, a good way to begin understanding this topic is classification by categorization.|$|R
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) <b>product</b> <b>that</b> provides protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits and Trojan horses. Before version 4.5, MSE ran on , Windows Vista and Windows 7, but not on Windows 8 and later, which have built-in AV components. MSE 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP. The license agreement allows home users and small businesses to install and use the product free of charge. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 protected users from only adware and spyware.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's {{decision}} was correct because Bowman had created a new <b>product</b> <b>that</b> infringed on their patent. They further argued {{that this was not}} an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is The Black Album by Prince. The album {{was to have been}} a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided to pull the album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed. A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Ultra Rare Trax series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that digital remastering onto compact disc could produce a high-quality <b>product</b> <b>that</b> was comparable with official studio releases.|$|E

5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood <b>product</b> <b>that</b> benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished <b>product</b> <b>that</b> was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner <b>product</b> <b>that</b> allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien based Quenya {{pronunciation}} more on Latin than on Finnish. Thus, Quenya {{lacks the}} vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish, and accent {{is not always}} on the first syllable of a word. Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö, ä and y are lacking in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or {{the development of the}} syllables ti > si in both languages. The combination of a Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a <b>product</b> <b>that</b> resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien's favourite modern Romance language.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil <b>product</b> <b>that</b> became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, sparkling Champagne {{is not the}} only <b>product</b> <b>that</b> is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de Champagne. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small.|$|E
