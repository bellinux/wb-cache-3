5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

The distal joint is subsequently drawn into hyperextension because the two peripheral slips of the extensor tendon are stretched by the head of the proximal phalanx (note that the two peripheral slips are inserted into the distal phalanx, while the proximal slip is inserted into the middle phalanx).

40|$|Abstract】Objective: <b>Interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> con-tracture is a {{challenging}} complication of hand trauma, which reduces the functional {{capacity of the}} entire hand. In this study we evaluated the results of soft tissue distraction with no collateral ligament transection or volar plate removal in comparison with traditional operation of contracture re-lease and partial ligament transection and volar plate removal. Methods: In this prospective study, a total of 40 pa-tients in two equal groups (A and B) were studied. Patients suffering from chronic flexion contracture of abrasive trau-matic nature were included. Group A were treated by soft tissue distraction using pentagonal frame technique and in Group B the contracture release was followed by finger splinting. Results: Analyzed data revealed a significant differ-ence {{between the two groups}} for range of motion in the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints</b> (P 0. 05). There was not {{a significant difference in the}} degrees of flexion contracture between groups (P> 0. 05). Regression analysis showed that using pentagonal frame technique significantly increased the mean improvement in range of motion of proxi-mal <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints</b> (P< 0. 001), while the higher the preoperative flexion contracture was observed in <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints,</b> the lower improvement was achieved in range of motion of <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints</b> after intervention (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Soft tissue distraction using pentagonal frame technique with gradual and continuous collateral liga-ment and surrounding joint tissues distraction combined with skin Z-plasty significantly improves the range of mo-tion in patients with chronic traumatic flexion deformity of <b>proximal</b> and/or distal <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints.</b> Key words: Osteogenesis, distraction; Finger joint; Hand deformitie...|$|R
