40|$|Exhausting {{activity}} {{results in}} a marked and immediate drop in blood pH which gradually returns to normal over the following 6 h. The acidosis is caused largely by elevated PCOi levels, which vary inversely with pH. Blood lactate concentration increases slowly, reaching a maximum at 2 - 4 h post-exercise, and contributes significantly to the acidosis only late in the recovery period. The slow time course of lactic acid release into the blood permits temporal separation of the peak metabolic acidosis from the peak respiratory acidosis. Evidence is presented that a metabolic acid other than lactic also makes a modest contribution to the <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> during the recovery period...|$|E
40|$|Tinodes rostocki larvae (Trichoptera: Psychomyiidae) cover large {{proportions}} of stream hard substrata with retreats constructed of mineral particles and larval silk. We consider these retreats as 3 -dimensional {{extensions of the}} epilithic biofilm that may possess a distinct microenvironment, community metabolism and composition. Therefore, we compared the photosynthetic/respiratory activities (O₂ and pH microsensors) and the photopigment composition (HPLC) of larval retreats and the surrounding epilithic biofilms. In retreats, pigment contents and photosynthetic/respiratory activities were highest in sections with a visible microphytobenthic biofilm that were mostly the older parts of the retreats. In contrast, newly constructed sections of the retreats and the surrounding epilithic biofilm had approximately 5 -fold lower values. The fucoxanthin-to-chlorophyll ratio of the retreat biofilm was high (fuco/chl a = 1. 27) and indicated diatom dominance, which was not evident in the surrounding epilithic biofilm (fuco/chl a = 0. 15). Experimental transplantation of larval retreats to microscope slides allowed microsensor measurements through the 500 to 700 µm-thick wall and inside the lumen. In the light, O₂ concentration and pH values increased significantly across the wall and remained high in the lumen of the retreat, whereas in darkness O 2 and <b>pH</b> <b>depressions</b> in both wall and lumen were moderate or even absent. Our data suggest that T. rostocki larvae construct and maintain retreats with a particular physico-chemical microenvironment that favours a distinct microbial community. Thereby, abundant T. rostocki larvae might significantly influence benthic primary production and heterotrophic metabolism in small streams...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT When sperm of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus or Lytechinus pictus are diluted into seawater, {{motility}} is initiated; {{and when}} exposed to egg jelly, an acrosome reaction is induced. In {{the presence of a}} variety of structurally different metal chelators (0. 1 - 1 mM EDTA, EGTA, phenanthroline, dipyridyl, cysteine, or dithiothreitol), motility initiation is delayed and the acrosome reaction is inhibited. Of the metals detected in the sperm of these two species, very low levels of Zn + 2 (0. 1 /~M free Zn ÷z) uniquely prevent this chelator inhibition. L. pictus sperm concentrate 65 Zn+ 2 from seawater, and EDTA removes 50 % of the accumulated ~SZn+ 2 by 5 min. Since both sperm motility and acrosome reactions are in part regulated by intracellular pH (pHi), the effect of chelators on the sperm pH ~ was examined by using the fluorescent pH sensitive probe, 9 -aminoacridine. FDTA depresses sperm pH ~ in both species, and 0. 1 #M free Zn + 2 reverses this <b>pH</b> ~ <b>depression.</b> When sperm are diluted into media that contain chelators, both NH 4 CI and monensin (a Na+/H + ionophore) increase the sperm pH~ and reverse the chelator inhibition of sperm motility and acrosome reactions.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is involved in ATP release from skeletal muscle at low pH. These experiments investigate the signal transduction mechanism linking <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> to CFTR activation and ATP release, and evaluate whether CFTR is involved in ATP release from contracting muscle. Lactic acid treatment elevated interstitial ATP of buffer-perfused muscle and extracellular ATP of L 6 myocytes: this ATP release was abolished by the non-specific CFTR inhibitor, glibenclamide, or the specific CFTR inhibitor, CFTR(inh) - 172, suggesting that CFTR was involved, and by inhibition of lactic acid entry to cells, indicating that intracellular <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> was required. Muscle contractions significantly elevated interstitial ATP, but CFTR(inh) - 172 abolished the increase. The cAMP/PKA pathway {{was involved in the}} signal transduction pathway for CFTR-regulated ATP release from muscle: forskolin increased CFTR phosphorylation and stimulated ATP release from muscle or myocytes; lactic acid increased intracellular cAMP, pCREB and PKA activity, whereas IBMX enhanced ATP release from myocytes. Inhibition of PKA with KT 5720 abolished lactic-acid- or contraction-induced ATP release from muscle. Inhibition of either the Na(+) /H(+) -exchanger (NHE) with amiloride or the Na(+) /Ca(2 +) -exchanger (NCX) with SN 6 or KB-R 7943 abolished lactic-acid- or contraction-induced release of ATP from muscle, suggesting that these exchange proteins may be involved in the activation of CFTR. Our data suggest that CFTR-regulated release contributes to ATP release from contracting muscle in vivo, and that cAMP and PKA are involved in the activation of CFTR during muscle contractions or acidosis; NHE and NCX may be involved in the signal transduction pathway...|$|E

40|$|Calanus glacialis {{strongly}} {{contributes to}} the energy fluxes in Arctic shelf ecosystems. During its life cycle, this copepod species overwinters at depth with physiological adjustments which are yet not fully understood. We therefore assessed key metabolic activities and extracellular pH (pHe) in the haemolymph, seeking to identify the mechanisms which characterize this so called diapause state. For one year we sampled copepods in a high Arctic fjord and found that their enzymatic activities and pHe followed a clear seasonal trend. Both, activities and pHe were high when the copepods were feeding in surface waters in spring. In winter at depth, metabolic enzyme activities and pHe were low (pHe< 6), while lipid catabolism on internal reserves increased. Metabolic activity matched the pHe pattern suggesting that low <b>pH</b> supports metabolic <b>depression.</b> Metabolic enzyme syntheses decreased and copepods descended before food had disappeared. In late winter, metabolic activity increased and the copepods migrated to the surface long before the spring bloom. Our data support that diapause timing is regulated internally, with an early enzyme synthesis that prepares the copepods for activity before spring...|$|R

Given the liability of hyperammonemia for precipitating hepatic encephalopathy (HE), 28 patients affected by stage I HE were equally divided into two groups and maintained up to their death at the highest (5. 4 - 5. 5 mEq/l) or the lowest (3. 5 - 3. 6 mEq/l) normokalemia levels. When compared with the lowest normokalemia group, the highest one showed an early, albeit transient, improvement in the mental state (as assessed by both EEG and psychiatric investigations) {{and to a lesser extent}} in hepatic functions (as assessed by the variations in serum bilirubin, GPT, GGT and plasma prothrombin time). In the highest normokalemia group the survival was also prolonged.

40|$|Life {{histories}} {{and distribution of}} mayflies (Insecta:Ephemeroptera) were investigated in 11 streams in south central Ontario that ranged from highly acidic to circumneutral. At least 29 mayfly species were recorded from the streams, with 16 common enough for life history analysis. Mayfly distribution and diversity were correlated with pH regime and stream size. No mayflies {{were found in the}} smallest, most acid stream, and numbers of mayfly species and their relative abundances generally increased with both increasing stream size and stream pH. Incorporation of life cycle information with distributional data enabled us to determine the precise stream-water pH range encountered by different mayfly life stages in the study streams. Generally, during the period of greatest acid stress in the streams (<b>pH</b> <b>depressions</b> associated with spring snowmelt) the mayflies were present in large or dormant stages, which are believed to be more tolerant of lowered pH.

The coagulation performances were investigated by studying the rate of flocs development, the turbidity removal efficiency and charge neutralization capacity under fixed pH conditions and uncontrolled pH conditions. The effect of pH on coagulation was also studied. The results show that PAC(Al 30) are stable for using as coagulant. PAC(Al 30) causes less <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> than PAC(Al 13). The charge neutralization capacity of PAC(Al 30) is slightly {{lower than that of}} PAC(Al 13) at pH >= 6. 8 and higher at pH <= 6. 5. PAC(Al 30) achieves the most effective turbidity removal in these three coagulants. And it acts effectively within a much broader dosage range and a wider pH range when compared with PAC(Al 13). PAC(Al 30) achieves the highest turbidity removal due to its strong flocs formation capacity.

40|$|Head lettuce, bush {{beans and}} celery were grown in {{subsequent}} years in an experimental field on anthropogenously uncontaminated or heavy metal contaminated soils at a mean pH of 6. 3 ± 0. 1. The contaminated plots were made up by amending or replacing the upper 20 cm soil layer with heavy metal contaminated alluvial top soil. Contamination includes Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu. Phytoavailable fractions of these elements were extracted with 1 M ammonium nitrate. Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu were also determined in the leaves of all three species {{as well as in}} bean pods and celery bulbs. The results show that plant uptake of Cd and Zn increased with increasing soil contamination while the uptake of Pb was low. No dependence of Cu uptake on total soil Cu content could be seen within the given contamination range. The relationship between Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu in plants and ammonium nitrate soil extracts was determined by twofactorial linear regression where r was approximately 0. 8 for Zn, 0. 7 for Cd and 0. 5 for Pb whereas no relationship was found for Cu. For the pot experiments carried out in a greenhouse two different soils (loamy sand, silt loam) were amended with 5 and 10 % metallurgical slag and adjusted to pH levels around 7 and 5 while controls did not contain slag. Phytoavailable heavy metal fractions were extracted from soil samples using ammonium nitrate or Calcium chloride + DTPA (CAT). Spinach was grown on these soils and the concentrations of Cd, Zn, Pb and Cu in the shoots correlated with their concentration in the soil extracts. The uptake of these elements by the plants increased with increasing slag amendment and decreasing <b>pH.</b> Strong <b>depression</b> of growth was observed at a pH around 5 in all treatments of the lighter and in the slag treatments of the heavier soil. In the slag treatments this was accompanied by increased endogenous Cd and Zn concentrations. The plant content of Cd, Zn and Pb correlated better with the ammonium nitrate extractable soil fraction of these elements than in the field experiments (r > 0. 9). Correlations based on the CAT extractable fraction of Cd and Zn yielded values for r around 0. 5 while it was only 0. 1 for Pb.

Background: Comorbid depression is strongly related to decreased QoL in cancer patients and may {{increase the risk of}} mortality. Many psychosocial factors, such as childhood trauma (CT), neuroticism (NE), past history of <b>depression</b> (<b>PH)</b> and current life events (LE) increase the risk of depression. Depression is also associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and patients with comorbid depression and cancer show higher levels compared to patients with either condition alone. Thus, increased inflammation may also be a risk factor for low mood. This thesis explores relationships between inflammation and psychosocial risk factors and their potential as predictive markers for depression in cancer patients. Methods: Ninety-one newly diagnosed cancer patients due for surgical treatment (57 HN and 34 CR) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire before surgery and one, three and six months following surgery. Patients gave blood samples before and one week and one month after surgery to measure levels of C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines and saliva samples before surgery. The Brief Life Events Questionnaire was completed at one month and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Brief COPE at three months. Patients completed a diagnostic interview between three and six months for diagnosis of past or current episode of depression. Results: Childhood trauma, NE, PH and LE were all related to low mood and poorer QoL. Increased inflammation was associated with lower mood post treatment in CR patients, but there were fewer associations in the HN patients.

Few studies have focused on AAPI, and even fewer have reported findings for each AAPI subgroup separately despite the unique characteristics of each subgroup. Using the aggregate group makes identifying actual differences in health and mental health of these subgroups difficult. As a result, {{little is known about the}} specific characteristics of AAPI subgroups. To fill this gap in knowledge, the purpose of this study was to a) identify the prevalence of current depression, substance use (smoking and alcohol use) and chronic illnesses (diabetes, cardiovascular disease and asthma) among AAPI adults in Hawaii; (b) determine if there are significant differences in the prevalence of current depression, substance use, and chronic illnesses between AA and PI adults in Hawaii, and (c) determine if there is a relationship between current depression, substance use, chronic illnesses and individual characteristics (such as age, gender, employment status, educational level, frequency of emotional support, life satisfaction and healthcare access) among AAPI adults in Hawaii. Using the 2008 data from Hawaii Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (HBRFSS), significant differences in prevalence of current depression between AA and PI were found. Pis in Hawaii were two times more likely to have severe/moderately severe depression compared to AAs. The prevalence of moderate and mild depression, among AA and PI did not differ significantly.

Lactic acid (LA) was infused into the arterial supply of the buffer-perfused rat hindlimb muscle; ATP concentrations were measured by HPLC in interstitial microdialysate from soleus muscle. Inhibitors of several ATP transporters were used to explore the mechanism. LA (10 mM) reduced venous pH from 7. 14 ± 0. 02 to 7. 00 ± 0. 03 (P< 0. 01) and increased interstitial ATP from 31 ± 6 nM to 62 ± 10 nM (P< 0. 01, n= 13). Infusion of alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, a lactate-transporter-inhibitor, prevented the LA-infusion-induced increase in interstitial ATP, suggesting that cellular uptake of the LA {{is necessary for the}} stimulation of ATP efflux. LA-induced elevation of interstitial ATP was reduced to 48 ± 5 nM by nifedipine, an inhibitor of electrodiffusional transport, and abolished by the nonspecific blockers of CFTR, 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-isothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid (SITS, 100 μM) or glibenclamide (200 μM). Atractyloside, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP transporter, could not prevent LA-infusion-stimulated ATP efflux. These results suggested that <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> could stimulate the efflux of ATP from rat soleus muscle, thereby elevating the interstitial ATP concentration.

40|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 1995 resting state functional connectivity derived from functional MRI data {{has become a}} popular neuroimaging method for study psychiatric disorders. Current methods for analyzing resting state functional connectivity in disease involve thousands of univariate tests, and the specification of regions of interests to employ in the analysis. There are several drawbacks to these methods. First the mass univariate tests employed are insensitive to the information present in distributed networks of functional connectivity. Second, the null hypothesis testing employed to select functional connectivity dierences between groups does not evaluate the predictive power of identified functional connectivities. Third, the specification of regions of interests is confounded by experimentor bias in terms of which regions should be modeled and experimental error {{in terms of the}} size and location of these regions of interests. The objective of this dissertation is to improve the methods for functional connectivity analysis using multivariate predictive modeling, feature selection, and whole brain parcellation. A method of applying Support vector classification (SVC) to resting state functional connectivity data was developed {{in the context of a}} neuroimaging study of depression. The interpretability of the obtained classifier was optimized using feature selection techniques that incorporate reliability information. The problem of selecting regions of interests for whole brain functional connectivity analysis was addressed by clustering whole brain functional connectivity data to parcellate the brain into contiguous functionally homogenous regions. This newly developed famework was applied to derive a classifier capable of correctly seperating the functional connectivity patterns of patients with depression from those of healthy controls 90 % of the time. The features most relevant to the obtain classifier match those previously identified in previous studies, but also include several regions not previously implicated in the functional networks underlying <b>depression.</b> <b>Ph.</b> D.

40|$|Although {{previous}} {{workers have}} {{established that the}} pH of the phagocytic vacuole of the polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte changes from neutral to acid, {{the time course of}} conversion has not been investigated. The present experiments were initiated to study pH changes immediately after phagocytosis. Peritoneal exudates were induced in rats; 4 h later, yeast stained with pH indicators was injected intraperitoneally, and the exudate was retrieved at 30 -s intervals and examined by light microscopy. Results revealed that (a) within 3 min, pH dropped to ~ 6. 5, as indicated by the change in color of neutral redstained yeast; (b) within 7 - 15 min, pH dropped progressively to ~ 4. 0, as indicated by color change in bromcresol green-stained yeast; (c) pH did not fall below 4, since no color change was observed up to 24 h when bromphenol blue-stained yeast was used. The finding that intravacuolar acidity increases rapidly after phagocytosis is undoubtedly important with respect to PMN leukocyte function in killing and digesting microorganisms, for many PMN leukocyte granule enzymes (i. e., peroxidase and lysosomal enzymes) are activated at acid pH (~ 4. 5). It follows that temporal changes in pH and maximal <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> should be considered in studies of intraleukocytic microbicidal mechanisms, since a defect in these factors could result in impaired PMN leukocyte function...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} short-term acidification with HCl at a first-order {{stream in}} central Maine, USA {{was used to}} study processes controlling the changes in stream chemistry and to assess the ability of stream substrate to buffer pH. The streambed exerted a strong buffering capacity against pH change by ion exchange during the 6 -hour acidification. Streambed substrates had substantial cation and anion exchange capacity in the pH range of 4. 1 to 6. 5. The ion exchange for cations and SO 4 2 - were rapid and reversible. The speed of release of cations from stream substrates was Na 1 + > Ca 2 + > Mg 2 + > Al n+ > Be 2 +, perhaps relating to charge density of these cations. Ca 2 + desorption dominated neutralisation of excess H + for the first 2 hr. As the reservoir of exchangeable Ca diminished, desorption (and possibly dissolution) of Al 3 + became the dominant neutralising mechanism. The exchangeable (and possibly soluble) reservoir of Al was not depleted during the 6 -hour acidification. Sulphate adsorption during the acidification reduced the concentration of SO 4 2 - in stream water {{by as much as}} 20 ?eq L - 1 (from 70 ?eq L - 1).

It was artificially acidified with hydrochloric acid (HC 1) for four hours to assess the role of stream substrate in acid-neutralisation and recovery. The pH was lowered from 4. 7 to 3. 2. Desorption of Ca and Mg and desorption or solution of Al dominated acid-neutralisation; Al mobilisation was more important later. The stream substrate released 4, 542 meq Ca, 1, 184 meq Mg, and 2, 329 meq Al over a 45 m long and 1 m wide stream segment; smaller amounts of Be, Cd, Fe, and Mn were released. Adsorption of SO 4 2 - and desorption of F ? occurred during the acidification phase of the experiment. The exchange reactions were rapidly reversible for Ca, Mg and SO 4 2 -; but not symmetric as the substrate resorbed 1083, 790 and 0 meq Ca, Mg, and Al, respectively, in a 4 -hour recovery period. Desorption of SO 4 2 -; occurred during the resorption of Ca and Mg. These exchange and dissolution reactions delay acidification, diminish the <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> and retard recovery from episodic acidification. The behaviour of the stream substrate-water interaction resembles that for soil?soil water interactions.

Leaching of sludge-borne trace elements has been observed in experimental and field studies. The role of microbial processes in the mobilization of trace elements from wastewater sludge is poorly defined. Our objectives were to determine trace element mobilization from sludge subjected to treatments representing microbial acidification, direct chemical acidification and no acidification, and to determine the readsorption potential of mobilized elements using calcareous sand. Triplicate columns (10 -cm diameter) for incubation and leaching of sludge had a top layer of digested dewatered sludge (either untreated, acidified with H 2 SO 4, or limed with CaCO 3; all mixed with glass beads to prevent ponding) and a lower glass bead support bed. Glass beads in the sludge layer, support layer or both were replaced by calcareous sand in four treatments used for testing the readsorption potential of mobilized elements. Eight sequential 8 -day incubation and leaching cycles were operated, each consisting of 7. 6 d of incubation at 28 (C followed by 8 h of leaching with synthetic acid rain applied at 0. 25 cm/h. Leachates were analyzed for trace elements, nitrate and pH, and sludge layer microbial respiration was measured. The largest trace element, nitrate and S losses occurred in treatments with the greatest <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> and greatest microbial respiration rates.

40|$|The time {{course of}} nitrate {{production}} {{is different in}} different soils; in some soils, nitrate is produced at a constant rate while in others, this rate increases with time, often exponentially. Mechanistic models, based on the Monod equations, cannot account for a constant rate of nitrification. All such mechanistic models make the implicit assumption that the nitrifying organisms are distributed uniformly as single cells throughout the soil volume, while in reality, the cells {{might be expected to}} occur in small clusters formed by repeated cell division. This paper examines the effects of allowing the ammonium oxidising cells to occur in evenly distributed clusters of cells of equal volume. One effect of clustering would be the lowering of soil pH around the cluster, caused by differences in the rates of acid production and diffusion. The effects of this <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> were examined using a mathematical model. In general, {{it was found that the}} effect of clustering was to reduce the rate of ammonium oxidation. In extreme cases, in which the fraction of the soil volume occupied by the cells was assumed to be small, the model predicted a constant rate of ammonium oxidation with time in contrast to the increasing rate with time predicted by a model based on a uniform single cell distribution. The clustering model was therefore capable of reproducing the different time courses of ammonium oxidation reported in the literature. The differences between the time courses of ammonium oxidation predicted using the two different assumptions was affected by the initial pH of the soil. This observation suggested a possible experimental test of the clustering hypothesis. © 1987 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers...|$|E
40|$|Laminitis is {{a common}} health problem in dairy cows in Thailand nowadays. In order to {{maintain}} high production, dairy cows need to be fed with a diet high in grain and low in forage. Consequently, the diet contains a high amount of rapid fermentable carbohydrates and insufficient fiber. This results {{in the production of}} a large quantity of volatile fatty acids, and causes a depression on the rumen pH and associated with rumen acidosis. (Kleen et al, 2009). Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA), the condition were the rumen pH< 5. 6 for at least 180 min/d (Gozho et al., 2005), is suggested {{to play an important role}} in the cascade. It has been suggested that the pathogenic mechanism of laminitis may involve the activation of systemic inflammatory responses due to the lysis of gram-negative bacteria. Rumen <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> during SARA increases free LPS concentration of the rumen (Emmanuel et al., 2008; Gozho et al., 2007) and may result in the transfer of LPS from the gut into blood circulation, and activation of an inflammatory response (Khafipour et al., 2009). Thus, materials that can bind LPS in the rumen and can prevent the transfer of endotoxin (LPS) to the blood are potentially of interest to the prevention of laminitis. It is know that montmorillonite have binding affinity for LPS (Pilachai et al., 2010, unpublished data). This trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of three adsorbents; montmorillonite, hydrate sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) and modified HSCAS, to trap intrinsically generate lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in rumen fluid collected from SARA induced cows. In vitro, we added the three absorbents at three levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 % (w/v) to the rumen fluid from SARA cows and measured the LPS concentration. It appear that the sequestering agents tested here had no significant absorbing effect on the LPS in the rumen fluid of the SARA induced cows...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of thiosalts in mining wastewaters is an environmental issue {{due to the}} resulting <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> as these species degrade with time. Despite research in the area, reaction kinetics of thiosalt species under different pH and temperature conditions are not fully understood, especially in conditions common in receiving ponds. As a result, {{it is difficult to}} design ponds or develop treatment technologies to treat these compounds. Several studies have dealt with the reaction kinetics of major thiosalt species (thiosulfate, trithionate, tetrathionate) under various pH and temperature conditions. However, further research is required to better understand the fundamental behaviors of thiosalt species and identify probable reaction paths in temperatures below 30 °C, pH range between 2 and 9 and in the {{presence of}} reagents. [...] The overall objectives of this work have been to study the behavior of thiosalts in mining wastewaters and develop a model of their behavior under the conditions studied that includes pH and temperature as independent variables. The study is divided in four parts: the first part is a summary of relevant information in terms of generation and kinetics of thiosalts, analytical methods for measuring their concentrations, and treatment of thiosalt wastes. Despite extensive research in the area, generation and kinetic information of thiosalt species under different pH and temperature conditions is not fully understood, especially under the range of conditions likely to be encountered in receiving ponds. [...] The second part of the study analyzes the behavior of thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate and provides with mathematical models for their behavior as pure species under the specified conditions. The third part of the study consists of the analysis of the thiosalt behavior in mixtures following a decoupling approach; this analysis provided with additional information for the proposal of global reaction pathways for the species. Finally, the last chapter provides preliminary results from kinetic experiments with selected reagents, results from equilibrium simulations and an analysis of future work required to improve the understanding of thiosalt reactions, improve treatment efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of acid mine drainage...|$|E
40|$|The David L. Tippin Water Treatment Facility (DLTWTF) {{serving the}} city of Tampa, Florida is an {{advanced}} drinking water treatment facility consisting of coagulation/flocculation, ozonation, granular activated carbon biofiltration, and disinfection by chloramine. New regulations and the recent economic crisis pushed the facility to investigate methods to decrease costs and meet regulatory requirements easier. The two major issues identified as priorities for investigation were the optimization of the biofiltration system {{and the use of}} a novel process to reduce the formation of bromate during ozonation. Optimization of the biofiltration system is needed to remove more of the assorted particles that cause biofilms, nitrification in the distribution system, and high chloramine demand. Previous work improved the removal of particles that cause biofilms and nitrification, but was not able address the removal of particles that cause high chloramine demand to a satisfactory degree. Possible factors affecting this high chloramine decay were identified and evaluated at the pilot scale, including filter depth, chloramination of filter backwash water, media material, and nutrient addition. Non-chlorinated backwash water reduced chloramine demand by approximately 30 % for GAC filters, and by approximately 50 % for anthracite. Generally, anthracite performed slightly worse than GAC. Nutrient addition showed no effect. Filter depth improved chloramine decay, but not significantly enough to warrant the increased material required Bromate control is necessary to prevent the formation of bromate, a regulated carcinogen. Traditional bromate control methods use <b>pH</b> <b>depression.</b> While effective, at the DLTWTF, this forces the increased use of more expensive caustic soda over lime for raising the pH of process water. A novel process known as the chlorine-ammonia process was investigated at the bench scale to identify the ideal ratio of chlorine and ammonia to decrease the formation of bromate to ensure regulatory compliance and allow greater use of lime to decrease costs. The best ratio in this study is 0. 45 mg/L NH 3 to 0. 75 mg/L Cl 2 which produced 1. 09 ppb bromate at a CT of 6. 8 min*mg/L, representing a 84 % improvement over the control...|$|E
40|$|The low {{intake and}} {{digestibility}} of low-quality roughages such as mature forages or crop residues {{often results in}} a digestible energy intake insufficient for a desired level of production. One alternative to increase digestible energy intake is to provide supplementary concentrates of high digestibility. ‘ Associative effects on forage fibre digestion may occur when roughage and concentrate are given together to ruminants. Positive associative effects may occur if the forage is deficient in a specific nutrient (e. g. fermentable N or S) and the concentrate supplement provides this nutrient {{in excess of the}} requirements for the fermentation of the concentrate in the rumen. More often negative associative effects are observed when the rumen fermentation of readily fermentable carbohydrates (RFC) in the concentrate reduces-the rate of rumen digestion of the forage cell wall constituents (CWC). This often causes reduced intake of the roughage i. e. substitution of concentrate for roughage occurs. Reduced rumen digestion of CWC may be associated with a reduction in the number and activity of the bacteria which digest CWC, and. also with a low rumen pH (pHx 6. 1). Rumen pH is depressed principally by the VFA produced during the rapid fermentation of RFC, the extent of the <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> depending on the buffering capacity of the rumen, the type and amount of RFC consumed and feeding management practices. Also rumen digestion of CWC may be severely reduced if fermentation of concentrates causes a deficiency of an essential substrate (e. g. N) for microbial fermentation of CWC. It appears that it is roughages of low digestibility such as mature forages and crop residues and which have high contents of CWG and low contents of microbial substrates which are most severely affected by supplements containing RFC. An understanding of the physiological basis for associative effects and selection of appropriate management stratagies should lead to greater efficiency in feeding systems where low-quality roughages are supplemented with concentrates.

40|$|Session - Purines: Release and MetabolismUnder in-vivo conditions, {{adenosine}} {{output from}} oxidative skeletal muscle is stimulated by {{a decrease in}} pH. The present experiments were undertaken to investigate the enzymatic control of adenosine formation by changes in pH. The membrane and cytosolic fractions of rat oxidative muscle tissues (soleus) were separated by differential centrifugation. The V,, and K, of the adenosineforming enzyme 5 ’-nucleotidase (ND) were determined at pH values of 6. 5, 7. 0, 7. 5 and 9. 0; the rate of adenosine formation was estimated from these data and literature value for the substrate concentration. For the membrane bound (ecto-) ND, the highest V max was found at pH 7. 5, which was 1. 7, 1. 2 and 1. 9 times that at pH 6. 5, 7. 0 and 9. 0, respectively, whereas the affinity (reciprocal of K,) of ecto-ND for AMP was decreased as the pH was increased from 6. 5 to 9. 0. Therefore, the estimated rates of adenosine formation (nmol/min/g wet. wt.) by ecto-ND were 50. 4 at pH 6. 5, 48. 5 at pH 7. 0, 37. 0 at pH 7. 5 and 19. 7 at pH 9. 0, respectively. For the soluble (cytosolic) ND, the V,, was increased as the pH was increased from 6. 5 to 9. 0, but the affinity of cytosolic ND for AMP was similar under all conditions. The estimated rate of adenosine formation by cytosolic ND did not exceed 0. 7 nmol/min/g wet. wt. at any pH. These results suggest that in oxidative skeletal muscle (1) the increased adenosine formation during <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> {{is the result of}} the increased affinity (decreased K, value) of the ecto-ND for the substrate (AMP) and (2) the rate of adenosine formation by the membrane bound ecto-ND is sufficient to account for the adenosine release observed under in-vivo conditions such as muscle contractions.

This review focuses on advances made in modeling rumen fermentation and its associated rumen disorders, and energy and nutrient utilization and excretion with respect to environmental issues. Accurate prediction of fermentation stoichiometry has impact on estimating the type of energy-yielding substrate available to the animal and the ratio of lipogenic to glucogenic VFA is an important determinant of methanogenesis. Recent advances in modeling VFA stoichiometry offer ways for dietary manipulation to shift the fermentation in favor of glucogenic VFA. Increasing energy to the animal by supplementing with starch can lead to health problems such as sub-acute rumen acidosis (SARA) due to rumen <b>pH</b> <b>depression.</b> Mathematical models have been developed to describe changes in rumen pH and rumen fermentation. Models that relate rumen temperature to rumen pH have also been developed and have the potential to aid in the diagnosis of SARA. The effect of pH has been studied mechanistically and in such models, fractional passage rate has a large impact on substrate degradation and microbial efficiency in the rumen and should be an important theme in future studies. The efficiency with which energy is utilized by ruminants has been updated in recent studies. Mechanistic models of N utilization indicate that reducing dietary protein concentration, matching protein degradability to microbial requirement, and increasing energy status of the animal will reduce output of N as waste. Recent mechanistic P models calculate P requirement by taking into account P recycled through saliva and endogenous losses. Mechanistic P models indicate reducing current P levels for lactating dairy cattle to at least 0. 35 % P in the diet with potential reduction of up to 1. 3 kt/yr. A model that integrates nutrient utilization and health has great potential benefit for ruminant nutrition research. Finally, whole animal or farm level models were discussed. An example that used a multiple criteria decision-making framework is reviewed and the approach is considered to be appropriate in dealing with the multi-dimensional nature of agricultural systems and can be applied to assist the decision process in cattle operations...|$|E
40|$|Fouling of quartz jackets around mercury {{arc lamps}} {{represents}} a performance limitation in ultraviolet (UV) photochemical reactors. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to investigate mechanisms of inorganic fouling at quartz:water interfaces in UV photoreactors. Approaches to the problem include conducting pilot-scale experiments in the laboratory and in the field, numerical simulations of fouling processes, and exploration of physico/chemical treatment to mitigate the quartz fouling problems. Fouling behavior was examined at different observation scales with analytical tools which included UV transmittance measurements, wet chemistry, atomic absorption spectrometry, surface/solid-phase analytical methods, scanning electron microscopy, and microscopic image analyses. ^ Experimental results showed that a broad spectrum of metals that are commonly found in wastewaters was identified in fouling materials. Temporal analyses of fouling materials indicated that fouling was a linear process with time. An increasing trend in longitudinal distributions of fouling material supported the hypothesis that thermally-induced precipitation plays a significant role in inorganic fouling of quartz under conditions of moderate precipitation rate. A second mechanism, impaction of pre-existing particles on quartz surfaces, resulted in heterogeneity in spatial accumulation around quartz jackets. Time-course UV intensity measurements indicated that iron and aluminum-based treatments (e. g., for phosphorous removal) accelerated fouling processes significantly. Fluid shear also played a role in inorganic fouling in that it influenced the agglomeration of coagulated/precipitated particles. Illumination of UV lamps was found to diminish organic accumulation and promote inorganic fouling. ^ A numerical model that accounts mass, heat, and momentum transport characteristics in the immediate vicinity of the quartz:water interface addressed the increasing mixing energy due to velocity gradient inside the momentum boundary layer as approach velocity increases. Thermal effects were illustrated by a temperature field and an increasing saturation excess in the direction of flow. The model also demonstrated that accelerated fouling processes could result in local <b>pH</b> <b>depression</b> (proton production) upon precipitate formation. Altogether, the mathematical model was found to be capable of explaining fouling behavior observed in the pilot-scale experiments qualitatively and providing insights into fouling mechanisms. ^ Several physico/chemical strategies were reviewed for reducing quartz fouling. Methods of UV system treatments are recommended based on the results and findings of this research. ...|$|E
