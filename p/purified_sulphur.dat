But to work them profitably will require a little more common-sense than the good folks of St. Lucia have as yet shown. In 1836 two gentlemen of Antigua, {43a} Mr. Bennett and Mr. Wood, set up sulphur works at the Souffriere of St. Lucia, and began prosperously enough, exporting 540 tons the first year. 'But in 1840,' says Mr. Breen, 'the sugar-growers took the alarm,' fearing, it is to be presumed, that labour would be diverted from the cane-estates, 'and at their instigation the Legislative Council imposed a tax of 16s. sterling on every ton of <b>purified</b> <b>sulphur</b> exported from the colony.' The consequence was that 'Messrs. Bennett and Wood, after incurring a heavy loss of time and treasure, had to break up their establishment and retire from the colony.' One has heard of the man who killed the goose to get the golden egg. In this case the goose, to avoid the trouble of laying, seems to have killed the man.|$|E
40|$|Introduction [...] Sampling and {{analytical}} technique [...] Results and discussions [...] References. Sulphur dioxide from sulphides was extracted for analysis by oxidation with Cuprous oxide at 1070 º C, using essentially the method described by Robinson and Kusakabe (1975). The isotopic {{analyses of the}} <b>purified</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide were made on a modified Micromass 602 mass spectrometer with heated inlet system. The results were corrected for isobaric interference assuming a constant oxygen isotopic content and instrumental crosstalk (Coleman, 1977; 1980) and expressed in conventional del notation {{with respect to the}} Canon Diablo meteoritic troilite standard...|$|E
40|$|Siddha is a {{traditional}} medical system of India. According to siddha system of medicine, chendooram is a red colour powder generally made of metallic compounds. Mercury {{is used in the}} form of rasa chendooram (red oxide of mercury). This paper deals with the standardization of Kantha chendooram. It is a Siddha preparation of 8 ingredients, viz. 1. Purified Lode Stone, 2. <b>Purified</b> <b>Sulphur,</b> 3. Lead wort root powder, 4. Eclipta juice, 5. Lime juice, 6. Milk, 7. Egg albumin, 8. Madar Latex. In this study an attempt was made to standardize Kantha chendooram which has not been attempted by researchers earlier. Standardization of Kantha chendooram was in terms of its organoleptic characters, qualitative identification of phytochemical constituents, metallic quantification and in terms of pharmacognostical standardization. Kantha chendooram is a popular siddha preparation of eight ingredients indicated 1 for microcytic anaemia, anaemia, chlorosis, obesity...|$|E

Whatever else a child may be, in respect of this particular question, it is a complicated piece of mechanism, built up out of materials supplied by its mother; {{and in the course of}} such building-up, provided with a set of motors--the muscles. Each of these muscles contains a stock of substance capable of yielding energy under certain conditions, one of which is a change of state in the nerve fibres connected with it. The powder in a loaded gun is such another stock of substance capable of yielding energy in consequence of a change of state in the mechanism of the lock, which intervenes between the finger of the man who pulls the trigger and the cartridge. If that change is brought about, the potential energy of the powder passes suddenly into actual energy, and does the work of propelling the bullet. The powder, therefore, may be appropriately called work-stuff, not only because it is stuff which is easily made to yield work in the physical sense, but because a good deal of work in the economical sense has contributed to its production. Labour was necessary to collect, transport, and <b>purify</b> the raw <b>sulphur</b> and saltpetre; to cut wood and convert it into powdered charcoal; to mix these ingredients in the right proportions; to give the mixture the proper grain, and so on. The powder [149] once formed part of the stock, or capital, of a powder-maker: and it is not only certain natural bodies which are collected and stored in the gunpowder, but the labour bestowed on the operations mentioned may be figuratively said to be incorporated in it.|$|R
40|$|Swarna Makshik (Chalco-pyrite), {{a mineral}} having various {{therapeutic}} uses in Pandu (Anemia), Kushtha (Skin disorders) and Kamala (Jaundice) {{has been used}} since long in Ayurveda. The present {{study was conducted to}} standardize raw and processed swarna makshik using techniques which can be used by pharmacies. Powdered swarna makshik was heated in an iron pan by adding lemon juice for 3 days till liberation of sulphur fumes stopped completely. Bhasma of this purified swarna makshik was obtained by triturating it with <b>purified</b> <b>sulphur</b> and lemon juice. It was then subjected to heat in 13 putas, and for ﬁring in each puta, 3. 5 kg cow dung cakes were used. To assure the quality of bhasma, rasa shastra quality control tests like nischandratva, varitara, amla pariksha, etc., were used. After the bhasma complied with these tests, the bhasma was analyzed using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Thermo Gravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that SM bhasma contains Fe 2 O 3, FeS 2, CuS and SiO 2. It may be concluded that raw SM is a complex compound which gets converted into a mixture of simple compounds after the particular process of marana...|$|E
