40|$|Prostate {{brachytherapy}} involves implanting radioactive seeds (I 125 for instance) {{permanently in}} the gland {{for the treatment}} of localized prostate cancers e. g. cT 1 c-T 2 a N 0 M 0 with good prognostic factors. Treatment planning and seed implanting are most often based on the intensive use of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. This is not easy because prostate visualization is difficult in this imaging modality particularly as regards the apex of the gland and from an intra- and inter-observer variability standpoint. Radioactive seeds are implanted inside open interventional MR machines in some centres. Since MRI was shown to be sensitive and specific for prostate imaging whilst open MR is prohibitive for most centres and makes surgical procedures very complex, this work suggests bringing the MR virtually in the operating room with MRI/TRUS data fusion. This involves providing the physician with bi-modality images (TRUS plus MRI) intended to improve treatment planning from the data registration stage. The paper describes the method developed and implemented in the <b>PROCUR</b> system. Results are reported for a phantom and first series of patients. Phantom experiments helped characterize the accuracy of the process. Patient experiments have shown that using MRI data linked with TRUS data improves TRUS image segmentation especially regarding the apex and base of the prostate. This may significantly modify prostate volume definition and have an impact on treatment planning. I...|$|E
40|$|Background To inform their decisions, commissioners {{need to know}} if {{particular}} services reduce NHS {{costs and}} <b>procur</b> cost savings elsewhere within the system. A review of service evaluations of NHS complementary therapy services found that most did not investigate the impact of these services on NHS costs such as GP consultations, hospital visits and medications. Two recent studies have attempted to tackle the challenges in economic evaluation of NHS complementary therapy services, using different approaches. The SEAT study evaluated an Alexander Technique (AT) service in a hospital pain clinic. The BISCUIT study focused on the economic evaluation of the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. The aim of this presentation is to reflect on these two studies’ approaches to economic evaluation, compare their usefulness and present results. Methods The SEAT study recruited 43 service users via the hospital pain clinic who attended weekly Alexander Technique lessons over six consecutive weeks. They self-reported personal and NHS costs at the first session, six weeks and 3 months after baseline. As part of the BISCUIT study, 15 case participants who attended the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital and 19 community control participants were matched for GP practice, condition, age and sex and reported personal and NHS costs at five time points over 15 months. In addition, GP medical record data was extracted on NHS resource use and sick notes for all 34 BISCUIT participants. SEAT and BISCUIT data were priced using a variety of different sources (i. e. NHS reference costs, British National Formulary, Unit Costs of Health and Social Care). SEAT data were analysed for NHS and personal costs whereby standard weekly costs were calculated at three time points and compared. BISCUIT data were analysed from a NHS cost and societal cost perspective whereby annual costs for cases and controls were compared. Results For the SEAT study, we found that total costs for AT service users did not decrease between baseline (mean £ 55. 53 [95...|$|E

5000|$|Although {{based in}} Belfast, Mahood {{was close to}} UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade leader Billy Wright and helped to {{establish}} the LVF in 1996 after Wright and his Portadown unit were stood down by the UVF Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) in August of that year. According to David Ervine, Mahood had acted as the liaison between the Brigade Staff and Wright; in this capacity he agitated for Wright to be accepted as the UVF's chief strategist just before the split, although Ervine also suggested that Mahood was highly unpopular {{with the rest of}} the UVF leadership, apart from Wright, due to his involvement in criminality. Ervine went on to claim that Mahood had provided the gun which was taken from the UVF Shankill Road arms dump that the Mid-Ulster Brigade used to kill Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick in July 1996 at the height of the Drumcree stand-off, an act which led to Wright's expulsion from the UVF as the leadership had not sanctioned the murder. According to Ervine, the gun was <b>procurred</b> from the arms dump to incriminate the Belfast UVF while the organisation was on ceasefire at the time. These allegations were published in Ed Moloney's book Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland in 2010 and infuriated Mahood who publicly denied Ervine's claim that he had provided the weapon used in McGoldrick's killing, maintaining that he was the victim of a UVF [...] "smear campaign". Following the LVF's establishment, Mahood encouraged Wright to challenge the Brigade Staff and return the entire UVF to a war footing. Mahood also enjoyed a close relationship with UDA leader Jim Spence and encouraged Spence to link up with Wright. However, Spence, who had no desire for a feud with the UVF, kept his distance from the man he nicknamed [...] "Billy Wrong". Mahood was shot by masked men as he sat in his office in Belfast's Crumlin Road on 27 November 1997. He was hit three times in the neck and jaw and left for dead, although he survived the attack. Mahood claimed that the UVF was behind the attack and also claimed to know the identity of the shooter.|$|R
