30|$|The {{method of}} modifying {{relative}} permeability {{is described as}} follows. Firstly, {{it is necessary to}} determine the variability of every controlling parameter of relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> (such as irreducible water saturation, residual oil saturation, and ratio of endpoint relative permeability), then the parameters’ variations are substituted into the correlative empirical formula of relative permeability to modify the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
30|$|According {{to whether}} it is {{required}} to assume {{the shape of the}} relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve,</b> there are two main categories in the representation model: the parametric model and the nonparametric model (Kulkarni and Datta-Gupta 2000). The parametric model uses explicit equations to generate the two- or three-phase relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve,</b> assuming that the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> fits into the shape of a certain type of the functional model (e.g., the power law model). Nevertheless, the number of degrees of freedom of the parametric model is not enough for all types of relative permeability curves for actual reservoirs. Due to its simplicity, the power law model is widely used (Lee and Seinfeld 1987; Reynolds et al. 2004). The nonparametric model is far more general and flexible because there is no assumption regarding the shape of the relative permeability curves [e.g., the cubic B-spline model (CBM)], which has the advantage of being able to accurately represent any set of relative permeability curves. Thus far, the nonparametric model most widely used is the CBM (Chen et al. 2008; Eydinov et al. 2009). For this study, the CBM is adopted to describe the water–oil–gas relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> during the WAG recovery process.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{computational}} {{methods were}} {{used to analyze the}} relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> in immiscible displacement process using Lattice Boltzmann pore-scale modeling. Quantitative analysis of the effect of relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> on production performance of immiscible displacement at reservoir-scale was also performed. A multi-component multiphase Shan–Chen-type Lattice Boltzmann model was developed and implemented to study the two-phase flow in porous media with focus on relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> of different involving gas phases. The relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> were calculated as a function of wetting phase saturation for different viscosity ratios, capillary numbers, and pore structures.|$|R

Through a large number of core flooding experiments, based on the establishment of oil-water relative permeability calculation models, the use of the function of the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> divided these into the water phase concave, water phase convex and a water phase linear categories. The relationship between different types of relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> with reservoir characteristics, moisture content, common infiltration points, common permeation range and oil displacement efficiency have been evaluated.

30|$|There {{are also}} methods that infer {{relative}} permeability by history matching observable parameters such as pressure drop and saturation profile history. The relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> are adjusted until {{a good match}} is obtained with the experimental data. The limitation is that {{the description of the}} actual shape of the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> can cause errors (Hirasaki et al. 1995).|$|R
30|$|Relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> are {{the main}} {{parameters}} that govern simultaneous multi-phase flow in reservoir simulation. They are normally obtained from steady- or unsteady-state two-phase core floods. To consider the heterogeneity within a large grid block, pseudo(up-scaled)relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> can replace intrinsic relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> (Cao and Aziz 1999). Pseudorelative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> attempt to capture the effects of scale and heterogeneity within the coarse grid blocks. The goal of up-scaling {{is to reduce the}} CPU time needed for calculation either “by reducing the number of grid blocks or reducing the number of dimensions of the problem, such as reducing a 3 D field case model to a 2 D areal model” (quote from Cao and Aziz 1999). In other words, through up-scaling, we hope to retain precise information in less computational time and effort (Dykstra and Parsons 1950; Coats et al. 1967, 1971; Hearn 1971).|$|R
30|$|Actual core {{samples were}} used for phase {{behavior}} studies, MMP measurements, and immiscible WAG coreflood experiments to understand the major recovery mechanisms and thus to generate the fluid properties under reservoir conditions. Based on history matching results of fluid phase behavior and MMP, the proposed method was used to interpret coreflood data from the immiscible WAG experiment in order to implicitly estimate the water–oil–gas relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve.</b> Results indicate that the proposed method is reliable and can meet engineering requirements. It provides a basic calculation theory for implicit estimation of three-phase relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> during immiscible WAG processes.|$|E
30|$|The {{relative}} <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> {{is essential}} to describe the complicated multiphase flow characteristics in porous media (Masihi et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2013). In general, water–oil or oil–gas relative permeability data {{can be obtained from}} steady- or unsteady-state displacement experiments with core samples. Such experimental data can be interpreted using analytical methods, e.g., the Johnson–Bossler–Naumann (JBN) method. However, due to the idealized hypothesis, the precision usually cannot be guaranteed when using analytical methods to calculate the water–oil or oil–gas relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve.</b> To improve the precision of the estimated result, Sigmund and McCaffery applied a nonlinear regression to the problem of history matching laboratory coreflood data {{for the first time and}} proposed a numerical inversion method for the water–oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> (Sigmund and McCaffery 1979). In contrast to the existing analytical methods, when the numerical inversion methods are adopted to interpret laboratory coreflood data, production performance prior to and after water breakthrough can be utilized comprehensively. The estimated result is not only complete but also highly precise (Daoud and Velasquez 2006; Barroeta and Thompson 2010). In recent decades, a variety of numerical inversion methods have been developed to implicitly estimate the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> for water–oil or oil–gas systems (Chen et al. 2008; Li et al. 2009; Eydinov et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2010; Wang and Li 2011; Li and Yang 2011; Abdollahzadeh et al. 2011; Zhang and Yang 2013; Xu et al. 2013; Miao et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|Relative {{permeability}} {{is among}} the most critical parameters in reservoir performance evaluation and EOR projects. It reflects the ease of movement and trapping of different phases and affects the production rate and ultimate recovery from reservoirs. Experimental measurement of relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> is complicated, costly, time consuming, and the results can easily be influenced by test conditions and interpretation methods. Empirical correlations are alternative approaches that are based on existing experimentally measured relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> and rock and fluid properties. The authors used 260 relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> from Iranian carbonate and sandstone reservoirs. Six key points for each set of water-oil relative permeability were determined, which fully characterize these curves. Using linear regression technique, new correlations were proposed to predict these key points. Having this done, it is then easy and straightforward to construct unnormalized/real water-oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves.</b> R. Roghanian, M. Reza Rasaei and M. Haghigh...|$|R

30|$|The RCP {{program can}} be adopted in the {{two-phase}} relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> computations for the unsteady-state data with high reliability. The parameter estimation approach overcomes significant limitations of the classic calculation procedure of the Johnson–Bossler–Naumann method and related methods. Furthermore, RCP is thought to give an occasion to calculate relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> for heterogeneous cores rather than the explicit methods, which applied for homogeneous cores only.|$|R
30|$|The {{procedure}} for implicitly estimating the three-phase relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> using LM based history matching techniques is briefly described as follows: (1) initialize the unknown controlling {{parameters of the}} CBM to generate prior knowledge of the three-phase relative permeability curve; (2) implement reservoir simulation using the prior curves to generate the predicted production data; (3) establish a least-squares objective function to reflect {{the discrepancy between the}} predicted and observed values of production performance; and (4) advance the minimization of the least-squares objective function using the LM algorithm to subsequently adjust the unknown controlling parameter vector of the CBM until all the observed production data are assimilated. Finally, the water–oil–gas three-phase relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> is achieved and evaluated.|$|E
30|$|Immiscible water-alternating-gas (WAG) {{flooding}} is an EOR {{technique that}} has proven successful for water drive reservoirs {{due to its}} ability to improve displacement and sweep efficiency. Nevertheless, considering the complicated phase behavior and various multiphase flow characteristics, gas tends to break through early in production wells in heterogeneous formations because of overriding, fingering, and channeling, which may result in unfavorable recovery performance. On the basis of phase behavior studies, minimum miscibility pressure measurements, and immiscible WAG coreflood experiments, the cubic B-spline model (CBM) was employed to describe the three-phase relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve.</b> Using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to adjust the vector of unknown model parameters of the CBM sequentially, optimization of production performance including pressure drop, water cut, and the cumulative gas–oil ratio was performed. A novel numerical inversion method was established for estimation of the water–oil–gas relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> during the immiscible WAG process. Based on the quantitative characterization of major recovery mechanisms, the proposed method was validated by interpreting coreflood data of the immiscible WAG experiment. The proposed method is reliable and can meet engineering requirements. It provides a basic calculation theory for implicit estimation of oil–water–gas relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
30|$|Next, an {{inversion}} algorithm will {{be presented}} and then integration between the developed multiphase flow simulator and the inversion technique {{will be used to}} estimate relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> for laboratory drainage tests data (production data) that carried out on glass bed models (Fahad 2013).|$|E
30|$|The {{relative}} <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> {{with different}} residual {{oil and water}} saturations {{will be used for}} the design of waterflooding techniques to evaluate the amount of oil recovery by artificially injecting water into the reservoir. The rate of advancement of the water front can be calculated by Buckley–Leverett frontal displacement theory using fractional flow curves that are evaluated from the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> (Nazari et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|After more {{reliable}} experimental data have gained, we need proper interpretation method to get representative relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves.</b> In general, {{there are two}} types of components to determine relative permeability curves: endpoints and shape factors (Eydinov et al. 2007). Endpoints could be measured directly by core flooding, while shape factors are depending on the fluid/fluid interactions and usually obtained by empiric. Up to now, the proper formulation of relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> under miscible flooding is mostly based on empirical Corey model (Lee and Seinfeld 1987; Yang and Watson 1991). Therefore, in this paper, Corey model combined with history-matching method is used in this paper to obtain CO 2 –oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves.</b>|$|R
30|$|The JBN method (without {{considering}} capillary pressure) {{was used}} at first for calculating relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> using revised data, but the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> are almost two intersecting straight lines. As the relative permeability is essential input for numerical simulation, neglecting the dynamic effect of capillary pressure while analyzing unsteady laboratory data ultimately leads to inaccurate assessment of multiphase flow properties. Thus, the JBN method did not apply.|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} of the {{above-mentioned}} problems, this paper presents a novel numerical inversion method for estimation of the water–oil–gas relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> during immiscible WAG processes. The structure of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect.  2, the formulation and architecture of the relative permeability representation model are presented. Section  3 provides {{a brief description of the}} proposed numerical inversion method using the LM based history matching techniques. In Sect.  4, laboratory tests including phase behavior studies, minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) measurement, and immiscible WAG coreflood experiments are conducted to understand the major recovery mechanisms and thus generate accurate fluid properties under reservoir conditions. Finally, the reliability and robustness of the proposed method are validated by interpreting coreflood data of the immiscible WAG experiment to implicitly estimate the water–oil–gas relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} improved procedure for generating pseudo relative permeability curves for stratified waterflooding using either constant pressure or constant flux at the reservoir boundaries. Pseudo relative permeability reflects {{the generation of}} a relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> {{that can be used}} to represent the entire reservoir thickness, rather than a specific layer during reservoir simulation, thus saving computational time. In this project, Fractional Flow Theory is applied to the generation of pseudo relative permeability curves for i) constant flow rate condition, and ii) constant pressure boundary condition. Previously pseudo relative permeability curves were generated for the constant flow rate condition only. The method differs from previous methodologies and studies, which are all based on a piston-like displacement for water flooding. Instead, this new model uses fractional flow theory to generate a pseudo relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> that is physically more realistic. The solution is extended to generate pseudo relative permeability curves for simulating the waterflood of a reservoir under the constant pressure boundaries which is a more realistic assumption in compared to constant flow rate. The generated pseudo relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve</b> is used in a 2 D areal reservoir model in an ECLIPSE simulator to predict the behavior of the full layered 3 D reservoir model. It was found that there is good agreement between the results corresponding to this new method and the full layered reservoir model, which is very important...|$|E
30|$|Prediction and {{simulation}} on {{the production}} performance of oilfields are carried out in macroscopic scale. By adjusting the reservoir macro-parameters such as porosity, permeability, and relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curve,</b> the influence of reservoir parameters’ variation on oilfield development rules can be studied, and then, the internal relationship between reservoir macro-parameters and oilfield development rules can be established.|$|E
30|$|Obviously, {{with new}} data {{processing}} method and long composite cores, the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> for CO 2 flooding obtained {{in this paper}} are more reliable. Firstly, combined with improved Corey model and history-matching method effects of capillary pressure and vaporizing mechanism can be incorporated in relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves.</b> Secondly, short core segment failed to simulate mass transfer mechanism due to early gas breakthrough and more oil remained in pores. Thirdly, longer contacting time between CO 2 and oil strengthens the vaporizing and dissolution mechanism which helps to decrease oil viscosity and IFT. However, it is should be noticed, long composite cores and new data processing method in this paper improved CO 2 –oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> obtained in laboratory, {{but it is still}} failed to simulate the fully miscible flooding in natural cores.|$|R
30|$|With {{experimental}} data of endpoints, calculated shape factor bog and empirical shape factor bg, the initial guess of CO 2 –oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> was measured, then using history-matching method we reversed the curves by matching production data. The final results of CO 2 –oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> {{are shown in}} Fig.  4. As {{can be seen in}} Fig.  4, CO 2 –oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> in long slim tube are nearly two intersecting straight lines, and endpoint of gas relative permeability at residual oil saturation is 1. However, these features in short slim tube are different: (1) oil-phase relative permeability decreases faster and gas phase relative permeability increases slower with gas saturation, (2) crossing point is lower and endpoint of oil relative permeability at residual oil saturation is 0.473, (3) residual oil saturation is 16.25  % higher.|$|R
30|$|CO 2 {{injection}} {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} proven EOR methods and is being widely used nowadays in many EOR projects all over the globe. The process of in situ displacement of oil with CO 2 gas is implemented in both miscible and immiscible modes of operation. In some oil reservoirs, CO 2 miscibility will not be attained due to fluid composition characteristics as well as in situ pressure and temperature conditions. Laboratory determination of gas–oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> is usually performed with air, nitrogen, or helium gases, and the results are then implemented for both natural depletion processes (especially in reservoirs with “solution gas” or “gas cap” drive mechanisms) and gas injection processes. For the gas injection processes, it is therefore necessary to find out how selection of the gas phase would affect the relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> when the intention of developing the curves is to use them for immiscible CO 2 displacement. In this study, a reservoir simulator was first used to quantitatively analyze the effect of variation in relative permeability data (due to the use of different gas phases) on production performance of a reservoir. Then, computational analysis was performed on changes in relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> upon using different gas phases with the aid of pore-scale modeling using statistical methods. To predict gas–oil relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves,</b> a Shan–Chen-type multi-component multiphase Lattice Boltzmann pore-scale model for two-phase flow in a 2 D porous medium was developed. Fully periodic and “full-way” bounce-back boundary conditions were applied in the model to get infinite domain of fluid with nonslip solid nodes. Incorporation of an external body force was performed by Guo scheme, and the influence of pore structure and capillary number on relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> was also studied for CO 2 –oil as well as N 2 –oil fluid pairs. The modeled relative <b>permeability</b> <b>curves</b> were then compared with experimental results for both these fluid pairs.|$|R
