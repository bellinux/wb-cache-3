40|$|BACKGROUND: Intrathecal drug {{delivery}} using implantable pumps {{is an effective}} method to control stable chronic pain. However, the appropriate alleviation of unpredictable pain fluctuations remains challenging. A possible solution {{is the use of}} patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) by means of a specific device [...] the personal therapy manager (PTM) [...] designed to be used with implanted <b>programmable</b> <b>pumps.</b> METHODS: A multicenter (n = 17), open-label registry recording 168 patients suffering from chronic pain with unsatisfactory control of pain episodes was initiated. While 79 patients (47 %) (group A) already carried an implanted pump at enrollment, all other patients were implanted after being registered in the study (group B). Parameters assessed included pain relief (visual analog score, VAS), quality of life (EQ- 5 D), patient and physician satisfaction, medication use, PTM programming parameters and adverse events. Final follow-up was at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, there was a significant reduction (29 %) of the overall average VAS compared with baseline (P < 0. 01) in patients with newly implanted devices (group B). All patients tended to decrease the concomitant pain medication and the quality of life tended to improve (10 % on the EQ- 5 D scale). In total, 85 % of patients were satisfied with the PTM. No serious adverse events related {{to the use of the}} PTM device were observed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To compare {{clinical}} {{effectiveness and}} health related {{quality of life}} in patients with severe spasticity who received intrathecal baclofen or a placebo.  METHODS—In a double blind, randomised, multicentre trial 22 patients were followed up during 13 weeks and subsequently included in a 52 week observational longitudinal study. Patients were those with chronic, disabling spasticity who did not respond to maximum doses of oral baclofen, dantrolene, and tizanidine. After implantation of a <b>programmable</b> <b>pump</b> patients were randomly assigned to placebo or baclofen infusion for 13 weeks. After 13 weeks all patients received baclofen. Clinical efficacy was assessed by the Ashworth scale, spasm score, and self reported pain, and health related quality of life by the sickness impact profile (SIP) and the Hopkins symptom checklist (HSCL).  RESULTS—At three months the scores of the placebo and baclofen group differed slightly for the spasm score (effect size= 0. 20) and substantially for the Ashworth scale (effect size= 1. 40) and pain score (effect size= 0. 94); health related quality of life showed no significant differences. Three months after implantation the baclofen group showed a significant, substantial improvement on the SIP "physical health", "mental health", "mobility", and "sleep and rest" subscales and on the HSCL mental health scale; patients receiving placebo showed no change. After one year of baclofen treatment significant (P 0. 80.

Patient-controlled analgesic techniques are recognized as preferred administration methods. Previously, research has focused on intravenously administered opioids via a <b>programmable</b> <b>pump.</b> More recently, an iontophoretic transdermal system (ITS), which is patient controlled, has been developed. The focus of this review is on pain management using the fentanyl ITS during the 24 – 72 -hour time period immediately following surgery. Fentanyl ITS offers a needle-free alternative to traditional intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system that is as effective and safe as IV PCA. This system is easy to use for both patients and nurses. The use of fentanyl ITS is generally associated with a better ease-of-care profile, including a greater ease of mobility, from a patients&# 39; perspective when compared with morphine IV PCA.

Case presentation A 56 -year-old male with C- 4 tetraplegia had undergone implantation of <b>programmable</b> <b>pump</b> in the anterior abdominal wall for intrathecal infusion of baclofen to control spasticity. He developed perinephric haematoma while he was taking warfarin as prophylactic for deep vein thrombosis. Perinephric haematoma became infected with a resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and required percutaneous drainage. Positioning this patient on his abdomen without anaesthesia, for insertion of a catheter from behind, was not a realistic option. Administration of general anaesthesia in this patient in the radiology department would have been hazardous. Results and Conclusion Percutaneous drainage was carried out by anterior approach under propofol sedation. The site of entry of percutaneous catheter was close to cephalic end of baclofen pump. By carrying out drainage from anterior approach, and by keeping this catheter for ten weeks, we took a risk of causing infection of the baclofen pump site, and baclofen pump with a resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The alternative method would have been to anaesthetise the patient and position him prone for percutaneous drainage of perinephric collection from behind. This would have ensured that the drainage track was far away from the baclofen pump with minimal risk of infection of baclofen pump, but at the cost of incurring respiratory complications in a tetraplegic subject. </p...|$|E

Among the clinical manifestations of MS are also found mental health problems including depression mood. The drugs most commonly offered, for treatment of depression in patients with MS, are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).
