5|$|As the {{national}} dish of Cornwall, several oversized {{versions of the}} pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week. Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the Cornish Pirates rugby team on St Piran's Day before it is <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> goal posts.|$|E
5|$|Gale force winds {{affected}} the Delmarva Peninsula; on Poplar Island in Talbot County, Maryland, winds peaked at 1600UTC on September 3. The strongest winds {{were confined to}} the Atlantic coastline, with outer rainbands producing heavy rainfall in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. Fierce winds were observed in Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with the strongest gales occurring after the eye <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
5|$|Joan {{gradually}} strengthened as it <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern Windward Islands on October 15. It continued {{heading west}} {{in response to}} a strong Ridge, and <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Guajira Peninsula on October 17. After entering the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea, Joan strengthened into a hurricane. It then slowly executed a small counterclockwise loop, possibly in response to the nearby Tropical Depression Eighteen. Upwelling caused by the quasi-stationary hurricane weakened the system. As the nearby depression dissipated, Joan resumed its westward track. A strong anticyclone over the southwestern Caribbean Sea created an extremely favorable environment, and Joan underwent rapid deepening at a rate of 38millibars {{in the space of a}} day. With a minimum pressure of 932millibars, Joan was one of the strongest October hurricanes since 1961. At the time, it was located at 12°N, the southernmost Category 4 hurricane ever recorded at the time. That record has since been broken by Hurricane Ivan.|$|E

50|$|A major design {{challenge}} was {{the noise of}} the public transit tracks <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lot. The solution was to enclose a 530 ft section of the tracks in a stainless steel tube <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> building. The tube's support structure is completely independent of the building's, to minimize vibration passing between them.|$|R
5|$|Mobile is {{occasionally}} {{affected by}} major tropical storms and hurricanes. The city suffered a {{major natural disaster}} {{on the night of}} September 12, 1979, when category-3 Hurricane Frederic <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> heart of the city. The storm caused tremendous damage to Mobile and the surrounding area. Mobile had moderate damage from Hurricane Opal on October 4, 1995, and Hurricane Ivan on September 16, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} brought {{widespread rain}} to northern South India as it <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{country and its}} remnants brought scattered rain to Gujarat over the following week. Over a period of four hours, heavy rain fell on Hyderabad and Secunderabad, destroying many houses in the two cities. About 130mm (5inches) of rain fell on Bombay as the system dissipated. The heavy rains claimed about 75 lives.|$|E
5|$|Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland, Etty and Evans <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Simplon Pass {{and on to}} Milan, {{where they}} viewed Leonardo's The Last Supper and visited the Brera Gallery.

5|$|When Bonnie <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Azores {{only four}} days after Charley, it {{resulted}} in tropical storm-force winds {{across much of the}} island chain. Lajes Air Base reported sustained winds of 40mph (64km/h) with gusts to 59mph (94km/h). In addition, one man was killed by a rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in the Azores.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E

5|$|As it {{approached}} the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Swan Islands north of Honduras as a Category5 hurricane on September27. The hurricane caused rough seas, and strong winds uprooted trees and antennas. After gusts exceeded an estimated 100mph (160km/h), {{officials on the}} islands took shelter in a Navy seismograph building. Though no deaths were reported, Janet destroyed almost all buildings on the islands. The U.S. Weather Bureau and Civil Aeronautics Authority requested food and supplies for 82people on the island after the storm passed.|$|E
5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center {{southwest of}} Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence of}} a mid-level ridge that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica as it <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Dolly {{weakened}} as it accelerated northeastward, {{although it}} still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds. As a result, the United States Air Force ordered {{all of the}} planes on the island to fly to the mainland. After continued weakening, Dolly <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> island on September11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and little to no damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of Dolly later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September17.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Uxbridge {{adopted the}} Royal Navy {{destroyer}} HMS Intrepid in 1942, to help towards the ship's costs; Intrepid {{was lost to}} enemy action the following year. The town and surrounding areas suffered bombing by the Luftwaffe. V1 flying bombs fell on the town between June 1944 and March 1945. The first recorded bombing using a V1 was on 22 June 1944 at 07:00, when the bomb <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top of a bus and hit four houses nearby. Seven {{people were killed and}} 25 injured, leaving 46 houses in the area uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, a {{man named}} Mr. Butler {{requested}} permission of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to construct a tunnel or through cut through Nescopeck Mountain for the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Glen Summit Springs Hotel operated on top of Nescopeck Mountain. It was constructed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. During its most active use, it attracted visitors from the Wyoming Valley and from the East Coast of the United States. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ridge. In the late 1800s, the ridge was prospected for coal.|$|E

5|$|Joan made {{landfall}} {{just south}} of Bluefields on October 22. It <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> northern portion of Lake Nicaragua, passed over Managua, and entered the Pacific Ocean near Leon on October 23. Joan remained a hurricane or tropical storm during its entire passage over Central America, and was a minimal tropical storm when it reached the Pacific. As per the policy at the time, Joan was renamed Miriam.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of August 25, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made {{landfall}} as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami-Dade–Broward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result. The next morning, after passing over the state, Tropical Storm Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico, and reintensified back to hurricane strength. As the hurricane <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> warm waters of the Loop Current, the hurricane began to undergo rapid deepening.|$|E

After crossing Lake Okeechobee, Hurricane King <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> city of Okeechobee, which recorded a pressure of 977mbar. The winds diminished along the southern and {{western side of the}} storm, although winds gusted to hurricane force in many locations in eastern coastal Florida. Early on October19, King weakened to tropical storm status over north-central Florida, and later that day weakened further into a tropical depression over western Georgia. King curved northwestward, dissipating over Alabama on October20.|$|E
