2500|$|Dolphin was a keen {{motorcyclist}} (he owned a 1000cc Ariel Square Four), {{and with}} design help from Harry Lester, a former racing bike engineer, {{they developed a}} prototype of a small folding motorbike that could be dropped in a <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> and be used by paratroopers. Codenamed the [...] "Welbike" [...] {{this was to be}} the first operational transport for individual parachutists. The Welbike was the smallest motorcycle ever used by the British Armed Forces. Between 1942 and 1945, 3853 were built and although it was not much used by the SOE, many were issued to the Parachute Regiment and used at Arnhem during Operation Market Garden.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{activation}} device (AAD) in skydiving terminology {{refers to}} an electronic-pyrotechnic or mechanical device that automatically opens the main or reserve <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> at a preset altitude or after a preset time.|$|E
50|$|A reserve static line, {{occasionally}} {{called a}} Stevens Lanyard, is {{a device that}} automatically opens the reserve <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> when the main parachute is cut-away. The RSL is a lanyard connecting {{one or both of}} the main parachute risers to the reserve ripcord.|$|E
50|$|Some {{heavy weapons}} were dropped in special <b>parachute</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A large, open, high ceilinged {{space where}} {{parachute}} riggers re-pack <b>parachutes</b> into <b>parachute</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Skyhook was {{developed}} by the founder of United Parachute Technologies, Bill Booth. It was originally only available on Vector III <b>parachute</b> <b>containers.</b> Now it is being licensed to other manufacturers, Sunpath being the first licensee to market.|$|R
50|$|A solid-fuel rocket {{is used to}} {{pull the}} {{parachute}} out from its housing and deploy the canopy fully within seconds. Typically on ultralight installations the rocket is mounted on the <b>parachute</b> <b>container.</b> On larger aircraft installations the rocket may be remotely mounted.|$|E
50|$|AADs are {{typically}} used {{to open the}} reserve <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> at a preset altitude if the descent rate exceeds a preset activation speed. This indicates that the user has not opened his or her parachute, or that the parachute is malfunctioning and is not slowing the descent rate sufficiently.|$|E
50|$|The ALR Piranha {{would have}} been either a {{single-engine}} version, powered by RB199, EJ200 or M88 or a twin-engine model with two Larzacs. In the two models, only the rear portion of the aircraft would differ in size, affecting {{the arrangement of the}} <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> and the air brakes.|$|E
50|$|Trojan Ltd {{continued}} to make vans until war broke out and during hostilities made bomb racks and <b>parachute</b> <b>containers.</b> With peace, van production restarted still with the original engine until 1952 when it {{was replaced by a}} Perkins diesel.|$|R
50|$|The {{sequence}} of events leading {{to the arrest of}} Suttill started on the night of 10/11 June 1943 when some <b>parachuted</b> <b>containers</b> exploded during an operation in the Sologne that alerted the Germans. The local leader, Pierre Culioli, asked Suttill to suspend further parachute operations, but he refused.|$|R
25|$|From March 1945 Idland {{was working}} to {{establish}} the base area Varg in the Setesdal area. Idland was leading one of the Varg resistance groups, located at the mountain cabin Langelona. The group received supplies (weapons, ammunition and food) from <b>parachuted</b> <b>containers</b> delivered from allied aircraft. The Langelona group was still small {{when the war ended}} in May 1945.|$|R
50|$|The Sugar pack was a {{standardised}} haversack sized webbing carrier, {{composed of}} anaesthetics, drugs, bandages, gauze, swabs and plaster of Paris. It {{was designed to}} contain sufficient supplies for ten surgical cases. Sugar packs were sized so {{a number of them}} could be fitted into an airborne <b>parachute</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bungee cords {{have been}} used to provide a {{lightweight}} suspension for aircraft undercarriages from before World War I, and are still used on many small homebuilt aircraft where weight remains critical. [...] Bungee cords were also used in parachuting to assist in opening the old-style <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> after the ripcord was pulled.|$|E
50|$|The Don pack was a {{standardised}} haversack sized webbing carrier, {{composed of}} anaesthetics, drugs, serum, dressings, tins of tea, milk and sugar powder, cubes of meat extract, cigarettes, soap and candles. It {{was designed to}} contain sufficient supplies for twenty patients. Don packs were sized so {{a number of them}} could be fitted into an airborne <b>parachute</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main party {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Colonel Brian Franks arrived 18 days after the advance party on 30 August 1944. Their landing was not without incident. A <b>parachute</b> {{equipment}} <b>container</b> filled with ammunition exploded on contact with the ground. A member of the resistance assisting to move the <b>parachute</b> <b>containers</b> killed himself by eating plastic explosive, believing it was some sort of cheese. A Frenchman who was found in the area supposedly picking mushrooms, who the resistance believed was an informer, was detained. In the confusion following the explosion of the ammunition [...] container, he managed to snatch up a Sten gun and was shot trying to escape.|$|R
5000|$|Late in 1943, SOE {{established}} a base at Bari in Southern Italy, {{from which they}} operated their networks and agents in the Balkans. This organisation had the codename [...] "Force 133". This later became [...] "Force 266", reserving 133 for operations run from Cairo rather than the heel of Italy. Flights from Brindisi were run to the Balkans and Poland, particularly once control had been wrested from SOE's Cairo headquarters and was exercised directly by Gubbins. SOE {{established a}} new packing station for the <b>parachute</b> <b>containers</b> close to Brindisi Air base, {{along the lines of}} those created at Saffron Walden. This was ME 54, a factory employing hundreds, the American (OSS) side of which was known as [...] "Paradise Camp".|$|R
5000|$|At an {{altitude}} of 600 m, having been in free-fall for at least 300 m, a skydiver is falling at approximately 55 m/s, and is approximately 10.9 seconds from the ground. Most BASE jumps are made from less than 600 m. For example, a BASE jump from a 150 m object is about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. On a BASE jump, the parachute must open at about half the airspeed of a similar skydive, and more quickly (in a shorter distance fallen). Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers often use specially designed harnesses and <b>parachute</b> <b>containers,</b> with extra large pilot chutes, and many jump with only one parachute, since {{there would be little}} time to utilize a reserve parachute. In the early days of BASE jumping, people used modified skydiving gear, such as by removing the deployment bag and slider, stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute. However, modified skydiving gear is then prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as [...] "line-overs" [...] and broken lines). Modern purpose-built BASE jumping equipment is considered to be much safer and more reliable.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the Skyhook system over traditional RSLs is a higher reserve deployment after a cutaway. More altitude means more time for the skydiver to perform a safe landing, which is especially important because most malfunctions cause a significant loss of altitude. Since the Skyhook relies on a cutaway main, it offers no advantages in situations where the main parachute has not been deployed from the <b>parachute</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1963 the Poles started {{production}} of the final variant of the attack plane, the Lim-6bis. It had standard wings and single wheels, like the Lim-5 fighter. One important change was the addition of two underwing weapon pylons close to the fuselage. Another was the fitment of a braking <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> below the rudder. These aircraft entered the service in the Polish Air Force in 1963, but were not officially accepted until September 14, 1964.|$|E
50|$|The Su-30MKI is {{a highly}} {{integrated}} twin-finned aircraft. The airframe is constructed of titanium and high-strength aluminium alloys. The engine intake ramps and nacelles are fitted with trouser fairings to provide a continuous streamlined profile between the nacelles and the tail beams. The fins and horizontal tail consoles are attached to tail beams. The central beam section between the engine nacelles consists of the equipment compartment, fuel tank and the brake <b>parachute</b> <b>container.</b> The fuselage head is of semi-monocoque construction and includes the cockpit, radar compartments and the avionics bay.|$|E
50|$|The Captive Air Amphibious Transporter (CAAT) is a 1:5 scale tracked {{amphibious vehicle}} {{prototype}} {{being developed by}} DARPA. It drives on the water with air-filled pontoons attached to the tracks, and is intended to demonstrate how to transport standard 20- or 40-foot containers from ordinary container ships to shore without using a harbor. DARPA is investigating its usefulness in disasters so that commercial shipping can relieve military ships to focus on military tasks. The CAAT {{is one of four}} elements in the Tactically Expandable Maritime Platform (TEMP) program; the others being a containerized living quarter, a stabilized crane, and an unmanned powered <b>parachute</b> delivering <b>containers</b> by air.|$|R
5000|$|The {{kite balloon}} pilot had a {{parachute}} {{in a flat}} container attached to the observation basket suspended from the kite balloon, with the pilot only wearing a simple body harness around his waist, with shroud lines from the harness attached to the main <b>parachute</b> in the <b>container.</b> When the balloonist jumped, {{the main part of}} the parachute was pulled from the container, with the shroud lines first, followed by the main canopy. [...] A similar parachute system for the entire observation basket was tested at Rockaway Naval Air Station, but it was not widely used.|$|R
2500|$|Supplies were to {{be dropped}} in special waterproofed metal containers, [...] long and [...] in diameter, {{weighing}} [...] each. [...] Each aircraft could carry 12 containers (a load of [...] ) and with 20 aircraft per mission, it was hoped to deliver [...] of supplies per night. [...] Missions from Italy would follow the route along the Vistula, accessing Warsaw from the south along the river using the four bridges across the river as their aiming reference points. Supplies {{were to be}} released from a height of [...] at an airspeed of [...] (the slow speed to avoid separation of <b>parachutes</b> from their <b>containers).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dolphin was a keen {{motorcyclist}} (he owned a 1000cc Ariel Square Four), {{and with}} design help from Harry Lester, a former racing bike engineer, {{they developed a}} prototype of a small folding motorbike that could be dropped in a <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> and be used by paratroopers. Codenamed the [...] "Welbike" [...] {{this was to be}} the first operational transport for individual parachutists. The Welbike was the smallest motorcycle ever used by the British Armed Forces.

50|$|The {{airframe}} {{is constructed}} entirely from composite materials making possible for radio antennae {{to be placed}} inside the fuselage instead of outside such is usual for normal aircraft. At {{the base of the}} fuselage, underneath the wings there are two skids used for mounting and sliding across the side rails of the pneumatic catapult. Another small skid is installed underneath the frontal part of the fuselage that attaches to the middle rail of the catapult. Two more large skids are placed at {{the far edge of the}} wings. The <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> is installed in the frontal part of the fuselage. The parachute can be deployed for landing or in case of emergency.|$|E
5000|$|During {{and after}} World War II {{a number of}} new RDX-based {{explosives}} were developed, including Compositions C, C2, and eventually C3. Together with RDX these incorporate various plasticisers to decrease sensitivity and make the composition plastic. The origin of the obsolete term [...] "plastique" [...] dates back to the Nobel 808 explosive introduced to the U.S. by the British in 1940. The samples of explosive brought to the U.S. by the Tizard Mission had already been packaged by the SOE ready for dropping via <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> to the French Resistance and were therefore labelled in French, as Explosif Plastique. It is still referred to by this name in France and also by some Americans.|$|E
50|$|The {{throw-out}} {{pilot chute}} {{is the most}} popular type in use today. The pilot chute is packed in a pouch {{at the bottom of the}} container (often called BOC for short). The handle is attached to the apex of the pilot chute. When the user grabs the handle and throws the pilot chute into the airstream, the bridle extends, pulling the closing pin and opening the container, as the pilot chute continues in the airstream it extracts the deployment bag containing the main <b>parachute</b> from the <b>container.</b> The pull-out pilot chute and the throw-out pilot chute were both invented by Bill Booth.|$|R
5000|$|Stores {{were usually}} <b>parachuted</b> in {{cylindrical}} <b>containers.</b> The [...] "C" [...] type was 69 in long and when fully loaded could weigh up to 224 lb. The [...] "H" [...] type {{was the same}} size overall but could {{be broken down into}} five smaller sections. This made it easier to carry and conceal but made it impossible to carry long loads such as rifles. Some inert stores such as boots and blankets were [...] "free-dropped" [...] i.e. simply thrown out of the aircraft bundled together without a parachute, often to the hazard of any receiving committee on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} prototype {{was designed}} by SOE motor cycle enthusiast Harry Lester, from an idea developed by Lt. Colonel John Dolphin, the Commanding Officer of Station IX, the secret Inter-Services Military Research Establishment based in a mansion called The Frythe (latterly owned by the pharmaceutical company GSK) an hour's drive north of London {{near the town of}} Welwyn in Hertfordshire, which had been taken over for the war effort. Powered by a Villiers [...] single-cylinder two-stroke petrol (gasoline) engine, the Welbike was designed to fit into a CLE Canister - the standard <b>parachute</b> airdrop <b>container</b> 51 in long, 15 in high, and 12 in wide. Once deployed, they were easily assembled and ready for use as quickly as possible. The name Welbike comes from the custom that all the clandestine equipment devised at Station IX in Welwyn had names starting with Wel, e.g., Welman, Welrod. There was very limited space in the airborne equipment container, so the Welbike, which was carried in the container at an angle, had no suspension, no lights and just a single rear brake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuel tank}} was {{as small as}} {{possible}} and, because its bottom feed point was located lower than the carburetor, had to be pressurised occasionally by a hand pump built into the tank. The range on maximum capacity of [...] of fuel was 90 mi at about 30 mph. Tanks were pressurised before the Welbike went into action to save time. The Welbike was then packed into the <b>parachute</b> <b>container</b> with the rear wheel {{to the base of}} the parachute canister, which had a percussion head to minimise damage on landing. Once it hit the ground all that was needed was to twist the handlebars into position and lock them on spring-loaded pins. The saddle was pulled up and the footrests folded out ready to push start the two stroke engine and ride into action. The aim was that a paratrooper could remove the Welbike from its special green container (which was marked in white lettering with the words Motor Cycle) and its easily identified coloured parachute, and be on the road within 11 seconds. The prototype survived extensive drop testing at the Special Operations School at Arisaig in Scotland where it was demonstrated to the commando forces.|$|E
40|$|A {{baseline}} for a {{space shuttle}} configuration utilizing four parallel-burn 120 -in. diameter SRMS is presented. Topics discussed include parachute system sequence, recovery system development profile, <b>parachute</b> <b>container,</b> and segment and closure recovery operations. A cost analysis for recovery of the SRM stage is presented. It is concluded that {{from the standpoint of}} minimum cost and development, parachutes are the best means of achieving SRM recovery. Major SRM components can be reused safely...|$|E
5000|$|Supplies were to {{be dropped}} in special waterproofed metal containers, 2.45 m long and 0.9 m in diameter, {{weighing}} 150 kg each. Each aircraft could carry 12 containers (a load of 1800 kg) and with 20 aircraft per mission, it was hoped to deliver 35.5 t of supplies per night. [...] Missions from Italy would follow the route along the Vistula, accessing Warsaw from the south along the river using the four bridges across the river as their aiming reference points. Supplies {{were to be}} released from a height of 500 ft at an airspeed of 225 km/h (the slow speed to avoid separation of <b>parachutes</b> from their <b>containers).</b>|$|R
500|$|... {{and wooden}} boxes rotted or were eaten by insects. Parachutes for air {{dropping}} were in short supply. [...] Orders for parachutes {{were placed in}} Australia, the United States and India. A request for 5,000 cargo <b>parachutes</b> with <b>containers</b> was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September {{it was decided to}} send 1,000 without containers by air, while the rest went by sea. Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be [...] "free-dropped"—dropped without parachutes—so the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would have also increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier. Without a well-organised recovery effort, less that 50 percent of what was dropped was recovered, and perhaps 70 per cent of what was recovered was found to be in a usable condition.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to either}} an {{operator}} or rigging error, the wrong parachute was released when Harris attempted to cut-away. The parachute that was disconnected {{was the main}} parachute still packed on his back (which he had intended to deploy and land after the cut-away). Since the third parachute {{was connected to the}} risers of the main parachute (which had just been released) and not any part of Harris' harness, it began to quickly extract the main <b>parachute</b> from its <b>container</b> in a disorderly, out-of-sequence manner. Neither parachute could now be used to land Harris safely, and unfortunately Harris was unable to disentangle himself from the two partially open parachutes. Lacking clean air to deploy his reserve parachute, he was eventually forced to risk deploying it with the others still attached, and the reserve also entangled. His resulting fall-rate was not survivable.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 September 1966, the {{squadron}} again was re-formed, {{this time at}} RAF Abingdon as a transport unit. The first Hawker Siddeley Andover CMk1 aircraft arrived in December, and {{the squadron}} was tasked with transport support and tactical transport, for which the Andover's ability to [...] "kneel" [...] - to allow vehicle entry at a shallow angle via the rear ramp - was an asset. Over the years, the squadron acquired expertise in aero-medical evacuation, short take-off and landing, route flying and <b>parachute</b> and one-ton <b>container</b> drops. In addition to carrying equipment, vehicles, passengers or paratroops, the Andover could be fitted in a VIP role and carried Cabinet Ministers including (the late) John Davies, Julian Amery and Lord Carrington and {{was used for the}} parachute jump of HRH Prince Charles into Studland Bay during his RAF training in July 1971.|$|R
