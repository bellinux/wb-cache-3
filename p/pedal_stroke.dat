2500|$|Used {{for long}} distances, these unicycles are {{specially}} made to cover distances. They {{have a large}} wheel diameter, between 26 and 36 in., so more distance is covered in less pedal rotation. A 36" [...] unicycle made by the Coker Tire company started the big wheel trend. Some variations on the traditional touring unicycle include the Schlumpf [...] "GUni" [...] (geared unicycle), which uses a two-speed internal fixed-geared hub. Larger direct-drive wheels tend to have shorter cranks to allow for easier cadence and more speed. Geared wheels, with an effective diameter larger than the wheel itself, tend to use longer cranks to increase torque as they {{are not required to}} achieve such high cadences as direct-drive wheels, but demand greater force per <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke.</b> A 36" [...] Commuter unicycle was used by Bob Mueller to complete a cross-country unicycle trek from Cape Elizabeth, ME to Westport, WA on August 8th, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Bicycle cranks {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. Crank length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle. The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from 165mm to 180mm long in 2.5mm increments, with 170mm cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than 165mm and longer than 180mm. Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies' results have been mixed. Bicycle crank length has not been easy to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an adaptation period. Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider's size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider's cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very low rider torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an actute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke.</b> Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal ...|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} characteristics about a racing bicycle are its weight and stiffness which determine the efficiency {{at which the}} power from a rider's <b>pedal</b> <b>strokes</b> can {{be transferred to the}} drive-train and subsequently to its wheels. To this effect racing bicycles may sacrifice comfort for speed. The drop handlebars are positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture. The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling. The derailleur gear ratios are closely spaced so that the rider can pedal at their optimum cadence. Other racing bicycles, especially those used in time trialling, prioritize aerodynamics over comfort.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} enhance our {{understanding}} of supraspinal control of locomotion in stroke survivors {{and its relationship to}} locomotor impairment. We focused mainly on the locomotor component of walking, which involves rhythmic, reciprocal, flexion and extension movements of multiple joints in both legs. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to record human brain activity while pedaling was used as a model of locomotion. First, we examined the spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses recorded with fMRI and found that they were different in stroke survivors and control subjects. However, these differences were not substantial enough to require altering the normal canonical hemodynamic response function to obtain valid measurements of pedaling-related brain activity. During <b>pedaling,</b> <b>stroke</b> survivors and control subjects showed activity in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum. Stroke survivors had reduced volume of activation in those regions, however the signal intensity was similar between the groups. In stroke survivors, sensorimotor cortex activity was symmetrically distributed across the damaged and undamaged hemispheres; while cerebellum activity was lateralized to the damaged hemisphere. These brain activation patterns were different from those observed during non-locomotor movements, where volume of activation was unchanged but signal intensity was reduced in stroke survivors. We conclude that neural adaptations for producing locomotor and non-locomotor movements post-stroke are not the same and that the spinal cord and cerebellum might have a compensatory role in producing hemiparetic locomotion. Finally, we examined the relationship between locomotor performance and pedaling-related brain activity measured with fMRI. We found no relationship between the brain activation symmetry and locomotor symmetry, suggesting that the brain activation from each hemisphere was not directly responsible for control of the contralateral leg. However, our stroke survivors demonstrated poor locomotor performance and decreased volume of activation measured during pedaling, suggesting that impaired locomotion was associated with reduced volume of activation. Signal intensity of brain activity was associated with rate of <b>pedaling</b> in <b>stroke</b> survivors, suggesting that increased signal intensity in the active brain areas may compensate for reduced volume of activation in the production of hemiparetic locomotion...|$|R
5000|$|A cycling pad, {{also known}} as [...] "chamois" [...] or [...] "bikepad" [...] or [...] "Fondello" [...] (Italian), [...] "Gamuza" [...] or [...] "Badana" [...] (Spanish), Peau (French) is a {{protective}} insert that is applied in cycling shorts with {{the main purpose of}} protecting the groin from the friction of constant and prolonged saddle contact. Cycling pads were developed {{at the beginning of the}} 1900s and were exclusively made of deer leather up until the 1980s, when technical fabrics were introduced, and allowed for enhanced performance. The first high-tech thermo molded cycling pads date back to the early 1990s; gel inserts also make their first appearance and are used in addition to polyurethane foams for extra comfort. It is only in the year 2000 that the chamois is produced with an elastic technology, which allows the pad to move with the cyclist's body. This technology acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and it is these very few square inches that are vertically subject to body weight and pressure. For this reason it is essential for a cycling pad to be capable of protecting the body from the compression the body exerts in contact with the saddle and from chafing in the inner leg area, that is due to the thousands of <b>pedal</b> <b>strokes</b> and revolutions that a cyclist carries out during a normal workout.|$|R

Elite level triathletes often practice multiple sports in short succession, potentially leaving neuromuscular adaptations learned during the first discipline subject to disruption by the second. Cyclists, in contrast, tend to avoid other physical activity after completing daily training loads. Indeed, this study demonstrated that trained cyclists show very little muscle coactivation and variability in muscle recruitment patterns, both signs of a very efficient <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke,</b> while triathletes showed muscle activation patterns that were comparable to untrained individuals.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that novice and elite cyclists use {{different}} patterns of leg muscle recruitment when cycling. These differences may reflect less skilled muscle recruitment by novice cyclists or different, but not necessarily less skilled, movement patterns. We compared kinematics of the pelvis and lower limbs and leg muscle activity during cycling between novice and elite cyclists, to determine if differences in leg muscle activity are associated with differences in movement patterns. Three-dimensional pelvic and lower limb kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity of leg muscles were measured during cycling at 55 – 60, 75 – 80, 90 – 95 rpm and preferred cadence. Differences were found between novice and elite cyclists in the recruitment of leg muscles, which were consistent with previous findings. Joint-angle and velocity were not different between groups. Absolute range of sagittal plane motion of the ankle was less in novice cyclists than in elite cyclists. Cadence did not influence kinematics. Coordination of sagittal plane motion of the hip and ankle, and knee and ankle, was stronger in elite cyclists. Furthermore, coordination of these movements was more consistent between <b>pedal</b> <b>strokes</b> in elite cyclists. Individual variance of kinematics was not different between groups. We conclude that differences in leg muscle recruitment between novice and elite cyclists may be explained in part by small kinematic variations at the ankle, i. e. less absolute range of motion, but contend that differences in muscle recruitment are primarily a reflection of more skilled muscle recruitment by elite cyclists...|$|R
50|$|Creating the {{impression}} of increased power the accelerator was remapped, becoming much more sensitive to movement, particularly {{at the beginning of}} the <b>pedal's</b> new shorter <b>stroke.</b> This, coupled with the harsh suspension, makes it very hard for the driver to drive smoothly at low speeds on streets with even slight bumps. The lack of power steering has also been noted by drivers as making the car tiring and hard to steer at low speed.|$|R
5000|$|Mountain bike {{suspension}} {{technology has}} made great advances since first {{appearing in the}} early 1990s. Early full suspension frames were heavy and tended to bounce up and down while a rider pedaled. This movement was called pedal bob, kickback, or monkey motion and took power out of a rider's <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke</b> [...] - [...] especially during climbs up steep hills. Input from hard braking efforts also negatively affected early full suspension designs. When a rider hit the brakes, these early suspensions compressed into their travel and lost some {{of their ability to}} absorb bumps.

When braking efforts cause the suspension to compress it is referred to as brake squat, when braking causes the suspension to extend it is called brake jack.|$|E
50|$|If the {{exercise}} {{is not done}} correctly or the rider's position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort {{it is important to}} make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the ball of the foot when the pedal is pointing forward. This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat {{at the bottom of the}} <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke.</b> Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it in level with the seat.|$|E
50|$|To measure torque, strain gages {{which are}} {{precisely}} laid along the left crank arm. These gages detect the flex of the crank arm when a downward force is applies. This force is multiplied by 9.8 m/s2 {{and the length}} of crank arm are used to determine the force applied to the <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke,</b> known as torque. To measure cadence, Stages Cycling uses an accelerometer. Housed in the circuity for the meter, this eliminated any need external magnets, sensors, cables or zip ties when measuring cadence. The accelerometer can capture multiple positions per revolution, resulting in more data. Once torque and cadence are collected they are multiplied together to determine the power of a single stroke. This number is then multiplied by 2 with the assumption that both legs produce relatively the same force. This is the key factor that allows Stages Power to exist {{on one side of the}} crank, and keeps the meter small and economical. Stages Power Meters are also equipped with Active Temperature Compensation with allows the power meter to compensate for temperature changes that would otherwise affect the stain gages and their ability to accurately measure force. This technology auto-adjusts to keep power readings accurate without the need to recalibrate and stop pedalling. To capture data the meters use ANT+ and Bluetooth protocols. This also allows the meter to be updated at any time.|$|E
40|$|Studies of arm {{movements}} {{suggest that}} interference with motor learning occurs when multiple tasks are practiced in sequence or with short interim periods. However, interference with learning {{has only been}} studied during training periods of 1 - 7 days {{and it is not}} known if interference with learning continues during long-term multitask training. This study investigated muscle recruitment in highly trained triathletes, who swim, cycle and run sequentially during training and competition. Comparisons were made to highly trained and novice cyclists, i. e. between trained multidiscipline, trained single-discipline and novice single-discipline athletes, to investigate adaptations of muscle recruitment that occur in response to ongoing multitask, or multidiscipline, training. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of five leg muscles, tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius lateralis and soleus muscles, was recorded during cycling using intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. Differences were found between trained triathletes and trained cyclists in recruitment of all muscles, and patterns of muscle recruitment in trained triathletes were similar to those recorded in novice cyclists. More specifically, triathletes and novice cyclists were characterised by greater sample variance (i. e. greater variation between athletes), greater variation in muscle recruitment patterns between <b>pedal</b> <b>strokes</b> for individual cyclists, more extensive and more variable muscle coactivation, and less modulation of muscle activity (i. e. greater EMG amplitude between primary EMG bursts). In addition, modulation of muscle activity decreased with increasing cadence (i. e. the amplitude and duration of muscle activity was greater at higher movement speeds) in both triathletes and novice cyclists but modulation of muscle activity was not influenced by cadence in trained cyclists. Our findings imply that control of muscle recruitment is less developed in triathletes than in cyclists matched for cycling training loads, which suggests that multidiscipline training may interfere with adaptation of the neuromuscular system to cycling training in triathletes...|$|R

Five low-fit individuals (men VO[subscript ???max] [less than or equal to] 40 ml/kg/min, women VO[subscript ???max] [les than or equal to] 34 ml/kg/min) performed constant-load exercise until intolerance in three different environmental conditions; normoxia, moderate hypoxia (F[subscript IO???] = 0. 15), and moderate hyperthermia (42 ??C, 40 % RH). Prior to each trial, a linear relationship between power and EMG at various efforts was established (R?? = 0. 98). At the point of intolerance, subjects performed 5 - 6 <b>pedal</b> <b>strokes</b> at maximal effort to determine fatigue. Time to intolerance was shorter in the hyperthermic trials (151. 4 ?? 51. 4 s) compared to the normoxic (269. 6 ?? 62. 2 s, p = 0. 001) and hypoxic (222. 4 ?? 34. 6 s, p = 0. 008) trials. However, {{there were no differences}} in performance fatigue (- 189. 2 ?? 111. 9 W, - 205 ?? 95. 3 W, - 180. 8 ?? 108. 5 W) peripheral fatigue (- 94. 2 ?? 74. 4 W, - 107. 2 ?? 50. 7 W, - 92. 8 ?? 71. 7 W) or recruitment activity (- 23. 4 ?? 13. 1 %, - 25. 3 ?? 13. 8 %, - 26. 5 ?? 14. 5 %) between normoxic, hypoxic, and hyperthermic conditions, respectively. With decreased times to intolerance and similar levels of peripheral fatigue, the adverse conditions increased the rate of peripheral fatigue. As peripheral fatigue has been considered to govern central fatigue, central fatigue was also unaffected by the conditions. Performance fatigue, being the result of both central and peripheral factors, also remained unchanged. These results indicated moderate hyperthermia and hypoxia do not alter central or peripheral fatigue contributions towards intolerance. Additionally, these results support the concept of an individualized critical peripheral fatigue threshold. Once reached, this threshold elicits recruitment fatigue, restricting further increases in peripheral fatigue possibly to prevent muscle/organ damage/failure...|$|R
40|$|Motor {{impairment}} after stroke {{has been}} hypothesized to be related, among others, to impairments in the modular control of movement. In {{this study we}} analyzed muscle coordination and pedal forces during a recumbent pedaling exercise from a sample of post-acute stroke patients (n= 5) and a population of age-matched healthy individuals (n= 4). Healthy subjects and the less impaired patients showed a shared modular organization of pedaling based on 4 similar muscle synergies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aerodynamic}} drag of a cyclist mannequin {{is measured in}} a ¾ open jet wind tunnel. The mannequin leg position is systematically varied over a complete crank cycle and {{aerodynamic drag}} measurements are taken every 15 degrees. The results show that rider aerodynamic drag is strongly affected by leg position with {{a difference between the}} maximum and minimum drag coefficients measured over a pedal cycle being approximately 15 %. A small variation in cyclist frontal area is apparent over the <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke,</b> however the change in aerodynamic drag coefficient is identified as the dominant mechanism affecting cyclist drag. A series of flow visualization studies have been used to demonstrate the large effect that the position of the legs has on the flow around the entire body of the mannequin. It is observed that the flow regime is symmetrical for the low drag case and asymmetrical for the high drag case. This work highlights that the flow regime changes significantly throughout the <b>pedal</b> <b>stroke</b> of a cyclist, and consequently drag varies. This has implications in terms of analyzing cyclist aerodynamic performance as it highlights that multiple flow regimes should be considered...|$|E
