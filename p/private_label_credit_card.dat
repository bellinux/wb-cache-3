40|$|Now a day {{the usage}} of <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> has {{dramatically}} increased. As <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> becomes the most popular mode of payment for both online as well as regular purchase, cases of fraud associated with it are also rising. Various techniques like classification, clustering and apriori of web mining will be integrated to represent the sequence of operations in <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transaction processing and show {{how it can be}} used for the detection of frauds. Initially, web mining techniques trained with the normal behaviour of a cardholder. If an incoming <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transaction is not accepted by the web mining model with sufficiently high probability, it is considered to be fraudulent. At the same time, the system will try to ensure that genuine transactions will not be rejected. Using data from a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> issuer, a web mining model based fraud detection system will be trained on a large sample of <b>labelled</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> account transactions and tested on a holdout data set that consisted of all account activity. Web mining techniques can be trained on examples of fraud due to lost cards, stolen cards, application fraud, counterfeit fraud, and mail-order fraud. The proposed system will be able to detect frauds by considering a cardholder’s spending habit without its significance. Usually, the details of items purchased in individual transactions are not known to any Fraud Detection System. The proposed system will be an ideal choice for addressing this problem of current fraud detection system. Another important advantage of proposed system will be a drastic {{reduction in the number of}} False Positives transactions. FDS module of proposed system will receive the card details and the value of purchase to verify, whether the transaction is genuine or not. If the Fraud Detection System module will confirm the transaction to be of fraud, it will raise an alarm, and the transaction will be declined...|$|R

40|$|RFID tags, small {{microchips}} {{no bigger}} than grains of rice, are currently being embedded in product <b>labels,</b> clothing, <b>credit</b> <b>cards,</b> and the environment, among other sites. Activated by the appropriate receiver, they transmit information ranging from product information such as manufacturing date, delivery route, and location where the item was purchased to (in the case of <b>credit</b> <b>cards)</b> the name, address, and credit history of the person holding the card. Active RFIDs {{have the capacity to}} transmit data without having to be activated by a receiver; they can be linked with embedded sensors to allow continuous monitoring of environmental conditions, applications that interest both environmental groups and the US military. The amount of information accessible through and generated by RFIDs is so huge that it may well overwhelm all existing data sources and become, from the view-point of human time limitations, essentially infinite. What to make of these technologies will be interrogated through two contemporary fictions, David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas and Philip K. Dick’s Ubik. Cloud Atlas focuses on epistemological questions – who knows what about whom, in a futuristic society where all citizens wear embedded RFID tags and are subject to constant surveillance. Resistance takes the form not so much of evasion (tactical moves in a complex political Situation) but rather as a struggle to transmit information to present and future stakeholders in a world on the brink of catastrophe. Ubik, by contrast, focuses on deeper ontological ques-tions about the nature of reality itself. Both texts point to the necessity to reconceptualize information as ethical action embedded in contexts and not merely as a quantitative measure of probabilities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{have become}} a {{noticeable}} feature on most American households’ financial landscape. Data from the Bank for International Settlements indicate {{that the number of}} <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in circulation increased 34 percent between 1988 and 1994, and the number of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 55 percent. The data also show that the value of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 98 percent during the same period. The higher number of cards and their use increased the size of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, so that total consumer revolving credit outstanding grew from $ 175 billion to $ 339 billion. Unfortunately, aggregate data like those above fail to provide information about the composition of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth. So it is impossible to tell whether the increased debt arose from a general {{increase in the number of}} households or from a larger proportion of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Aggregate data also do not reveal who holds <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> balances—upper- or lower-income households—nor do they indicate which factor contributed more to the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt—an increase in the number of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> or an increase in average <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> indebtedness. Such detailed information about the components of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth is important because each component has different implications for the viability of the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt. Household data provide some of the information we need to examine the different strata of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt.
