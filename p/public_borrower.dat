Constituted as our system of finance and taxation is, the interests of the contracting parties cannot well be separated, whatever they may reciprocally intend. He who is the hard lender of to-day to-morrow is the generous contributor to his own payment. For example, the last loan is raised on public taxes, which are designed to produce annually two millions sterling. At first view, this is an annuity of two millions dead charge upon the public in favor of certain moneyed men; but inspect the thing more nearly, follow the stream in its meanders, and you will find that there is a good deal of fallacy in this state of things.|$|E

The competing interests of creditors and debtors, combined with the increasing necessity of advancing welfare worldwide, {{make it difficult to}} establish a workable scheme that provides adequate assistance to needy countries. Foreign aid is evidently part of the solution to development problems. However, conditions imposed by international lenders bring about certain discontents. The World Bank's negative pledge clause forbids a <b>public</b> <b>borrower</b> from securing external debt that is preferential to that of the Bank. This covenant also includes several exceptions: short-term secured banking transactions and financing, through the transfer of state-owned assets, are allowed. Moreover, only in exceptional circumstances does the Bank waive the clause's application. Thus, in order to secure foreign debt, a borrowing government is usually forced to contract financing that falls within the covenant's exceptions. This Paper analyzes the World Bank's negative pledge clause and compares it to the provisions used in commercial lending. It also reviews the historical tendencies and current trends with respect to sovereign borrowing, and concludes that the World Bank's negative pledge clause should be amended, in order to bring it closer to commercial practice. It is argued that the amendments proposed in this thesis will enhance the Bank's dual function and role as both a creditor and a development institution...|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} {{global and}} regional fluctuations in international private debt flows to emerging {{and developing countries}} using data on cross border loans and international bond issuance over 1993 - 2009. We estimate the effects of individual borrower characteristics as well as macroeconomic conditions {{on the cost of}} foreign borrowing and test whether these effects differ across phases of the lending cycle. We find that public and financial institutions benefit from lower spreads compared to private and nonfinancial firms and that lenders may differentiate the risk associated with the borrower’s industrial sector between good and bad times. The loan (bond) rating has an equally robust spread reduction effect across credit cycle phases. The results also suggest that international reserve holdings and investment ratios {{have a significant effect on}} reducing credit spreads for loans, while higher reserve holdings and longer maturities matter more for bond spreads.

40|$|Financing {{trade between}} {{economic}} agents located {{in different countries}} is affected by many types of risks, resulting from incomplete information about the debtor, the problems of enforcing international contracts, or the prevalence of political and financial crises. Trade is important for economic development {{and the availability of}} trade finance is essential, especially for developing countries. Relatively few studies treat the topic of political risk, particularly in the context of international lending. This thesis explores new ground to identify links between political risk and international debt defaults. The core hypothesis of the study is that the default probability of debt increases with increasing political risk in the country of the borrower. The thesis consists of three essays that support the hypothesis from different angles of the credit evaluation process. The first essay takes {{the point of view of}} an international lender assessing the credit risk of a <b>public</b> <b>borrower.</b> The second investigates creditworthiness assessment of companies. The obtained results are substantiated in the third essay that deals with an extensive political risk survey among finance professionals in developing countries. The financial instruments of core interest are export credit guaranteed debt initiated between the Export Credit Agency of Finland and buyers in 145 countries between 1975 and 2006. Default events of the foreign credit counterparts are conditioned on country-specific macroeconomic variables, corporate-specific accounting information as well as political risk indicators from various international sources. Essay 1 examines debt issued to government controlled institutions and conditions public default events on traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, in addition to selected political and institutional risk factors. Confirming previous research, the study finds country indebtedness and the GDP growth rate to be significant indicators of public default. Further, it is shown that public defaults respond to various political risk factors. However, the impact of the risk varies between countries at different stages of economic development. Essay 2 proceeds by investigating political risk factors as conveivable drivers of corporate default and uses traditional accounting variables together with new political risk indicators in the credit evaluation of private debtors. The study finds links between corporate default and leverage, as well as between corporate default and the general investment climate and measeures of conflict in the debtor country. Essay 3 concludes the thesis by offering survey evidence on the impact of political risk on debt default, as perceived and experienced by 103 finance professionals in 38 developing countries. Taken together, the results of the thesis suggest that various forms of political risk are associated with international debt defaults and continue to pose great concerns for both international creditors and borrowers in developing countries. The study provides new insights on the importance of variable selection in country risk analysis, and shows how political risk is actually perceived and experienced in the riskier, often lower income countries of the global economy...|$|E

Using firms with watch-preceded rating downgrades (control firms) as a benchmark, we document that firms with watch-preceded rating confirmations (treatment firms) experience an increase in long-term financing, investment, and profitability immediately following the credit watch period. These patterns are stronger for treatment firms of lower credit quality, for which external monitoring is more valuable. We further show that financially constrained treatment firms substantially increase their long-term financing immediately following the watch period, indicating that agency’s monitoring can help alleviate capital constraints resulting from information asymmetry. Additional tests show that treatment firms are more profitable regardless of corporate governance, implying that agency’s monitoring is independent of corporate governance. These findings suggest that credit agencies have real effects on corporate behavior, and that a credit watch with direction downgrade acts as an effective monitoring mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{bond prices}} are {{tumbling}} and rates rising just as <b>public</b> <b>borrowers</b> face pressure to refinance deals cut during the financial crisis. At the same time, the funded status of public pension plans has declined, and {{states and localities}} {{will have to come}} up with more money to meet future benefit payments. In the private sector, numerous studies have shown that pension underfunding affects corporate bond ratings. And Moody’s just announced that it would combine unfunded pension liabilities with outstanding bonds when evaluating a state’s leverage position. These developments raise the question of how future pension commitments affect today’s borrowing costs in the public sector. The brief proceeds as follows. The first section describes the municipal bond market. The second section describes the factors that traditionally have been considered in the bond rating process. The third section summarizes what other researchers have found regarding the relationship between pension commitments and borrowing costs in the private and public sectors. The fourth section presents a model for the period 2005 - 2009 that relates borrowing costs to factors generally considered by the rating agencies, such as the state’s management, finances, economy, and debt structure. Pensions are a component of the debt structure, and the extent to which states make their Annual Required Contribution (ARC) has a statistically significant – albeit modest – impact on the cost of debt. A side finding is that the bond’s rating explains relatively little about the variation in interest cost, and the effect of pensions remains significant even including the bond’s rating in the equation. The final section concludes that while pension underfunding had only a small effect on borrowing costs in the 2005 - 2009 period when pension expenses were only 3 to 4 percent of state budgets, its impact could become more significant as the cost of pensions increases. ...|$|R

40|$|Die europ 4 ische Schuldenkrise hat zentrale Defizite des Binnenmarkts offengelegt. Regulatorische Defizite haben Anreize geschaffen, eine zu hohe Verschuldung einzugehen. Zwar wurde eine einheitliche Geldpolitik verfolgt, gleichzeitig aber die Kompetenzen f die Aufsicht und Restrukturierung von Banken auf nationaler Ebene belassen. So sind Anreize entstanden, Risiken auf die europ 4 ische Ebene zu verlagern. Eine Bankenunion und die Etablierung eines einheitlichen Aufsichtsmechanismus haben das Ziel, diese Defizite zu beheben. Grunds 4 tzlich ist eine Bankenunion eine notwendige Erg 4 nzung des Binnenmarkts. Sie ist aber vor allem ein langfristiges Projekt, das keinesfalls das aktuelle Problem des privaten und 6 ffentlichen Schulden l 6 sen kann (Buch und Weigert, 2012; SVR, 2012 a). The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis has revealed severe {{flaws in the}} design of the internal market. Both, private and <b>public</b> <b>borrowers</b> had incentives for excessive borrowing, which have been created by deficits in the regulatory structure of financial markets. Capital requirements for banks were too low and had procyclical effects (Favara and Ratnovski 2012). Supervision has been ineffective with regard to containing the build-up of risks in banks' balance sheets. Common monetary policy in the Euro Area has not been accompanied by the transfer of authority to supervise and restructure banks which has, in turn, created incentives to shift risks to the European level. Risks of banks and states have become dangerously intertwined. Proposals for a banking union aim at correcting these deficits. In principle, a banking union is a necessary complement to other elements of the internal market. In an integrated capital market, banking distress in one country can have negative externalities for the stability of financial systems in other countries. Such risks are even more pronounced if other countries are affected through a common monetary policy. The banking union currently being discussed has three elements (President of the European Council 2012) : banking supervision at the European level, a European authority for bank restructuring and resolution financed by a bank resolution fund, and a European deposit insurance fund. So far, concrete proposals have been made for the establishment of a Single Supervisory Mechanism only. However, a banking union is a long-term project. It is not the key to a solution to the acute problems in Europe's banking sectors (Buch and Weigert 2012, GCEE 2012 a) ...|$|R

To contribute to knowledge by engaging {{in a study of}} the relationship between Australia, New Zealand and international capital markets 1850 - 1950 which would focus on three key themes: i. 	The history of Australia and New Zealand as borrowers and debtors. ii. 	The rise and consolidation of the British 'colonial' market in the London capital market from the mid-nineteenth century to the late 1920 s. iii. 	The interaction between the market disciplines to which all borrowers were subject, and the opportunities and constraints created by membership of the British Empire. The study would also evaluate recent arguments (Cain and Hopkins, 1993) {{about the role of the}} City of London in the dynamics of British imperial expansion and control with respect to two British settler societies, Australia and New Zealand. 2. 	To extend and revise the statistics of Australasian public debt in the period 1850 - 1950. 3. 	To create a database of Australasian overseas public loans during that period. The projects specific objectives were to complete three stages of research: 1. 	The consultation of archival and printed official sources in the United Kingdom and Australia relating to Australasian borrowing activity and relations with overseas creditors during nineteenth century. These either had not been available to, or were not consulted by, earlier historians. 2. 	The collection of quantitative data for revised statistics of Australian and New Zealand public debt between 1850 and 1950. 3. 	The collection of data for a database of Australasian overseas public loans during that period. Main Topics : This dataset publishes new statistics of Australian colonial and state debt, and of capital raised by all Australian <b>public</b> <b>borrowers</b> (including corporation) in London, until 1914. Current historical statistics do not distinguish between stocks of debt held locally or abroad. Moreover, the time series of new capital subscribed or received in London prepared by Butlin, Simon, Hall, and others often aggregate all colonial public borrowing, have different terminal dates, and are inconsistent with each other. The new statistics remedy these deficiencies. Three types of table are presented. The first disaggregates, and where necessary corrects, the official annual statistics of stocks of outstanding debt of each Australian colony, distinguishing between the place of original sale, long and short-term securities, and gross new issues (i. e. the nominal value of all securities sold) and repayments. The second shows the stocks of long and short term debt held in Australia and the United Kingdom. These are taken principally from Statistical Registers, and include debt (e. g. stock issued by Savings Banks) omitted from the official statistics in the early years. The final type of table summarises the principal annual flows in London of capital created (including as a result of conversions and exchanges), subscribed, received, and amortized for each colonial government and for public corporations as a single group. It excludes flows arising from remittance of securities originally sold in the colonies, but includes transfers from London to colonial registers and purchases from sinking funds where they are known. The data is presented in 18 spreadsheets and are of seven separate borrowers: New South Wales (3 spreadsheets), Victoria (3), Queensland (3), South Australia (3), Tasmania (2), Western Australia (2), and public corporations (1).

Although they account for the lion''s share of capital markets, regional public debt markets remain underdeveloped {{for a variety of}} reasons. The problems of small scale, dollarization, and weak public finances in many countries are compounded by poor structure and composition of debt (with sizeable nonstandard and non-tradable components), fragmentation of public debt between central banks and the sovereigns and across instruments, poor debt management practices, weaknesses in securities market, and small investor bases all of which result in high transaction costs and a lack of liquid benchmarks. The paper also briefly discusses efforts towards and impediments to regional integration of public debt markets. The authorities recognize these problems and the paper takes note of the regional efforts to harmonize debt standards and improve issuance practices.

Our evidence suggests that loan and bond ratings are not determined by the same model. Finally, we estimate a credit spread model incorporating bank loan ratings and other factors reflecting default risk, information asymmetry, and agency problems. We find that ratings are related to loan rates, given the effect of other influences on yields, suggesting that ratings provide information not reflected in financial information. Ratings may capture idiosyncratic information about recovery rates, as each of the agencies claims, or information about default prospects not available to the market. 2006 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R

I find that the HOT equity market borrowers generally have higher market-to-book ratios compared to the COLD market borrowers. Also, in HOT equity markets, the public debt firms (i. e. the corporate bond issuers) tend to have fewer tangible assets, the private placement firms tend to be smaller and highly levered, and the syndicated loan firms tend to be smaller, more profitable, and less levered compared to the COLD market firms.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} draw {{lessons from the}} IMF’s {{experience}} in handling financial crises around the globe {{over the past ten}} years that are relevant to the challenges faced by countries in Latin America, especially in the wake of the recent crisis in Argentina. Experience suggests that there is no quick or easy fix in the face of a wide-ranging crisis involving both acute external financing pressures and rapidly changing asset prices that undermine financial stability and household and corporate balance sheets. In the end, effective solutions depend on developing a comprehensive strategy combining the full range of fiscal, monetary, financial system, and debt policy instruments.
