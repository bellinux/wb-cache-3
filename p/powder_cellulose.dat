These include: titanium (iv) oxide, iron <b>powder,</b> <b>Cellulose,</b> sodium silicate binder and other additives. In this work, one of the major components was technically and economically substituted. The more popular but expensive potassium silicate binder was replaced by the more readily available sodium silicate. For the newly chosen binder to perform effectively, it was enriched with potassium carbonate (Potash). The flux formulation was not based on the old method of trial and error but some mathematical methods, especially the experimental design approach were applied. The Mc-Cleans and Anderson method was used in the preliminary design to generate the orthogonal array that guided the formulation. Four major components: Titanium dioxide, Iron <b>powder,</b> <b>cellulose</b> and Sodium silicate binder enriched with Potash were considered as the major contributing elements. An electrode made out of the flux was used by some professional welders and their comment {{on the quality of the}} electrode was impressive. Tests on the sample of the weldment showed that it could withstand a tensile strength up to 430 N/mm 2. The Brinell’s harness value gave a maximum of 608 N/mm 2. Also, the Nick Break revealed a good penetration, no slag inclusion. The micrograph presented an acceptable grain structure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} effect of biogas {{production}} with a single component in the waste, the phenomena of biogas production with the groups of fat <b>powder,</b> <b>cellulose</b> powder and protein powder inoculated respectively in activated sludge from Liu Minying biomass pool and Xiao Hongmen Sewage Plant were observed simultaneously. Six reactors in total were settled. Gas production and the component of the biogas were monitored by GC everyday. Three single materials and the sludge were inspected with infrared spectrometer {{from the beginning of}} the installment of the reactors. The results of the experiments show that cellulose powder has the best ability on the respect of methane production, and fat powder is worse than cellulose powder but better than protein powder. On the respect of hydrogen production, protein powder is the best and the other two materials produce gas without hydrogen at all. Compared with sludge from the two different origins, sludge from Liu Minying biomass pool is better both on methane and hydrogen production. The difference of sludge FTIR figures between Liu Minying biomass pool and Xiao Hongmen Sewage Plant can explain this to some degree...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>powder</b> <b>cellulose</b> (PC) and 2 types of {{microcrystalline}} (MCC 101 and MCC 301) on pellet properties produced by an extrusion/spheronization process was investigated. The different investigated types of cellulose displayed different behavior during the extrusion/spheronization process. Pure PC was unsuitable for extrusion, because too much water was required and the added water was partly squeezed during the extrusion process. In contrast, MCC 101 and MCC 301 were extrudable at {{a wide range of}} water content, but the quality of the resulting products varied. In the extrusion/spheronization process, MCC 101 was the best substance, with easy handling and acceptable product properties. The properties of the extrudates and pellets were determined by Fourier transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). FT-Raman spectroscopy was able to distinguish between the original substances and also between the wet and dried extrudates. The particle sizes of the raw material and of the extrudates were determined by ESEM with-out additional preparation. For MCC, the size of the resulting particles within the extrudate or pellet was smaller. However, in the extrudates of PC, changes in particle size could not be observed...|$|E

40|$|The study {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} influence of the degree of polymerization (DP) of cellulose materials (microcrystalline cellulose [MCC] and <b>powder</b> <b>cellulose</b> [PC]) on the behavior of these materials during homogenization and extrusion/spheronization processes. Suspensions of the cellulose types with different DP values were homogenized using a high-pressure homogenizer. The particle size, agglomeration index, and apparent viscosity of these suspensions was determined at different times after pouring. Additionally, these different cellulose types were processed into pellets using the extrusion/spheronization, method, and the water content and power consumption {{as a function of the}} DP were determined. Cellulose types with a high DP value showed greater particle size after homogenization, than the types with a low DP value. In contrast, no relevant relationship between the apparent viscosity and DP could be observed. During the extrusion process, water content in the extrudate and pellet porosity were increased as the DP was increased for the extrudates produced at the same level of power consumption. MCC types with various DPs compared with PC provided a novel way of understanding the role of cellulose in the extrusion process. The DP showed a remarkable influence on the physicochemical properties of the cellulose materials and, consequently, on the behavior of these materials during the extrusion/spheronization process. It is postulated that the sponge model is more appropriate for the cellulose type with high DP (PC), whereas the gel model is more applicable to cellulose types with lower DP (MCC) ...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{reactions}} and secondary effects resulting from cellulose fast pyrolysis were investigated. It {{was found that}} mass transfer limitations existed when the sample weight of <b>powder</b> <b>cellulose</b> was larger than 0. 8 mg or when the cellulose particles were pyrolyzed at a larger characteristic length scale. Similar pyrolysis product distributions were obtained for celluloses of differing crystallinity, degree of polymerization, and feedstock type, implying that the primary products from cellulose were not influenced by these factors. Interactions between cellulose-hemicellulose and cellulose-lignin during fast pyrolysis were examined by comparing the pyrolysis products from their native mixture, physical mixture and superposition of individual components. Negligible interaction was found for either binary physical mixture. For the native cellulose-hemicellulose mixture no significant interaction was identified either. In {{the case of the}} native cellulose-lignin mixture, herbaceous biomass exhibited an apparent interaction. However, such interaction was not found for woody biomass. An acid-base bi-functional catalyst, which was synthesized by acid treating a natural mixed metal oxide, serpentine, was studied for catalytic deoxygenation of bio-oil model compounds. Catalyst characterization revealed stronger acid sites were introduced by the formation of bridged hydroxyl groups between a Si atom and a heteroatom during acid treatment. It was also suggested that the acidic and basic sites are closely jointed together in the bi-functional catalyst. The acid-base bi-functional catalyst could best promote aldol condensation reactions, comparing to single acid, single base, and physical mixture of acid and base. The best deoxygenation was also observed for the bi-functional catalyst during catalytic conversion of the single model compound. Catalytic deoxygenation during cellulose fast pyrolysis was performed over acid, base, transitional metal compounds and acid-base bi-functional catalyst. The results showed the bi-functional catalyst achieved the best balance between deoxygenation and bio-oil yield among the tested materials. It appeared that during catalysis, the acidic sites primarily promoted dehydration while the basic sites mainly promoted fragmentation reactions. Compared to a physical mixture of acid and base materials, the bi-functional catalyst appeared to promote deoxygenation reactions more effectively presumably due to the presence of adjacent acid and base sites...|$|E
