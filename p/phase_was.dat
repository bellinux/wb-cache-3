5|$|The entire works was {{upgraded}} between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The {{plan was}} announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost £1 million. The first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> {{the construction of a}} filter pressing plant, for which the main contractor was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a storm sewage separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary sedimentation tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old sedimentation tanks were converted to become temporary storm sewage tanks. This fourth <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake {{did not have to be}} taken to Thrybergh to be dumped.|$|E

50|$|The MPI Stuttering Treatment Schedule {{is divided}} into 4 <b>phases.</b> Those <b>phases</b> <b>are</b> Pre-Treatment, Establishment, Transfer, and Maintenance. Each <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to be managed jointly by the speaker (person who stutters) and the clinician. The Pre-Treatment <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> directed by the clinician, but the other <b>phases</b> <b>are</b> largely self-managed while also requiring regular validation by a clinician.|$|R
50|$|If {{the mass}} {{fraction}} of the dispersed <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> small, then one-way coupling between the <b>phases</b> <b>is</b> a reasonable assumption; that is, {{the dynamics of the}} particle <b>phase</b> <b>are</b> affected by the carrier phase, but the reverse is not the case. However if the mass {{fraction of the}} dispersed <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> large, the interaction of the dynamics between the two <b>phases</b> must <b>be</b> considered - this is two-way coupling.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E
5|$|As {{the school}} roll grew, the old {{buildings}} became too small. A major building programme {{began in the}} 1950s: £128,000 was set aside to rehouse the school in purpose-built facilities adjacent to the existing school-houses. The first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> opened in 1956 and included art and handicraft rooms; the second <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1958 when physics and chemistry rooms were added; and the third came in 1965 {{with the opening of}} new biology and general science laboratories alongside other classrooms, while the following year saw a new hall/canteen and kitchen open. The final phase consisted of eight further rooms, built shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Opened in 1967, Wayzata Bay Center was {{constructed}} in two phases; the first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1964 while the second <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1967. The mall initially featured several regional retailers, along with small businesses, but eventually made way for various national chains, including The Original Pancake House and True Value. After increasing vacancies throughout the center in the 2000s, a Minnesota construction firm purchased the center from United Properties for $16 million in 2009. Following the firm's purchase in 2011, the mall was shut and torn down {{to make way for}} a mixed-use retail and residential community center.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{building}} <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> the sixth, which saw {{the restoration of}} the eastern and western external walls after they were severely damaged by Mongol besiegers. A northeastern salient bastion, much smaller than the eastern and western bastions, was also built. Masonry from the fifth <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> reused for the reconstruction along with new gypsum, limestone and other materials. The seventh and eighth phases both consisted of heightening al-Rahba's western external walls.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been several {{developments}} along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} phase of the attack by {{infantry}} in the 75th Division (XXI Corps) were to capture the line Tel el Turmus–Qastina–Yazur and then seize Mesmiye. On their left infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were to secure the line Yazur–Beshshit and then seize Qatra. After a pause for the artillery to be brought forward, the second phase attacks on the final objectives of Junction Station for the 75th and al-Mansura for the 52nd (Lowland) Divisions were to be made. The first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> due to start at 08:00 hours on 13 November preceded by one hour's bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near the front wall. Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E
5|$|However, {{soon after}} the six episodes {{comprising}} the third series had been recorded by Above the Title Productions, a minor legal dispute over the online availability of episodes arose between the production company and The Walt Disney Company, which had started production on the Hitchhiker's movie, also in 2003. This led to a delay in transmitting the third series and an immediate cessation {{in the production of}} series four and five. Eventually a deal was worked out, and the Tertiary <b>Phase</b> <b>was</b> first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 21 September 2004.|$|E

5|$|Plans for a route between La Jolla and Santee {{date from}} 1959, and SR52 was officially {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Construction began in 1966 at the I-5 interchange with Ardath Road leading to La Jolla. It continued {{with the building}} of San Clemente Canyon Road, which was later widened to become SR52. The freeway was completed east to I-805 in 1970, and was built in two stages from there to Santo Road east of I-15; the last <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Post-production <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> {{scheduled}} to be wrapped up in 50 days. On 19 May 2014, a puja commemorated {{the beginning of the}} film's dubbing at Hyderabad. The supporting cast of the film completed dubbing for their parts in late August 2014, and Mahesh began dubbing for his role after returning from Europe. The dubbing was completed on 10 September 2014. Aagadu was passed with an 'U/A' certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification in mid September 2014. All the remaining post-production activities, including the final mixing, were wrapped up by 16 September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{engineering}} {{and a final}} tunnel design was completed by {{a joint venture between}} AECOM and Arup. The first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> originally supposed to include a core tunneling section between 62nd and 92nd Streets, as well as a spur from Third Avenue/63rd Street to Second Avenue/65th Street. The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, would allow the first phase's trackage to run from 62nd to 105th Streets. Before construction started, the MTA revised their plans so that the construction of the section between 62nd and 65th Streets was postponed.|$|E

Typical stationary phases for normal-phase chromatography are silica or organic moieties with cyano and amino functional groups. For reversed <b>phase,</b> alkyl hydrocarbons <b>are</b> the preferred stationary phase; octadecyl (C18) {{is the most common}} stationary phase, but octyl (C8) and butyl (C4) are also used in some applications. The designations for the reversed phase materials refer to the length of the hydrocarbon chain.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{proclamation}} as Maharaja, Abu Bakar laid {{plans for the}} construction of a wooden railway between Johor Bahru and Gunung Pulai after some Europeans had raised proposals to set up a retreat and sanatorium. Construction of the railway started in July 1869 and construction of the first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1874, which ran between Skudai and Johor Bahru. The construction project was later halted after an accident which saw a locomotive falling off the tracks as a result of termite attacks on the wooden tracks within the Skudai portion and a shortage of funds.|$|E
5|$|Stela 63 was {{dedicated}} by K'inich Popol Hol. Its sculpture consists purely of finely carved hieroglyphic texts {{and it is}} possible that it was originally commissioned by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' with additional texts added to the sides of the monument by his son. The text contains the same date in AD435 that appears on the Motmot Capstone. Stela63 was deliberately broken, together with its hieroglyphic step, during the ritual demolishing of the Papagayo phase of Temple 26. The remains of the monuments were then interred in the building before the next <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> built.|$|E
5|$|The {{scope of}} the Christianization mission in its early <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> quite limited geographically, and the few relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land. Stone churches and baptisteries were {{discovered}} within the Ostrów Lednicki and Poznań gords, and a chapel in Gniezno.
