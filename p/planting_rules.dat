40|$|AbstractThe high intra-seasonal {{rainfall}} variability and {{the lack}} of adaptive capacities are the major limiting factors for rainfed agricultural production in smallholder farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the crop planting date, a low-cost agricultural management strategy aiming to alleviate crop water stress can contribute to enhance agricultural decision-making, particularly as a climate change adaptation strategy. By considering the crop water requirements throughout the crop growing cycle using a process-based crop model in conjunction with a fuzzy rule-based planting date approach, location-specific <b>planting</b> <b>rules</b> were derived for maize cropping in Burkina Faso (BF). Then, they were applied to regional future climate projections to derive optimized planting dates (OPDs) for the 2020 s (2011 – 2030) and the 2040 s (2031 – 2050), respectively. Based on potential maize yield simulations driven by climate change projections and planting dates, the OPD approach was compared with a well-established planting date method for West Africa and evaluated as a potential adaptation strategy for climate change. On average, the OPD approach achieved approximately + 15 % higher potential maize yield regardless of the regional climate model (RCM) and the period. However, the potential yield surpluses strongly decreased from the North to the South. Regarding climate change adaptation, the combined impact of climate change and the OPD approach has shown on average, a mean maize yield deviation between − 23 % and 34 % in comparison to the 1989 – 2008 baseline period. Yield deviation is found to depend strongly on the RCM and location. The RCM ensemble mean yield for the period 2011 – 2050 revealed a maximum decrease of 8 % compared to the baseline period. On the one hand, these findings highlight the potential of the OPDs as a crop management strategy but, on the other hand, it is apparent that farmers need to combine the OPDs with others suited farming practices to adequately respond to climate change...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to use a}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) architectural plant modelling approach to simulate possible ways to improve the aboveground competitive ability of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) with sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.). It is now widely accepted that the best approach to manage weeds in field crops is through {{the development and implementation of}} integrated weed management (IWM) approaches. Such approaches should make use of the competitive ability of the crop canopy and the application of other cultural practices that ultimately reduce the dependence on herbicide use. To help understand the complexity of the different IWM choices available, computational models can be used by the agronomist, plant breeder or agricultural practitioner to simulate and visualise these different cultural practices in weedy situations to evaluate the possible ways to enhance crop competitiveness to the common weeds of that crop. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and value of such an approach, research experiments and modelling techniques have been used to develop architectural models for chickpea and sowthistle. These models were then used to simulate how changes in crop canopy architecture could modify chickpeas competitive ability with sowthistle. In order to determine the potential of using canopy manipulations of the crop to improve its competitive ability with sowthistle, an experiment was conducted in which sowthistle plants were grown under two densities of chickpea and in full sun light (as a control). While the phyllochron and bolting time of sowthistle increased when the light availability decreased, the number of branches, number of capitula and consequently seeds in sowthistle were significantly decreased under reduced light availability. To capture the 3 D architecture of the chickpea and sowthistle, plants were grown separately in a sandy, well watered and fertilized soil. A sonic digitizer system was then used to record a number of chenges in plant morphological, topological, and geometrical changes in a non-destructive way over time. The resulting data sets were analysed and used to develop a realistic, dynamic architectural model for each of the two species. Plant architectural (virtual) models were created using the mathematical formalism of Lindenmayer Systems. The virtual plant models were verified for growth and development, using an independently produced data set. A quasi-Monte Carlo ray tracing program was employed to estimate the light availability under different architectures of the virtual chickpea plants in a chickpea-light environment model. Since the aim was to simulate the effect of the chickpea canopy manipulation on sowthistle morphogenesis, observation of the effect of light availability on sowthistle were used to calibrate the morphogenesis of virtual sowthistle and then this lightsensitive virtual sowthistle was incorporated into the chickpea-light environment model. The key point is that the entire development period and changing light environment is considered. In the final chickpea-light environment-sowthistle (CLES) model the virtual chickpea plants were modified to replicate the architecture of five different cultivars (Macarena, Bumper, Jimbour, 99071 - 1001, and 96033 - 1014). The models were run over time and both visualizations and numerical output were produced to examine their competitive ability with sowthistle. To validate the results of the CLES model, an experiment using the same five chickpea cultivars with a sowthistle growing under their canopy was conducted. The simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the empirical data. The growth of sowthistle, in both in silico and empirical experiments was reduced most by 99071 - 1001 a cultivar with short phyllochron and early branching feature. The second rank of competitive ability in both simulated and observed data belonged to Macarena and Bumper while Jimbour and 96033 - 1014 were the least competitive. Both the simulation and experiment results supported the hypothesis that morphogenesis of a weed can be suppressed under specific canopy architectures of crops. Some practical applications of the developed model are discussed and it is shown that the developed model can be used to explore a number of different agronomic practices such as choice of cultivar and seeding rate in weed management systems. The practical implication of these simulation studies is how a management system that uses quick canopy closure can provide sufficient suppression of weeds in chickpea. The study also demonstrates the versatility of the 3 D plant architectural modelling approach especially when combined with a light environment model to predict how the plant breeder might genetically improve the crop canopy architecture and how the agronomist might modify <b>planting</b> <b>rules,</b> to improve the competitive ability of crops with weeds...|$|E
