5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or <b>physical</b> <b>feature),</b> a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} a world that is {{localized}} to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.|$|E

25|$|The Beast {{is not of}} any {{one species}} of animal, but a chimera (a mixture of several animals), who would {{probably}} be classified as a carnivore overall. He has the head structure and horns of a buffalo, the arms and body of a bear, the eyebrows of a gorilla, the jaws, teeth, and mane of a lion, the tusks of a wild boar and the legs and tail of a wolf. He also bears resemblance to mythical monsters like the Minotaur or a werewolf. He also has blue eyes, the one <b>physical</b> <b>feature</b> that does not change whether he is a beast or a human.|$|E

25|$|A Sizang, {{he was a}} very strong, {{tall and}} {{masculine}} individual who possessed an unusual body structure, measuring “9 tuuk” at his chest (54inches diameter and 108inches of the chest circumference). Yet, because of his ability to move quickly, apparent body lightness despite its massiveness, and his athletic skills, the constant admiration was overwhelming. The description of his <b>physical</b> <b>feature</b> seems similar to the figure of Goliath in the Bible, 1 Samuel 17:4-7, Goliath was more than six cubits- about three meters tall, according to the Bible. Pu Tong Seal's dwelling place was Khuasak, Zogam (Chin State), northern Burma. His father-in-law at that time lived in Theizang but owned a plot at Khuakhuan, 'Khuasak'.|$|E
500|$|The {{common name}} [...] "springbok" [...] {{comes from the}} Afrikaans words spring ("jump") and bok ("antelope" [...] or [...] "goat"); the first {{recorded}} use of the name dates to 1775. The scientific name of the springbok is Antidorcas marsupialis; anti is Greek for [...] "opposite", and dorcas for [...] "gazelle" [...] – identifying that the animal is not a gazelle. The specific epithet marsupialis comes from the Latin marsupium ("pocket"); it refers to a pocket-like skin flap which extends along the midline of the back from the tail. In fact, this <b>physical</b> <b>feature</b> distinguishes the springbok from true gazelles.|$|E
500|$|Morrell's journal {{indicates}} that Wasp reached South Georgia on November 20, and then sailed eastwards towards the isolated Bouvet Island, which lies approximately midway between Southern Africa and the Antarctic continent {{and is known}} as the world's remotest island. It had been discovered in 1739 by the French navigator Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, but his plotting of its position was inaccurate; Captain James Cook, in 1772, had been unable to find it and had assumed its nonexistence. It had not been seen again until 1808, when the British sealing captains James Lindsay and Thomas Hopper reached it and recorded its correct position, though they were unable to land. Morrell, by his own account, found the island without difficulty—with [...] "improbable ease", in the words of historian William Mills— before landing and hunting seals there. In his subsequent lengthy description, Morrell does not mention the island's most obvious <b>physical</b> <b>feature,</b> its permanent ice cover. This has caused some commentators to doubt whether he actually visited the island.|$|E

500|$|Marjorie Jacqueline [...] "Marge" [...] Simpson (née Bouvier), {{voiced by}} Julie Kavner, is the well-meaning and {{extremely}} patient wife of Homer {{and mother of}} Bart, Lisa and Maggie. She often acts {{as the voice of}} reason, but displays exaggerated behavior traits of stereotypical mothers and takes the blatant dysfunctionality of her family for granted, unlike the other family members, who are aware that they are eccentric. Her most notable <b>physical</b> <b>feature</b> is her blue hair, styled into an improbably high beehive. Julie Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Marge in the episode [...] "I Married Marge". For her performance in The Simpsons Movie, Kavner received a nomination for [...] "Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature" [...] at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm in Ratatouille. Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she [...] "gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever". Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video because she does not want to [...] "destroy the illusion for children". In 2008, CityNews published an article entitled [...] "Top 10 Greatest TV Moms of All Time", and placed Marge in eighth spot.|$|E

2500|$|The county's {{prominent}} <b>physical</b> <b>feature</b> is the Gallatin River, {{named by}} Meriwether Lewis in 1805 for Albert Gallatin, U.S. Treasury Secretary from 1801-14. A {{small part of}} Yellowstone National Park lies in the county's southeastern portion. The Big Sky Resort is about midway between West Yellowstone and Bozeman, though the ski area lies mostly in neighboring Madison County, Montana. [...] The Gallatin River canyon is accessed by U.S. Highway 191.|$|E
40|$|The neuropeptide {{oxytocin}} {{has been}} implicated in prosocial behavior and social cognition. However, little is known {{on the influence of}} oxytocin on the perception of infant positive and negative characteristics. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, 40 females (Mage = 20. 11) were asked to rate characteristics of infants with high, medium and low infantile <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> before and after receiving nasal spray containing either 16 IU of oxytocin or placebo. We found an increase of adults` perception of infant positive characteristics over time. In both conditions females perceived infants with less infantile <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> as displaying significantly more positive characteristics at posttreatment compared to pretreatment. We also found that participants perceived positive characteristics of infants in the high infantile <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> category as even more positive at posttreatment compared to pretreatment, but depending on treatment. Participants who received placebo perceived infants with more infantile <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> as more positive at posttreatment than at pretreatment, but oxytocin prevented increase on positive perception. Females who received oxytocin perceived infants with high infantile <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> almost equally positive both at pretreatment and at posttreatment. We conclude that when young adults are already highly prosocial to infants with infantile <b>physical</b> <b>features,</b> oxytocin may prevent an even more positive perception of infants. Our findings indicate that the effects of oxytocin are nuanced, and its effects contingent on personal and contextual factors...|$|R

The next {{expedition to}} arrive at the island was American Benjamin Morrell and his seal hunting ship Wasp.

This place lay in a vale of its own, further inland than the west village, and though so near it, had little of <b>physical</b> <b>feature</b> in common with the latter. East Endelstow was more wooded and fertile: it boasted of Lord Luxellian's mansion and park, and was free from those bleak open uplands which lent such an air of desolation to the vicinage of the coast--always excepting the small valley in which stood the vicarage and Mrs. Swancourt's old house, The Crags.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, {{research}} has shown that <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> of a stimulus guide attentional selection. [...] It has been found consistently that observers correctly separate relevant from irrelevant stimuli due to physical rather than semantic features, indicating selection channels are heavily influenced by <b>physical</b> <b>features.</b> This then further supports Broadbent's research. According to the modality effect, echoic memory has an advantage over iconic memory. Research has shown that the speech is more apt to objective interpretation than inputs to the visual system. This indicates that auditory information is first processed for its <b>physical</b> <b>features,</b> and then combined with visual information features.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 49). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Methods in developing computer-generated characters which aid storytelling, using non-verbal, interactive movements combined with distinctive <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> are examined. An assessment of the overall enjoyment of computer-generated animations specifically correlated with non-verbal movements and also with distinctive <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> is made. It is hypothesized that controlled uses of non-verbal movements and <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> are directly related to the audience's ratings of the following four categories: clearly identifying the plot, identifying with character A and with character B, and the overall enjoyment. Also, it is hypothesized that the use of developed <b>physical</b> <b>features</b> improves the audience's ability to identify the emotions of {{the character}}s. The results showed that increasing the variables improves the ratings in the four categories. But no noticeable differences in the ratings were found in communicating the characters' emotions when using more developed <b>physical</b> <b>features...</b>|$|R
