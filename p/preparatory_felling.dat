Postotni udjeli tehničke oblovine određeni ovim istraživanjem uspoređeni su s planskim vrijednostima (sortimentnim tablicama) koje se primjenjuju u šumarskoj operativi. Na temelju rezultata istraživanja izrađene su nove sortimentne tablice prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma od 1995. godine. Istraživanja su provedena na uzorku koji obuhvaća 787 stabala u proredama, 1025 stabala u pripremnim, 606 stabala u naplodnim i 583 stabala u dovršnim sjekovima. Sveukupno je istraživanjima obuhvaćeno 3001 primjerno stablo. Starost istraživanih sječina iznosila je od 59 do 91 godinu kod prethodnog prihoda (proreda), od 94 do 110 godina kod pripremnog sijeka, od 100 do 112 godina kod naplodnog sijeka te od 98 do 112 godina kod dovršnog sijeka. Dosadašnji je pristup određivanju sortimentne strukture jednodobnih bukovih sastojina u velikoj mjeri pogrešan. Operativne sortimentne tablice daju previsoke procjene za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente svih vrsta sjekova osim zadnjih sjekova oplodnih bukovih sječina. Tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata koje uvažavaju vrstu sijeka kao jedan od ulaza, omogućuju pouzdaniju procjenu sortimentne strukture sječine i preciznije planiranje sječivog etata. Pri tome su kao čimbenici razdvajanja uzeti kriteriji selekcije prilikom doznake stabala za sječu koji se primjenjuju do uključivo pripremnog sijeka. Iz tih su razloga tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata izrađene zasebno za prorede i pripremni sijek, a zasebno za naplodni i dovršni sijek. The {{subject of}} {{research}} was probability of appearance of technical roundwood timber assortments in trees according to type of felling, {{as well as}} the difference between shares of technical roundwood timber assortments according to diameter class and type of felling. The percentages of technical roundwood established in this research were compared to the planned values (assortment tables) which are applied in forestry operational bodies. Research was carried out on a sample consisting of 787 trees in thinning felling, 1025 trees in <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> 606 trees in seeding felling and 583 trees in final felling. An overall number of 3001 exemplary trees were included in the research. The age of the felling areas studied was between 59 and 91 years in the preliminary yield (thinning), 94 to 110 years in <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> 100 to 112 years in seeding felling, and 98 to 112 years in final felling areas. We think that the approach to establishing the assortment structure of even-aged beech stands taken so far is to a large extent wrong. The operative assortment tables give too high estimates of top quality timber assortments of all types of felling, except the final felling of seeding beech felling areas. Timber assortment tables that take into consideration the type of felling as one of the inputs, enable a more reliable estimate of assortment structure of the felling area and more precise planning of timber mass marked for felling. In this case, as a distinguishing factor, we took the selection criterion for marking trees for felling which is applied for the types up to, and including, the <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling.</b> For that reason, timber assortment tables were made separately for thinning and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> and separately for seeding and final felling. On the basis of the research results, new assortment tables were made according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995. Seeding and final felling show by ca 8 – 14 % higher shares of top quality timber assortment (F and L) than thinning and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling.</b> On the other side, thinning and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling</b> show by ca 4 – 15 % higher shares of technical roundwood assortment of lower quality (second-class and third-class) than seeding and final felling...|$|E

Čistoća debla definirana je kao dužina debla od perca do prve žive ili urasle grane, te ostalih grešaka koje nisu površinske naravi, a veće su od 15 % prsnog promjera. Visina debla definirana je kao dužina debla od perca do mjesta gdje se gubi jednostruka uzdužna os stabla, ili kao dužina debla od perca do prve deblje žive grane koja suvislo tvori krošnju. Prikrajanje i razvrstavanje (klasiranje) drvnih sortimenata tehničke oblovine izvršili smo prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma od 1995. godine (HRN) i hrvatskim normama HRN-EN 1316 - 1 : 1997. Na čistoću debla, pojavnost grešaka ima važan utjecaj. Pojavnost grešaka slučajnog je karaktera i nije u korelaciji ni sa jednim mjerljivim parametrom stabla. Iz tog razloga nismo uspjeli utvrditi čvršću vezu između čistoće debla i prsnog promjera stabla. Srednje vrijednosti visine debla po debljinskim stupnjevima rastu od proreda prema dovršnim sjekovima. Raspored srednjih visina debla po debljinskim stupnjevima i vrsti sijeka nije posljedica slučajnosti. Visina debla stabala u sastojini uvjetovana je nizom čimbenika. Raspored srednjih visina debla u sječinama određene vrste sijeka u velikoj je mjeri posljedica naših odluka kojima se rukovodimo prilikom odabira stabala za sječu pojedine vrsti sijeka. Postotni je udio tehničke oblovine u neto obujmu stabla kod primjene HRN-EN veći za stabla svih debljinskih stupnjeva. Utvrđena je razlika između udjela tehnike u deblu stabla kod proreda i pripremnog sijeka s jedne strane te naplodnih i dovršnih sjekova s druge strane. Udio tehničke oblovine debla raste od proreda prema pripremnim sjekovima. Srednje vrijednosti tehničke oblovine debla za cijeli uzorak primjernih stabala pokazuju linearnu ovisnost o debljinskim stupnjevima i padajući trend, koji je posljedica povećanja obujma tehničke oblovine izrađene iz krošnji s porastom prsnoga promjera stabala. Veće vrijednosti postotnih udjela tehničke oblovine u deblima stabala kod primjene HRN mogu se protumačiti većom količinom izrađene tehničke oblovine iz krošnji stabala pri primjeni HRN-EN. The {{subject of}} {{research}} were purity and height of beech trees, {{as well as}} the participation of technical roundwood in trunks and tree tops in relation to breast diameter and the type of felling. Research was carried out in the economic unit „Bjelovarska Bilogora“ of Forest Office Bjelovar, Forest Administration Bjelovar. Data gathering, i. e. measurement of exemplary beech trees was carried out in 36 areas on 46 occasions (fellings). All the areas belong to ecological-economical type II-D- 11 and structural class BEECH, with the rotation of 100 years, which participates {{in the area of the}} economic unit with 76. 1 %, and with 80. 6 % in its timber stock. Measurements of exemplary trees were made in relation to diameter class and the type of felling. Trunk purity was measured on 693 exemplary trees, of which 237 mere measured in the felling areas of <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> 139 in the areas of thinning felling, while 317 were measured in the areas of final felling. Trunk height was measured on samples including 787 trees in the areas of thinning felling, 788 trees in the areas of <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> 467 trees in the areas of seeding felling and 266 trees in the areas of final felling – a total of 2, 308 trees. Altogether, the research included 3, 001 exemplary trees. Trunk purity is defined as the length of trunk from the butt-end to the first live or ingrown branch, and other flaws which are not superficial, and take up more than 15 % of the breast diameter. Trunk height is defined as the length of trunk from the butt-end to the place where the single longitudinal axis of the tree disappears, or as the length of trunk from the butt-end to the first thicker live branch which coherently forms the top of the tree. Bucking and sorting (classification) of timber assortment of technical roundwood was carried out according to two standards: Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995 (HRN), and European Standards EN 1316 - 1 : 1997 (HRN-EN). Occurrence of flaws has crucial influence on trunk purity. Occurrence of faults is random in character and isn’t in correlation with any measurable tree parameter. For that reason we couldn’t establish a closer connection between trunk purity and breast diameter of tree. Average values of trunk height according to diameter class increase from thinning felling towards final felling. Thinning felling has an extremely falling (almost linear) trend of trunk height average with the increase of diameter class. The average values of trunk height of final felling show the highest values of all the diameter classes. Such distribution of average trunk height according to diameter class and the type of felling is not accidental. Trunk height of trees in the stand depends on a range of factors, from hereditary (genetic) predisposition of trees, over conditions of growth, to the position of trees in the stand. The distribution of average trunk heights in the felling areas of a certain type of felling is to a great extend a consequence of the decisions that we make during the selection of trees for felling in a particular type of felling. Because of their poor technical, (but not evolutionary) quality, forked trees are the first choice for assignation in thinning felling and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling.</b> According to the European Standards, the participation of technical roundwood in the net tree volume is greater for trees of all diameter classes. The difference decreases with the increase of breast diameter of tree, and it ranges from over 20 % for the thinnest diameter classes to almost 5 % in the thickest diameter classes. Upon implementation of the two standards (HRN and HRN-EN), a difference was established between the participation of technical roundwood in the tree trunk in thinning and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling</b> on one side, and seeding and final felling on the other side. Trend lines of average values of technical roundwood in the tree trunk of the thinning and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling</b> have a falling and convex form, while the trend line form of the seeding and final felling is concave. Furthermore, we can conclude that the participation of technical roundwood of trunk increases from thinning felling towards <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling.</b> Average values of participation of technical roundwood of trunk of the whole sample of exemplary trees show a linear dependence on diameter class and the falling trend which is a consequence of the increased quantity of technical roundwood produced from the tree tops with the increase of the breast diameter. Higher participation of technical roundwood in tree trunks according to the Croatian Standards can be interpreted by larger amount of technical roundwood produced from tree tops according to the European Standards. This is the result of smaller minimal dimensions and higher tolerance of flaws for D quality class of technical roundwood according to the European Standards...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of morphological analysis of the Croatian skidder ECOTRAC 120 V, as well as the research of its productivity features in timber skidding from hilly terrain after <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling</b> and from mountainous terrain after selective felling. Morphological analysis was used for determining the dependence of morphological features of the skidder ECOTRAC 120 V, as well as for establishing its belonging to the skidder’s family. The characteristics of the researched skidder are small width relative to length, due to the requirements of its manoeuvrability in timber skidding on skid roads of up to 2. 5 m in width, and higher engine power relative to skidder mass. Such considerations give justification for morphological analyses, because they provide the possibility of observing development trends of machines, as well as ways of finding the right design solutions for meeting the requirements for their use. The comparison of two working sites in the research of productivity of skidders clearly shows that productivity primarily depends on harvesting density (working time at the felling site) and skidding speed, and that in this case a considerable difference {{in the size of the}} load is not a key factor of productivity in timber skidding...|$|E

Morris taking over from Roosevelt. The Australian 42nd Infantry Battalion was landed at Nassau and Tambu Bays in early August and subsequently used secure positions around Davidson Ridge and Scout Ridge as part of efforts to secure Mount Tambu. Since their earlier failed attacks, the US troops around Roosevelt Ridge had been patrolling the area and observing the Japanese forces, aided by the PIB. By 12 August, orders were passed for a renewed effort. The 2nd Battalion, under Major Arthur Lowe, was tasked with the main assault from its position on the southern slope of the ridge, while Morris' 3rd Battalion assaulted on their left, on the eastern part of Scout Ridge. The main assault commenced early on 13 August, but it was preceded by a patrol from the 2nd Battalion establishing an outpost about [...] from Boisi. This position was attacked by the Japanese throughout the night, but the US troops managed to hold their position. Heavy <b>preparatory</b> fires <b>fell</b> on Japanese position to the front and flanks, before the attack began with two companies pushing forward. In the ensuing fighting the Japanese lost 39 men killed, while the US forces had 25 killed or wounded, as they penetrated the Japanese [...] perimeter in three locations. Overnight, the Japanese attempted to reinforce the position with 200 men from the 238th Infantry Regiment, but the following morning the two US companies were able to effect a link up at the western end of the ridge. The remainder of the position was then subjected to heavy fire from Bofors guns that had been dragged onto a knoll opposite the ridge, and were fired horizontally into the Japanese position, devastating the Japanese defenders and tearing up the jungle.|$|R

Doznačena primjerna stabla razvrstana su prema najizraženijim vanjskim značajkama u devet grupa (kategorija). Istraživanje je provedeno na ukupno 36 objekata gospodarske jedinice Bjelovarska Bilogora. U objektima oplodnih sječa podaci su prikupljani u više navrata (sjekova). Na taj je način razvrstano 2. 308 doznačenih stabla u ukupno 46 navrata (sjekova). Svi objekti pripadaju ekološko-gospodarskom tipu II-D- 11 i uređajnom razredu BUKVA s ophodnjom od 100 godina. Postotna zastupljenost stabala s pozitivnim utjecajem na sorimentnu strukturu, ovisno o vrsti sijeka, kreće se oko 50 % kod proreda i pripremnog sijeka te oko 60 % kod naplodnog i dovršnog sijeka. Na ukupnost strukture drvnih sortimenata pojedine vrste sijeka najveći utjecaj imaju srednje debela i debela stabla, odnosno stabla iz debljinskih razreda većih od 41 cm prsnog promjera. Razlog tomu je činjenica da samo ta stabla potencijalno mogu sadržavati najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente (prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma iz 1995) zbog minimalnih dimenzija propisanih za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente. Postotna zastupljenost i razlika postotnog udjela broja stabala prsnog promjera većeg od 41 cm s pozitivnim utjecajem na sortimentnu strukturu raste od proreda prema dovršnom sijeku. Postotak zastupljenosti od strane čovjeka oštećenih stabala raste od proreda prema dovršnim sjekovima što se može povezati s intenziviranjem radova iskorištavanja šuma u vrijeme oplodnih sječa. Nužno je razlučiti sortimentnu strukturu sastojine od sortimentne strukture sječine (određene vrste sijeka). Porast postotnih udjela kvalitetnih drvnih sortimenata po debljinskim stupnjevima od proreda prema dovršnim sjekovima, pravilnost je uvjetovana našim odlukama, odnosno stručnim provođenjem uzgojnih zahvata doznake stabala za sječu. Ta je pravilnost stalna u onoj mjeri u kojoj su takvi načini gospodarenja i način nihovog provođenja. The {{subject of}} {{research}} were absolute and percentage share of assigned trees according to diameter class {{and type of}} felling and their influence on assortment structure of particular types of felling. The assigned exemplary trees were categorized {{according to the most}} prominent outward features into nine categories. The research was carried out on the total number of 36 areas of the economic unit Bjelovarska Bilogora. In the seeding felling areas data were collected on several occasions (felling). In that way, 2, 308 assigned trees were categorized in the total of 46 occasions (felling). All the areas belong to ecological-economical type II-D- 11 and structural class BEECH with the rotation of 100 years. The aim of the process was gaining more insight into the factors that influence assortment structure of stands, as well as completing the information on principles and ways of forest management in the past and nowadays. Analysis of the number of trees of particular categories according to the type of felling (stand age) and diameter class was carried out with the aim of finding the answers to questions pertaining to the criteria of assignment of one type of felling, as well as the degree of damage to stands during the exploiting of forest in the area subject to research. The assigned trees of group A (undamaged trees of normal growth) have, on the whole, extremely positive influence on assortment structure of particular type of felling. To these we can, to a certain extent, join pregrowth trees, i. e. group G, whose influence is limited mostly to thinning felling. Trees of all the other described groups have more or less negative effect on assortment structure of particular type of felling. The influence of suppressed trees (group H) on assortment structure is insignificant, and their importance for successful carrying out of seeding felling is considerable. The percentage of trees with positive influence on assortment structure according to the type of felling, stands about 50 % in thinning and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> while in seeding and final felling it is about 60 %. Trees of medium diameter and large diameter, i. e. trees of diameter class between 41 cm and 60 cm, and those with breast diameter over 61 cm, have the greatest influence on the whole of tree assortment structure or particular types of felling. The reason for that is the fact that only those trees can potentially contain timber assortment of the highest quality (according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995) because of the minimal dimensions prescribed for timber assortments of the highest quality. Percentage of those trees with positive and negative influence on assortment structure is almost identical in case of thinning and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> while in case of seeding and final felling the share of trees with positive effect is considerably higher than the percentage of trees with negative effect on assortment structure. It can be said that the percentage of trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with the positive effect on assortment structure grows from 5. 7 % in thinning felling to 57. 5 % in final felling. If we focus on the relation (difference) between the trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with positive and negative effect on assortment structure, we can easily say that this value ranges from – 2. 9 % in thinning felling to 22. 9 % in final felling. Trees damaged {{as a result of our}} activities, or human influence, are contained within groups with description marks of C, D, E and I. The percentage of trees damaged by human activity increases from thinning felling to final felling. For thinning felling, this percentage amounts to 11. 2 %, for <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling</b> it is 13. 1 %, for seeding felling it is 15. 8 %, while for final felling it amounts to 23. 3 % of damaged trees. The increase in participation of trees damaged in that way towards the end of rotation can be attributed to intensifying of exploitation of forests at the time of seeding felling. However, as much as 23. 3 % of damaged trees out of the assigned trees of final felling, i. e. almost one quarter of more or less damaged trees left for final felling, is the information which calls for some concern. The quality of assortment structure of stand varies within a large scope and depends on different kinds of influence, from timely and high-quality cultivation activities, over influence of habitats, to the extreme abiotic influences of accidental character. Assortment structure of beech stands is the focus of our interest only in the sense of increasing the overall quality of beech trees, i. e. achieving the largest possible percentage of high-quality beech trees in the stand. The percentage of timber assortments in beech stands of particular age (except for final felling and clear felling) is not our primary interest. The primary interest of forestry operational bodies (as well as science) is the quality and quantity of timber assortments that can be achieved through carrying out of particular type of felling, i. e. assortment structure of felling area. The share of timber assortments of particular type of felling is to a great extent a result of our decisions during the selection of trees for felling, by which we pursue the aim and the guidelines of stand management. The principles (rules) we apply while assigning trees for particular type of felling lead us to “save” the high-quality trees for the end of the rotation (seeding felling, final felling). Having that in mind, it is to be expected that the percentage of the timber assortments of the highest quality (within the same diameter class) will increase from thinning felling towards final felling. For that reason it is necessary to distinguish between the assortment structure of stand and the assortment structure of felling area (specific types of felling). The assortment structure of stand varies within a wide and unknown scope, and its quality is the result of the success of our management in the past. Only in that sense does the assortment structure of stand influence the assortment structure of felling area. The increase in percentage shares of high-quality timber assortments according to diameter classes from thinning felling to final felling is a pattern determined by our decisions, i. e. expert conduct of cultivation activities of assigning trees for felling. This pattern is constant in the same measure as the principles of management and the manner of their implementation are constant...|$|E

This paper {{deals with}} {{research}} and comparison of technical roundwood structure in assortment tables compiled {{in accordance with}} the requirements of the Croatian standards for forest harvesting products of 1995 and the Croatian Standard Hardwood round wood - Qualitative classification - Part 1 : Oak and Beech HRN EN 1316 - 1 : 1999. The research was carried out in the Management Unit "Bjelovarska Bilogora", Forest Office Bjelovar, Forest Administration Bjelovar. All investigated compartments pertain to ecological management type II-D- 11 and management class BEECH with a 100 -year rotation. The age of the investigated cutblocks ranged between 59 and 91 with thinning, between 94 and 110 with preparatory cut, between 100 and 112 with seed cut and between 98 and 114 with final cut. The group of sample trees was formed by random selection of approximately 10 % of marked trees. The sample for compiling assortment tables {{in accordance with the}} requirements of the Croatian standards for forest harvesting products of 1995 involved 3001 sample trees (table 1), and assortment tables were compiled in accordance with the requirements of the Croatian standard HRN EN 1316 - 1 : 1999 based on 3082 sample trees (table 2). Share tables of wood assortments determined in accordance with these two standards were developed, for various reasons, separately for thinnings and <b>preparatory</b> <b>felling,</b> and separately for seeding and final felling. By processing sample trees in accordance with the requirements of the Croatian Standards for Forest Harvesting Products of 1995, 10, 098 pieces of technical roundwood were obtained, whose total volume was 4, 337 m 3 (without bark). In accordance with the requirements of this Standard, total processed and classified net volume of all sample trees was 7, 469 m 3. By bucking sample trees in accordance with the requirements of the Croatian Standard Hardwood round wood - Qualitative classification - Part 1 : Oak and Beech HRN EN 1316 - 1 : 1999, 13, 507 pieces of technical roundwood were obtained, whose total volume was 6, 010 m 3 (without bark), and in accordance with the requirements of this Standard, the net volume of all sample trees was 8, 931 m 3. Due to substantial differences, structural comparison of technical roundwood classified in accordance with the requirements of these two standards is more simple and adequate for wood assortments of the best quality, veneer logs - A quality class (Fig. 1) and assortments of the lowest quality class, 3 rd class sawlogs - D quality class (Fig. 4). The comparison is much more difficult with other quality classes of technical roundwood, logs for rotary cutting - 1 st quality class sawlogs - B quality class (Fig. 2), 2 nd class sawlogs - C quality class (Fig. 3), due to even more significant differences between standard requirements with respect to dimensions, range of timber defects, and number of quality classes. Differences between the Croatian standards for forest harvesting products (1995), still applied in Croatian forestry and international standards Hardwood round wood - Qualitative classification - Part 1 : Oak and Beech EN 1316 - 1 : 1999 are numerous and significant. Differences are related to the number of quality class, prescribed minimum dimensions, range of roundwood defects along with way of measurement of technical roundwood and they reflect to different share of wood assortments (quality classes) determined in accordance with the requirements of individual standards. However, the key difference between these two standards {{lies in the fact that}} according to the "old" Croatian standards technical roundwood was classified by purpose, and according to the "new" Croatian standards technical roundwood is classified by quality, therefore avoiding to define its future purpose. Consequently, the comparison of percentage shares of wood assortments in the assortment tables is difficult, and defining unambiguous conclusions (except for assortments of technical roundwood of the highest and lowest quality) is questionable. Differences in contents between international standards and standards currently in use in Croatian forestry shall necessarily bring operational changes in bucking, scaling, classifying and marketing of forest products. Operational changes (partly conditioned by the acceptance of international laws and regulations) shall also be accompanied by certain changes in relationships within the forestry sector...|$|E
