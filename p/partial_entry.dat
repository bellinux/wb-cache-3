40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} partial refactorization for faster {{nonlinear}} analysis based on sparse matrix solution, which is nowadays the default solution choice in {{finite element analysis}} and can solve finite element models up to millions degrees of freedom. Among various fill-in’s reducing strategies for sparse matrix solution, the graph partition is in general the best in terms of resultant fill-ins and floating-point operations and furthermore produces a particular graph of sparse matrix that prevents local change of entries from wide spreading in factorization. Based on this feature, an explicit partial triangular refactorization with local change is efficiently constructed with limited additional storage requirement in row-sparse storage scheme. The partial refactorization of the changed stiffness matrix inherits a big percentage of the original factor and is carried out only on <b>partial</b> factor <b>entries.</b> The proposed method provides a new possibility for faster nonlinear analysis and is mainly suitable for material nonlinear problems and optimization problems.

40|$|In eukaryotes, each {{subcellular}} compartment harbors {{a specific}} group of proteins that must accomplish specific tasks. Nfs 1 {{is a highly}} conserved mitochondrial cysteine desulfurase that participates in iron-sulfur cluster assembly as a sulfur donor. Previous genetic studies, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have suggested that this protein distributes between the mitochondria and the nucleus with biochemically undetectable amounts in the nucleus (termed “eclipsed distribution”). Here, we provide direct evidence for Nfs 1 nuclear localization (in addition to mitochondria) using both α-complementation and subcellular fractionation.

This led to the discovery of a novel mitochondrial processing enzyme, Icp 55. This enzyme removes three amino acids from the N terminus of Nfs 1 after cleavage by mitochondrial processing peptidase.

40|$|This Article {{will examine}} whether efforts to {{implement}} the Resolution suggest new ways to address the old problems: the reliance on stereotyped gender representations to rally women {{in the cause of}} peace and the vexed strategic question of how movements for transformative change might influence the mainstream institutions of international law and politics. The first concerns the way that the category of gender is deployed by women 2 ̆ 7 s peace activism and by international institutions as they respond to it. The author’s question is whether it is possible to rally women to promote peace, while also challenging the gender dichotomies that underpin the notion of a distinct women 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to peace; whether there are 2 ̆ 2 disruptive 2 ̆ 2 gender identities that can form an emancipatory basis for solidarity between women and men in the cause of peace. The second problem is whether the pacifist and equality goals of women 2 ̆ 7 s peace movements can best be pursued from outside or within mainstream institutions, systems of location which carry their own gendered dichotomies. The long experience of women 2 ̆ 7 s peace activism suggests that the most that can be achieved is a position that is partially inside.

40|$|Thailand {{embarked}} on a course of deregulation and financial liberalization in the early 1990 s. Starting with the acceptance of Article 8 of the International Monetary Fund, Thailand phased in liberalization of capital flows, deregulation in the scope of operation of financial institutions, and <b>partial</b> <b>entry</b> of foreign competitors into the domestic financial system. Also many firms in the financial industry were encouraged to integrate their information systems. The linkage of competitive strategy, information technology (IT) maturity and size has received much attention in recent years. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the state of IT application in Thai financial institutions and to examine the impact of competitive strategy, information technology maturity, and size on strategic responses to the liberalization of financial markets. Mintzberg (1973) conceived of strategy as a pattern or a stream of important decisions. This study operationalized strategy through the use of Miles and Snow’s (1978) typology, which identifies four archetypes of strategic adaptation: defenders, analyzers, prospectors and reactors. This study examines the relationships between strategic changes in IT investment patterns and the factors of competitive strategy, IT maturity, and size. Financial executives from three groups of financial institutions: (1) Thai commercial banks (N = 13), (2) foreign banks (N = 14), and (3) finance and securities companies (N = 23), responded to the researcher constructed questionnaire. Statistical methods used in this study included independent-samples t-test. One-way ANOVA were conducted to determine the significance of the differences of the mean responses among Thai commercial banks, foreign banks, and finance and securities companies. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to identify the significant relationships among the relevant variables. The results revealed that different IT factors impact the relationships between the linkage of competitive strategy, information technology maturity and size with strategic response to financial liberalization differently. The analysis of strategy provides strong support for Miles and Snow 2 ̆ 7 s (1978) typology. Finally, the results show that a firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive strategy significantly affects change in its IT investment. The practical implication of this finding relates to issues of strategic response to financial liberalization in Thailand...|$|E
40|$|In the {{literature}} on migration, {{as well as in}} social policies regarding this phenomenon, the situation of returning emigrants receives scant attention. This essay establishes an intricate connection between attitudes and policies that prevail in a country regarding emigration and those concerning immigration. The case of Italy provides a prime example for this as it once was a classical country of emigration, only to turn, in recent decades, into a country that appears highly attractive (and relatively accessible) to immigrants. The essay traces the pervasive ambiguity that characterizes this country’s attitudes towards emigration from the beginning of mass emigration shortly after the unification of Italy in 1868 to the emigration policies of the fascist regime of Mussolini and the post-World War II waves of emigration right through to the corresponding ambiguity concerning the status of immigrants in contemporary society, including the indifferent treatment of returning Italian emigrants who constitute a considerable numerical phenomenon. These reflections take their origin from the impending closure of a reception centre in Lazio, the Casa dell’Emigrante near Sant’Elia Fiumerapido, Province of Frosinone, ostensibly for financial reasons. This centre had been the only one {{of its kind in the}} whole of Italy dealing officially with the needs of repatriated Italians. It had assisted returning emigrants both with practical matters, such as negotiating the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy, and with psychological implications of a return, which are often considerable given the time lag of experiences with current social realities and the frequently unrealistic expectations associated with the return. Questions of identity become highly acute in those circumstances. The threatened closure of the centre illustrates the unwillingness of the state to face up to the factual prevalence of migratory experiences in the country as a whole and as a core element of national history, experiences of migration in both directions. The statistics speak for themselves: of the 4. 660. 427 persons who left Italy between 1880 and 1950, 2. 322. 451 have returned, almost exactly 50 %. To those have to be added 3. 628. 430 returnees of the 5. 109. 860 emigrants who left Italy between the end of World War II and 1976 for Europe alone. Attitudes towards people leaving changed ostensibly over time. In the first two decades after Unification parliament on the one hand wanted to show some concern over the fate of its citizens, not wanting to abandon those newly created citizens entirely to their own destiny, while on the other portraying their decisions to emigrate as expressions of individual liberty and responsibility and not necessitated by want and poverty. Emigrants had to prove, paradoxically that they had the requisite means to emigrate when in fact poverty was largely driving them to emigrate. To admit that publicly would have amounted to admission of economic and political failure made evident through emigration. In contrast to that Mussolini’s emigration policies not only enforced large population movements within the territory of Italy to balance unemployment between regions and particularly between North and South, but also declared it citizen’s duty to be ready to move also to the colonies, thereby ‘turning emigration as a sign of social crisis into a sign of national strength and the success of the country’s political agenda’ (Gaspari 2001, p. 34). The duplicity continued even after World War II when secret deals were done with the USA to allow a continuous flow of Italian immigrants and EU membership obviously further facilitated the departure of unemployed, impoverished Italians. With the growing prosperity of Italy the reversal of the direction of migration became more obvious. On the basis of empirical research conducted by one of the author on returning emigrants four types of motives for returning can be distinguished: 1. Return as a result of failure – particularly the emigrants who left during the 1950 - 1970 period usually had no linguistic preparation, and in any case the gap between the spoken and the written language is enormous with the latter often being insurmountable. This gives rise to nostalgic sentiments which motivates a return into an environment where language is familiar 2. Return as a means of preserving an identity – the life of emigrants often takes place within ghetto-like conditions where familiarity is being reproduced but under restricted conditions and hence not entirely authentic. The necessity for saving money permits only a <b>partial</b> <b>entry</b> into the host society and at the same time any accumulating savings add to the desire to return home where life can be lived fully again – or so it seems. 3. Return of investment – the impossibility to become fully part of another society often motivates migrants to accumulate not so much material wealth but new experiences and competences which they then aim to reinvest in their home country. 4. Return to retire – for many emigrants returning home becomes acute once they leave a productive occupation and feelings of estrangement build up, in conjunction with the efforts of having invested in building a house back home. All those motives are associated with a variety of difficulties on the actual return home because, above all, time in relation to the country of origin has been suspended for the emigrant and the encounter with the reality of that country reveals constant discrepancies and requires constant readjustment. This is where the need for assistance to returning emigrants arises. The fact that such an important centre of assistance has been closed is further confirmation of the still prevailing politics of ambiguity which nominally demand integration from nationals and non-nationals alike but deny the means of achieving this. Citizenship is not a natural result of nationality but requires the means for active participation in society. Furthermore, the experiences of returning immigrants provide important cues for the double ambivalence in which immigrants to Italy live between the demands made on them to integrate, the simultaneous threats of repatriation and the alienation from the immigrants’ home country which grows inexorably during the absence. The state can only regain its credibility by putting an end to this ambiguity and provide to returning emigrants, and immigrants alike, the means of reconstructing strong communal identities...|$|E

CaALK 8 in JG 436 conferred resistance to drugs such as cycloheximide (CYH), fluconazole (FCZ), O-phenanthroline (PHE) and 4 -nitroquinoline oxide (NQO). The gene was so designated because its sequence was identical to a <b>partial</b> sequence <b>entry</b> named as ALK 8 in the Candida database ([URL] CaALK 8 encodes for a putative 515 amino acid protein highly homologous to alkane-inducible cytochromes P 450 (CYP 52 gene family) of C. maltosa and C. tropicalis. The ability of CaALK 8 to confer drug resistance was also established by its expression in another drug-hypersensitive strain of S. cerevisiae (AD 1234568), which was deleted in seven ABC efflux pumps. The homozygous disruption of CaALK 8 in a wild-type C. albicans strain (CAI 4) {{did not result in}} altered drug susceptibilities. The overexpression of CaALK 8 in CAI 4 resulted in only FCZ resistance. However, a distinct MDR phenotype was evident when CaALK 8 was overexpressed in a drug-hypersensitive C. albicans strain disrupted in both CDR 1 and CDR 2 (ABC drug extrusion pumps of C. albicans). Alk 8 p, similar to other Alk proteins from C. maltosa and C. tropicalis, could hydroxylate alkanes and fatty acids.

We also introduce the dual sets $\hat H_m$ of reals $y$ for which the sequence of integers $\big([ky]\big) _{k\geq 1 }$ consistently hits the set $m\mathbb Z$ with the at least expected frequency $\frac 1 m$ and establish the connection with the sets $H_m$: { 2 mm} If $xy=m$ for $x,y> 0 $, then $x\in H_m$ if and only if $y\in \hat H_m$. The motivation for the present study comes from Y. Peres's ergodic lemma. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear pore {{complexes}} (NPCs) mediate nucleocytoplasmic movement. The central channel contains proteins with phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats, or variations (GLFG, glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine). These are ‘intrinsically disordered’ {{and often}} represent weak interaction sites that become ordered upon interaction. We investigated this possibility during nuclear transport. Using electron microscopy of S. cerevisiae, {{we show that}} NPC cytoplasmic filaments form a dome-shaped structure enclosing GLFG domains. GLFG domains extend out of this structure and {{are part of an}} ‘exclusion zone’ that might act as a <b>partial</b> barrier to <b>entry</b> of transport-inert proteins. The anchor domain of a GLFG nucleoporin locates exclusively to the central channel. By contrast, the localisation of the GLFG domains varied between NPCs and could be cytoplasmic, central or nucleoplasmic and could stretch up to 80  nm. These results suggest a dynamic exchange between ordered and disordered states. In contrast to diffusion through the NPC, transport cargoes passed through the exclusion zone and accumulated near the central plane. We also show that movement of cargo through the NPC is accompanied by relocation of GLFG domains, suggesting that binding, restructuring and movement of these domains could be part of the translocation mechanism...|$|R

Wolkowicz, Positive {{definite}} completions {{of partial}} Hermitian matrices, Linear Algebra Appl. 58 (1984) 109 – 124] the positive definite (semi-) completion problem {{in which the}} underlying graph is chordal was solved. For the positive definite case, the process was constructive and the completion was obtained by completing the <b>partial</b> matrix an <b>entry</b> at a time. For the positive semidefinite case, they obtained completions of a particular sequence of partial positive definite matrices with the same underlying graph and noted {{that there is a}} convergent subsequence of these completions that converges to the desired completion. Here, in the chordal case, we provide a constructive solution, based entirely on matrix/graph theoretic methods, to the positive (semi-) definite completion problem. Our solution associates a specific tree (called the “clique tree” [C. R. Johnson, M. Lundquist, Matrices with chordal inverse zero-patterns, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 36 (1993) 1 – 17]) with the (chordal) graph of the given partial positive (semi-) definite matrix. This tree structure allows us to complete the matrix a “block at a time” as opposed to an “entry at a time” (as in Grone et al. (1984) for the positive definite case). In Grone et al. (1984), using complex analytic techniques, the completion for the positive definite case was shown to be the unique determinant maximizing completion and was shown to be the unique completion that has zeros in its inverse in the positions corresponding to the unspecified <b>entries</b> of the <b>partial</b> matrix. Here, we show the same using only matrix/graph theoretic tools...|$|R
40|$|Approved for Public Release; Distribution is UnlimitedAnalysis of U. S. Army Reserve {{recruiting}} {{is conducted}} across the U. S. Army {{with data from}} the Recruit Quota System (REQUEST). A combination of <b>partial</b> manual data <b>entry</b> and a decided lack of tools for large scale data extraction make REQUEST difficult to use for analysis without an extensive knowledge of the system. In this thesis, I develop a process for screening, preparing, and evaluating REQUEST data for subsequent analysis. This process uses data mining software to progressively work {{through a series of}} rules that outline data inconsistencies, mark these records for exclusion and later investigation, and generate a "clean" dataset for analysis. I examine enlistments over a four year period with respect to Military Occupational Specialty and training program structure. Data from the Army Training Requirements and Resource System (ATRRS) are used to provide an overview of Initial Entry Training seat quotas and usage, and to confirm and/or update training dates in the REQUEST dataset. The joint examination of enlistments and training seats provides new insights into enlistment patterns. Additional analysis is possible using demographic data provided by the U. S. Army Recruiting Command. I provide summaries of a few key demographic variables for various subsets of the enlistees, and discuss how similar analyses might prove useful for targeting recruiting efforts and incentives more effectively. Good decisions require good data. This thesis is a start in providing a framework for generating quality USAR accession data for analysis. Major, United States Arm...|$|R
40|$|Two mutant Rat 2 {{fibroblast}} cell lines, R 3 - 2 and R 4 - 7, {{have been}} previously isolated by a selection for retrovirus resistance. We have now further analyzed {{the basis of}} the block to retroviral infection in the R 3 - 2 line. Using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, several genes were identified as differentially expressed in the mutant R 3 - 2 line compared with the wild-type cells. One of the candidate gene products, FEZ 1 (fasciculation and elongation protein ζ- 1), a protein kinase C (PKC) ζ-interacting protein homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans synaptic transport protein UNC- 76, was found to be up-regulated > 30 -fold in the resistant R 3 - 2 line. FEZ 1 overexpression in Rat 2 cells conferred a potent resistance to infection by genetically marked retroviruses, and the degree of retroviral resistance in both Rat 2 fibroblasts and 293 T cells tightly correlated with the expression level of FEZ 1 transcripts. FEZ 1 -overexpressing Rat 2 cells showed a similar phenotype to that of the mutant R 3 - 2 line: Infection resulted in normal viral DNA synthesis but a reduction in the formation of circular DNA, indicating a block after reverse transcription but before nuclear <b>entry.</b> <b>Partial</b> knockdown of FEZ 1 expression in R 3 - 2 by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly reduced the resistance of this line to infection. Thus, our data suggest that FEZ 1 overexpression is sufficient to explain the resistant phenotype of R 3 - 2 cells and identify FEZ 1 as a new gene capable of causing retrovirus resistance...|$|R
40|$|Aims/Background: Intrahepatic {{branching}} of the {{hepatic artery}} (HA) to liver microcirculatory units, the acini, is more heterogeneous {{than that of}} the portal vein (PV). Furthermore, part of HA blood enters the sinusoid partially downstream between the in- and outlets. We examined the effects of these vascular variations on porcine hepatic first-pass ammonia metabolism, which is characterised by high uptake and separate periportal urea and perivenous glutamine formations. Methods: NH was given via the PV, HA or caval vein, followed by 22 min dynamic liver positron emission tomography (PET) recordings in six pigs. Heterogeneity of liver N-metabolism was quantified by the coefficient of variation of tissue N-radioactivity measured 10 min after tracer infusion. Sinusoidal zonal clearances of NH into N-urea and N-glutamine were calculated by kinetic PET modelling. Results: Liver metabolic heterogeneity was 0. 65 ± 0. 20 (mean ± SD, n = 6) following NH-infusion into HA, 0. 34 ± 0. 17 into PV and 0. 10 ± 0. 02 into the caval vein. Clearance of NH to N-urea was of similar magnitude following NH administration into HA and PV: 0. 27 ± 0. 11 ml/min/g (mean ± SD) and 0. 29 ± 0. 09 ml/min/g, respectively. Clearances of NH to N-glutamine when NH was given into HA and PV were also similar: 0. 47 ± 0. 18 and 0. 50 ± 0. 13 ml/min/g, respectively. Conclusions: The present measurements of the hepatic metabolism of NH showed metabolic heterogeneity compatible with variation of the HA supply of the acini. Second, results of PET modelling of the sinusoidal zonation metabolism of NH to N-urea and to N-glutamine did not indicate metabolically important <b>partial</b> downstream arterial <b>entry</b> into the sinusoids...|$|R
