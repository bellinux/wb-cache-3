5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or <b>pyrethroid</b> <b>insecticides,</b> while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E
25|$|IRS is {{effective}} if at least 80% {{of homes and}} barns in a residential area are sprayed. Lower coverage rates can jeopardize program effectiveness.

5000|$|Since {{deltamethrin}} is a neurotoxin, it temporarily {{attacks the}} nervous system of any animal with which it comes into contact.

50|$|Knockdown resistance, {{also called}} kdr, {{describes}} cases {{of resistance to}} diphenylethane (e.g. DDT) and <b>pyrethroid</b> <b>insecticides</b> in insects and other arthropods that result from reduced sensitivity {{of the nervous system}} caused by point mutations in the insect population's genetic makeup. Such mutative resistance is characterized by the presence of kdr alleles in the insect's genome. Knockdown resistance, first identified and characterized in the house fly (Musca domestica) in the 1950s, remains a threat to the continued usefulness of pyrethroids in the control of many pest species. Research since 1990 has provided a wealth of new information on the molecular basis of knockdown resistance.|$|E
50|$|For IRS to be effective, {{at least}} 80% {{of homes and}} barns in an area must be sprayed, and if enough {{residents}} refuse spraying, {{the effectiveness of the}} whole program can be jeopardized. Many residents resist spraying of DDT in particular. This is due to a variety of factors, including its smell and the stains it leaves on the walls.While that stain makes it easier to check whether the room has been sprayed, it causes some villagers to resist the spraying of their homes or to resurface the wall, which eliminates the residual insecticidal effect. <b>Pyrethroid</b> <b>insecticides</b> are reportedly more acceptable since they do not leave visible residues on the walls.|$|E
