The extent to which the actual doctrinal law harmonises with these norms can arguably determine the usefulness of legal tools and interventions in exchange relations, but it is a complicated question.|$|E

(Later, John Maynard Keynes and his school argued that saving does not automatically lead to investment in tangible capital goods.) Thus, in this view, profit income is a reward for those who value future income highly and are thus willing to sacrifice current enjoyment.

Reciprocity is mostly regarded as a remnant of mercantilist trade policy. This paper argues that reciprocity is the more fundamental constitutional rule, because it reflects the unanimity principle enabling countries to identify Pareto-improving changes of trade policy. I reconstruct the implicit constitution of world trade by applying some methodology of <b>positive</b> constitutional <b>economics.</b> A major result {{is that in the}} Uruguay round a fundamental constitutional change took place from general reciprocity to “status quo reciprocity”, which entails the possibility of Pareto-deteriorating institutional changes.

2500|$|The {{fact that}} firms {{appear to be}} {{consistently}} heterogeneous (S.F.3) has brought Dosi to criticize the Neoclassical prediction that firms in an industry converge toward some kind of [...] "optimal" [...] or [...] "representative" [...] characteristic. For such argument to be valid, the characteristics of firms would need to evolve in time toward a normal distribution, possibly showing some shrinking of the support. Notably, this theoretical implication poses an unresolved challenge to the arguments put forward by Milton Friedman in his essay The Methodology of <b>Positive</b> <b>Economics.</b> In such work Friedman asserted that maximizing behavior was a reasonable working approximation to describe the choices of economic agents: in fact, even if not all economic agents actually maximize (for example because some make mistakes) only the [...] "fittest" [...] ones will be selected by the market. Therefore, those agents that actually maximize {{would be the only}} [...] "survivors" [...] to market selection, and hence they would gather very closely around the single optimal behavior. In other words, the tails of the distribution will tend to disappear as market selects the best [...] "genes", which {{would turn out to be}} both [...] "optimal" [...] (in terms of fit to the market selection) and [...] "representative" [...] (since it would be the only surviving type). However, the empirical findings that constitute S.F.3 prove the exact opposite of Friedman's prediction: very different [...] "genes" [...] survive to the market. As a consequence, a realistic representation of economic behavior should rather allow for firm-specificities, which would explain the heterogeneity found in the data: a point that was clearly made by Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter in their book An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{conditions}} under which compliance with a social contract establishes an equilibrium in a society. It is assumed that society consists of two groups, one of which has a comparative advantage in using violence, whereas the other one has a comparative advantage in producing a private good. Violence can be used to produce security as well as to exploit the weaker group. Yet, exploitation is limited: it reduces the incentives of the exploited group to produce the private good and increases the chances of a revolution. A social contract consists of the exchange of security against a share of the private good, produced at a high level of effort. The model not only allows the derivation of conditions for either compliance or exploitation to occur, but also sheds light on the transition from one form of government to the other. Hence, it contributes to <b>Positive</b> Constitutional <b>Economics,</b> i. e., the research program that is interested in explaining the emergence and the change of constitutions. self-enforcing contracts, rule of law, dictatorship, autocracy, <b>Positive</b> Constitutional <b>Economics,...</b>|$|R

I show that, when public schools are congested, the majority of voters are in favour of SV. Furthermore, SV induces a Pareto improvement.

However, since lobby groups care about the distribution of income as well as about efficiency, the equilibrium structure of taxes differs considerably from the set of Pigouvian taxes. In particular, organized sectors get a tax discount, while unorganized sectors are taxed at an inefficiently high rate. Hence, environmental lobbying has a huge beggar-thy-neighbour element.
