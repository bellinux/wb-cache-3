40|$|This {{final report}} is {{an account of}} the {{principal}} activities of Lof Energy Systems, Inc. in a two-year project funded by the Energy Related Inventions Program (ERIP) of the U. S. Department of Energy. The primary objective has been the development of a fully practical and economical system for saving energy in indoor swimming pools by use of motorized covers. The goal is wide-spread use of a fully developed product, in institutional swimming pools. Four major tasks, depicted in the accompanying Performance Schedule, have been completed, and one other has been initiated and its completion committed. Principal accomplishments have been the selection and improvement of cover materials and designs, lengthening and strengthening of reels and improvements in motorized components and their control, design and installation of pool covers in full scale demonstration and evaluation of fully developed commercial system, preparation and dissemination of manuals and reports, finalization of arrangements for Underwriters Laboratory certification of products, and final report preparation and submission. Of greatest significance has been the successful demonstration of the fully developed system and the verification and reporting by an energy consultant of the large savings resulting from <b>pool</b> <b>cover</b> use. Probably the best evidence of success of the DOE-ERIP project in advancing this invention to a commercial stage is its acceptance for sale by the Lincoln Equipment Company, a national distributor of swimming pool supplies and equipment. A copy of the relevant page in the Lincoln catalog is included in this report as Annex A. Representatives of that company now offer Tof motorized <b>pool</b> <b>cover</b> systems to their pool owner customers. In addition to the plans for securing UL certification the company expects to continue making design improvements that can increase system reliability, durability, and cost-effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{distribution}} calculations {{are performed}} for the ITER-FEAT vacuum vessel, the connected {{pressure suppression pool}} and drain tank. An ex-vessel/first-wall coolant leak without plasma shutdown is simulated. The steam, hydrogen, and air sources for this sequence are taken from best-estimate MELCOR calculations. The time- and space-dependent gas distribution in the system is calculated using the verified three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics code GASFLOW. A new extended version of GASFLOW has been developed to model the ITER-FEAT specific phenomena in adequate detail. During the accident sequence, hydrogen initially appears only in the vacuum vessel due to the steam/beryllium reaction. After failure of the burst membranes, steam and hydrogen flow from the vacuum vessel through the connecting lines to the suppression pool and the drain tank. Because of the ongoing steam condensation occurring in the suppression pool, the pressure there remains permanently at a lower level {{compared to the other}} components, resulting in a continuous flow of steam and noncondensable gases into this volume. Since no steam condensation is modeled in the drain tank, almost all H_ 2 and N_ 2 accumulate in the suppression <b>pool</b> <b>cover</b> gas volume. After 10, 500 s of steam flow, also air starts entering the vacuum vessel, with the basic mechanisms remaining the same. Consequently, an accumulation of N_ 2 and O_ 2 takes place in the suppression <b>pool</b> <b>cover</b> gas. Combustible and explosive H_ 2 -O_ 2 -N_ 2 mixtures exist after 13, 600 s, and at 21, 000 s a stoichiometric H_ 2 /O_ 2 ratio has formed, involving 14 kg of hydrogen. Contrary to the situation in the suppression pool with its significant hydrogen risk, only inert, steam dominated mixtures without hazard potential develop in the vacuum vessel and the drain tank. Various passive mitigation measures could be considered to reduce or completely remove the hydrogen risk in the suppression pool. (orig.)

40|$|An {{unheated}} {{swimming pool}} has a natural yearly temperature cycle that varies with climate and geography, which {{in most parts}} of the United States limits outdoor swimming to just the summer months. However, a comfortable three to four month swimming season can be stretched out to five or six months when a pool heater is added (even longer in warm climates). While heating your pool can enhance and extend your enjoyment of your pool, the cost of keeping all that water warm is very high. However, if you take advantage of the strong summer sun, you can reduce those high heating costs while still obtaining the benefits of a warm pool. Conservation First If you already have a heating system, the first thing you should do is to conserve the heat in your pool. The easiest way to save energy is to turn down the thermostat on your pool heater; every one degree reduction on the thermostat will reduce energy consumption by 5 - 10 %. Once you have turned the heat down, the next step is to keep the heat from escaping. Since 95 % of a pool's heat losses occur at the surface through evaporation, conduction, and radiation to the sky, a <b>pool</b> <b>cover</b> will substantially reduce your pool's heat loss. A cover will also help keep the pool cleaner and help extend the life of the chemicals in your pool. With a transparent plastic cover, you will actually gain some heat as the sun's rays pass through the cover and heat the water. At a cost of $ 0. 40 - $ 0. 80 per square foot, a <b>pool</b> <b>cover</b> can pay for itself in as little as one year, though you should be aware that the covers will deteriorate due to ultraviolet radiation, requiring a replacement every 3 to 5 years. Make sure your cover's warranty specifies its life expectancy. Also check to determine the ease of handling and storing the cover. Basic Components If you have taken steps to retain your pool's heat but are still not happy with your heating bills, or if you are planning to install a new pool, a solar swimming poo...|$|E
40|$|Recovery {{planning}} for the nationally threatened black redhorse (Moxostoma duquesnei) is limited {{by a lack of}} knowledge regarding species ecology, population size and factors that affect distribution and abundance. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to evaluate the influence of habitat quality on the distribution of the black redhorse in the Grand River (Ontario) and 11 western Lake Erie tributaries (Ohio). Black redhorse were captured at 26 % of Grand River sites and 6 % of western Lake Erie tributary sites. In western Lake Erie tributaries, black redhorse {{were more likely to be}} found at sites of intermediate upstream drainage area (a surrogate for watercourse size) and less likely to be found at sites with poor sub-strate, <b>pool,</b> <b>cover</b> and channel conditions. In the Grand River, occurrence was negatively associated with higher gradients and small and large upstream drainage areas. Habitat quality was found to be associated with the distribution of golden red-horse (M. erythrurum) but not the other two co-occurring redhorse species. Site occupancy was negatively associated with poor substrate and pool conditions. Results from this study indicate that, in areas of black redhorse occurrence, river reaches with clean, coarse bed material, well-developed riffles and pools, and stable channels require specific protection.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify pool geomorphic and geographic characteristics, to determine distribution of vegetative cover types and nekton species, and to evaluate effects of ditch plugging on nekton use of pools. Over 30 ditched and unditched marshes were surveyed from the Connecticut shore of Long Island Sound to southern Maine, USA for pool physical traits. Pools from ditched and unditched marshes had similar sizes, depths and distances on tidal flow, but not pool density (#/ha marsh) and coverage (m² pool/ha marsh) was negatively correlated to pool density and coverage.

40|$|Spawning {{biology of}} Galaxias postvectis Clarke (shortjaw kokopu) was {{investigated}} in streams in northwest Taranaki, New Zealand. Most G. postvectis were found to spawn near their adult habitat on the river bank during spate flows between May 9 and 17, 2001. Other galaxiids captured appeared to begin spawning earlier in late April. Sixteen galaxiid nests were discovered amongst flooded areas, lying on or amongst the substrate, vegetation and debris {{on the banks of}} the Katikara Stream. Mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences were used to identify these morphologically similar eggs, with 12 being identified as G. postvectis and four as G. fasciatus Gray (banded kokopu). Galaxias fasciatus nest sites had more vegetation and debris than G. postvectis nests. The presence of a backwater or <b>pool,</b> <b>cover</b> and gravel were found to be important characteristics associated with both species nests. Egg development took around three to four weeks on the Katikara Stream margins. Under experimental conditions, most G. postvectis and G. fasciatus eggs were found to hatch within the first hour of re-immersion in water, and more hatching occurred in moving than still water at warmer temperatures. In the Katikara Stream, eggs hatched and moved downstream only at times of increased water levels. MtDNA sequences were used to identify G. fasciatus, G. postvectis and G. brevipinnis Günther (koaro) larvae caught drifting downstream in May and June, 2001. From reproductive assessment of adults captured, developmental stage of eggs in nests found, and timing of emigrating larvae, G. fasciatus appeared to spawn earlier than G. brevipinnis, and both species spawned earlier than G. postvectis. Whitebait migrations were examined within the tidal influence and c. 40 km inland in two rivers in south Taranaki, one with a dam and one without. Whitebait catches were dominated by G. maculatus (Jenyns) (inanga) and catches appeared to be similar in both rivers. Large schools of whitebait were however seen below the Patea Dam from October onwards in the Patea River. No whitebait were found to surmount the dam using the elver pass. So the presence of a dam does not appear to affect whitebait recruitment within the tidal influence, however it does block whitebait migrating further upstream to adult habitat...|$|E
40|$|Salt marsh pools provide {{important}} habitat for nekton (fish and decapod crustaceans). Although relatively unstudied, efforts are underway to expand pool habitat through a technique known as ditch plugging. The {{purpose of this}} study was to quantify pool geomorphic and geographic characteristics, to determine distribution of vegetative cover types and nekton species, and to evaluate effects of ditch plugging on nekton use of pools. ^ Over 30 ditched and unditched marshes were surveyed from the Connecticut shore of Long Island Sound to southern Maine, USA. Pool density (#/ha marsh) and coverage (m 2 pool/ha marsh) were over twice as great at unditched versus ditched marshes. Ditch intensity (m ditch/ha marsh) was negatively correlated to pool density and coverage. ^ <b>Pool</b> <b>cover</b> types surveyed at 12 marshes resulted in eight categories; “bare” (pool bottom visible) and filamentous green algae were most common. Canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that R. maritima and algal flocculations were separated by water depth, soft sediment depth, and water column nitrogen. ^ Pool nekton sampling using 1 m 2 throw traps documented 12 fish and 4 decapod species with F. heteroclitus comprising 80 % of the fish catch. Species richness and density were greater in southern versus northern New England salt marshes. In contrast to other studies, fish densities were not affected by the presence of submerged aquatic vegetation (R. maritima). Data suggest that F. heteroclitus use pools as nursery habitat and as refuges from predation, selecting among pools with different environmental conditions as the season progressed and juvenile size increased. ^ Ditch plugging at 3 sites in the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, Maine, was evaluated for initial effects on nekton use of pools. After controlling for natural variation using the BALI (Before-After-Control-Impact) design, few nekton parameters were altered at Moody and Granite Point. Decreased species richness at Granite Point was thought due to physical barriers of ditch plugs and a 51 % reduction in tidal interface. At Marshall Point, ditch plugging resulted in increased pool habitat and nekton use. Nekton occupied newly created pools within weeks, and within months new pools were not discernable from old pools in terms of nekton use. ...|$|E
