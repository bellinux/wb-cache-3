When his parents bought a computer when he was 10, Yonezu made and uploaded flash animation videos for Bump of Chicken songs on the Internet.

His Universal releases have also featured his own artwork. Yonezu primarily uses Adobe Photoshop Elements, Adobe After Effects and Corel Painter Essentials for animation. Yonezu's illustrations became a feature in music magazine Rockin' On Japan starting in the August 2013 issue. His piece, called , features fictional creatures Yonezu has drawn.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present an {{intuitive}} tool suitable for 2 D artists using touch-enabled <b>pen</b> <b>tablets.</b> An artist-oriented tool should be easy-to-use, real-time, versatile, and locally refinable. Our approach uses an interactive system for 3 D character posing from 2 D strokes. We employ a closed-form {{solution for the}} 2 D strokes to 3 D skeleton registration problem. We first construct an intermediate 2 D stroke representation by extracting local features using meaningful heuristics. Then, we match 2 D stroke segments to 3 D bones. Finally, 3 D bones are carefully realigned with the matched 2 D stroke segments while enforcing important constraints such as bone rigidity and depth. Our technique is real-time and has a linear time complexity. It is versatile, as it works with any type of 2 D stroke and 3 D skeleton input. Finally, thanks to its coarse-to-fine design, it allows users to perform local refinements and thus keep full control over the final results. We demonstrate that our system is suitable for 2 D artists using touch-enabled <b>pen</b> <b>tablets</b> by posing 3 D characters with heterogeneous topologies (bipeds, quadrupeds, hands) in real-time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an empirical study that considered the usability of digital <b>pens,</b> <b>Tablet</b> PCs, and laptop PCs for handwritten text input by young users.

The study found that digital pens were particularly well suited to older children and that the both sets of children were able to use the Tablet PC without too many errors. Digital ink technologies are often evaluated by the calculation of recognition rates and this paper exposes some of the flaws in the process of estimating recognition rates from activities involving the copying of text. With particular reference to the personalization of text, possibilities for the use of digital ink for the task of writing are explored and a new interaction, digital doodling, is presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{is focused}} on dynamic {{signature}} verification for state-of-the-art smart phones, including performance evaluation. The analysis was performed on database consisting of 25 users and 500 signatures in total acquired with Samsung Galaxy Note. The verification algorithm tested combines two approaches: feature based (using Mahalanobis distance) and function based (using DTW), {{and the results are}} shown in terms of EER values. A number of experimental findings associated with signature verification in this scenario are obtained, e. g., the dominant challenge associated with the intra-class variability across time. As a result of the algorithm adaptation to the mobile scenario, the use of a state-of-the-art smart phone, and contrarily to what has been evidenced in previous works, we finally demonstrate that signature verification on smart phones can result in a similar verification performance compared to one obtained using more ergonomic stylus-based <b>pen</b> <b>tablets.</b> In particular, the best result achieved is an EER of 0. 525 %...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{collaborative}} music game for two <b>pen</b> <b>tablets</b> is studied {{in order to}} see how two people with no professional music background negotiated musical improvisation. In an initial study of what it is that constitutes play fluency in improvisation, a music game has been designed and evaluated through video analysis: A qualitative view of mutual action describes the social context of music improvisation: how two people with speech, laughter, gestures, postures and pauses negotiate individual and joint action. The objective behind the design of the game application was to support players in some aspects of their mutual play. Results show that even though players activated additional sound feedback {{as a result of their}} mutual play, players also engaged in forms of mutual play that the game engine did not account for. These ways of mutual play are descibed further along with some suggestions for how to direct future designs of collaborative music improvisation games towards ways of mutual play...|$|R
40|$|ISSN 2220 - 4806. International audienceDigitartic, {{a system}} for bi-manual gestural control of Vowel- Consonant-Vowel performative singing {{synthesis}} is presented. This system {{is an extension of}} a real-time gesture-controlled vowel singing instrument developed in the Max MSP language. In addition to pitch, vowels and voice strength controls, Digitartic is designed for gestural control of articulation parameters, including various places and manners of articulation. The phases of articulation between two phonemes are continuously controlled and can be driven in real time without noticeable delay, at any stage of the synthetic phoneme production. Thus, as in natural singing, very accurate rhythmic patterns are produced and adapted while playing with other musicians. The instrument features two (augmented) <b>pen</b> <b>tablets</b> for controlling voice production: one is dealing with the glottal source and vowels, the second one is dealing with consonant/vowel articulation. The results show very natural consonant and vowel synthesis. Virtual choral practice confirms the effectiveness of Digitartic as an expressive musical instrument...|$|R
