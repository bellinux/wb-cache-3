40|$|Through its diverse trade {{preference}} schemes, the European Union provides {{different groups of}} developing countries with different degrees of market access. This paper {{is the first to}} demonstrate empirically that such staggered market access induces sizable trade diversion to the detriment of relatively less <b>preferred</b> <b>beneficiary</b> countries. In particular, preferences granted to African, Caribbean and Pacific economies are shown to impair the export performance of seven developing countries whose products only qualify for basic preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences. Exports to the European Union decline by about 30 percent if the African, Caribbean and Pacific tariff falls by 10 percentage points. In terms of forgone trade volume, losses for these relatively disadvantaged countries amount on average to 9 percent of their total trade with the European Union, depending on the country and its main exports. These intra-developing country distortions are driven by highly substitutable, often labor-intensive commodities.

40|$|A ‘discount rate’ for the {{consumption}} of future generations from current investments for their benefit is typically composed of two parts: ‘time preference’ and an allowance for the lower marginal utility of consumption due to higher average levels of consumption in the future. Time preference would be involved if one were postponing one's own consumption; it has {{little or nothing to}} do with income redistribution, which is what greenhouse abatement is about. A lower marginal utility of consumption is an anomaly in income redistribution: we rarely deliberately transfer consumption from the less to the more well-to-do. Time may serve as a kind of measure of distance; we may <b>prefer</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> who are closer in time, in geographical distance, in culture, surely in kinship. Perhaps to keep our thinking straight we should use a term like ‘depreciation’, rather than ‘discounting’...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleThe key {{objective}} of the study described here was to compare the impact of cash and food transfers on beneficiary households’ food and livelihood security and on the local economy. A wider objective was to learn how best to determine the feasibility and appropriateness of cash-based programmes in emergency food-security assessments [...] . In areas where markets were functioning and accessible, cash transfer was more cost-effective and <b>preferred</b> by <b>beneficiaries.</b> In those areas where markets were less functional or accessible food assistance was more cost-effective and <b>preferred</b> by <b>beneficiaries.</b> The appropriateness of cash programming depends on market access and functioning. (whether they are competitive and integrated), and security. Food aid is more appropriate in contexts where markets are not working well, where security conditions impose higher market transactions costs for consumers, and in situations of high and unpredictable inflation. Opportunities exist for using both interventions in parallel or in a phased approach depending on seasonal and contextual changes over time and space.

50|$|In 1976, a {{group of}} Italian American professors at City University of New York asked to be added as an affirmative action {{category}} for promotion and hiring. Italian Americans are usually considered white in the US {{and would not be}} covered under affirmative action policies, but the professors believed they were underrepresented. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell wrote in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study, that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of <b>preferred</b> groups primary <b>beneficiaries</b> of affirmative action to take advantage of group preference policies.|$|R
30|$|The third type {{of medical}} {{innovation}} is treatment with considerable uncertainty of value or poor cost effectiveness. The classical example is arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee, a surgical procedure that can diagnose and treat {{problems in the}} knee joint. Kirkley and their colleagues conducted a single-center, randomized, controlled trial of arthroscopic surgery in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} surgical lavage and arthroscopic débridement together with optimized physical and medical therapy or to treatment with physical and medical therapy alone. They found that arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee does provide any additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy (Kirkley et al., 2008). Barnato et al (2007) examined whether variations across regions in end-of-life (EOL) treatment intensity are related with regional differences in patient preferences for EOL care. They concluded that Medicare <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>preferred</b> a focus on palliative care rather than life-extension care such as ICU for the chronically ill, which increases healthcare costs. Temel et al. (2010) argued that lung cancer patients who were treated with the advanced medical technology experienced worse quality of life and shorter life expectancy as compared with palliative care.|$|R
40|$|This paper depicts, first, an {{overview}} of the passive house concept. The comparison between thermal insulation of buildings and energy consumption shows the economic (financial) and environmental benefits (pollution reduction) that complies with the passive house standard. The presented examples show that the "passive house" standard applies not only to single family residential constructions but also to large buildings: kindergartens and schools, collective dwellings, administrative buildings and offices. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the first two buildings (houses) in Romania designed and erected according to "passive house" standard. The first one is built with a concrete structure and the second one is built on a wooden structure, thus illustrating different possibilities of applying the "Passivehaus" standard in Romania. The focus is on the first example, which is a result of a research project in applying the passive house standard to Romanian climat conditions and with a construction system (concrete and brick structures) <b>preferred</b> by Romanian <b>beneficiaries.</b> Research results shows that a judicious design, including green and sustainable principles can extend the benefits of the "passive house" standard compliance, the result being visible in both financial and, more importantly, the quality of life...|$|R
5000|$|Terry Eastland, {{the author}} who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, [...] "Most {{arguments}} {{for affirmative action}} fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go {{to those who did}} not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it {{we would be able to}} compete more freely with one another.Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of <b>preferred</b> groups primary <b>beneficiaries</b> of affirmative action to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best - the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile - thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.|$|R
30|$|Apart from {{evaluating}} {{an important}} new pension reform in Singapore, our paper {{contributes to the}} literature on the effects of non-contributory pensions on the labour market. In our paper, the estimated effect of the SSS on participation in paid work is lower (close to zero, and statistically insignificant) than the fall of 4 to 6 percentage points that many other studies on non-contributory pensions find (Aguila et al. 2011; Bando et al. 2016; Cheng et al. 2018; Fetter and Lockwood 2016; Galiani et al. 2016; Hernani-Limarino and Mena 2015; Juárez and Pfutze 2015). 6 Interestingly, Galiani et al. (2016) and Bando et al. (2016) find no effects on overall labour supply about 1  year after a non-contributory pension was rolled out in Mexico and Peru respectively, as there was a shift from paid work to unpaid work. Galiani et al. (2016) explain that the shift could be due to <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>preferring</b> “less stressful and less demanding informal unpaid work within the household”. Following this line of argument, it is possible that we do not see a drop in paid work participation because paid work in Singapore could be less stressful and demanding than that in the developing countries, and little informal unpaid work within the household (such as farming and handicrafts) is available in Singapore. The lack of an effect on the intensive margin may also be partially explained by labour market constraints on minimum working hours (see, e.g. Euwals 2001; Martinez-Granado 2005 for evidence on constraints on working hours; Stewart and Swaffield 1997). In addition, the relatively small quantum of SSS payouts (in relation to both recipients’ wage and payouts from many other non-contributory pensions), 7 as well as the possibility that work behaviour may take time to change, may also explain our result. Regardless of the exact reasons for the smaller estimated effects in our sample, our results suggest that the effects of non-contributory pensions on labour supply, as well as the speed of labour market adjustment, are likely to vary by payout level and/or institutional context.|$|R
