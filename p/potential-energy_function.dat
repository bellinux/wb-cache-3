The 1 { 1 and 1 {S 0 intersections are converted into conical intersections when the out-of-plane motion of the active hydrogen atom is taken into account. It is argued that the predissociation of the 1 and 1 n states by the 1 state and the conical intersection of the 1 state with the S 0 state provide the mechanism for the ultrafast radiationless deactivation of the excited singlet states of adenine.

This ⋅CH 3 +diamond <b>potential-energy</b> <b>function</b> is a molecular anharmonic potential written with switching (MAPS) functions and is identified by MAPS/MeDIAM. It is a sum of lattice (Vlattice), nonbonded (Vnonbonded), and radial site (VCH 3,site) potential terms. There are many general properties of potential-energy functions for alkyl radical association reactions which are transferable {{and can be used}} to help construct VCH 3,site. Additional properties of VCH 3,site are determined by ab initio calculations using the restricted and unrestricted quadratic configuration-interaction method, with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations and the 6 - 31 G** basis set. The MAPS/MeDIAM potential function is used to study ⋅CH 3 association with a carbon-atom radical site on the diamond { 111 } terrace. The energy for ⋅CH 3 adsorption with this site is calculated to be 17 kcal/mol lower than the ab initio CH 3 -C(CH 3) 3 bond dissociation energy.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is presented for deriving kinetic and <b>potential-energy</b> <b>functions</b> from experimental data for an arbitrary number of large-amplitude vibrations. As a starting point, the method requires a highquality {{estimate of the}} spectroscopic data. We use the previously developed technique of spectrum generation from ab initio calculations to obtain the initial kinetic and potential functions. The present technique minimizes the error between the calculated and experimental energy levels by considering both the kinetic and potential terms. The application to the internal rotation of the methyl group in the So state of acetaldehyde shows that the technique is capable of yielding agreement to the experimental measurements to within 0. 0001 cm-'. The joint methyl torsion and aldehyde wagging modes for the T, state of acetaldehyde are also considered. From the twodimensional potential function the barriers to methyl rotation and to inversion of the aldehydic hydrogen {{are found to be}} 633. 60 and 935. 76 cm-', respectively. The equilibrium conformation obtained from the twodimensional potential shows one methyl hydrogen almost eclipsing the aldehydic oxygen (torsion angle 186. 40 ") whereas the aldehydic hydrogen distorts out of the molecular frame by 39. 17 ".

First, we used standard free-energy perturbation calculations of relative binding affinities, {{performed at the}} molecular-mechanics (MM) level with TIP 3 P waters, the GAFF force field, and two different sets of charges for the host and the guest, obtained either with the restrained electrostatic potential or AM 1 -BCC methods. Both charge sets give good and nearly identical results, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 4 kJ/mol and a correlation coefficient (R (2)) of 0. 8 compared to experimental results. Second, we tried to improve these predictions with 28, 800 density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for selected snapshots and the non-Boltzmann Bennett acceptance-ratio method, but this led to much worse results, probably because of a too large difference between the MM and DFT <b>potential-energy</b> <b>functions.</b> Third, we tried to calculate absolute affinities using minimised DFT structures. This gave intermediate-quality results with MADs of 5 - 9 kJ/mol and R (2) = 0. 6 - 0. 8, {{depending on how the}} structures were obtained. Finally, we tried to improve these results using local coupled-cluster calculations with single and double excitations, and non-iterative perturbative treatment of triple excitations (LCCSD(T 0)), employing the polarisable multipole interactions with supermolecular pairs approach. Unfortunately, this only degraded the predictions, probably because of a mismatch between the solvation energies obtained at the DFT and LCCSD(T 0) levels...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{optimizing}} potential-energy functions of proteins is proposed. The method assumes a hierarchical {{structure of the}} energy landscape, {{which means that the}} energy decreases as the number of native-like elements in a structure increases, being lowest for structures from the native family and highest for structures with no native-like element. A level of the hierarchy is defined as a family of structures with the same number of native-like elements (or degree of native likeness). Optimization of a <b>potential-energy</b> <b>function</b> is aimed at achieving such a hierarchical structure of the energy landscape by forcing appropriate free-energy gaps between hierarchy levels to place their energies in ascending order. This procedure is different from methods developed thus far, in which the energy gap and/or the Z score between the native structure and all non-native structures are maximized, regardless of the degree of native likeness of the non-native structures. The advantage of this approach lies in reducing the number of structures with decreasing energy, which should ensure the searchability of the potential. The method was tested on two proteins, PDB ID codes 1 FSD and 1 IGD, with an off-lattice united-residue force field. For 1 FSD, the search of the conformational space {{with the use of the}} conformational space annealing method and the newly optimized <b>potential-energy</b> <b>function</b> found the native structure very quickly, as opposed to the potential-energy functions obtained by former optimization methods. After even incomplete optimization, the force field obtained by using 1 IGD located the native-like structures of two peptides, 1 FSD and betanova (a designed three-stranded β-sheet peptide), as the lowest-energy conformations, whereas for the 46 -residue N-terminal fragment of staphylococcal protein A, the native-like conformation was the second-lowest-energy conformation and had an energy 2 kcal/mol above that of the lowest-energy structure...|$|E

When the two instances arise from the fact that different algorithms or different approximations are used, the distance herein defined may be used to evaluate the relative accuracy of the two methods. When the difference is due to a change in the free parameters of which the potential depends on, the distance can be used to quantify, in each region of parameter space, the robustness of the modeling to such a change and this, in turn, may be used to assess the significance of a parameters' fit.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of internuclear distances in gaseous XeF 6 exhibits unusually diffuse XeF 6 bonded and F–F geminal nonbonded peaks, {{the latter of}} which is severely skewed. The distribution proves the molecule cannot be a regular octahedron vibrating in independent normal modes. The instantaneous molecular configurations encountered by the incident electrons are predominantly in the broad vicinity of C 3 υC 3 υ structures conveniently described as distorted octahedra in which the xenon lone pair avoids the bonding pairs. In these distorted structures the XeF bond lengths are distributed over a range of approximately 0. 08 Å with the longer bonds tending to be those adjacent to the avoided region of the coordination sphere. Fluorines suffer angular displacements from octahedral sites which range up to 5 ° or 10 ° {{in the vicinity of}} the avoided region. Alternative interpretations of the diffraction data are developed in detail, ranging from models of statically deformed molecules to those of dynamically inverting molecules. In all cases it is necessary to assume that t 1 ut 1 u bending amplitudes are enormous and correlated in a certain way with substantial t 2 gt 2 g deformations. Notwith‐standing the small fraction of time that XeF. spends near OhOh symmetry, it is possible to construct a molecular <b>potential‐energy</b> <b>function</b> more or less compatiable with the diffraction data in which the minimum energy occurs at OhOh symmerty. The most notable feature of this model is the almost vanishing restoring force for small t 1 ut 1 u bending distortions. Indeed, the mean curvature of the potential surface for this model corresponds to a υ 4 υ 4 force constant F 44 F 44 of 10 − 2 mdyn/Å or less. Various rapidly inverting non‐OhOh structures embodying particular combinations of t 2 gt 2 g and t 1 ut 1 u deformations from OhOh symmetry give slightly better radial distribution functions, however. In the region of molecular configuration where the gas molecules spend most of their time, the form of the <b>potential‐energy</b> <b>function</b> required to represent the data does not distinguish between a Jahn–Teller first‐order term or a cubic V 445 V 445 term as the agent responsible for introducing the t 2 gt 2 g deformation. The Jahn–Teller term is consistent with Goodman's interpretation of the molecule. On the other hand, the cubic term is found to be exactly analogous to that for other molecules with stereochemically active lone pairs (e. g., SF 4, ClF 3). Therefore, the question as to why the XeF 6 molecule is distorted remains open. The reported absence of any observable gas‐phase paramagnetism weighs against the Jahn–Teller interpretation. The qualitative success but quantitative failure of the valence‐shell–electron‐pair‐repulsion theory is discussed and the relevance of the “pseudo‐Jahn–Teller” formalism of Longuet‐Higgins et al. is pointed out.

40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in the protein-structure prediction method developed in our laboratory, based on the thermodynamic hypothesis, are described. The conformational space is searched extensively at the united-residue level by using our physics-based UNRES energy function and the conformational space annealing method of global optimization. The lowest-energy coarse-grained structures are then converted to an all-atom representation and energy-minimized with the ECEPP/ 3 force field. The procedure was assessed in two recent blind tests of protein-structure prediction. During the first blind test, we predicted large fragments of α and α+β proteins [60 – 70 residues with Cα rms deviation (rmsd) < 6 Å]. However, for α+β proteins, significant topological errors occurred despite low rmsd values. In the second exercise, we predicted whole structures of five proteins (two α and three α+β, with sizes of 53 – 235 residues) with remarkably good accuracy. In particular, for the genomic target TM 0487 (a 102 -residue α+β protein from Thermotoga maritima), we predicted the complete, topologically correct structure with 7. 3 -Å Cα rmsd. So far this protein is the largest α+β protein predicted {{based solely on the}} amino acid sequence and a physics-based <b>potential-energy</b> <b>function</b> and search procedure.

40|$|In variational transition-state theory (VTST) and semiclassical {{tunnelling}} calculations, {{especially those}} with semiempirical potential-energy surfaces, it is sometimes desirable to match the classical energies and vibration frequencies of some points (eg. the reactant, saddle point, product, van der Waals complex, ion-molecule complex) along the minimum-energy path (MEP) and in the reaction swath with high-level results, as this can improve the accuracy. This {{can be accomplished by}} adding a correction function to the calculated energies or frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a three-point or zero-order interpolated correction method which is based on the correction at three points, in particular the saddle point and two stationary points, one {{on each side of the}} MEP. We use the corrections at these points to build a correction function for the classical energy and for each vibrational mode frequency along the MEP. The function is calibrated such that the corrected result matches the accurate values at these stationary points.

40|$|Significant {{departures from}} D 5 hD 5 h {{symmetry}} are {{indicated by the}} gas‐phase electron diffraction data for ReF 7. Observed scattered intensities, corrected for heavy‐atom effects as discussed in the preceding paper, are adequately represented by structures with static deformations of either C 2 C 2 or CsCs symmetry of the following character. A puckering of the ring of five fluorines (maximum out‐of‐plane displacement ≈[*] 9 °) {{is accompanied by a}} movement of each axial fluorine from the reference axis of ≈[*] 8 ° in the direction which provides maximum avoidance of fluorines on the rhenium coordination sphere. Equally compatible with the data is the much more reasonable dynamic pseudorotation model in which vibrational displacements carry the molecule from C 2 C 2 to CsCs to C 2 C 2 configurations. The tenfold character of the hindering potential and modest displacements preclude an appreciable barrier. A pronounced skewing of the envelope of axial–equatorial, FaFeFaFe, distances reveals a coupling in phase of the e 1 ′e 1 ′ axial bend to the e 2 ″e 2 ″ ring puckering vibration through the S 2 (e 2 ″) S(e 1 ′) S 2 (e 2 ″) S(e 1 ′) cubic term in the <b>potential‐energy</b> <b>function.</b> The skewing, which moves the maximum of the FaFeFaFe distribution peak inside the distribution center of gravity, results in an apparent “anharmonic shrinkage” of the nonbonded peak by an amount exceeding the well‐known “Bastiansen–Morino” harmonic shrinkage. It is to be noted that the equatorial pseudorotation problem closely resembles that for cyclopentane in reduced mass, in displacement, and therefore, presumably, in frequency. The structure itself may be understood in terms of bond–bond repulsions thrusting the equatorial atoms out of plane; the out‐of‐plane displacement, in turn, induces an axial bend. The actual structure, however, exhibits too large an axial bend to conform to the simple repelling points‐on‐a‐sphere model of Gillespie and too small a deviation from D 5 hD 5 h to correspond to the close packing of hard atoms around the rhenium...|$|E
40|$|The {{torsional}} oscillation {{between the}} two OH groups of the hydrogen peroxide molecule is investigated through {{a study of the}} far‐infrared absorption spectrum of the molecule. A 1 ‐m‐focal‐length vacuum grating monochromator was used to scan the region from 15 to 700 cm− 1 with an average resolution of 0. 3 cm− 1. The observed spectrum contains seven perpendicular‐type bands of which only the Q branches are resolved. The centers of the seven bands are at 11. 43, 116. 51, 198. 57, 242. 76, 370. 70, 521. 68, and 557. 84 cm− 1. These bands result from transitions between different states of the internal rotation and their identification makes it possible to construct the internal‐rotation energy level scheme through the first five excited states. Relative to the torsional ground state, these levels occur at 11. 43, 254. 2, 370. 7, 569. 3, and 775. 9 cm− 1. A theory of internal rotation in the hydrogen peroxide molecule is developed for use in the analysis of the far‐infrared spectra. In this theory, the Hamiltonian is constructed assuming all structural distances and angles fixed except the dihedral angle x defining the relative position of the two OH bars. By the use of a contact transformation the Hamiltonian is put in the form H (asymmetric top) +H(internal rotation) where the interaction between the internal and over‐all rotations arises through the x dependence of the inertial parameters of H(asymmetric top). It is assumed that the relative position of the two OH bars is governed by a <b>potential‐energy</b> <b>function</b> of the form V(x) = V 1 cosx+V 2 cos 2 x+V 3 cos 3 xV(x) =V 1 cosx+V 2 cos 2 x+V 3 cos 3 x. The internal‐rotation wave equation [αpx 2 +V(x) ]M(x) = EM(x) [αpx 2 +V(x) ]M(x) =EM(x) is solved numerically by an electronic‐computer and the potential function parameters V 1 = 993 cm− 1, V 2 = 636 cm− 1, and V 3 = 44 cm− 1 are chosen to fit the internal‐rotation energy‐level scheme. The trans and cis potential barrier heights are 386 and 2460 cm− 1, respectively, and the potential‐function minima are located 111. 5 ° from the cis configuration. Diagonalization of the matrix of the complete Hamiltonian to second order by the use of perturbation theory is sufficient to account for the observed Q‐branch shapes in the far infrared region. Two microwave frequencies observed by Massey and Bianco at 22 054. 5 and 27 639. 6 Mc/sec are identified from their Stark effects as the first excited‐state transitions J, K, n, τ= 8, 6, 1, 1 → 7, 5, 1, 3 and J, K, n, τ= 8, 5, 1, 3 → 9, 6, 1, 1, respectively, where the internal‐rotation quantum number n= 1 denotes the first excited torsional state and where τ denotes trans symmetric (τ= 1 and 2) or antisymmetric (τ= 3 and 4) states. The form of the dipole moment operator is assumed to be μ 0 cos(x/ 2) and μ 0 is found to be 3. 15 D in agreement with the value obtained from the torsional ground‐state transitions. Two J= 0 microwave series observed by Massey, Beard, and Jen in a mixed sample of the deuterated species D 2 O 2 and HOOD give confirmation of the potential function determined from the H 2 O 2 analysis. The K= 4 → 5 series is identified as the D 2 O 2 first excited torsional state transition n= 1 → 1, τ= 4 → 2. The K= 0 → 1 series is identified as the HOOD torsional ground‐state transition n= 0 → 0, τ= 4 → 2. Only very small changes in the trans barrier height are necessary to fit the constant terms of these series exactly. These changes, which are expected to arise from vibration‐internal rotation interactions, show a reasonable progression from H 2 O 2 to D 2 O 2 : V (trans, HOOH) = 386 cm− 1, V (trans, HOOD) = 381 cm− 1 and V (trans, DOOD) = 378 cm− 1...|$|E
