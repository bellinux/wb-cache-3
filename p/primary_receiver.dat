After taking a 21–0 lead into the second quarter, the offense showed signs of sputtering; the secondteams took over for the 4thquarter.

As a result, young receivers David Ausberry and Vidal Hazelton handled the primary wide receiver duties. [...] The highlight of the Trojans offense was the running game, which rushed for 214yards while Idaho was held to 98. The role was run by committee: with the debut of redshirt freshman Stafon Johnson (64yards in 12carries, twotouchdown runs), who scored the firsttouchdown of the game, as well as C.J. Gable (68yards in eightcarries, onetouchdown reception), who made an impressive 33-yard run, and fullback Stanley Havili who made several receptions, including one for a touchdown. The game marked the debut of USC true freshman running back Joe McKnight, who made a spectacular run in the thirdquarter that was likened to those of predecessor Reggie Bush. Kristofer O'Dowd became the firsttrue freshman to start at center for the Trojans due to an injury to Matt Spanos, earning positive reviews for his performance. [...] Although the defense did not cause many turnovers and lost key linebacker Brian Cushing to an ankle sprain in the firstquarter, it met enough expectations to remain ranked among the top defenses in the country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the interference caused by a secondary system to the primary system in a cognitive radio network. We consider a secondary system deployed {{in a field of}} <b>primary</b> <b>receivers.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>receivers</b> are assumed to be distributed according to a Poisson point process with a density parameter λp. We assume that the secondary system consists of source, relay, and destination terminals, and the source terminal can communicate with the destination terminal either directly (direct mode) or using the relay (relaying mode). We derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of both modes including pathloss, shadowing and multipath fading, and validate the analytical results by simulation. We also derive analytical expressions for the maximum interference caused by both modes to the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers.</b> The results show that to achieve the same median SNR level, the relaying mode may cause less interference to the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers</b> than the direct mode in high pathloss and low shadowing conditions. However, the relaying mode has much higher interference than the direct mode if both modes have the same capacity performance. The results also show that the capacity of the relaying mode has to be reduced by about one half to provide the same level of interference as the direct mode in a typical channel environment.

40|$|In {{order to}} address the {{asynchronous}} interference issue for a generalized scenario with multiple primary and multiple secondary receivers, in this paper, we propose an innovative cooperative beamforming technique. In particular, the cooperative beamforming design is formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the weighted sum achievable transmission rate of secondary destinations while it maintains the asynchronous interferences at the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers</b> below their target thresholds. In light of the intractability of the problem, we propose a two-phase suboptimal cooperative beamforming technique. First, it finds the beamforming directions corresponding to different secondary destinations. Second, it allocates the power among different beamforming directions. Due to the multiple interference constraints corresponding to multiple <b>primary</b> <b>receivers,</b> the power allocation scheme {{in the second phase}} is still complex. Therefore, we also propose a low complex power allocation algorithm. The proposed beamforming technique is extended for the cases, when cooperating CR nodes (CCRNs) have statistical or erroneous channel knowledge of the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers.</b> We also investigate the performance of joint CCRN selection and beamforming technique. The presented numerical results show that the proposed beamforming technique can significantly reduce the asynchronous interference signals at the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers</b> and increase the sum transmission rate of secondary destinations compared to the well known zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) technique.

40|$|In this article, radio {{resource}} allocation in underlay spectrum sharing {{based on the}} orthogonal frequency-division multiple access is studied. A cellular-based secondary service is considered in which the licensed spectrum is opportunistically accessed provided that the imposed interference at the <b>primary</b> service <b>receivers</b> because of secondary service transmissions stays below an interference threshold constraint. The main objective here is to maximise the sum capacity of the secondary service and to find the optimal allocated power, subcarrier and rate across all subcarriers and different secondary users. Three different scenarios are considered based {{on the availability of}} the channel state information (CSI) between the secondary service base station and <b>primary</b> <b>receivers.</b> The optimal resource allocation for the case of accurate CSI between the secondary base station and the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers</b> is obtained. To manage more practical situations, in the second considered scenario the authors assume that only the channel distribution information information between the secondary base station and the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers</b> is available at the secondary service base station. In the third scenario the authors further propose a novel algorithm, which controls the collision incidences caused by secondary transmissions owing to lack of CSI in secondary base station.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{capacity}} gains of opportunistic spectrum-sharing channels in fading environments with imperfect channel information.

Considering average received-power constraint, we derive the ergodic and outage capacities along with their optimum power allocation policies for Rayleigh flat-fading channels, and provide closed-form expressions for these capacity metrics. We further assume that the interference power inflicted on the <b>primary's</b> <b>receiver</b> should remain below a peak threshold. Introducing the concept of interference-outage, we derive lower bounds on the ergodic and outage capacities of the channel. In addition, we obtain closed-form expressions for the expenditure-power required at the secondary transmitter to achieve the above-mentioned capacity metrics.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the optimal secondary-link {{beamforming}} pattern that balances between the SU's throughput and the interference it causes to PUs in MIMO cognitive radio networks. In particular, {{we aim to}} maximize the throughput of the SU, while keeping the interference temperature at the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers</b> below a certain threshold. Unlike traditional MIMO systems, SUs {{may not have the}} luxury of knowing the channel state information (CSI) on the links to PUs. This presents a key challenge for a secondary transmitter to steer interference away from <b>primary</b> <b>receivers.</b> In this paper, we consider three scenarios, namely when the secondary transmitter has complete, partial, or no knowledge about the channels to the <b>primary</b> <b>receivers.</b> In particular, when complete CSI is not available, the interference-temperature constraints are to be satisfied with high probability, thus resulting in chance constraints that are typically hard to deal with. Our contribution is fourfold. First, by analyzing the distributional characteristics of MIMO channels, we propose a unified homogeneous QCQP formulation that can be applied to all three scenarios. The homogeneous QCQP formulation, though non-convex, is amenable to semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation methods. Secondly, we show that the SDP relaxation admits no gap when the number of primary links is no larger than two. Thirdly, we propose a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a near-optimal solution to the QCQP problem when there are more than two primary links. Finally, we show that when the secondary transmitter has no CSI on the links to <b>primary</b> <b>receivers,</b> the optimal solution to the QCQP problem can be found by a simple matrix eigenvalue-eigenvector computation, which can be done much more efficiently than solving the QCQP directly.
