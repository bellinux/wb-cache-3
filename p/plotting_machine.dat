40|$|ILLIMAP is a {{computer-based}} {{system designed to}} construct maps of any portion {{of the state of}} Illi-nois, at any scale, {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. It also can convert locations expressed in section-township-range notation into rectangular coordinates that can then be used to plot maps with a n incre-mental <b>plotting</b> <b>machine.</b> ILLIMAP has three features not normally found in other mapping systems: (1) all section corners are located in accurate relation to their position on the ground, as depicted by U. S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps; (2) only the four section corners of the section in which a point is to be located are needed in calculating a location; and (3) any point or location in Illinois having a legal description (section-township-range notation) — such a s oil wells, coal mine shafts, sampling locations, highway cuts, and pipeline pumping stations — may be plotted. Coordinate values are in the Lambert Conformal Conic Projection. The system has been designed to help the Ill-inois State Geological Survey present geologic and mineralogic data. However, it may be useful to those outside the Survey who wish to construct maps of Ill-inois or to create a similar mapping system...|$|E

All carbon fiber composites used in today 2 ̆ 7 s applications are manufactured through a molding or extrusion manufacturing process. The finished product is normally not machined. However there are instances where machining to a finished size is desirable. ^ This research is focused on determining the strength and micro-structural characteristics of Uni-Directional vinyl ester-carbon fibre rod after machining with a carbide insert. This study examined the surface fractures, and the micro-structural changes before and after machining the carbon fibre rod. As part of the study, the tensile strength of the carbon fibre rod after machining was observed and stress and strain graphs were <b>plotted.</b> The <b>machining</b> of the carbon fibre was performed with cold compressed air as the coolant and a carbide insert having a trade name of Sandvik was utilized to perform the turning operations. ^ The study was conducted to determine, whether machined vinyl ester-carbon fibre rod retains a tensile strength comparable to virgin solid carbon fibre rod.

40|$|Authors of {{eighteenth-century}} narratives often compared their <b>plots</b> to <b>machines.</b> They used mechanical metaphors {{because in}} the wake of the scientific revolution the machine became the dominant model for understanding the organization of nature and because machines were becoming increasingly prominent in everyday cultural life. But the idea that the world was a great piece of clockwork in which human beings were so many cogs and wheels challenged both traditional religious conceptions of the freedom of the will and newer political principles protecting the right of the individual to resist the domination of absolute power. As a result, many of the important innovations in narrative form that came to define the novel as a genre in the eighteenth century resulted from attempts to reconcile the contradictions between notions of individual freedom and the new mechanical understanding of nature. In her novels of intrigue written in the early eighteenth century, for example, Eliza Haywood adopted a Hobbesian ontology of mechanistic materialism but sought to contain its dangerously libertine tendencies by emphasizing the deliberative freedom of her heroines in the scenes of their seduction. Henry Fielding 2 ̆ 7 s Tom Jones, meanwhile, though celebrated for its “clockwork” form, was in fact written as a response to the mechanization of the theatre by pantomimes, which seemed to be threatening the professional integrity of actors and authors and the illusion of authenticity in the human subjects they portrayed. In Tristram Shandy likewise, Laurence Sterne repeatedly invoked machines as metaphors for narrative, but then showed that the “sunshine” and “soul” of the reading experience was to be found in those moments when the narrative machine broke down into digressions. Finally, the supernatural machinery of Gothic fiction was designed to trigger a set of internal mechanisms in the mind, but the readers of Ann Radcliffe 2 ̆ 7 s novels were also meant to reflect on the means by which the despotic power of the culture industry could exploit these mechanisms in order to place limits on human freedom and philosophical enquiry. ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{vibration}} analysis instruments today utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) {{which is}} a special case of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform and converts the vibration signal from its time domain representation to its equivalent frequency domain representation. However, frequency analysis (sometimes called Spectral Analysis or Vibration Signature Analysis) is {{only one aspect of}} interpreting the information contained in a vibration signal. Frequency analysis tends to be most useful on machines that employ rolling element bearings and whose main failure modes tend to be the degradation of those bearings, which typically exhibit an increase in characteristic frequencies associated with the bearing geometries and constructions. Depending on the type of machine, its typical malfunctions, the bearing types employed, rotational speeds, and other factors, the CM specialist may use additional diagnostic tools, such as examination of the time domain signal, the phase relationship between vibration components and a timing mark on the machine shaft (often known as a keyphasor), historical trends of vibration levels, the shape of vibration, and numerous other aspects of the signal along with other information from the process such as load, bearing temperatures, flow rates, valve positions and pressures to provide an accurate diagnosis. This is particularly true of machines that use fluid bearings rather than rolling-element bearings.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This study compares {{production}} {{rates and}} costs for four ground skidding machines and for four harvesting treatments. The four machine types studied were a Caterpillar 060 crawler (060), Caterpillar 518 rubber tired skidder (RTS), FMC 200 CA (FMC), and International TD- 8 E crawler (TD- 8 E). Two treatments, conventional/whole tree and designated/tree length, were studied, and two, Conventional/tree length and designated/whole tree, were determined through {{the regression analysis}} and statistical inference. Conventional versus designated refers to skid road location and restriction to, while whole tree versus tree length refers to whether the skidded trees contained limbs and tops or not. The study took place in northern Idaho. The stand was two-storied and the overstory was removed to release the advanced understory. The overstory averaged s trees per acre and contained 23. 0 cunits (gross) per acre. Two operators were time studied {{for each of the}} four machine types to help eliminate operator influence and produce more meaningful comparisons. Eight operators, 483 hours of detailed time study, and 2, 270 cunits skidded allowed for many delays and all significant variables to be averaged over machine types and treatments. Regression analysis was used to develop equations to predict delay free elemental times. Indicator variables were employed to determine significant differences between conventional and designated skid roads and between whole tree and tree length skidding. In addition, significance was determined between independent variables. Delay free turn time was calculated by summing the predicted elemental times. At an average residual skidding distance of 530 feet, the study average, dollars per cunit for conventional/whole tree were calculated to be: D 6 D, 27. 60; RTS, 19. 00; FMC, 36. 30; TD- 8 E, 27. 70 and for designated/tree length: D 60, 27. 10; RTS, 21. 50; FMC, 31. 40; TD- 8 E, 29. 30. For all skidding distances and both studied treatments, the RTS was the most economical machine type. The FMC was the most expensive, and this is attributed to the low observed mechanical availability and high operating costs. The D 6 Dand TD- 8 E were midway in costs. Lower initial and operating costs made the TD- 8 E more economical than the D 6 D for distances less than 500 feet for conventional/whole tree and for distances less than 275 feet for designated/tree length. Designated/tree length was more economical than conventional/whole tree for the D 6 D and FMC but not for the RTS and TD- 8 E. The main reason was that a significant increase in pieces per turn for the D 6 D and FMC offset the additional sawyer costs required to produce the tree length pieces. The RTS and TD- 8 E showed no increase in pieces per turn. Just the restriction to skid roads (designated/whole tree versus conventional/whole tree) is expected to influence costs per cunit by: 060, + 0. 40; RTS, + 0. 40; FMC, - 0. 50; TD- 8 E, + 0. 20. Mortality and damage to the advanced regeneration was shown to be related to machine impact (visual signs of machine activity within an 1 / 200 th acre plot).
