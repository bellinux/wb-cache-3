50|$|Decorative {{laminates}} {{were made}} by impregnating large sheets of kraft paper with phenolic resin, which was then partially cured (B-staged by passing through a long drying oven) and cut to sheet lengths at the oven exit. The dry treated sheets were stiff and somewhat brittle. A decorative sheet (solid colored, or wood-grained, or patterned), impregnated with melamine resin and B-staged and cut to length {{in a similar manner}} to the phenolic core sheets, was laid on a polished stainless steel <b>press</b> <b>plate.</b> Then several plies or layers of kraft paper impregnated with a phenolic resin were placed on top of the decorative layer. The number of plies of kraft used yielded products of varying thickness depending upon end-use requirements. Next, a sheet of release paper that would not bond to the phenolic resin was placed on top of the phenolic kraft and following this a mirror image build-up of the assembly already on the <b>press</b> <b>plate.</b> Finally, another polished stainless steel <b>press</b> <b>plate</b> was placed on top of the pack assembly. On {{the other side of this}} plate another similar assembly was built until there were several laminates in one press pack to go into a single opening in the hydraulic press. The huge hydraulic presses, perhaps 5 feet by 12 feet, had many heated openings thus many laminates could be produced in a single press cycle of about one hour duration. Great pressure (in excess of 1000 psi and heat to 150 degrees Celsius) were applied to each press pack. The B-staged melamine and phenolic resins first flowed to bond the interlaminar plies together, then the plastic resins thermoset to provide a very durable product that could tolerate much heat and abrasion.|$|E
50|$|A variant {{was to use}} a {{slightly}} roughened steel sheet atop the cover sheet, producing a laminate with a matte surface. A similar effect can be achieved using various types of release paper between the steel <b>press</b> <b>plate</b> and the decorative melamine surface.Some users considered this more attractive than the gleaming, absolutely flat surface created by the highly polished stainless steel separators. After being removed from the press, the individual laminates were sanded on the phenolic kraft side to a uniform thickness. This sanding operation also increased the back surface area so the more secure bonding to a substrate such as a kitchen counter could be achieved.|$|E
50|$|Single-8 cartridges, {{without a}} <b>press</b> <b>plate,</b> {{are of a}} {{different}} design from a Super 8 cartridge, resembling a cassette-style design (supply and take-up reels side by side) as opposed to Super 8's coaxial cartridge design (one reel {{on top of the}} other). Therefore, Single-8 film cartridges can only be used in Single-8 cameras. However, the film loaded in a Single-8 cartridge has exactly the same dimensions as Super 8 (though it is made of a thinner and stronger polyester base, rather than the acetate base of Super 8 film), and can be viewed in any Super 8 projector after processing. However, Fuji recommended that only tape splices be used when combining Single-8 footage with Super-8, as cement would cause damage to the Single-8 footage. Also, when jammed, Single-8 footage had a tendency to stretch in the projector, unlike the acetate-based Super-8 film, which simply broke.|$|E

The developed method permits to obtain desired temperature profiles {{on the surface of the}} <b>press</b> <b>plates</b> through two main steps. The first step consists in finding out an appropriate parametric curve that defines the spatial location of the heating sources into the thickness of the <b>press</b> heating <b>plates.</b> The second step uses an inverse method that combines a stochastic optimization algorithm in conjunction with finite element simulations. This second step serves for the adjustment of the position curve parameters to obtain a simulated temperature profile as close as possible to the expected one at the <b>press</b> <b>plates</b> surface. This easy-to-implement approach is shown to be very effective to rapidly obtain a suitable location of the heat sources that minimizes energy consumption...|$|R

Because of an increasing interest in biodegradable renewable composites reinforced with plant fiber, wood plastic composite (WPC) {{come out with}} characteristic as a green composite which is biodegradable. WPC is made of wood fiber, recycle polypropylene and coupling agent. For optimizing the impact of mechanical and physical properties on WPC, three most important variables including fiber length, coupling agent, orientation of fiber were investigated. Extrusion and hot <b>press</b> <b>plate</b> are the processes involve in this experiment to produce WPC. Then, WPC will go through four testing which are Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetry Analysis (TGA), Tensile and Flexural testing. Based on the result obtained, the relation of fiber length is directly proportional to tensile strength and stress transfer. Furthermore, the parallel orientation {{is the best of}} fiber orientation that will increase the mechanical properties besides coupling agent at 4 % will achieve optimum level to increase the strength bonding between wood fibers and polypropylene.

40|$|To analyze color {{errors and}} their {{sources in the}} color {{reproduction}} process, the reproduction is visually evaluated and compared visually with the original scene color scales and also with the original transparency viewed on a variable brightness illuminator (D 5000) with an opaque reflective white surround. Graphs (<b>press</b> <b>plate</b> curves, single color proofs and END of single color proofs) {{have been added to}} the Kodak tone-reproduction diagram (1960) to obtain more complete steps in the analysis of the tone-reproduction and the color balance. The GATF Evaluation Method of Ink Color is tested and the GARC colorimetric system, which is a modified Adam’s chromatic value system, is used to analyze colorimetric measurement. The slightly dark reproduction, the shift of the color balance to bluish cyan in the reproduction; the shift of hues, the magenta toward red, the cyan and the green toward blue; and the desaturation of the blue, the cyan and the yellow are discovered as errors in the reproduction. The possible improvements of these errors are discussed. The hope to combine the tone-reproduction analysis, the GATF Evaluation of Ink Color and the GARC colorimetric system into one system of analysis of the color errors is not fulfilled, because the mask percentages obtained from the Evaluation of Ink Color do not agree with that of the reproduction process and the hue error and grayness of the Evaluation of Ink Color do not correspond with the visual hue and the color saturation. However, the results of the colorimetric analysis, such as hue errors and the saturation of reproduced color, correspond quite well to the visual evaluation and the results of the tone-reproduction of the colorimetric analysis can be related to the reproduction process. It is concluded that great benefit is obtained by using the three systems; the subjective evaluation, the tone-reproduction analysis and the GARC colorimetric system for the analysis of the color reproduction process...|$|E
40|$|Historically the {{producers}} of collotype printing have been secretive and taken a proprietary attitude toward the production of collotype prints. Therefore, knowledge about and information on {{the growth of the}} collotype industry has been minimal. Although the collotype process produces prints that are amoung the most beautiful and delicate of any graphic arts medium, collotypes presently are rarely produced commercially or even as an artistic medium. Eventually, the making of collotypes will be a lost art. The primary objective of this thesis was to produce a portfolio of photographic images which illustrates all of the production steps in the making of a collotype print. Included with the photographic essay is a condensed history of collotype, a technical review of the collotype printing process, and analysis of the present state of collotype printing. This thesis endeavors to ensure that the techniques used to produce collotype prints are accurately documented. In addition, the thesis presents an illustrated record of the contemporary collotype printing process. To ensure the proper procedures and techniques necessary to produce a quality collotype print, a collaboration with an expert collotype printer was initiated. Thus, the collotype printing and subsequent photographic documentation was done with Kent Kirby at his Light-print Press in Alma, Michigan. Kirby {{is one of a handful}} of individuals working in collotype today, and his studio is one of the last remaining collotype studios in the world. He is an expert collotype printmaker and the author of Studio Collotype, (1988) the most comprehensive manual on collotype printing. Though his book contains extensive information about collotype, it lacks a visual narrative of the collotype process. In addition to the photographic documentation, there is a written description of the collotype printing process. This includes sections on the <b>press,</b> <b>plate</b> preparation, plate exposure, substrate information, printing techniques, ink and its application, and dampening solutions. This thesis project also includes a historical background of the process and an analysis concerning the state of contemporary collotype for commercial and artistic applications. The research includes information gathered during interviews with expert contemporary collotype printers such as Kent Rush of the University of Texas, San Antonio, James Hajicek of Arizona State University and Kent Kirby. In addition, interviews were conducted with Michael Intrator of Black Box Collotype, Andre DePolo of Alinari Archive, Florence, Italy, Ms. Leibiger of Lichtdruck Grafisches Zentrum fur Druckkunst, Dresden, Germany, and Tom Reardon, formerly with The Jaffe Heliochrome Press, New York as to their insight into the demise of the commercial collotype. The backbone of this thesis project is a portfolio of eighteen original black-and-white matted and mounted silver prints that photographically document the collotype process. In addition to the documentary photographs, the portfolio also contains an original photograph and an original collotype reproduction. These two images enable the reader to compare the original silver print photograph and a photomechanical reproduction of it...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Zirconium <b>press</b> <b>plates</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for the production of melamine coated particle board, using shot-peening to achieve the desired plate (and therefore coated particle board) surface texture. Service temperatures of the <b>press</b> <b>plates</b> approach 200 °C. This study examined the microstructural effects of extended exposure of shot-peened zirconium to temperatures of 200 °C and 300 °C. Softening of the surface may reduce wear resistance and possibly the surface morphology of the plate, affecting the usability of the plates. It was discovered that the shot-peened surface of the plates experienced a loss in hardness from approximately 230 VHN (DPH) to about 220 VHN after 560 hrs at 200 °C. The same drop in hardness was experienced after only 5. 5 hrs at 300 °C. This decrease in hardness was determined from hardness profiles before and after heat treating the zirconium to various times from 0. 5 hours to 4458 hrs and 2790 hrs at 200 °C and 300 °C respectively. The decrease in hardness is believed to be a result of static recovery, the annihilation of point and/or line defects and/or alignment of dislocations into relatively low misorientation substantially relatively close to the shot-peened surface (about 35 μm), and decreased more modestly over the next 100 μm until virtually no drop was experienced further than approximately 150 μm from the surface. The shot-peening hardens the surface region which extends about 150 μm from the surface. Thus, the level of recovery appears to depend on the stored energy associated with cold work, or ambient temperature deformation. This increases from about 2 - 3...|$|R
