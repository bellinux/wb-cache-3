40|$|A <b>Priority</b> <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> is a {{hardware}} designed chip which {{acts as an}} overall system manager to efficiently handle the multiple interrupts that tend to occur from the varied number of peripheral devices. Hence, it relieves the system‟s CPU from the task of polling in a multilevel priority system. This paper deals with implementation of a <b>Priority</b> <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> using Verilog language. During the implementation, the Verilog code has been written for all the internal registers of the <b>Priority</b> <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> {{so that it can}} accomplish its task of prioritizing the various interrupts and thereby increasing the efficiency of the processor. In this paper the entire functional block was sub divided into various modules like vector address module, command register module, mask register module and finally it was integrated into a single unit to accomplish specified tasks. In the present work the <b>Priority</b> <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> was made to operate in three different modes-Fully Nested Mode, Rotatin...|$|E

50|$|An Interrupt Request Level (IRQL) is a {{hardware}} independent means with which Windows prioritizes interrupts {{that come from}} the system's processors. On processor architectures which Windows runs on, hardware generates signals which are sent to an <b>interrupt</b> <b>controller.</b> The <b>interrupt</b> <b>controller</b> sends an <b>interrupt</b> request (or IRQ) to the CPU with a certain priority level, and the CPU sets a mask which causes any other interrupts with a lower priority {{to be put into}} a pending state, until the CPU releases control back to the <b>interrupt</b> <b>controller.</b> If a signal comes in at a higher priority, then the current interrupt will be put into a pending state, the CPU sets the interrupt mask to the priority and places any interrupts with a lower priority into a pending state until the CPU finishes handling the new, higher <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt.</b>|$|R

50|$|In computing, Intel's Advanced Programmable <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> (APIC) is {{a family}} of <b>interrupt</b> <b>controllers.</b> As its name suggests, the APIC is more {{advanced}} than Intel's 8259 Programmable <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> (PIC), particularly enabling the construction of multiprocessor systems.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> is {{designed}} to interface with the AMBA bus. It can make the system more efficient and more responsive to critical events. <b>Interrupt</b> <b>controller</b> {{is designed}} {{with the concept of}} priority for immediate selection of peripherals which requires attention or service. The interrupt is necessary for any embedded processor based SOC design that is running a Real Time Operating System. The <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> is fully scalable to support 32 interrupt sources and provides a programmable interrupt register which can be used to generate an interrupt under software control. Daisy chain concept is used to cascade the <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> {{to increase the number of}} inputs.

25|$|Hardware {{interrupts}} are signalled to the CPU {{using three}} inputs that encode the highest pending <b>interrupt</b> <b>priority.</b> A separate Encoder is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems {{that do not}} require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of additional software complexity.

50|$|The 8061 had an 8-channel {{vectored}} <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt</b> system. The later 8065 provided 40 channels, {{of which}} 32 were tied into the HSI/HSO event system.|$|R
50|$|The Intel 8259 is a Programmable <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Controller</b> (PIC) {{designed}} for the Intel 8085 and Intel 8086 microprocessors. The initial part was 8259, a later A suffix version was upward compatible and usable with the 8086 or 8088 processor. The 8259 combines multiple interrupt input sources into a single interrupt output to the host microprocessor, extending the interrupt levels available in a system beyond {{the one or two}} levels found on the processor chip. The 8259A was the <b>interrupt</b> <b>controller</b> for the ISA bus in the original IBM PC and IBM PC AT.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{programmable}} <b>interrupt</b> <b>controllers</b> that provide dedicated input capture pins and a programmable counter along with it. These pins generate <b>interrupts</b> to the <b>controller,</b> which then executes an interrupt service routine.

50|$|The design {{philosophy}} of the Propeller is that a hard real-time multi-core architecture negates the need for dedicated interrupt hardware and support in assembly. In traditional CPU architecture, external interrupt lines are fed to an on-chip <b>interrupt</b> <b>controller</b> and are serviced {{by one or more}} interrupt service routines. When an interrupt occurs, the <b>interrupt</b> <b>controller</b> suspends normal CPU processing and saves internal state (typically on the stack), then vectors to the designated interrupt service routine. After handling the interrupt, the service routine executes a return from interrupt instruction which restores the internal state and resumes CPU processing.|$|R

50|$|In computing, {{interrupt}} latency is {{the time}} that elapses from when an interrupt is generated to when {{the source of the}} interrupt is serviced. For many operating systems, devices are serviced as soon as the device's interrupt handler is executed. Interrupt latency may be affected by microprocessor design, <b>interrupt</b> <b>controllers,</b> <b>interrupt</b> masking, and the operating system's (OS) interrupt handling methods.|$|R
