60|$|During that year, Frank was {{to remain}} at the office in London; his {{employers}} being informed beforehand that family circumstances prevented his accepting their offer of employment in China. He was to consider this concession as {{a recognition of the}} attachment between Magdalen and himself, on certain terms only. If, during the year of probation, he failed to justify the confidence placed in him--a confidence which had led Mr. Vanstone to take unreservedly upon himself the whole responsibility of Frank's future prospects--the marriage scheme was to be considered, from that moment, as at an end. If, on the other hand, the result to which Mr. Vanstone confidently looked forward really occurred--if Frank's <b>probationary</b> <b>year</b> proved his claim to the most precious trust that could be placed in his hands--then Magdalen herself should reward him with all that a woman can bestow; and the future, which his present employers had placed before him {{as the result of a}} five years' residence in China, should be realized in one year's time, by the dowry of his young wife.|$|E

50|$|The {{sales of}} 186,000 season tickets, {{which was not}} even reached by all federal horticultural shows, the number of 8.1 million visitors, {{and the removal of}} the Luisenpark fence, {{convinced}} the city council to operate the Luisenpark as city park with entrance fee. However, on October 21, 1975, the decision for a closed Luisenpark with entrance fee fell. It was agreed to have two <b>probationary</b> <b>years</b> (Probejahre) of free entrance, but over 38,000 maps sold yearly demonstrated a convincing argument to maintain the free entrance to the park.|$|R

50|$|A travel {{grant of}} the Polytechnikum {{allowed him to}} earn a doctorate, {{possible}} in those days at universities only. On 1 April 1885 Witting commenced his <b>probationary</b> <b>year</b> as teacher at the Thomasschule in Leipzig, {{and at the same}} time he attended courses and seminars at the university of Leipzig, esp. under Felix Klein, from whom he also received the topic for his dissertation. On 4 August 1886 he was accredited with a PhD at the Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen, the new work-place of Felix Klein.|$|E
50|$|He had {{inherited}} {{much of his}} father's character, and his lifestyle was such that, although he was successful in gaining an Oriel fellowship, {{at the close of}} the <b>probationary</b> <b>year</b> (1820) he was judged to have forfeited it, mainly on the grounds of intemperance. The authorities would not reverse their decision; but they awarded him a gift of £300. This incident deeply saddened his father, who did everything he could to try to get the decision reversed, but without success. Hartley suffered from a dependency on alcohol for the rest of his life.|$|E
50|$|After a <b>probationary</b> <b>year</b> 1869/1870 at {{the high}} school of Bonn, he worked {{at the high}} school of Krefeld (at least to 1878) and then at the Realprogymnasium in Bonn. In the {{hope to be able to}} change to a high school career at the {{mathematical}} faculty at the University of Bonn he sent a habilitation document. The faculty approved his plan but it failed because of the Berlin government for reasons unconnected with the subject. A later attempt to receive a lectureship at the technical University of Braunschweig also failed. From 1893 to 1911 he was working as a high school professor at Trier until his retirement.|$|E
50|$|The team's next {{head coach}} was former Oregon head coach Rich Brooks, {{who was hired}} in December 2002.

Brooks also led the football team to its first bowl game since 1999 and its first bowl game victory since 1984, as Kentucky defeated the Clemson University Tigers 28-20 in the Music City Bowl. In 2007, the Wildcats were ranked 8th in the nation before a loss to South Carolina on October 4. After the loss to South Carolina, Kentucky bounced back on October 13 to defeat No. 1 LSU in a historic triple overtime game.|$|R

50|$|Grierson {{was born}} in Glenageary, County Dublin. His father and {{grandfather}} (George Grierson) were well-known Dublin printers and publishers. His mother Isabella {{was the daughter of}} Henry Ruxton of Ardee. He was educated at St. Bees School, Cumberland and Trinity College, Dublin, where he was a student of mathematics. Grierson qualified for the Indian Civil Service in 1871 ranking twenty-eighth for the year. He continued studies at Trinity College for two <b>probationary</b> <b>years</b> where he was influenced by Robert Atkinson, professor of oriental languages. He took a deep interest in languages, won prizes for studies in Sanskrit and Hindustani before leaving for the Bengal Presidency in 1873. First posted to Bankipore in Bihar, he became Magistrate and Collector at Patna and still later in 1896, Opium Agent for Bihar.

50|$|After {{attending}} Gymnasium in Zittau between 1876 and 1885, {{he studied}} mathematics and physics in Leipzig (with one semester in 1886 in Freiburg im Breisgau) until 1890. After a <b>probationary</b> <b>year</b> {{as a teacher}} at Nikolaigymnasium in Leipzig he taught from 1891 to 1898 at various schools in Pirna, Dresden, Keilhau near Rudolstadt, Löbau and Meerane. Frequent changes, often between very different school types, indicate that he {{found it difficult to}} gain ground in his profession. His first scientific publication, a voluminous review of Ernst Schröder's lectures on the Algebra of Logic, fell into this time (finished 1893). From 1898 till his retirement in 1924 he taught at Realschule Plauen.|$|E

In the following interval, while he fulfilled his period of regency, {{he served as a}} prefect of the Jesuit boarding school at Verdun (1615-16) and teacher at the Collège in Amiens (1616-19). After finishing his study of theology he taught philosophy and the sciences at the Collège de Clermont (1623-26), and did his tertianship, a third <b>probationary</b> <b>year</b> of the Society of Jesus, at Rouen (1626-27), after which he was allowed to profess the fourth vow specific to the Society of Jesus.|$|E

Finally, on 1 April 1899, he became a professor and director at the Osnabrück Realgymnasium (now named the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Gymnasium).

60|$|Meanwhile these daily visits of Espinosa's, and {{the long}} hours he spent in Anne's company gave, as was inevitable, rise to scandal, within and without the convent. She was a nun professed, interdicted from seeing any man but her confessor other than through the parlour grating, and even then not at such length or with such {{constancy}} as this. The intimacy between them--fostered and furthered by Frey Miguel--had so ripened {{in a few weeks}} that Anne was justified in looking upon him as her saviour from the living tomb to which she had been condemned, in hoping that he would restore her to the life and liberty for which she had ever yearned by taking her to Queen when his time came to claim his own. What if she was a nun professed? Her profession had been against her will, preceded by only one year of novitiate, and she was still within the five <b>probationary</b> <b>years</b> prescribed. Therefore, in her view, her vows were revocable.|$|R

For the subsequent formation period of his regency, he taught the lower classes at the college in Nevers (1612-15), then studied theology at La Flèche (1615-19).
