40|$|Firms seek <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> {{by hiring}} {{politicians}} and ex-bureaucrats as top executives in China, especially in privately controlled firms. One unintended consequence of establishing <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> is management entrenchment. Political connected CEOs have smaller equity holding than CEOs without <b>political</b> background. <b>Political</b> <b>connection</b> significantly lowers the CEO turnover probability and turnover-performance sensitivity. Firm performance improves after political connected CEOs are replaced, particularly if replaced by new ones not politically connected.

5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, {{it is thought}} that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of the}} first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and <b>political</b> <b>connections,</b> before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and <b>political</b> <b>connections</b> Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> of corporations {{and the impact of}} such connection on corporate governance in Hong Kong. Corporate governance is important to Hong Kong, which positions itself as an international financial centre, and corporate <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> is a widely concerned issue bearing potentially significant impacts on corporate governance. However, rarely has local past research drawn a link between corporate <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> and corporate governance. It is hoped that through a detailed study of the topic, the current corporate governance problems incurred by the <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> of the business sector in Hong Kong can be better understood, managed, and resolved. It is also hoped that the research effort of this study can help to fill the gap of the existing literature. This study is both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative analysis was conducted to test the various characteristics of politically connected companies as opposed to unconnected companies. The qualitative part of the analysis focused on three in-depth case studies based on documentary evidence from multiple sources. The two complementary analyses provided multi-perspective exploration into the topic. The statistical findings confirmed that more influential local companies in terms of scale, ownership mode and industry type are more connected with politics. The case studies revealed how local corporate governance has been adversely affected by increasing corporate <b>political</b> <b>connection.</b> While highlighting corporate governance problems brought about by corporate <b>political</b> <b>connection,</b> this study affirms the necessity of the connection from a cultural and political point of view. Political-legal mechanisms are recommended for monitoring government-corporate interactions to ensure that all corporate stakeholders and the society as a whole can benefit from a healthy and constructive corporate governance culture.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the audit pricing {{literature}} by examining whether institutional investors and <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> are associated with higher audit fees. Design/methodology/approach – Both descriptive and multivariate analyses are employed to address the research objectives.

Findings – Based on a panel analysis of 390 Malaysian firms from 1999 to 2003, a positive relationship between institutional ownership and audit fees is found, although the economic impact is minimal. Further, the authors find that audit fees are higher for politically connected firms. Research limitations/implications – A thorough examination on the role of <b>political</b> <b>connection</b> is much warranted to provide a better understanding on such connection influences the audit market.
