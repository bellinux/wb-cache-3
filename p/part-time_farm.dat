Employment in two* or several sectors of activity m most cases occurs as an economic necessity of rural households and affects the productive orientation of part-time farms: as a rule their market ability diminishes, they chiefly produce food for their own requirements, and their size becomes adjusted to the family members who stay on the farm as the basic manpower, i. e. women and old men. As regards the structure of spending, these households do not differ much from urban households i most of their income is spent on improving accommodation and acquiring labour-saving devices and only a small proportion of their income is invested in improving the farm.

How taxfilers use these plans, therefore, is an interesting area for investigation. This study focusses on a specific group of taxfilers, namely, farm producers. It describes RRSP contribution habits by farm producers from two points of view. First, it compares farmers with other groups of workers. Second, it takes {{a closer look at}} the specific situation of farm producers by exploring a number of characteristics specific to this group. The main results indicate that farm producers are among those who use RRSPs least, and who contribute the smallest amounts to RRSPs. The data also indicate, however, that farm producers who do contribute to RRSPs take full advantage of the opportunities provided by this tool. Like other workers, Canadian farm producers are most likely to contribute to RRPS when their incomes are higher and as they approach retirement age. The farm producer's province is another variable (albeit less important than the first two) that explains RRSP contribution habits. When full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>farm</b> producers are examined separately, part-time producers are found to contribute to RRSPs more frequently and in larger amounts than their full-time colleagues.

40|$|Regional {{conditions}} of agriculture {{have been investigated}} every five years by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Japan and the statistic data were published as agricultural censuses. In this study, the data obtained in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1995 were used for finding regional agricultural characteristics of 58 towns (administrative districts) in Oita Prefecture. Total land areas of this prefecture are 6, 338 km^ 2 and about 76 km^ 2 are used for agricultural production. Most of the remaining parts are composed of mountainous area. 1) As a result of statistic principal component analysis, {{the first and second}} principal components are considered to make sense. The first principal component has characteristics expressing the activity level of agriculture. From the distribution pattern of the calculated scores, 58 towns in Oita Prefecture are found to be classified into five distinct groups according to the agricultural activity. 2) The regional characteristics of active level of agriculture were proved to depend on inter relationships between the variables. Among the variables, the scale of cultivated lands, the number of workers and the amount of agricultural income in each farmhouse have related most to the first principal component score. It was supposed that the present agricultural conditions could be grasped by means of the analysis stated above. 3) The variations of active level and statistic data of agriculture for time series showed that the five regional groups in Oita Prefecture have changed with different style during these 15 years. It is effective to analyze the causative variables in the long time course for studying the regional activating technique. 4) From the analysis of correlation between the topographic conditions and agricultural statistic data, it was clarified that the highest land levels of agricultural land in each district were closely related to the factors of the number of farm households possessing large scale cultivated lands and the number of <b>part-time</b> <b>farm</b> households having more agricultural income than non-farm income. The high regression coefficient showed that the topographic conditions obviously affect the agricultural activities. 大分県 58 市町村について 1980 年から 1995 年の農業センサスのデータを用いて地域農業の分析を行った. 1) 主成分分析を行った結果,第 2 主成分まで主成分の意味を読み取ることができた. そのうち第 1 主成分は地域農業やその担い手の活発さを示す特性値であり,このスコアを用いて農業生産活動の活性度の評価を行った. その結果, 5 つの地域性が表れた. 2) 5 地域別に農業の活性度に寄与する要因について検討を行うと,スコアの大小を決定している変量は地域によって異なることが判明した. また,活性度が高い地域は耕地面積が広く,農業担い手が多く,農業収入が多いなどの変量の値が押し並べて高いことが明らかとなった. つまり,ここでいう農業の活性度が高いという意味は,農業生産活動が全般にわたり活発であるということが判明した. 3) 5 地域別に,農業の活性度の時系列変動を検討した結果,各地域の変動もそれぞれ異なる変量の増減により生じたことが判明した. すなわち農業の活性度の動向にも地域性があり,その原動となっている変量を検討することがその地域の農業の活性化を図る際に有効であると推察される. 4) 地理的要因と営農に関する因子との相関分析を行った結果,標高が高いほど広い耕地面積を持つ農家及び農業収入の割合が高い 1 種兼業農家が増加することが明らかとなった. このように,地理的要因は営農に関する因子に影響を及ぼし,農業の活性度と深い関係をもつと考えられる...|$|E
40|$|This microsociological {{research}} on the attitude of farmers towards land consolidation {{is the part of}} a wider, more complex project about the drainage regulation of the river Sava. The research took place in the area of Črnec Polje, and plot 10. The sample included 13 villages from the communities of Čazma, Dugo Selo, Ivanić Grad and Sisak, and the total of 102 rural households — 51 full-time and 51 <b>part-time</b> <b>farm</b> households. The interviewees were heads of the sample households. The following specific goals were to be established through that research: socio-demographic and productional characteristics of the farm households, the level of knowledge of the farmers about the planned carrying out of land consolidation, their general attitudes towards land consolidation, their expectations of land redistribution and hydromelioration, as well as their perception about the social action directed towards the improvement of land arrangement. It was established that the interviewed farmers have generally a positive attitude towards land consolidation, as to one of the necessary steps in the wider hydroameliorational project. However, this positive attitude, existing at the global level, moderates, when their own households are in question. In this case, the farmers condition their positive determination for land consolidation as well as their readiness for cooperation with the local authorities on the »fulfillment of the promise« by the land consolidation organizer, on the covering of the costs by the society, on the higher level of information regarding the procedure and conditions of land consolidation, {{as well as on the}} socially guaranteed usefulness of this action. This means, that for farmers the general social benefit of land redistribution is obvious, however, they are not inclined to accept it a priori, and to submit themselves to the new working and earning conditions. For the respondents, it is hard, from the perspective of the familiar productional procedure on their own farms, to see the advantages of the new, for them essentially different, productional process. The benefits of productional reorientation, which is necessarily to take place upon the completed land redistribution and hydromelioration, are at the present moment still not fully comprehensible and understandable for the farmers. Therefore, they declare themselves for firmer cooperation between the social representatives and the participants in rationalization of land holding. They, themselves, wish to participate more actively and equally, not only in the carrying out of land consolidation, but also in the planning of the total hydroameliorational project and in the realization of its particular phases...|$|E

We also identify socioeconomic factors that determine these shifts. The empirical study is based on discrete time hazard approaches, using micro-level panel data from Zhejiang, Hubei, and Yunnan provinces from 1995 to 2002. Estimation results suggest relatively high chances of shifts from full-time to <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> and a considerable lower risk for the shift in the opposite direction. Significant negative duration dependence is found for the move from full-time to <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> suggesting lock-in effects.

40|$|In {{this study}} the authors gives an {{analysis}} of the works which have been written by Yugoslav authors since the war and which deal with part-time farms and peasants,/workers. These works consist chiefly of articles published in periodicals, of analyses of statistical material, and of reports on various investigations. Some of the works also contain casual observations relating to these subjects. Parttime farms and peasants/workers {{have been the subject of}} many publications of Yugoslav economists, sociologists, demographers, geographers, agriculturalists, etc. The study is divided into six chapters. At the beginning of the first chapter the author states that most of the works he has studied appear to accept uncritically the definition of official statistics. According to that definition a <b>part-time</b> <b>farm</b> is any farm from the household of which one or several members work on the farm permanently. Pointing to the limitations of this definition, the author recalls the views of certain authors who have devoted more attention to this question and have tried to work out their own definitions of the concept (Stane Krašovec, Cvetko Kostić and Stipe šuvar). In the second chapter the author describes the causes of the emergence of part-time farms. He divides them into two basic groups: (1) causes deriving from agriculture or what are called internal reasons; and (2) causes outside agriculture or what are called external causes. He emphasizes that this is only a conditional classification, because in most cases the causes are closely interlinked. Among the most important causes in the first group the author lists the following: small size of holdings, rural overpopulation, large size of rural families, divisions of small-holding, etc. The most important causes in the second group are industrial development, low personal incomes, the various benefits deriving from regular employment, good communication links between settlements, the slow advance of urban development in comparison with de-agrarization, etc. The author finds that in the works analysed these causes are inadequately interconnected and that they are not classified according to their respective importance. At the same time he points to certain possibilities for working out a classification of the causes of the emergence of part-time farms. In the third chapter the author analyses the demographic, social, productive and economic characteristics of part-time farms, dealing in closer detail with the characteristics of the production and economy of part-time farms such as a growing orientation of these farms towards livestock growing, less investment in farming, inferior farming equipment in comparison with purely agricultural households, a tendency towards selling or renting farm land, a tendency among peasants/ workers to spend money on improving their living conditions, etc. In the fourth chapter the author quotes some characteristic views on peasants/ workers chiefly from the works of S. Livada, C. Kostić and S. Krašovec. The fifth chapter discusses the importance of part-time farms and peasants/ workers in Yugoslavia 2 ̆ 7 s social and economic development in the light of the various (favourable or adverse) consequences which derive from the existence of part-time farms and peasants/workers both in rural areas and in towns. The author refers to the various demographic and social consequences arising from the rapid spread of part-time farms (conservation of the expanded family increased engagement of women, children and old men on various kinds of farm work, etc.), the adverse effects on production (decreasing productivity in farm production, economic marginalization of private farms, discontinuation of land cultivation, production exclusively for private requirements, etc.), adverse effects on consumption, cultural consequences, etc. The author then notes the existence of contradictory views regarding the usefulness of part-time farms for socio-economic development. As regards their prospects, which the author discusses in the 6 th chapter it is largelly believed that part-time farms and peasants/workers will remain in existence for some time to come. However, part-time farms will gradually lose the character of economic necessity while their non-economic purpose will become more and more manifest...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands only {{little is}} known about {{part-time}} farming. What we do know is mainly of a quantitative nature. As from about 1955 the available data show an increase of the number of farms of over 2. 5 acres possessed by nonagriculturists, {{while at the same time}} the number of small full-time farms has decreased rapidly. These developments evoke the question as to what is up with regard to part-time farming. Are we dealing exclusively with a proces of desagrarization, i. e. with a proces by which farmers are gradually moving to nonagricultural occupations, choosing for part-time farming before flowing-off definitely? Or are we faced also with reagrarization, i. e. with a process of land mobility by which non-agriculturists obtain from farmers small plots of land for agricultural use? An answer to this question can only tell us something about the nature of the observed trends. However there are many other aspects and implications related to the phenomenon of part-time farming which may be of importance. The significance of this will be partly determined bij the nature of the trend. The available quantitative data do not enable us to give a definite answer to the question whether we are dealing only with desagrarization or also with reagrarization. There is some evidence that the developments under discussion are largely related to desagrarization, and consequently not to reagrarization. Assuming that these impressions are correct, it does not follow, however, that this situation will be continued in the near future. It is possible that a type of part-time farming will come up which is highly attractive for people with an 'urban' occupation. Some authors hold that even the dominating present-day type of part- time farming is attractive for many non-farm people, for it compensates a great number of shortcomings and needs allegedly experienced by many in the urban life- and-work situation. What kinds of developments with regard to part-time farming are to be expected in the Netherlands? This is not an academic question but a question of a great practical relevance for the future of the countryside, especially as far as the professional agriculture in a number of areas, as well as the attraction of the landscape and the viability of the countryside are concerned. In a twofold way we tried to get more insight into our problem. In the first place we analysed the available - mainly German and American - literature. In the second place we carried out an investigation. Two Dutch villages were selected (Didam and Uden). In the former part-time farming is a very frequent occurring phenomenon, while in the latter it holds a far less important place. The developments are mutually compared. and connected with current developments in agriculture (flow-off, production-pattern), in society at large (professionalization, leisure) and the changed position of the persons concerned. The literature analysis provided several data for a greater insight in the subject. So it was possible to conclude that in most countries migration from agriculture to other jobs mostly take place gradually and that this often leads to an increase of the number of part-time farmers. Another conclusion based on the literature-analysis was that an important explanation basis for part-time farming is constituted by the need for continuation of the way of life and of the social and fysical environment, so frequently recognized in the studies examined. The most frequent mentioned motives for a <b>part-time</b> <b>farm</b> - 'more income' and 'hobby' - cannot be seen separated from such a need for continuation. Important characteristics of the part-time farmers are: they mostly have a relatively poor training and usually have no 'urban' jobs. Consequently they have a low income from their main occupation. Nevertheless they usually are content with the situation in which they find themselves. Characteristic for the type of holding is, that it mostly is a reduced mode of the current type of fulltime farms. Other characteristics of part-time farming are a relatively extensive production and a general low average efficiency. The implications of part-time farming are judged very differently. As far as it concerns the implications for the professional agriculture mentioned in literature the opinions mostly are negative. The implications for the society and the people concerned on the contrary are judged positive in most cases. From the literature-analyses there also emerged that, though the attachment to agriculture and the land usually is very great, there is often a, more or less gradual, reduction of the size of the <b>part-time</b> <b>farm,</b> while at generation-turn in most cases complete termination of the farm takes place. From the research on the field in Didam and Uden there appears that in these areas the great majority of the part-timers came from farms (farm-heads as well as farmers' sons). So we may conclude that we mainly are facing a desagrarization proces. The most important tendencies we have found correspond with those emerging from foreign literature. However we could analyse them a bit further, and were able to indicate some background factors. One of these factors is, that the way and the extent to which one gives up part-time farming are directly related to the extent one remains integrated in the agricultural environment. It also appears that to the extent in which one gets integrated in the non-agricultural environment is of significance for the agricultural parttime job. Further there are indications that the time elapsed since the day one left agriculture as a main occupation has also some influence on the proces. The most striking aspect - and in the end probably also the most significant one - however, turned out to be the influence of the modern way of living upon parttime farming. In fact, contrary to frequently verbalized ambitions in other senses, many part-timers reduce or terminate gradually their enterprise, while at the same time also their production-pattern changes. According to the degree to which part-time farmers have accepted the modern way of life, they seem to choose those branches of production which entail less inconveniences (heavy labour, bondage etc.). As a result there is a preference to horticulture and sometimes to crop-farming and poultry. Other research-results connected with the acceptance of a modem way of living are that more simplified patterns of production were chosen, and that factors of commercial nature clearly guided the choice of the production-branche. As far as the comparison between the two areas involved in the research is concerned, it may be concluded that the Uden part-timers have broken with agriculture much more drastically than their colleagues in Didam. The Uden part- timers resembles already somewhat a real hobby-farmer, while the Didam part-timer still has much in common with the normal small farmer. As the most important conclusion it may be stated that - perhaps with the exception of the avowedly hobbyistic and the commercial modes of land-use by non-agriculturists - we are facing a transitional situation which must be seen as a compromise between on the one hand the agricultural occupation which one once chose or aspired to and on the other hand the need of a sufficient income. This transitional situation has the characteristic, that in most cases the emphasis is placed more and more on the main job. In this proces the modern way of living plays such a conditioning role that to the developments in question, just like those concerning the acceptance of the modern way of living itself, may be attached a certain amount of irreversibility. Whether or not in the future part-time farming may or will occur on a large scale is difficult to forecast. Yet we can point out some likely and some possible tendencies, drawing also on foreign literature. As a likely tendency we have to mention specially a continuing out-migration of farmers in the future, which will begin with part-time farming and setting itself forth step by step. As far as the existing part-time farms are concerned, it can be said that for the time being the present trends - i. e. towards gradual reduction, rationalization and comfortability - will increasingly shape the situation. As possible future developments can be mentioned both the rise of bigger, commercial part-time farms in some areas appropriate to this scope and an increasing interest for land use by people from urban origine, whereby perhaps the latter phenomenon will correspond to the mode of part-time farming arising from within the agricultural sector, as mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} {{theoretical}} section the author regrets that economic theory and economic policy of all schools ignore {{or at least}} neglect such 2 ̆ 7 impure 2 ̆ 7 phenomena as are part-time agricultural/non-agricultural farms. With economic development their number is rapidly increasing and this leads to various consequences {{which tend to be}} neglected or ignored by theory. However Marxist economic thought should give them more attention. As is known, Marx investigated what is called pure or abstract capitalism with its three basic classes: capitalists, workers, and land-owners. It was only this abstraction from a multitude of individual, unessential non-average and untypical elements, independently from governmental interference, that enabled him to discover the fundamental laws of capitalism. However, he did not limit himself to that alone but also investigated (especially in »Capital« I I I) concrete capitalism and industrial, commercial and financial bourgeoisie and its environment and historical appearance under the influence of numerous other economic and non-economic, sociological and political factors. Similarly, Lenin analysed the development of capitalism in Russia in the light of concrete geographical and historical conditions; however he believed that capitalist elements often derive from various non-capitalist and non-conomic circumstances. Even the regular mechanism of capitalist economic growth is based on an untypical factor, — the »extra surplus-value«, which derives from the exploitation of new technical invenions until the inventions become generally applied. Thus this exceptional factor tended to promote general progress. Another exceptional factor is the value and price of labour. Originally this was established {{on the basis of the}} value of the means of subsistence of the worker and his family, but with the introduction of machinery it has been devaluated and reduced to the value of means of subsistence of the worker alone. In the recent stage of economic development and full employment, the shorter working day and higher wages allow the employment of several family members and a higher evaluation of each individual, and this leads to a comparatively high level of family income and increased spending in general. The author feels that the effects of this family income on the market, on the purchase power, on the consumers’ preferences and choices, on the elasticity of consumer goods, and on Engels’s laws have not been adequately studied, especially in the conditions of poor, non-developed regions with a highly irregular employment of individual members of the family. The author then goes on to discuss the special combination of multiple job- -holding, the combination of agricultural with non-agricultural occupations within one household or, more precisely, of work on the farm and work outside it. This phenomenon which generally accompanies the economic development of agriculture, calls for a wider investigation of its importance and implications and especially for a reply to the question whether it is an obstacle to, or a promoter of, economic growth on a national scale. Local monographs, descriptions and micro-economic studies on the subject are already available. The author stresses the substantial differences between the standards of living of part-time and agricultural/non-agricultural households in the past (when the classical peasants/workers formed the poorest population strata) and nowadays (when they are among the wealthiest people in rural areas). In the past their characteristics were a long working day, a long walk to the place of work, and a heavy work load on the housewife, while nowadays, at least in developed countries, the situation is different: a shorter working day and a short working week, quick and often free transportation to the job, electricity and labour-saving devices in the home, public care for children, and a higher level of earnings from employment outside the farm, — all of which makes possible saving and investment in the holding. The author excludes from his study large agricultural holdings linked with non-agricultural activities, considering them simply a vertical concentration of capital; he also excludes the garden plots of kolkhoz peasants as not belonging into the category of small part-time farmers and workers/peasants. Since lack of statistical information is one of the main obstacles to economic research in this field, the author, in the second section of the study, deals with the methodological difficulties in establishing the number of part-time farms or agricultural holdings with an additional, external income. Until recently nothing reliable could be said about them on an international level. However, the situation has substantially improved since the 1970 World Census of Agriculture, although the respective data are not very comparable between different countries, especially those with different types of census and enquiry. This is demonstrated by instances from France and Yugoslavia: the differences were due to the non-uniformity of definitions and types of census. One of the main problems is the wide distribution of twin occupations: (a) In most Western countries (particularly in the English or German speaking region) only one type is recognized, i. e. where the farm serves as a supplementary, secondary occupation (the real »part-time farm«, »der landwirtschaftliche Nebenerwerbsbetrieb «; this type corresponds to the »part-time farm type II« in Japanese literature); (b) In certain other countries those persons are also regarded as multiple-job- -holders whose main occupation is farming but who also earn a certain amount of income outside the farm either by part-time or by full-time work (»peasant/worker«, »der landwirtschaftliche Zuerwerbsbetrieb«; this type corresponds to the »part-time farm type I« in Japanese literature). The author believes it is wrong to ignore »type b« and include it among full-time »pure« farmers, but he admits that in agricultural censuses it is difficult to identify holdings of type »b«. The second difficulty is the selection of a criterion for identification: working time (man-days, man-hours) or income? Different criteria lead to different results. The author is in favour of a combination of both criteria, as this is done in the German and Belgian censuses. The third problem is the question whose work should be considered: the work of the holder alone (U. S., Canada), of the holder and/or his wife, or of other active members of the household. The author supports the last alternative. The first criterion is to some extent corrected by considering the value of the sale of products. Most of the European censuses, however, make possible a detailed insight into the activity structure of the family. The third section contains statistics showing trends in the number and distribution of part-time farms in the U. S., Canada, Germany, France and Japan and some data on Yugoslavia, while the fourth section discusses the statistical data. As regards the well-known issue whether part-time farms is a phenomenon which accompanies a low level of economic development marked by low-income agriculture and low-income industry, but which disappears in the higher stages of economic growth, the author believes that recent development have refuted this view. In countries with a high average size of farm such as North America and Oceania the absolute number both of farms and of part-time farms is decreasing. The same applies to the developed regions of Central and Western Europe with their traditionally overpopulated, small-sized agricultural holdings whose adjustment to the new situation is slowed down to some extent by interventionary measures. Nevertheless, the number of marginal medium-sized farms continues increasing, and the link between part-time farms and farms with supplementary income earned outside the holding (. Nebenerwerbsbetriebe and Zuerwerbsbetriebe) is established on a higher level. Thus part-time farms as an institution are inevitable concomitants of economic growth at its various levels. As an individual phenomenon, however, the <b>part-time</b> <b>farm</b> is generally abandoned (or turned into a garden plot) in the third or fourth generations. (However, there exist certain regions where the tradition of part-time farming is maintained for several generations (e. g. wine growing for prestige reasons), certain mining regions, etc.) The f i f t h section contains the author 2 ̆ 7 s views on part-time farms or with supplementary sources of income: (a) Productivity of part-time farms. Although a nation’s agricultural supply cannot rely on these farms, and although these farms are generally below the level of productivity of 2 ̆ 7 purely 2 ̆ 7 agricultural farms of comparable size, the productivity of part-time farms under certain conditions can become equal or even higher than is that of the corresponding category of purely agricultural farms. This is particularly true if more of the money earned outside the farm is invested in agriculture and if the holder concentrates on the market production of only a few instead of many different crops. Here the principles of economies of scale have only a comparative value, and the author believes this to be fully compatible with Marx 2 ̆ 7 s teachings; (b) Competition in the market. In low-income countries, production on part- -time farms appears to have a promoting effect on industrialization because it lessens the need for food imports and saves the country considerable foreign exchange funds. In certain developed countries, part-time farmers are made responsible for overproduction and the fall of market prices. The real problem, however, is not only one of reducing production but also of financing the distribution as long as the total world food production continues to be exceeded by demand; (c) The acceleration exodus of part-time farmers and small full-time farmers leaves some less fertile, especially hilly regions deserted and exposed either to soil erosion or to a wild growth of bushes and woods. The EEC countries are trying to control the situation by various measures including the introduction of suitable local industries for part-time farmers, the development of tourism, etc.; (d) The existence of part-time farms and the daily commuting from villages to towns and industrial centres helps to relieve some of the tensions between rural and urban areas and may help to reduce differences between town and country in die future. Tn the most highly developed countries a »back to land« movement has recently been spreading among certain strata of the population; (e) Taking it all in all, small part-time farms offer many factors which can have a favourable effect on the processes of economic development and industrialization and on the development of a socialist society. It should be the task of economists, sociologists, politicians and legislators to see that this stratum is not left without assistance and long-term orientation, and to establish and promote those favourable elements which are likely to speed up national development and well being...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of agricultural and non-agricultural activities on peasant small-holdings in Italy and France {{has a long}} tradition. Reliable proofs of this have been found by the author in literary and historical works (Manzoni, Michelet). The terminological determination and definition of the {{combination of}} agricultural and non-agricultural activities is fairly complex. The definition of part- -time farming an proposed by the Italian National Institute for Rural Sociology (INSOR) and quoted by the author suggests (a) that the essence of <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> does not derive from the farm but the family which keeps it, (b) {{that it is possible}} to construct a continuum of <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> with respect to category 2 ̆ 7, modalities and intensity of the activity of individuals and the family, (c) that the characteristics of <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> derive from the activity of persons rather than from the nature of their income and (d) that <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> assumes division of employment between two sectors of regular activity or between two positions within one activity.

40|$|The Teagasc National Farm Survey (NFS) is {{undertaken}} annually {{to determine the}} financial situation on Irish farms. The principal measure of the income arising from farming activities is Family Farm Income (FFI) per farm. In addition to analysing farm income by system and size of farm, NFS data can also be analysed for Full-time and <b>Part-time</b> <b>farms</b> to determine the variation in income that occurs. In this paper the variation in FFI on <b>Part-time</b> and Full-time <b>farms</b> is analysed by system of farming. In the NFS Full-time farms are defined as those which require at least 0. 75 Standard Labour Units to operate, as calculated on a Standard Man Day (SMD) basis. Farms are therefore divided into Full-time and Part-time {{on the basis of}} the estimated labour required to operate their farms as distinct from labour available, which is often in excess of that required. The total number of farms represented nationally is 111, 115. Full-time farms represent the larger more commercial sector of farming and in 2005 accounted for 38 % (or 42, 300) of all farms represented by the NFS. Fifty five percent of Full-time farms were in the two dairying systems with 34 % in the drystock systems with the remaining 11 % in the Tillage systems.
