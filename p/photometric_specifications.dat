40|$|Recommendations for Tunnel {{lighting}} {{presented here}} concern the principles which underlie to the lighting of long tunnels for motorised traffic. They present <b>photometric</b> <b>specifications</b> by which an effective tunnel lighting can be obtained, {{taking into account}} traffic safety, traffic flow and driving comfort...|$|E
40|$|Illumination {{engineers}} and lighting specifiers often need {{to compare the}} <b>photometric</b> <b>specifications</b> of similar light sources. Factors such as luminaire efficiency and color temperature are easy to compare â€“ they are scalar numbers. Photometric distributions, however, are more problematic. We must compare two-dimensional plots of intensity values {{in one or more}} planes...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} an encounter with, {{and a look}} at, an Audi. Observations and measurements of the output of its headlights serve to emphasize some things concerning the relation of photometry to its task. Photometry's task is to predict the visual effect of light. This paper focuses on what photometry can't {{tell us about the}} effect of a light source on the eye. The eye has capability and idiosyncracy that <b>photometric</b> <b>specifications</b> cannot anticipate...|$|E
40|$|Many {{species of}} insects display a {{disposition}} {{to move towards}} light. As a consequence, nocturnal artificial lighting often contributes {{to an increase in}} insect population among humans. We tested the hypothesis that residential white lamps can evoke significantly different attraction to insects even when their light outputs are nearly indistinguishable to humans. In a two-choice experiment using insect traps equipped with either a compact fluorescent or a LED light source with similar <b>photometric</b> <b>specifications,</b> about three times more insects were captured in the trap with a compact fluorescent lamp than in the LED trap. The results suggest that LED lamps are preferable to compact fluorescent lamps when the objective is to avoid attracting nocturnal insects to households...|$|E
40|$|WO 2011023404 A 1 UPAB: 20110321 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{establishing the}} <b>photometric</b> <b>specifications</b> {{for a light}} by the user. A light meeting the specifications is determined in a computed-aided manner {{on the basis of}} data on available components. The light includes unavailable components. A record is created when the light is determined in a computer-aided manner. The user is informed about the effort required to produce the light. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a data medium with a computer program product for carrying out the method. USE - Method for producing a light (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - The record is created when the light is determined in a computer-aided manner, and thus ensures simple light producing method...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a recommendation for a test voltage to be used for harmonized headlamp <b>photometric</b> <b>specifications.</b> Two separate activities were 1 performed: a survey of expert opinion, and an analysis of published field data on lamp I voltages. 1 The survey dealt with recommendations for test voltage under current electrical systems that have a nominal voltage of 12 V, as well as under potential future, higher-voltage systems. Responses were received from 120 experts. The opinions of experts varied widely, both between continents and within continents. The most frequent recommendation for the test voltage under the current electrical system was 12. 8 V in North America and 12. 0 V in Europe and Asia, but values between 12. 0 and 13. 5 V found a substantial amount of support on all I continents. The published field data on lamp voltages are limited, and most of the data were collected under controlled conditions, as opposed to sampling a variety of normial driving conditions. The two studies that measured voltages under normal driving conditions suggest...|$|E
