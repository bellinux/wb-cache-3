500|$|Commencing {{with the}} [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg, clips from the tour's [...] "video confessional booth" [...] were {{displayed}} on the set's screens between the main set and the encore. Concertgoers were encouraged to visit the booth prior to the concert and say whatever they wanted. These [...] "confessions" [...] varied from a woman flashing her breasts to a man revealing he had killed his friend in a car accident. Once the encore began, Bono would return as a different alter ego—Mirror Ball Man in 1992, and MacPhisto in 1993. Performances of [...] "Desire" [...] were accompanied by images of Richard Nixon, Margaret Thatcher, Paul Gascoigne, and Jimmy Swaggart, and were meant as a criticism of greed; cash rained the stage and Bono portrayed Mirror Ball Man as {{an interpretation of the}} greedy preacher described in the song's lyrics. Bono often made a crank call from the stage as his persona of the time. Such calls included dialing a phone sex line, calling a taxi cab, ordering 10,000 pizzas (the Detroit pizza parlor delivered 100 pizzas during the show), or calling a local politician. Bono regularly called the White House in an attempt to contact President Bush. Though Bono never reached the <b>President,</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> acknowledge the calls during a press conference.|$|E

40|$|Let us {{begin at}} the beginning: The presidential pardon power is plenary. If a good President uses it to clear the record of civil rights protesters, convicted years ago, let us say, of {{trespassing}} on federal land, neither the Congress nor the courts may sit in review. If a wicked President uses it to shield white supremacists from a courageous federal prosecutor, there is no recourse. If the President uses {{the power to make}} amends for the society 2 ̆ 7 s unwillingness to acknowledge religious differences, as <b>President</b> George <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> on Christmas Eve of 1992, no entity but the public can bring him to brook; and if he uses it to prevent the prosecution of those who carried out a controversial and probably illegal policy, as <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> also <b>did</b> on Christmas Eve of 1992, that is his right. In particular, there is nothing even constitutionally fishy in the President 2 ̆ 7 s use of the pardon power to frustrate the will of the other branches, or to limit their ability to inquire into executive affairs—as <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> plainly <b>did</b> when he granted pardons to several of the major figures in the Iran-Contra scandal. To say that it cannot be used that way is as silly as saying that the Congress should not use its legislative power to criminalize policy disputes with the executive branch—the rather thin explanation that <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> offered for his last-minute decision...|$|R
