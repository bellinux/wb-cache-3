Igor Kurdin, Russian Navy - K-219s XO (executive officer) {{at the time}} of the {{incident}} - and Lieutenant Commander Wayne Grasdock, USN described the explosion occurrence as follows: At 0514, the BCh-2 officer and the hold machinist/engineer in compartment IV (the forward missile compartment) discovered water dripping from under the plug of missile tube No. 6 (the third tube from the bow on the port side). During <b>precompression</b> of the plug, the drips turned into a stream. The BCh-2 officer reported water in missile tube No. 6, and at 0525, the captain ordered an ascent to a safe depth (46 meters) while a pump was started in an attempt to dry out missile tube No. 6. At 0532, brown clouds of oxidant began issuing from under the missile-tube plug, and the BCh-2 officer declared an accident alert in the compartment and reported the situation to the GKP (main control post). Although personnel assigned to other compartments left the space, nine people remained in compartment IV. The captain declared an accident alert. It took the crew no more than one minute to carry out initial damage control measures, which included hermetically sealing all compartments. Five minutes later, at 0538, an explosion occurred in missile tube No. 6. Two sailors were killed outright in the explosion, and a third died soon afterward from toxic gas poisoning. Through a breach in the hull, the vessel immediately started taking on sea water, quickly sinking from its original depth of 40 m to eventually reach a depth in excess of 300 m. Sealing of all of the compartments and full engagement of the sea water pumps in the stricken compartments enabled the depth to be stabilised.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare <b>precompression</b> stresses derived from different compression test methods and relate these values to measured stress and displacement during wheeling in the field. <b>Precompression</b> stress was measured at three depths at two sites on a Eutric Cambisol in Sweden using in situ plate sinkage test, and by compressing soil cores in the laboratory with sequential loading (oedometer) and at constant displacement speed, respectively. At the same sites, wheeling experiments were carried out where vertical soil displacement and vertical soil stress were measured simultaneously at three depths. No clear relationship between <b>precompression</b> stress and compression method was found. <b>Precompression</b> stress values derived from the oedometer and the in situ plate sinkage test did generally not differ from each other. <b>Precompression</b> stress derived from the constant speed test was either higher (site A, silty clay loam) or lower (site B, silty clay) compared to the other methods. <b>Precompression</b> stress did not work as a threshold value between reversible and irreversible deformation when <b>precompression</b> stress values derived from the different methods were compared with stress and displacement measured in the field during the wheeling experiment. Even when the observed stress was lower than the <b>precompression</b> stress, a residual displacement was observed. The study demonstrates that the <b>precompression</b> stress is not a sharp value but depends on the compression test method and its analysis, and that compression tests might not represent the soil behaviour in the field sufficiently.

This paper outlines the application of such a system via a Post-Buckled <b>Precompression</b> (PBP) technique {{at the end of}} a twist-active piezoelectric rotor blade actuator. The basic performance of the system is handily modeled by using laminated plate theory techniques. A dual cantilevered spring system was used to increasingly null the passive stiffness of the root actuator along the feathering axis of the rotor blade.

40|$|AbstractMany arable soils have {{significant}} horizon-specific gravel content levels. Just how these influence compaction behaviour, {{and in particular}} <b>precompression</b> stress as an important criterion of a soil's susceptibility to compaction, {{has yet to be}} sufficiently clarified. This article is intended to contribute towards answering this question. Firstly, three different fine earths, from the “Clay”, “Silt Loam” and “Sandy Loam” soil texture classes were mixed with staggered proportions (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 % by volume) of a quartz gravel (the shape of which was subrounded to rounded, average weighted diameter 6 mm). Soil core samplers were filled with the mixtures at a typical density for a natural site. In the case of the 30 % by volume variant only, in addition to the quartz gravel an angular to subangular limestone gravel with the same size graduation was also used. The tests were supplemented by 20 samples from a natural site; the gravel content of these varied between 0. 1 and 23. 5 % by volume. All of the disturbed and natural samples were adjusted to a water content at a matric potential of − 6 kPa. Subsequently, an oedometer test was used to apply loads to them in stages (5 – 550 kPa). <b>Precompression</b> stress was calculated using the resulting stress–bulk density functions. While fine earth bulk density remained constant, the staggered addition of quartz gravel led to an increase in the whole soil density after packing, and thus also to a vertical shift in overall stress–bulk density functions. However, the stress–density functions of the fine earth do show that the overall compaction of fine earth decreased as gravel content increased. In the case of low gravel content levels of no more than 10 % by volume, the increase in <b>precompression</b> stress (log) in the disturbed samples was, on the whole, very low. In the disturbed samples, however, as gravel content increased <b>precompression</b> stress (log) increased exponentially. Contrary to this, a continuous linear increase in <b>precompression</b> stress (log) could be observed with increasing gravel content in the natural samples. The angular to subangular shape of the gravel only resulted in greater <b>precompression</b> stress (log) in the “Silt Loam”. At gravel-rich sites, gravel content influences soil compaction behaviour and <b>precompression</b> stress very strongly. For this reason, it is essential that it be considered when assessing such sites' risk of compaction damage...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the load bearing capacity models obtained with controlled moisture in laboratory and those obtained with natural field moistures determined a long one year. The evaluation of soil structural sustainability follows four distinct steps: soil sampling in the field, uniaxial compression test of the samples in the laboratory, determination of <b>precompression</b> stress and estimation of the load bearing capacity models. Laboratory estimates of <b>precompression</b> stress were obtained from moisture controlled in laboratory and from natural moisture determined in a field a long one year.

Then, the <b>precompression</b> stress was determined for this both conditions. To verify if the load bearing capacity models obtained with controlled moisture in laboratory may represent the load bearing models obtained with natural field moisture, these models were compared using the homogeneity test procedure. It was observed that 75 % of field models analyzed were similar to the laboratory models. Thus, due to the similarity on the load-bearing capacity models obtained using natural (field) or controlled (laboratory) moisture contents, the assessment of the soil structure sustainability can be done using both methods...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is conducted {{to study the}} propagation of stress pulses with wave length comparable {{to the size of}} a unit cell in an one-dimensional chain composed of steel cylinders alternating with toroidal Nitrile rubber O-rings under different levels of <b>precompression</b> or without <b>precompression</b> force by using experiments, numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Nitrile O-rings are making the system more tunable than the traditional metamaterials composed of steel spherical particles and this metamaterial has better dissipative properties especially for high energy repeatable impact loading. This strongly nonlinear discrete metamaterial can be potentially useful for acoustic and shock/impact mitigating applications. Investigated metamaterial is strongly nonlinear system with unique properties, where the strong nonlinearity arises from the Hertzian contact interaction or from more general double power interaction law under large compression. If the initial <b>precompression</b> is zero, such a system cannot support a classical sound waves and for this reason it is called a “sonic vacuum”. The static force-displacement relationship for toroidal O-ring is described by a combination of two power-law terms being in satisfactory agreement with experimental observations. This suggests unique tunability and it was demonstrated that the pulse speed indeed is strongly tunable with applied static stress. A strong attenuation of stress pulse was observed at a relatively short distances from the entrance. It is attributed to the viscous dissipation during dynamic deformation of strongly nonlinear viscoelastic O-rings, its dependence on the initial <b>precompression</b> was studied. Several models for this nonlinear metamaterial were numerically investigated to clarify the mechanism of the observed strongly nonlinear dissipation by representing O-rings in the frame of Kelvin-Voigt model: strongly nonlinear massless spring with parallel dashpot with nonlinear damping coefficient being function of initial <b>precompression.</b> Single bell shape waves of different durations and amplitudes were generated in the system without <b>precompression</b> by an impact of strikers with different masses. The viscous dissipation prevents the incoming pulse from splitting into trains of solitary waves typical for non-dissipative strongly nonlinear discrete systems. Very unusual behavior of strikers with relatively large masses in comparison with mass of steel cylinders in the metamaterial was observed in experiments – strikers did not recoil after impact with investigated metamaterial. Results of numerical modeling were in agreement with speed of stress pulses, their attenuation and strikers behavior observed in experiments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{practice}} of elastography is generally limited to small applied compressions (typically 1 %), {{under the assumption}} of a linear stress-strain relationship in biological tissue. However, the recent reports of larger applied compressions and <b>precompression</b> levels to increase the strain contrast violate the above assumption. The nonlinear stress-strain relationships in different breast tissue types significantly alter the contrast in elastography, especially for large applied compression. The moduli of normal fibrous and glandular breast tissue (along with cancerous lesions) are strain-dependent, with tissue stiffness increasing with applied compression. In this paper, we illustrate that the strain-dependence of the modulus has {{a significant impact on}} the elastographic contrast and on the contrast-to–noise ratio, and may even cause a reversal of the contrast in certain situations.

40|$|As {{the beam}} {{currents}} at the SLC are increased, transverse aperture restrictions in the ring-to-linac transport line (RTL) become increasingly important. The RTL contains a bunch compressor which introduces a large energy variation across the bunch and hence a larger transverse beam size.

While advantangeous for shaping the bunch distribution, this increased the bunch energy spread and therefore resulted in more beam loss.

40|$|When a {{detonation}} propagates in {{an explosive}} that partially fills a channel, a shock wave {{can be generated}} in the air gap between the explosive and its confinement. This is typically {{referred to as the}} channel effect. In the air gap, the detonation products behave as a piston, which drives the precursor air shock wave ahead of the detonation. Since the shock wave runs ahead of the detonation, it preconditions the explosive and the detonation propagates into shocked explosive. This can affect the detonation in various ways, depending {{on the nature of the}} explosive. Properties such as heterogeneity, porosity and sensitivity of the explosive will determine how the precursor shock will affect the detonation propagation. Four different coupling mechanisms have been identified and are discussed in this thesis. They have been called: <b>precompression,</b> detonation initiation, surface ignition and dead pressing. In the present study, three cases are investigated experimentally: <b>precompression,</b> detonation initiation and the case where no coupling occurs. The goal is to elucidate the respective propagation mechanisms. It is found that boundary layers on the channel walls significantly affect the precursor shock wave propagation. This effect is modeled and the results are compared to experiments. When the explosive is PETN powder, the detonation is found to accelerate to 1. 5 times the Chapman-Jouguet velocity. Experiments performed indicate that this is due to <b>precompression</b> of the PETN. Again this effect is modeled and compared with experiments. It is also demonstrated that in the present experiments, coupling via initiation does not occur.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{tableting}} mixtures {{containing the}} paracetamolum by {{the parameters of}} the equation of compression The diploma thesis deals with effect of paracetamol on the parameters of compression equation. These parameters characterize compression process in the individual phases of compression: <b>precompression</b> phase, phase of elastic deformation and phase of plastic deformation. Paracetamolum was studied in the five mixtures, where it occurred in different ratio with microcrystalline cellulose. Looseness, Carr's index and Hausner ratio were evaluated for each mixture. The sizes of reductions ai, sizes of energies Ei and Ri, "half-pressures" pHi and the velocity constants 1 /ti were calculated using three-exponential equation of compression for the individual phases of pressing. The results showed poor flow properties of tableting mixtures and thus its unsuitability for direct compression. The results of the study have revealed that increasing amounts of paracetamolum in the mixture increase reduction of volume a 1 and velocity of volume change 1 /t 1 in dependence on the amount of the extruded air and decrease the required energy due to the smooth surface and less friction during the <b>precompression</b> phase. Reduction of volume a 2 decrease with the increase of content of paracetamol due to [...] ...|$|E
