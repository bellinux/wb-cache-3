40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out by Tucker's Audiometer, in which a pure note, {{electrically}} produced, is reduced by means of resistances until it ceases to be heard. Thirty cases of middle-ear deafness with <b>paracusis</b> were investigated. In two there was absolute <b>paracusis,</b> the sound being better heard with disturbing noise. In sixteen (relative <b>paracusis)</b> there was little diminution in hearing power {{in the presence of}} a disturbing sound. In twelve the hearing was apparently improved {{in the presence of a}} disturbing sound in the opposite ear (crossed <b>paracusis).</b> We have found no previous description of this last condition, and venture no suggestions as to its significance...|$|E
