Compared with mere coagulation by polyaluminium chloride (PAC), <b>pre-oxidation</b> using 2 mg/l O 3 for 20 minutes could increase the removal rates of both turbidity and total organic carbon by 5. 33 % and 5. 06 %. However, the effectiveness of <b>pre-oxidation</b> using KMnO 4 was not as significant as that using O 3. Besides the direct mineralization of small organic molecules into CO 2 and H 2 O, O 3 and KMnO 4 could also destroy complex macromolecules in raw water.

40|$|The {{influence}} of oxidation-reduction (redox) pretreatment on the pulverization of Panzhihua ilmenite during hydrochloric acid leaching to obtain synthetic rutile {{was investigated in}} detail. We observed the dissociation of incompact TiO 2 products formed via the dissolution-hydrolysis of Ti ions, which {{was caused by the}} fast dissolution of FeTiO 3 during the leaching process and was the fundamental reason for pulverization for the raw Panzhihua ilmenite. A stirring operation during the acid leaching aggravated the pulverization phenomenon. The formation and consumption of insoluble rutile grains during the redox pretreatment {{played a key role in}} preventing the pulverization of pre-treated ilmenites. The rutile network formed during the <b>pre-oxidation</b> was retained and served as a nucleus for the hydrolyzed product during the successive leaching process, providing the leaching products of the pre-oxidized ilmenite with less hydrolyzed TiO 2, higher mechanical strength, and thus an excellent resistance to pulverization, even with stirred leaching. Because the following weak reduction process (reduction of ferric iron to ferrous state) at relatively low temperatures (e. g., 873 K) did not destroy the rutile network that was formed by the <b>pre-oxidation,</b> it did not change the ability of the <b>pre-oxidation</b> to prevent the pulverization of ilmenite. However, the weak reduction process at high temperatures (e. g. 1023 K) weakened the effect of <b>pre-oxidation</b> because most of the futile grains that were formed by the <b>pre-oxidation</b> were consumed and formed FeTiO 3.

Cast pure titanium {{was subjected to}} <b>pre-oxidation</b> and introduction of an intermediate layer of SnO x by sol-gel process. Specimen surfaces were characterized by XRD and SEM/EDS. The adhesion between the titanium and porcelain was evaluated by three-point flexure bond test. A rutile layer is formed on the titanium surface after <b>pre-oxidation.</b> Failure of the titanium-porcelain with <b>pre-oxidation</b> treatment predominantly occurs at the titanium-oxide interface. <b>Pre-oxidation</b> treatment {{does not affect the}} fracture mode of the titanium-porcelain system. The rutile layer is more strongly bonded to the porcelain than titanium. The poor adhesion of the rutile with substrate is due to the thermal stress arising from the large lattice mismatch and difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between Ti and rutile during cooling. However, a thin and coherent SnO x film with small spherical pores obtained after heat-treated at 300 ¡䟳erves as an effective oxygen diffusion barrier to improve titanium-ceramic adhesion.

The influence of reduction conditions on the metallization degree of the samples, such as reduction temperature, C/Fe molar ratio, <b>pre-oxidation</b> and additives were studied. It {{was found that the}} <b>pre-oxidation</b> and additives played a considerable role in the metallization degree of titanomagnetite concentrates.

The <b>pre-oxidation</b> destroyed the crystal lattice of raw titanomagnetite concentrates and formed pores in the particles, which accelerated the reduction process. The effect of different additives on the metallization degree of pre-oxidized titanomagnetite concentrates was also discussed. The results show that when 1. 5 wt. % Na 2 CO 3 is used as an additive, the metallization degree of pre-oxidized titanomagnetite concentrates reaches 96. 4 %, after heating for 1 h at 1200 degrees C.

40|$|The methane-steam redox {{process is}} an {{alternative}} methane conversion route to high-purity hydrogen production. Using natural ilmenite as an oxygen carrier, we investigated the effect of three different <b>pre-oxidation</b> temperatures (800, 1000 and 1200 °C) on redox performance and stability. We found that the <b>pre-oxidation</b> temperature significantly altered the crystalline properties of the ilmenite sample, which subsequently affected its morphology, reducibility and redox performance. <b>Pre-oxidation</b> above 1000 °C caused the formation of pseudo-brookite (Fe 2 TiO 5), while hematite (Fe 2 O 3) was formed at 800 °C. The presence of Fe 2 TiO 5 lowered the reduction kinetics, but improved the oxygen-transfer capacity. This resulted in the highest redox activity for the sample pre-oxidised at 1000 °C, which had a three to fourfold increase in hydrogen yield compared with samples pre-oxidised at the other temperatures.

The optimal surface roughness was obtained after 10 h of <b>pre-oxidation,</b> when the surface contained significant amounts of -alumina arranged as randomly oriented whiskers. Upon coating of the treated foil coupons with a γ-alumina slurry, the sample pre-oxidised for 10 hours gave the best performance in terms of coating loading (7. 94 mass %) and adherence (< 10 mass % loss) based on a ultrasonic vibration test...|$|E
40|$|A new jetting <b>pre-oxidation</b> {{fluidized}} bed gasification (JPFBG) process, mainly consisting of jetting <b>pre-oxidation</b> zone and char gasification zone, {{has been proposed}} and developed by Institute of Process Engineering (IPE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to utilize cohesive washing middling coal effectively for fuel gas production and thus replacing the valuable coke oven gas. This article is devoted to summarizing the results obtained in the fundamental studies and a pilot plant. The fundamental studies conducted on an externally heated laboratory JPFB gasification setup demonstrated that the appropriate operating conditions for the <b>pre-oxidation</b> zone and the char gasification zone were at temperature of 950 degrees C with an excessive air ratio (ER) of about 0. 13, and at temperature of 1000 degrees C with an ER of 0. 17 and a mass ratio of steam to coal of 0. 09, respectively. Based on these condition data, an autothermal pilot system with a treating capacity of 150 kg/h for strong cohesive coal was built and tested to demonstrate the JPFB gasification process. Keeping the temperatures of the pre-oxidization zone and char gasification zone at about 950 degrees C and 1000 degrees C respectively, the higher heating value of the produced fuel gas was close to 4000 kJ/N m(3). The obtained typical results from the continuously steady operations of the pilot plant fully verified the technical feasibility and clarified the technical features of the tested new JPFB gasification process.

40|$|Vitrification is a {{potential}} route for the immobilisation of Plutonium Contaminated Material (PCM). This is an Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) arising from operations {{in which there is}} contact with Pu isotopes. PCM consists of low levels of Pu combined with metals, masonry, glass, ceramics, polymers and other carbonaceous materials. Simulated PCM containing CeO 2 as a PuO 2 surrogate was mixed with a phosphate precursor and vitrified. <b>Pre-oxidation</b> of PCM simulant prior to vitrification minimised the violence of batch reactions. No <b>pre-oxidation</b> produced inhomogeneous slag-like materials with high residual metals and particulates. <b>Pre-oxidation</b> at 600 °C in air and at 1200 °C in an O 2 -rich atmosphere produced more favourable results, with increasingly vitreous products resulting from more oxidised PCM simulant. The most oxidised PCM simulant produced phosphate glasses with low levels of particulate inclusions, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Particulates included iron-rich metallics and aluminous oxides. Increased melting times and temperatures may have reduced the number of inclusions slightly, but O 2 bubbling during melting resulted in little additional benefit. Waste loading equivalent to ∼ 60 weight % of untreated waste may be possible. There was little evidence of Ce partitioning, indicating that it was immobilised within the glass matrix and had little preference for metallic or crystalline phases. These results demonstrate the potential feasibility for vitrification of PCM in phosphate glass, justifying further investigation into this potentially novel solution...|$|E
40|$|A CuOx-CeOx/Al 2 O 3 {{catalyst}} was {{studied with}} in-situ transmission CuK XAS {{for the total}} oxidation of propane as model reaction for the catalytic elimination of volatile organic compounds. The local Cu structure was determined for the catalyst as such, after <b>pre-oxidation</b> and after reduction with propane. The catalyst as such has a local CuO structure. No structural effect was observed upon heating in He up to 600 degrees C or after <b>pre-oxidation</b> at 150 degrees C. A full reduction of the Cu 2 + towards metallic Cu- 0 occurred, when propane was fed to the catalyst. The change in local Cu structure during propane reduction was followed with a time resolution of 1 min. The X(k) scans appeared as linear combinations of start and end spectra, CuO and Cu structure, respectively. However, careful examination of the XANES edge spectra indicates {{the presence of a}} small amount of additional Cu 1 + species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Comparative {{study on}} {{permanganate}} and ozone as <b>pre-oxidation</b> agents {{were performed on}} pilot scale with traditional drinking water treatment process, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon(TOC), UV 254, turbidity, trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) were examined at each reactor’s effluent. The results show that at <b>pre-oxidation</b> reactor, the total organic remained stable after by the two agents, while for UV 254, pre-ozonation has a removal rate of 34 %, comparing that of 17 % by permanganate. At the sedimentation process, 0. 4 mg/L permanganate improves the removal rate of turbidity and COD by 0. 99 % and 8. 4 %, respectively; while a positive COD removal of 11. 8 % was achieved by 0. 9 mg/L pre-ozonation, and an average of- 10. 08 % turbidity removal was achieved at applied dosage (0. 5, 0, 9 and 1. 5 mg/L), which {{can be made up}} for in the followed sand filtration reactor. Both permanganate and pre-ozonation show higher removal rate of THMFP for the finished water...|$|E
