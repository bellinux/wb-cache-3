5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into <b>planks,</b> as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the <b>planks</b> would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E

5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the <b>planks</b> bound together by steel, as opposed to simple <b>planks</b> that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many <b>planks,</b> there was widespread agreement among the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other <b>planks</b> of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} at the now-named Apostolic Faith Mission housed an office and rooms for several {{residents}} including Seymour and his new wife, Jennie.

5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted {{in the ground and}} connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split <b>planks</b> or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked with}} Corréard, Savigny {{and another of}} the survivors, the {{carpenter}} Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of <b>planks.</b> Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast {{on a number of}} occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is a {{historic}} county in the south west of England.

The oldest dated human road work in Great Britain is the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels with wooden <b>planks</b> in the 39th century BCE.|$|E
25|$|According to René Tinner and Stephan <b>Plank</b> {{in a radio}} {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Conny <b>Plank,</b> it was Brian Eno's idea that <b>Plank</b> should produce the U2-album The Joshua Tree instead of him. After being introduced to the band by Eno and after a short meeting, <b>Plank</b> turned down the job ("I cannot work with this singer"). According to the companion website of the documentary film Conny <b>Plank</b> – The Potential of Noise (but not the film itself), after the meeting, <b>Plank</b> firstly asked for time for a second thought. In the meantime he attended a U2 concert at Freilichtbühne Loreley, where U2's Bono introduced <b>Plank</b> to the audience as their new producer. Thereupon <b>Plank</b> has left the concert and never again talked to any member of U2.|$|R
50|$|During the 1800s, 202 <b>plank</b> road {{companies}} {{were established in}} Michigan, and 5,802 and 1/2 miles of <b>plank</b> roads were chartered, with roads as long as 220 miles (from Zilwaukee to Mackinaw City, and going through Traverse City) to as short as one mile (in Sault Ste. Marie). The man who signed the law {{was one of the}} major supporters of <b>plank</b> roads in Michigan, governor Epaphroditus Ransom. Ransom signed the general <b>plank</b> road incorporation act, and throughout his governorship viewed <b>plank</b> roads as the solution to increasing Michigan's economy. <b>Plank</b> roads were very popular in rural areas, because, even when it was wet and muddy, people could still travel on <b>plank</b> roads. Properly maintained <b>plank</b> roads were known to cut four to six day trips to as short as ten to fifteen hours.|$|R

That same year, Moebius and <b>Plank</b> teamed with Mayo Thompson to record Ludwig's Law, which was not released until 1998. The final Moebius & <b>Plank</b> collaboration, En Route was recorded in 1986 but not released until 1995 on Curious Music. <b>Plank</b> {{died of cancer in}} 1987.|$|R
5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the <b>planks</b> glued, and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
5|$|The species {{used for}} the hull <b>planks</b> was not {{positively}} identified but {{is thought to be}} Amoora of the Meliaceae family. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the Fabaceae family. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.|$|E
5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden <b>planks</b> bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E

Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose <b>planks</b> of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with <b>planks,</b> coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, {{driven into}} the {{waterlogged}} soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of <b>planks</b> of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E
50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>planking</b> has generated a backlash.

40|$|Purpose: The <b>plank</b> {{exercise}} {{is a popular}} and widely used exercise to increase core strength. We previously established normative values for the <b>plank</b> exercise {{that may be used}} for fitness classification to identify gaps in core muscular strength and endurance. Whether the <b>plank</b> exercise can be confidently added to current fitness appraisal protocols will depend on its reliability and validity in the fitness testing environment. This study sought to examine test-retest reliability of the <b>plank</b> exercise and to compare <b>plank</b> performance with established normative values for the curl up test. The role of verbal encouragement cues during <b>plank</b> performance testing was also assessed. Methods: Collegiate male (n= 14) and female participants (n= 19) performed the <b>plank</b> exercise in two separate sessions separated by a minimum of 72 hr. Participants maintained the <b>plank</b> position until complete fatigue was reached. Verbal cues were given to half of the participants in one of the two sessions. Performance on the curl up exercise was measured in a third, separate session. Results: Intraclass correlation showed that mean time held in the <b>plank</b> position was not significantly different between the two <b>plank</b> testing sessions (108. 15 + 49. 38 versus 111. 39 + 56. 87 seconds, p= 0. 556). Verbal encouragement cues did not improve performance time (between group effect, p= 0. 940). The curl up test was not significantly correlated with either <b>plank</b> session (r= 0. 410 and 0. 276 for <b>plank</b> session one and two, respectively). Surprisingly, the curl up test was positively correlated with participant height (r= 0. 578). Conclusion: This study suggests that the <b>plank</b> {{exercise is}} a reliable test; <b>plank</b> performance was comparable across testing sessions and not influenced by verbal encouragement. Further testing is needed to confirm validity of the <b>plank</b> exercise as a measure of core muscular endurance. We show here that <b>plank</b> performance was not correlated with the standard curl up test. However, the curl up test may not adequately measure core strength, given that increased body height was associated with higher curl up completion scores...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping <b>planks</b> that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
5|$|FIAT driver Aldo Weilschott {{climbed from}} fourteenth on lap three to third on lap five, before his car {{rolled off the}} <b>planks</b> outside Vibraye.

Despite a slow start, FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro moved up to third position, 15minutes behind Clément. Seventeen cars completed the first day; Henri Rougier's Lorraine-Dietrich finished last with a time of 8:15:55.0, two-and-a-half-hours behind Szisz. All the cars that were competing the next day were moved into parc fermé, a floodlit area guarded overnight by members of the ACF, to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century, burghs, towns that were granted certain legal {{privileges}} from the Crown, developed, {{particularly on the}} east coast with distinctive urban building patterns. They were typically surrounded by a palisade, and many had a castle. They usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross. There were houses for the nobles, burgesses and other significant inhabitants, which were often built in a relatively elaborate style {{and by the end of}} the period some would have slate roofs or tiles. Very little has survived of the houses of the urban poor. They were probably largely located in the backlands, away from the main street frontages. From Aberdeen and Perth there is evidence of nearly forty buildings dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, with walls of <b>planks</b> or wattles.|$|E
