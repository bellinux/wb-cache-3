40|$|The {{purpose of}} diploma thesis is {{to simplify the}} {{implementation}} of <b>printouts</b> in the project realisation phase of the SAP information system within a company. <b>Printouts</b> are often a neglected subject in the initiation process, as in the beginning, the main focus {{is always on the}} inventory of commercial processes and on the accurate creation of master data and settings. This is of course understandable, because a company must ensure its data are properly stored and processed. Unfortunately, {{at the beginning of the}} use of the information system, users tend to assess the quality of implementation by the appearance of prints, which is usually the final result or final piece of information of the running process in the SAP system. As far as the design and the coding of <b>printouts</b> is concerned, companies often run short of time, and therefore this part of the process is not included in the calculation of the budget frame. This diploma thesis describes the development of preconfigured SAP <b>printouts</b> for a sales module, covering the best practices from the business world. The implementation of sales <b>printouts</b> is parameterized by preconfigured <b>printouts.</b> Therefore, the intervention of an ABAP programmer is no longer needed. Outprints can be set by a SAP consultant...|$|R

25|$|Edward Lorenz was {{an early}} pioneer of the theory. His {{interest}} in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run his weather simulation. He {{wanted to see a}} sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a <b>printout</b> of the data that corresponded to conditions {{in the middle of the}} original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer <b>printout.</b> The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the <b>printout</b> rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome. Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.|$|E

25|$|Max tries {{programming}} his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. In {{the middle}} of printing out its picks, Euclid prints out a seemingly random 216-digit number, {{as well as a}} single pick at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max tosses the <b>printout</b> away. The next morning, he checks the financial pages and sees that the pick Euclid made was accurate. He searches desperately for the <b>printout</b> but cannot find it. Sol becomes unnerved when Max mentions the number, asking if it contained 216 digits. When Max questions him about the number, Sol indicates that he came across it many years ago. He urges Max to slow down and take a break.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Lorenz {{was running}} a {{numerical}} computer model to redo a weather prediction {{from the middle of}} the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the <b>printout</b> instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine the {{challenges}} posed by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) developments {{on the law}} and practice of admissibility of documentary evidence by Tanzanian courts. Particular focus is put {{on the issues of}} admissibility of computer <b>printouts</b> in courts. The main argument advanced in this thesis is that the Tanzania Evidence Act, 1967 (the TEA), being developed without reference to digital technologies, is inadequate to govern the admissibility of computer <b>printouts</b> with sensible results. The methodology of data collection deployed in this thesis is predominantly documentary review. Throughout, I have made substantial reference to the landmark case in Trust Bank Tanzania Ltd versus Le-Marsh Enterprises Ltd and Others to analyze the legal issues emerging from dealing with computer <b>printouts</b> in the courtroom when their admissibility is at issue. This case is the only available decision in Tanzania to deal with admissibility of computer <b>printouts.</b> In fulfilling the above mission, this thesis is organized in five Chapters. Chapter One sets out the aims of the thesis, background information to the problem of admissibility of computer <b>printouts</b> in courts, and literature review of previous works on the subject. The notion of electronic document is treated in Chapter Two. Chapter Three specifically focuses on bankers’ books {{as a result of the}} landmark case cited above. Chapter Four briefly reviews the evidentiary rules of admissibility of documentary evidence: the best evidence rule, the rule against hearsay and authentication at common law and under the TEA, 1967. It also deals with an interpretative approach of Tanzanian courts in admitting computer <b>printouts</b> in the form of bankers’ books. Chapter Five comprises concluding remarks and recommendations...|$|R
