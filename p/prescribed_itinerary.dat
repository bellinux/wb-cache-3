60|$|The nights were {{consumed}} in movement. Without shade the soldiers {{could not sleep}} by day. All ranks wearied, and the men would frequently, during the night marches, sink down upon the ground in profound slumber, only to be sternly aroused and hurried on. But {{the pace of the}} advance continued to be swift. On the 5th, the force, by a fourteen-mile march, reached Khula. Here they were joined by Sheikh Abdel-Azim with 150 Ababda camel-men from Murat Wells. Up to this point three Egyptians had died and fifty-eight men had been left behind exhausted in depots. A double ration of meat was issued to the whole force. The column moved on during the night, and arrived at Ginnifab at 8 A.M. {{on the morning of the}} 6th. Here startling news of the enemy was received. It was known that Mohammed-ez-Zein was determined to fight, and a trustworthy report was now received that a large force was coming down from Berber to support the Abu Hamed garrison. In spite of the long marches and the fatigues of the troops, General Hunter resolved to hurry on. He had already made up the day spent at Abu Haraz. He now decided to improve on the <b>prescribed</b> <b>itinerary,</b> accelerate his own arrival and anticipate that of the Dervish reinforcements. Accordingly the troops marched all through the night of the 6-7th with only a short halt of an hour and a half, so as to attack Abu Hamed at dawn. After covering sixteen miles of bad ground, the 'flying column' reached Ginnifab, 144 miles from Kassingar and only two from the Dervish post, at 3.30 on the morning of the 7th of August. A halt of two hours was allowed for the troops to prepare themselves. Half the 3rd Egyptian Battalion remained as escort to the transport and reserve ammunition, and then the force moved off in the darkness towards the enemy's position.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Julia {{set of the}} {{quadratic}} map fµ(z) = µz(1 − z) for µ not {{belonging to}} the Mandelbrot set is hyperbolic, thus varies continuously. It follows that a continuous curve in {{the exterior of the}} Mandelbrot set induces a continuous family of Julia sets. The focus {{of this article is to}} show that this family can be obtained explicitly by solving the initial value problem of a system of infinitely coupled differential equations. A key point is that the required initial values can be obtained from the antiintegrable limit µ → ∞. The system of infinitely coupled differential equations reduces to a finitely coupled one if we are only concerned with some invariant finite subset of the Julia set. Therefore, it can be employed to find periodic orbits as well. We conduct numerical approximations to the Julia sets when parameter µ is located at the Misiurewicz points with external angle 1 / 2, 1 / 6, or 5 / 12. We approximate these Julia sets by their invariant finite subsets that are integrated along the reciprocal of corresponding external rays of the Mandelbrot set starting from the anti-integrable limit µ = ∞. When µ is at the Misiurewicz point of angle 1 / 128, a 98 -period orbit of <b>prescribed</b> <b>itinerary</b> obtained by this method is presented, without having to find a root of a 2 98 -degree polynomial. The Julia sets (or their subsets) obtained are independent of integral curves, but in order to make sure that the integral curves are contained in the exterior of the Mandelbrot set, we use the external rays of the Mandelbrot set as integral curves. Two ways of obtaining the external rays are discussed, one based on the series expansion (the Jungreis-Ewing-Schober algorithm), the other based on Newton’s method (the OTIS algorithm). We establish tables comparing the values of some Misiurewicz points of small denominators obtained by these two algorithms with the theoretical values. Key words.

40|$|We use lobe {{dynamics}} in the restricted three-body problem to design orbits with <b>prescribed</b> <b>itineraries</b> {{with respect to}} the resonance regions within a Hill’s region. The application we envision is the design of a low energy trajectory to orbit three of Jupiter’s moons using the patched three-body approximation (P 3 BA). We introduce the “switching region, ” the P 3 BA analogue to the “sphere of influence. ” Numerical results are given for the problem of finding the fastest trajectory from an initial region of phase space (escape orbits from moon A) to a target region (orbits captured by moon B) using small controls...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{combinatorial}} approach to rigorously show {{the existence of}} fixed points, periodic orbits, and symbolic dynamics in discrete-time dynamical systems, {{as well as to}} find numerical approximations of such objects. Our approach relies on the method of `correctly aligned windows'. We subdivide the `windows' into cubical complexes, and we assign to the vertices of the cubes labels determined by the dynamics. In this way we encode the dynamics information into a combinatorial structure. We use a version of the Sperner Lemma saying that if the labeling satisfies certain conditions, then there exist fixed points/periodic orbits/orbits with <b>prescribed</b> <b>itineraries.</b> Our arguments are elementary...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is the {{numerical}} computation and continuation of homoclinic connections of the Lyapunov families of periodic orbits (p. o.) associated with the collinear equilibrium points, L 1, L 2 and L 3, of the planar circular restricted three-body problem (RTBP). We describe the method used that allows us to follow individual families of homoclinic connections by numerical continuation of a system of (nonlinear) equations that has as unknowns the initial condition of the p. o., the linear approximation of its stable and unstable manifolds and a point in a given Poincar´e section in which the unstable and stable manifolds match. For the L 3 case, some comments are made on the geometry of the manifold tubes and the possibility of obtaining trajectories with <b>prescribed</b> <b>itineraries.</b> Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply {{dynamical}} systems techniques {{to the problem}} of heteroclinic connections and resonance transitions in the planar circular restricted three-body problem. These related phenomena have been of concern for some time in topics such as the capture of comets and asteroids and with the design of trajectories for space missions such as the Genesis Discovery Mission. The main new technical result in this paper is the numerical demonstration of the existence of a heteroclinic connection between pairs of periodic orbits: one around the libration point L 1 and the other around L 2, with the two periodic orbits having the same energy. This result is applied to the resonance transition problem and to the explicit numerical construction of interesting orbits with <b>prescribed</b> <b>itineraries.</b> The point of view developed in this paper is that the invariant manifold structures associated to L 1 and L 2 as well as the aforementioned heteroclinic connection are fundamental tools that can aid in understanding dynamical channels throughout the solar system as well as transport between the "interior" and "exterior" Hill's regions and other resonant phenomena...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} heteroclinic {{connections and}} resonance transitions in the planar circular restricted 3 -body problem, with applications to {{the dynamics of}} comets and asteroids and the design of space missions such as the Genesis Discovery Mission and low energy Earth to Moon transfers. The existence of a heteroclinic connection between pairs of equal energy periodic orbits around two of the libration points is shown numerically. This is applied to resonance transition {{and the construction of}} orbits with <b>prescribed</b> <b>itineraries.</b> Invariant manifold structures are relevant for transport between the interior and exterior Hill’s regions, and other resonant phenomena throughout the solar system. 1 Introduction. Resonant Transition in Comet Orbits. Some Jupiter comets such as Oterma and Gehrels 3 make a rapid transition from heliocentric orbits outside the orbit of Jupiter to orbits inside that of Jupiter and vice versa. During this transition, the comet may be captured temporarily by Jupiter for several orbits. The interior orbit is typically close to the 3 : 2 resonance while the exterior orbit is near the 2 :...|$|R

500|$|With {{his friend}} Neil Hunter, he {{travelled}} to the Soviet Union in May 1932, sailing to Leningrad aboard the Smolny. Once there, they followed a <b>prescribed</b> tourist <b>itinerary,</b> visiting Moscow, Nizhni Novgorod, Stalingrad, Rostov-on-Don, Tiflis, Armenia, Batum, and Sukhum. Crawford admired what he {{perceived as the}} progress that the Soviet Union had made {{since the fall of}} the Tsarist regime, the increasingly classless and gender-equal status of its population, and the respect accorded to scientists in planning its societal development. He described his holiday with glowing praise in a book, A Tour of Bolshevy, stating that he did so to [...] "hasten the downfall of capitalism" [...] {{while at the same time}} making [...] "as much money as possible" [...] out of capitalists. The book was rejected by the publisher Victor Gollancz, after which Crawford decided not to approach other publishers, instead giving typed copies of the work to his friends. Although he became involved with the Friends of the Soviet Union and wrote several articles for the Daily Worker newspaper, he never joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, nor did he become involved in organised politics at all, perhaps fearing that to do so would jeopardise his employment in the civil service.|$|R
