5|$|The final {{part of the}} ISA, Part IV, {{contains}} various miscellaneous provisions. Some notable <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> {{described in}} this section.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be able to run for office, a {{candidate}} must be a Belarusian citizen by birth that is over thirty-five years old. The candidate must also reside within the Republic for ten years and he or she must be able to cast a ballot legally. The <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> set down in Article 80 of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> {{very similar to}} those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Private {{provision}} of public goods is generally inefficient and government <b>provision</b> must <b>be</b> financed by distortionary taxation. Given these observations, how should <b>provision</b> <b>be</b> organized? The paper investigates {{the interaction between}} tax instruments, preferences and <b>provision.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that purely government <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> rarely optimal. Instead, <b>provision</b> should either <b>be</b> entirely private, with appropriate price intervention, or combine public and private <b>provision.</b> Acknowledgements: Thanks <b>are</b> due to Richard Cornes, Todd Sandler and semina...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} <b>provisions</b> <b>were</b> {{made for}} connections and transfers {{to the new}} lines. It is of note that only four of these <b>provisions</b> <b>were</b> completed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Provision</b> <b>was</b> {{made for}} two side {{platforms}} just northeast of what later became Williams Landing station; this <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> removed during the Williams Landing station project.|$|R
5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> {{contained in the}} United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a {{provision}} of the Human Rights Act 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E
5|$|Sections 9A(3)(b) and 9A(3)(c) of the Interpretation Act {{contemplate}} {{the use of}} explanatory statements to a tabled bill or a speech made by a minister {{on the occasion of}} the motion for the second reading of the bill as interpretive aids. However, they do not permit reference to other explanatory statements or speeches. The statements the court may refer to under these <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> strictly the statements concerning the bill in question.|$|E
50|$|This <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> a {{subjective}} immission control. This <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> generic {{in that it}} covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement. The strength of this <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance {{and can be used}} as backup for more specific <b>provisions.</b> The weakness <b>is</b> that it may not give fair warning, may lead to arbitrary enforcement {{on the part of the}} regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener.|$|R
50|$|<b>Provision</b> <b>was</b> {{made for}} {{carrying}} the British Landing Craft Assault (LCA) in gravity davits, instead of American assault craft. <b>Provision</b> <b>was</b> also made for carrying Landing Craft Tank (LCT) and Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM), and NL pontoon causeways.|$|R
5000|$|The {{empowering}} <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> {{an extremely}} important aspect of any administrative action. Any action not authorised by the empowering <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> not allowed. In fact, section 6 of PAJA says that a court may set aside decisions where ...|$|R
5|$|The Act {{includes}} {{a number of}} miscellaneous points, mainly in Sections 5 and 6. The Act and its <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> taken to extend to The Crown, which can be held tortiously liable to the extent {{laid out in the}} Crown Proceedings Act 1947. It repeals Section 4 of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, replacing it with Section 4 of this Act, and unlike the 1957 Act does not allow any provisions or duties to be excluded or restricted.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} these <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> offset by taxes, fees, and {{cost-saving}} measures, {{such as new}} Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; {{there is also a}} tax penalty {{for those who do not}} obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143billion over the first decade.|$|E
5|$|These <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to}} those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in {{relation}} to theft. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; it follows that such property cannot {{be the subject of}} a charge of criminal damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} on a 5:2 split, with both women dissenting, {{found that the}} purpose of eliminating prostitution was a valid goal and that the <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> rationally connected and proportional to that goal. Accordingly, the <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> upheld.|$|R
50|$|Onboard food <b>provisions</b> had to <b>be</b> {{brought up}} to a 90-day load level for a {{capability}} to serve 38,000 meals without resupply. All material and <b>provisions</b> <b>were</b> hand loaded aboard through 30” diameter hatches. Once aboard all repair parts, consumables and <b>provisions</b> <b>were</b> stored in lockers dispersed throughout the ship.|$|R
25|$|Water and {{sanitation}} policies and strategies {{are defined by}} Ministries at the national level; economic regulation of services <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> undertaken by a national authority and environmental regulation by a National Council; service <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> the responsibility of various local entities.|$|R
5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in the Deep South. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> unenforceable.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{financial}} crisis has required implementing specific macro approach of financial regulation and supervision. Thus, macro-prudential policy recently attracted considerable attention among global central banks. Therefore this paper provides {{an investigation of}} Mongolian financial systemic risk using macro-prudential frame {{and the way to}} avoid financial systemic risk. Dynamic <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> determined as a countercyclical macro-prudential tool to avoid systemic risk. Procyclicality, cross- sectional systemic risk analysis, and financial soundness indicators proposed that Mongolian financial system is at credit risk because of large banking sector. After {{financial crisis}}, although <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> 389. 64 billion tugriks in January of 2010, dynamic <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> calculated as 62. 64 billion tugriks that confirmed dynamic <b>provision</b> <b>is</b> countercyclical capital buffering tool...|$|R
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
25|$|In addition, special <b>provisions</b> <b>are</b> {{for regular}} phonological rules in {{exceptions}} to transliteration (see Korean phonology).|$|E

The number of pupils eligible for free school meals is well above the national average. In the most recent OFSTED inspection, the nursery <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> praised for enabling children who enter the school with skills below that expected of similarly–aged children nationwide to achieve well through a stimulating and engaging curriculum and the nursery <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> good overall. The primary <b>provision</b> <b>was</b> praised for providing a safe and engaging learning environment in which children are able to progress to a level broadly comparable with children nationally and where pupils are extremely well behaved.
