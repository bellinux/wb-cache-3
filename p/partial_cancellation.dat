40|$|Abstract—Crosstalk is {{the major}} {{limiting}} issue in very high bitrate digital subscriber line (VDSL) systems in terms of bit-rate or service coverage. At the central office side, joint signal processing accompanied by appropriate power allocation enables complex multiuser processors to provide near capacity rates. Unfortunately complexity grows with {{the square of the}} number of lines within a binder, so by taking into account that {{there are only a few}} dominant crosstalkers who contribute to main part of crosstalk power, the canceller structure can be simplified which resulted in a much lower run-time complexity. In this paper, a multiuser power control scheme, namely iterative waterfilling, is combined with previously proposed <b>partial</b> crosstalk <b>cancellation</b> approaches to demonstrate the best ever achieved performance which is verified by simulation results.

The analysis presents sufficient conditions for precoder convergence and an upper bound on the precoder steady state error.

Based on this analysis we determine that convergence is achievable in most practical channels. These bounds also allow for the proper setting of the convergence parameters. The paper presents several simulations to demonstrate the theoretical results. In these simulations, setting the precoder parameters according to the analysis leads to convergence in less than 400 OFDM symbols.

The 2005 tournament, which was held at historic Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, was suspended during the 15th inning of the championship game due to stray gunfire generated from a gang fight that occurred on the street behind the center field wall; the teams and fans alike were forced to scramble for cover. As of 2017, nine of the last ten tournaments have been rotated through three cities within the state of Louisiana relatively drama-free; however, even then rain delays at the 2008 event required the use of an additional facility in an attempt to stay on schedule. Also, a multi-year contract to hold the tournament at LaGrave Field in Fort Worth, Texas starting with the 2013 tourney was canceled after only one year due to the venue being in a state of disrepair.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Space-time code designs {{based on}} a <b>partial</b> {{interference}} <b>cancellation</b> (PIC) group decoding have been recently proposed. The PIC group decoding complexity depends on the group size and is between the lowest linear receiver complexity and the highest ML decoding complexity. The symbol rate for a space-time code achieving full diversity with the PIC group decoding is also between those for the linear receivers and the ML decoding. In this paper, we propose a new decoding, called conditional PIC group decoding, that is between the PIC group decoding and the ML decoding. With the proposed new decoding, we obtain a new design criterion for space-time codes to achieve full diversity, which is also between {{the one with the}} PIC group decoding and the one with the ML decoding. We then present some designs that satisfy the new criterion and in the meantime have higher symbol rates than that for the PIC group decoding.

40|$|Abstract. In single-field inflationary {{models with}} a low sound speed, the {{orthogonal}} shape of the primordial bispectrum arises due to <b>partial</b> <b>cancellations</b> between equilateral-type shapes. This fact allows for a speed of sound cs as low as about 0. 01, which is actually weakly preferred by WMAP data. For such values, the trispectrum, scaling like 1 /c 4 s, is of order 108 and is therefore comparable to, and greater than, the 1 σ observational bound teqNL = (− 3. 11 ± 7. 5) × 106. Hence, the trispectrum is already constraining inflationary mechanisms candidates for generating an orthogonal bispectrum at the level hinted in WMAP data. If this signal persists in imminent Planck data, most of the parameter space of the simplest effective field theory of inflation will be under observational pressure, while a dedicated analysis will be needed for the substantial fraction of parameter space where we show that a qualitatively new, orthogonal, trispectrum naturally arises...|$|R

We, therefore, need to derive sub-optimum decoding algorithms in order to decode the watermarks. The proposed decoders are multiple watermark decoders that estimate multiple watermarks at the same time. These methods are based on the multi-stage demodulation method and the <b>partial</b> interference <b>cancellation</b> method, which are two CDMA multiuser demodulation methods. We applied them to the digital watermarking scheme. When the original image is blind, the image itself is regarded as noise. We, therefore, evaluated bit error rates both for cases when the original image is informed and blind. As a result, we found both the multi-stage watermark decoder and the <b>partial</b> interference <b>cancellation</b> decoder were effective for watermarking.
