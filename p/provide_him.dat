5|$|Despite the {{original}} visions, Wheatley was used sparingly and started only eight games {{over the course}} of four seasons with the Giants. Off the field, Wheatley moved his half-brother with him to New Jersey to keep him out of the tumultuous environment and to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> a strong learning environment.|$|E
5|$|Adkins {{was born}} in Boone County, West Virginia on April 29, 1937, where he spent his entire life. He was the {{youngest}} of ten children of Wid Adkins, a coal miner, and Alice Adkins, raised in a tarpaper shack on property rented from a local coal company. Born {{at the time of the}} Great Depression, Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very brief time, as few as two days of first grade.|$|E

50|$|The Scorcher's powers {{derive from}} his flame-throwing equipment, which <b>provides</b> <b>him</b> {{the ability to}} produce large {{quantities}} of fire under his control. His costume <b>provides</b> <b>him</b> with protection against heat and flame as well as conventional forms of injury. Later, he added a jet pack to his armor, giving him the ability to fly and to hover in place.|$|R
5|$|After {{finding an}} empty {{treasure}} in Antioch, Raymond-Roupen increased taxation, {{which made him}} unpopular among his subjects. He also refused to assist Leo against the Seljuqs. In 1217, Raymond-Roupen tried to capture Leo, but the Templars assisted Leo to flee to Cilicia. Bohemond visited John, King of Jerusalem, in Acre in autumn 1217. John recognized Bohemond as the lawful prince of Antioch early the next year, but did not <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with military assistance.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the realization that he neither the Finnish nor the German high command is going to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E

50|$|Desani, as an {{acknowledged}} {{teacher of}} these highly specialised techniques, has addressed {{a number of}} audiences. The Indian Consular Services have <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> with facilities to address select audiences in Karachi (Pakistan), Jakarta (Embassy of India), Tokyo (Embassy of India), as far as Sydney, Australia. The External Services of All India Radio, over the years, have <b>provided</b> <b>him</b> with a worldwide audience.|$|R
5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with the money to pay back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{released}} Ramírez in March 2004, {{without being}} promoted beyond the Class A level. Disappointed, Ramírez considered retiring from baseball. With {{the advice of}} his father, Ramírez decided that as Major League Baseball pitchers often relied on a slider or curveball as a complimentary pitch to their fastball, he would develop a different pitch. Ramírez spent his time that year learning a changeup on baseball fields in Miami, Florida, and did not pitch professionally during the 2004 season. Working with Maximo Soto, a fellow minor league pitcher released by the Angels, Ramírez developed his changeup to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with a new weapon in his pitching arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{was founded}} by Merek Lama Lodre Gyamsto in 1680-81 {{at the behest of}} the 5th Dalai Lama, who was his contemporary. When Merek Lama was {{experiencing}} difficulties in building the monastery at the chosen location of Tsosum, the ancient name for Tawang, the 5th Dalai Lama issued directives to the people of the area to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> all help. To fix the perimeter of the Dzong, the Dalai Lama had also given a ball of yarn, the length of which was to form the limit of the monastery.|$|E

5|$|The tyrant however, {{was able}} to persuade Vulso to reduce the price to 100 talents and promised to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with 1,000 medimni of wheat. Thus Moagĕtes managed to save his city. When the consul crossed the River Colobatus he was met by ambassadors {{from the town of}} Sinda in Pisidia. The ambassadors asked for {{assistance}} against the city of Termessus who had taken over all their country except for the capitol.|$|E
5|$|Wellington rose {{at around}} 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Blücher {{confirming}} {{that he would}} give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> {{with at least one}} corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps.|$|E
5|$|While under Iso's tutelage, Kanō {{witnessed}} a demonstration by the Yōshin-ryū jūjutsu teacher Totsuka Hikosuke and later {{took part in}} randori with members of Totsuka's school. Kanō {{was impressed by the}} Yōshin-ryū practitioners and realized that he might never be able to beat someone as talented as Totsuka simply by training harder: he also needed to train smarter. It was this experience that first led Kanō to believe that to be truly superior, one needed to combine the best elements of several ryū, or schools, of jūjutsu including Yagyu Shingan-ryū Taijutsu. Toward this end, he began to seek teachers who could <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with superior elements of jūjutsu that he could adopt.|$|E

5|$|While {{working at}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hinde had {{developed}} {{a close relationship with}} George Madison and his nephew John Madison. In 1829 Hinde wrote to their relation, President James Madison, to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with information about the Burr conspiracy for a political history the president was said to be writing. Madison denied the project, but asked Hinde to send copies of The Fredonian to include in his presidential papers. Hinde sent newspaper issues dealing with the Burr Conspiracy. The copies of the newspaper were filed with the President's papers.|$|E
5|$|Wiśniowiecki's indebted {{family was}} not able to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with a funeral his rank and fame deserved. In the end, he never {{received}} the large funeral and the temporary location of his body, the monastery of the Holy Cross at Łysa Góra, became his final resting place. His body was lost in the fire {{at the end of the}} 18th century, which also prevents a modern reexamination of the cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but her inability to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. It {{is more likely that}} it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E

5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} an office in the West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, the family moved to England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons who met the academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a junior rank on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six years would be spent on the reserve list. In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> a sense of direction lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E
5|$|British {{secret service}} agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he {{eventually}} gets the gangsters to agree to <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> a room. Bond tells Michel {{that he is in}} America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in Toronto, as part of his quest to ferret out SPECTRE. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots him.|$|E
5|$|Eliab Harvey {{was born}} in Chigwell, Essex to William and Emma Harvey. His father William Harvey was a Member of Parliament for Essex, but died when Harvey was only five years old, in 1763. Until 1768, Harvey was raised at the family estate of Rolls Park in Chigwell, which had passed to his elder brother William {{on the death of}} their father. Harvey then {{attended}} Westminster School for two years before moving to Harrow School in 1770. At the age of thirteen in 1771, Harvey was entered onto the books of the naval schooner HMS Mary, although he did not actually serve aboard the ship. Utilising a standard legal fiction of the time, Harvey's name was entered on the ship's books without his actual presence, a ruse that would <b>provide</b> <b>him</b> with sufficient seniority to gain rapid promotion when he did enter the navy. In his summer holidays from school, Harvey served at sea, joining HMS Orpheus in 1773.|$|E
