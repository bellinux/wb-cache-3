40|$|Research on {{adaptive}} survey designs (ASDs) {{demonstrated that}} an optimal balance between cost and survey quality can be obtained. Nevertheless, the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASD to inaccuracy in design parameters, such as estimates of response propensities, method effects and costs, {{needs to be}} addressed before an ASD can be implemented in practice. In this research, methodology to assess the inaccuracy in design parameters on the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASD is described. The <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASD is measured by determining the precision and change over time in the cost and quality indicators <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASD, where the cost and quality indicators are the result of estimating allocation probabilities by performing an optimization on the design parameters. The described methodology on how to design and to evaluate the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASD is applied to the Dutch Travel Survey for the years 2010 to 2013. This study demonstrated that the precision of the cost and quality indicators is not affected by inaccuracy in design parameters. However, it is shown as well that a change over time in design parameters has a negative impact on the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASD. <b>Performance</b> issues <b>of</b> the optimization process are discussed as well...|$|R

5|$|Parineeta (The Married Woman) is a 2005 Indian musical romantic drama film {{adaptation}} of the 1914 Bengali novella, Parineeta by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Directed by debutant Pradeep Sarkar, it was based upon a screenplay by the film's producer, Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The film featured Vidya Balan (In her Bollywood Debut), Saif Ali Khan and Sanjay Dutt in the lead roles. Raima Sen plays the supporting role of Lalita's chirpy cousin. Sabyasachi Chakrabarty plays the pivotal role of Shekhar's father. Diya Mirza, with a cameo appearance as Shekhar's fiancé and Rekha, with a cameo <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> night club (Moulin Rouge) singer, are other notable performances.|$|E

5|$|Theaters {{projected}} silent {{films with}} a variety of musical accompaniment. Depending on the film and the venue, accompanying music might have been the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> live pianist or orchestra, recorded music, or absent entirely. Some films were distributed with cue sheets indicating when music was to be played, or anthologies of specific songs to use as accompaniment. Especially between 1910 and 1912, these selections were often popular music, chosen because the song's title or lyrics related to the film in some way, in contrast to later efforts to provide music with appropriate texture. Beginning in 1910, Vitagraph provided lists of this nature for all of their films.|$|E

5000|$|Competitive {{analysis}} {{is a method}} invented for analyzing online algorithms, in which the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> online algorithm (which must satisfy <b>an</b> unpredictable sequence <b>of</b> requests, completing each request {{without being able to}} see the future) is compared to the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal offline algorithm that can view the sequence of requests in advance.
