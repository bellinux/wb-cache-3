40|$|Thesis (M. Com (Human Resource Management) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 Background and Aim: Talent Management {{has become}} an {{important}} topic of discussion in South African organisations as it becomes more difficult {{to attract and retain}} highly qualified, skilled and talented employees. Retention of talent does not only mean of ensuring that a well qualified workforce is retained but it is also linked to how these talents can be nurtured and motivated to consistently strive for success and growth. The more employees' talents are managed and developed the more they are likely to focus their energies on improving their performance and focus their individual energy {{to the success of the}} organisation. The main aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between Talent Management, <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> and Intention to Quit of employees in a Government institution in North-West. Method: A quantitative research approach was followed with data collected from employees of the North West Provincial Department (N= 127). The Human Capital Index (HCI), <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> Measure (PEM) and Intention to Quit Scale were administered. Principal Component Analysis, Reliability Analyses, Descriptive Analyses and Regression Analyses were applied. Results: Significant relationships exist between the following variables: • A positive relationship exists between Talent Management Practices and <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> dimensions. • A significant relationship exists between Talent Management Practices and Intention to Quit. • A negative relationship exists between Talent Management Practices and Employees' Intention to Quit. • A significant relationship exists between <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> and Intention to Quit. • A negative relationship exists between <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> and Intention to Quit Mediator between variables: • From the Multiple Regression analysis conducted on the relationship between Talent Management, <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> and the intention to quit it was determined that Talent Management Practices were not a statistically significant mediator for the relationship between <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> and the intention to quit. Practice Relevance: To date there are limited empirical research studies on Talent Management in the South African context. In addition no research has been done between on the relationship between Talent Management, <b>Productive</b> Organisational <b>Energy</b> and Intention to Quit in the South African context. The study will go a long way in an attempt to identify if there is a significant relationship between the concepts, and makes a contribution to the body of knowledge surrounding the relationship between the three concepts in the South African context. Furthermore, the study of measures of organisational energy which can be applied in the South African context will assist those interested in the relationship between talent management, <b>productive</b> organisational <b>energy</b> and intention to quit in the workplace. This research will thus point out the extent to which the application of Talent Management Practices in the organisational influence the <b>productive</b> organisational <b>energy</b> of employees and hence their intention to leave the organisation.

6000|$|In this 'mythus', Jove is the {{impersonated}} representation or {{symbol of}} the 'nomos'--'Jupiter est quodcunque vides'. He is the 'mens agitans molem', {{but at the same}} time, the 'molem corpoream ponens et constituens'. And so far the Greek philosopheme does not differ essentially from the cosmotheism, or identification of God with the universe, in which consisted the first apostacy of mankind after the flood, when they combined to raise a temple to the heavens, and which is still the favored religion of the Chinese. Prometheus, in like manner, is the impersonated representative of Idea, or of the same power as Jove, but contemplated as independent and not immersed in the product,--as law 'minus' the <b>productive</b> <b>energy.</b> As such it is next to be seen what the several significances of each must or may be according to the philosophic conception; and of which significances, therefore, should we find in the philosopheme a correspondent to each, we shall be entitled to assert that such are the meanings of the fable. And first of Jove:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{according}} to the Greek philosopheme or 'mythus', in these, or in this identity, there arose a war, schism, or division, that is, a polarization into thesis and antithesis. In consequence of this schism in the [Greek: to theion], the 'thesis' becomes 'nomos', or law, and the 'antithesis' becomes 'idea', but so that the 'nomos' is 'nomos', because, and only because, the 'idea' is 'idea': the 'nomos' is not idea, only because the idea has not become 'nomos'. And this 'not' must be heedfully borne in mind through the whole interpretation of this most profound and pregnant philosopheme. The 'nomos' is essentially idea, but existentially it is idea 'substans', that is, 'id quod stat subtus', understanding 'sensu generalissimo'. The 'idea', which now is no longer idea, has substantiated itself, become real as opposed to idea, and is henceforward, therefore, 'substans in substantiato'. The first product of its energy is the thing itself: 'ipsa se posuit et jam facta est ens positum'. Still, however, its <b>productive</b> <b>energy</b> is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product.

6000|$|The {{marriage}} {{choice of}} others is the inscrutable puzzle {{of those who}} have no eye for the fact that such choice is the great match of cajolery between purpose and invisible hazard; the blessedness of many lives is the stake, as intention happens to cheat accident or to be cheated by it. When the match is once over, deep criticism of a game of pure chance is time wasted. The crude talk in which the unwise deliver their judgments upon the conditions of success in the relations between men and women, has flowed with unprofitable copiousness as to this not very inviting case. People construct an imaginary Rousseau out of his writings, and then fetter their elevated, susceptible, sensitive, and humane creation, to the unfortunate woman who could never be taught that April is the month after March, or that twice four and a half are nine. Now we have already seen enough of Rousseau to know for how infinitely little he counted the gift of a quick wit, and what small store he set either on literary varnish or on capacity for receiving it. He was touched in people with whom he had to do, not by attainment, but by moral fibre or his imaginary impression of their moral fibre. Instead of analysing a character, bringing its several elements into the balance, computing the more or less of this faculty or that, he loved to feel its influence as a whole, indivisible, impalpable, playing without sound or agitation around him like soft light and warmth and the fostering air. The deepest ignorance, the dullest incapacity, the cloudiest faculties of apprehension, were nothing to him in man or woman, provided he could only be sensible of that indescribable emanation from voice and eye and movement, that silent effusion of serenity around spoken words, which nature has given to some tranquillising spirits, and which would have left him free in an even life of indolent meditation and unfretted sense. A woman of high, eager, stimulating kind would have been a more fatal mate for him than the most stupid woman that ever rivalled the stupidity of man. Stimulation in any form always meant distress to Rousseau. The moist warmth of the Savoy valleys was not dearer to him than the subtle inhalations of softened and close enveloping companionship, in which the one needful thing is not intellectual equality, but easy, smooth, constant contact of feeling about the thousand small matters that make up the existence of a day. This is not the highest ideal of union that one's mind can conceive {{from the point of view}} of intense <b>productive</b> <b>energy,</b> but Rousseau was not concerned with the conditions of <b>productive</b> <b>energy.</b> He only sought to live, to be himself, and he knew better than any critics can know for him, what kind of nature was the best supplement for his own. As he said in an apophthegm with a deep melancholy lying at the bottom of it,--you never can cite the example of a thoroughly happy man, for no one but the man himself knows anything about it.[124] [...] "By the side of people we love," [...] he says very truly, [...] "sentiment nourishes the intelligence as well as the heart, and we have little occasion to seek ideas elsewhere.

60|$|Now, compare a plant, thus contemplated, with an animal. In the former, the <b>productive</b> <b>energy</b> {{exhausts}} itself, {{and as it}} were, {{sleeps in}} the product or 'organismus'--in its root, stem, foliage, blossoms, seed. Its balsams, gums, resins, 'aromata', and all other bases of its sensible qualities, are, it is well known, mere excretions from the vegetable, eliminated, as lifeless, from the actual plant. The qualities are not its properties, but the properties, or far rather, the dispersion and volatilization of these extruded and rejected bases. But in the animal it is otherwise. Here the antecedent unity--the productive and self-realizing idea--strives, with partial success to re-emancipate itself from its product, and seeks once again to become 'idea': vainly indeed: for in order to this, it must be retrogressive, and it hath subjected itself to the fates, the evolvers of the endless thread--to the stern necessity of progression. 'Idea' itself it cannot become, but it may in long and graduated process, become an image, an ANALOGON, an anti-type of IDEA. And this [Greek: eidolon] may approximate to a perfect likeness. 'Quod est simile, nequit esse idem'. Thus, in the lower animals, we see this process of emancipation commence with the intermediate link, or that which forms the transition from properties to faculties, namely, with sensation. Then the faculties of sense, locomotion, construction, as, for instance, webs, hives, nests, &c. Then the functions; as of instinct, memory, fancy, instinctive intelligence, or understanding, as it exists in the most intelligent animals. Thus the idea (henceforward no more idea, but irrecoverable by its own fatal act) commences the process of its own transmutation, as 'substans in substantiato', as the 'enteleche', or the 'vis formatrix', and it finishes the process as 'substans e substantiato', that is, as the understanding.|$|E
6000|$|This vicarious or {{reflected}} egoism, accompanied {{as it was}} by {{a certain}} amount of <b>productive</b> <b>energy,</b> seemed to mark a return to a sort of moral convalescence. He walked about the groves with pencil and tablets, assigning this or that thought or expression to one or other of the three companions of his fancy. When the bad weather set in, and he was confined to the house (the winter of 1756-7), he tried to resume his ordinary indoor labour, the copying of music and the compilation of his Musical Dictionary. To his amazement he found that this was no longer possible. The fever of that literary composition of which he had always such dread had strong possession of him. He could see nothing on any side but the three figures and the objects about them made beautiful by his imagination. Though he tried hard to dismiss them, his resistance was vain, and he set himself to bringing some order into his thoughts [...] "so as to produce a kind of romance." [...] We have a glimpse of his mental state in the odd detail, that he could not bear to write his romance on anything but the very finest paper with gilt edges; that the powder with which he dried the ink was of azure and sparkling silver; and that he tied up the quires with delicate blue riband.[264] The distance from all this to the state of nature is obviously very great indeed. It must not be supposed that he forgot his older part as Cato, Brutus, and the other Plutarchians. [...] "My great embarrassment," [...] he says honestly, [...] "was that I should belie myself so clearly and thoroughly. After the severe principles I had just been laying down with so much bustle, after the austere maxims I had preached so energetically, after so many biting invectives against the effeminate books that breathed love and soft delights, could anything be imagined more shocking, more unlooked-for, than to see me inscribe myself with my own hand among the very authors on whose books I had heaped this harsh censure? I felt this inconsequence in all its force, I taxed myself with it, I blushed over it, and was overcome with mortification; but nothing could restore me to reason."[265] He adds that perhaps on the whole the composition of the New Heloïsa was turning his madness to the best account. That may be true, but does not all this make the bitter denunciation, in the Letter to D'Alembert, of love and of all who make its representation a considerable element in literature or the drama, at the very time when he was composing one of the most dangerously attractive romances of his century, a rather indecent piece of invective? We may forgive inconsistency when it is only between two of a man's theories, or two self-concerning parts of his conduct, but hardly when it takes the form of reviling in others what the reviler indulgently permits to himself.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are those}} who argue that because the general {{productive}} effort of the country during the war has been speeded up to half as much again as that of normal times, by tapping women's labour, by longer hours and general improvement in machinery and industrial ideas, the war will not result in any great economic loss, and that we may with care and effort avoid the coming of bad times after the first boom. The fact remains, and anybody can test it for himself, that there is a growing shortage of practically everything except--they say--cheap jewellery and pianos. I am no economist, but that does seem to indicate that this extra production has not greatly compensated for the enormous application of labour and material resources to the quick-wasting ends of war instead of to the slow-wasting ends of civil life. In other words, a vast amount of <b>productive</b> <b>energy</b> and material is being shot away. Now this, I suppose, would not matter, in fact might be beneficial to trade by increasing demand, if the purchasing power of the public remained what it was before the war. But in all the great countries of the world, even America, the peoples will be faced with taxation which will soak up anything from one-fifth to one-third of their incomes, and, even allowing for a large swelling of those incomes from war savings, so that a great deal of what the State takes with one hand she will return to the investing public with the other, the diminution of purchasing power is bound to make itself increasingly felt. When the reconversion of machinery to civil ends has been completed, the immediate arrears of demand supplied, shipping and rolling-stock replaced, houses built, repairs made good, and so forth, this slow shrinkage of purchasing power in every country will go hand in hand with shrinkage of demand, decline of trade and wages, and unemployment, in a slow process, till they culminate in what one fears may be the worst [...] "times" [...] we have ever known. Whether those [...] "times" [...] will set in one, two, or even six years after the war, is, of course, the question. A certain school of thought insists that this tremendous taxation after the war, and the consequent impoverishment of enterprise and industry, can be avoided, or at all events greatly relieved, by national schemes {{for the development of the}} Empire's latent resources; in other words, that the State should even borrow more money to avoid high taxation and pay the interests on existing loans, should acquire native lands, and swiftly develop mineral rights and other potentialities. I hope there may be something in this, but I am a little afraid that the wish is father to the thought, and that the proposition contains an element akin to the attempt to lift oneself up by the hair of one's own head; for I notice that many of its disciples are recruited from those who in old days were opposed to the State development of anything, on the ground that individual energy in free competition was a still greater driving power.|$|E

This study also aimed to identify key measures of success of organisations. Organisational energy has a critical role to play in driving both people behaviour and innovation in organisations, ultimately providing a competitive advantage. Both a quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted on the data collected from four case study organisations, comprising a total sample size of 47 respondents. The research consisted of three phases. Phase One, which made use of an open-ended qualitative survey, was directed at industry experts who were required to identify and recommend four small- to medium- sized high-energy information technology organisations to be considered for this research. Phase Two consisted of gaining approval to conduct research within four of the recommended case study organisations, and conducting an open-ended exploratory face-to-face interview with each Managing Director, with the {{objective of}} determining the success, energy state, key drivers, and performance measures of the organisations, as well as the factors that drive the energy of staff. Furthermore, each Managing Director completed the same self-administered questionnaire that formed the basis of Phase Three. This structured survey was used to gather the perceptions and opinions of each organisation’s staff members in determining: the energy state of the organisation, the key drivers of organisational energy, and the link between organisation energy and performance. Statistical analysis techniques were used to determine whether significant relationships exist between the drivers of organisational energy and their respective rankings; and between organisational energy and organisational performance. The study provided evidence that intrapreneurial orientation, collective identity, employee investment and leadership are the most significant drivers of <b>productive</b> organisational <b>energy</b> and confirmed the existence of a significant relationship between <b>productive</b> organisational <b>energy</b> and high performance organisations. Through this research, a model has been developed that can be utilised by leaders of organisations to leverage organisational energy in order to improve and measure organisational performance, thereby creating a sustainable competitive advantage.

The program's mission is to enable strategic investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and innovative practices across the U.S. by a wide range of government, community and business stakeholders, in partnership with state and local organizations and community-based nonprofits. WIP is made up of two programs focused on state and local governments and two teams that develop and deliver targeted technical assistance and strategic initiatives to state and local governments.|$|E
50|$|The Center‘s {{mission is}} to perform plant science {{research}} in genetics, breeding and horticulture, and further develop technologies {{to allow for the}} economic commercialization and sustainability of energy farms. The Center provides a common research platform to foster communication and cooperation among various national and international research institutions and organizations in the biofuel sector. From a global economics, environmental and social perspective, this collaboration will {{contribute to the development of}} more <b>productive</b> <b>energy</b> farms capable of supplying large quantities of plant-based (non-food) oils to replace the use of fossil fuels. This initiative has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs in the agri-business and alternative energy industries, expand the use of non-productive land, generate local business-to-business opportunities, reduce global dependency on oil reserves, and contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions.|$|E

People value money because they value the benefits of exchange. By exchange, productive human energy becomes a force for constructive human interactions capable of fulfilling a wide range of human needs. People value money because it enables them to enjoy the fruits of other people’s labor. It acquires interpersonal or transactional value, because it enables people to relate to one another constructively by exchanging goods and services. The value of money issues {{from the fact that it}} is a social product. ‘’’Money is a symbol for the value of relating positively to other people for material exchange.’’’ ...|$|E

Critical-fluid extraction {{involves the use of}} fluids, normally gaseous at ambient conditions, as extraction solvents at temperatures and pressures around the critical point. Equilibrium and kinetic properties in this regime are very favorable for solvent applications, and generally allow major reductions in the energy requirements for separating and purifying chemical component of a mixture...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} with designing new and untried applications, is the sheer effort needed to produce a testable prototype. Many projects get bogged down with production problems and hardware/software issues before they can even be tested for their basic functionality. This creates delays and frustrations within the project structure as well as creating unnecessary pressures on the project structure itself. This is equally true for the two main types of prototype/application created in design research: 1. a potential new product 2. a viable test bed to test an hypothosis. This paper investigates approaches, both practical and philosophical, to design processes and construction techniques that endeavour to bypass the most common pitfalls and stumbling blocks to a working prototype. In the main, the paper focuses on designing with ’Audio’ as an effective tool for quick, effective and emotive prototyping. Practical examples, both successful and catastrophic, are used to illustrate these aspects. In specific we will be comparing two audio based games, Journey and Beowulf, looking at their respective weaknesses and strengths. These prototyping techniques are realised, in the main, through easily available tools and recording techniques, based on standard audio-visual techniques. This provides a neat fast-track to developing ideas into viable applications. However while we can utilize a vast array of existing technologies to enable fast proto-typing, the most crucial element in successfully creating testbeds and bringing them before a test group is the intellectual approach to experiment design. Understanding the fundamental processes and isolating the essential questions the application is intended to answer has a direct bearing on our ability to channel available creative and <b>productive</b> <b>energies</b> with the maximum focus. Audio provides us with emotive tools highly suited to performing these kinds of functions. The advantage of taking this approach is a quick, flexible and, not least, economic route to getting vital early answers to practical research problems in IT user-based projects...|$|R
