The saturated atmosphere condition precludes consideration of conditional convective instability. A consideration of disturbances at each level which depends only on the zonal coordinates and time results in a set of differential equations which is linear in all respects except for the latent heating term in the thermodynamic energy equation.

With respect to the characteristics of energetics for the first-order solution, it is noted that, {{in the cases of}} both the dry mode and the first moist mode, the heat transport quantities due to the second-order eddy are small and opposite in sign to their respective transports. The non-quasi-geostrophic effects render the vertical motion field asymmetric in each of the regions involved and enter into the present treatment only as nonlinear terms. The moisture transport terms in the eddy-available potential energy equation is small by comparison to other individual terms in the cyclone scale motion's energetics calculation.

One {{of the most important}} aspects of MMA polymerization is its exothermicity and autoaccelerating behaviour, these characteristics can generate the occurrence of a runaway reaction. In a runaway situation the reacting system is close to adiabatic behaviour because it is unable to eliminate the heat that is being generated. An even worse situation can be reproduced in the laboratory with the Phi-Tec <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> calorimeter.

When the hot spot shifts to the reactor outlet, leading to the so-called <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> operation (PAO), the geometry-based criteria become either invalid or conservative {{with respect to the}} generalized one. In addition, when the generalized criterion is applied to the cases where the PAO is present, it is required to use the axial coordinate rather than reactant conversion as the independent variable to predict the critical conditions, and the obtained runaway boundaries in the reactor parameter plane coincide with the PAO boundaries...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{aerosols}} {{and clouds}} {{is one of}} the largest sources of uncertainty in understanding climate change. The primary scientific goal of this thesis is to improve the understanding of cloud-aerosol interactions by applying inverse modeling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Through a set of synthetic tests using a <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> cloud parcel model, it is shown that a self adaptive MCMC algorithm can efficiently find the correct optimal values of meteorological and aerosol physiochemical parameters for a specified droplet size distribution and determine the global sensitivity of these parameters. For an updraft velocity of 0. 3 m s- 1, a shift towards an increase in the relative importance of chemistry compared to the accumulation mode number concentration is shown to exist somewhere between marine (~ 75 cm- 3) and rural continental (~ 450 cm- 3) aerosol regimes. Examination of in-situ measurements from the Marine Stratus/Stratocumulus Experiment (MASE II) shows that for air masses with higher number concentrations of accumulation mode (Dp = 60 - 120 nm) particles (~ 450 cm- 3), an accurate simulation of the measured droplet size distribution requires an accurate representation of the particle chemistry. The chemistry is relatively more important than the accumulation mode particle number concentration, and similar in importance to the particle mean radius. This result is somewhat at odds with current theory that suggests chemistry can be ignored in all except for the most polluted environments. Under anthropogenic influence, we must consider particle chemistry also in marine environments that may be deemed relatively clean. The MCMC algorithm can successfully reproduce the observed marine stratocumulus droplet size distributions. However, optimising towards the broadness of the measured droplet size distribution resulted in a discrepancy between the updraft velocity, and mean radius/geometric standard deviation of the accumulation mode. This suggests that we are missing a dynamical process in the <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> cloud parcel model.   At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Submitted.

Pre-monsoon environment features more variability for both near surface moisture and free-tropospheric temperature and moisture profiles.

Pre-monsoon soundings also feature higher Lifting Condensation Levels (LCLs). LCL heights are shown {{to depend on the}} availability of surface moisture, with low LCLs corresponding to high surface humidity arguably because of the availability of soil moisture. A simple theoretical argument is developed and showed to mimic the observed relationship between LCL and surface moisture. We argue that the key element is the partitioning of surface energy flux into its sensible and latent components, that is, the surface Bowen ratio, and the way Bowen ratio affects surface buoyancy flux. We support our argument with observations of changes in the Bowen ratio and LCL height around the monsoon onset, and with idealized simulations of cloud fields driven by surface heat fluxes with different Bowen ratios...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of cumulus convection in a prevailing wind with vertical shear is studied by integrating {{a set of}} dynamic equations numerically. The motion is considered under the solenoidal condition in a vertical two dimensional plane. Aside from the eddy exchange, the <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> process is assumed in which the motion is moist adiabatic in saturated ascending air and dry adiabatic in the remaining air. The comparison between both cases, with and without vertical shear, is made concern-ing the time dependent evolution of convections and their energy conversion. In a prevail-ing wind field with vertical shear, the axial symmetry of the convection is destroyed and the axis of the convection cell tilts downwind with height. This results in {{the interaction between the}} convective motion and the prevailing wind which transforms the kinetic energy of the convection into that of the prevailing wind. Therefore, vertical wind shear tends to suppress the development of the convection in the vertical plane parallel to the wind. Moreover, the discrepancy which develops between the central axes of updraft and the warm regions of the convection decreases the conversion of potential to kinetic energy-one which contributes {{to the development of the}} convection. 1...|$|E

This paper examines the microstructure and mechanical properties of a composite material made of gypsum reinforced with cellulose fibers from discarded Kraft cement bag. Two different kinds of gypsum were used, natural gypsum (NG) and recycled gypsum (RG), both with an addition of 10 % by mass of limestone. For the production of samples, slurry vacuum de-watering technique followed by pressing was evaluated revealing to be an efficient and innovative solution for the composites under evaluation. The composite was analyzed based on flexural strength tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, secondary electron (SE) detection, and <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> calorimetry. The morphology of the fractured surfaces of flexural test samples revealed large gypsum crystals double the original size surrounding the fibers, but with the same overall aspect ratio. Natural fibers absorb large amounts of water, causing the water/gypsum ratio of the paste to increase. The predominance of fiber pullout, damaged or removed secondary layers and incrusted crystals are indicative of the good bonding of the fiber to the gypsum matrix and of the high mechanical resistance of composites. This material is a technically better substitute for the brittle gypsum board, and it stands out particularly for its characteristics of high impact strength and high modulus of rupture...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of inverse modeling to determine cloud-aerosol interactions using a <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> cloud-parcel model. Two-dimensional plots of the objective function, containing {{the difference between the}} measured and model predicted droplet size distribution, are presented for selected pairs of cloud parcel model parameters. From these response surfaces it is shown that the "cloud-aerosol" inverse problem is particularly difficult to solve due to significant parameter interaction, presence of multiple regions of attractions, numerous local optima, and considerable parameter insensitivity. Sensitivity analysis is performed to help select an appropriate objective function that maximizes information retrieval from the measured droplet size distribution to help identify the unknown model parameters. The identifiability of the model parameters will be dependent on the choice of the objective function; including the interstitial aerosol will aid the calibration of parameters describing the smaller aerosol mode. Cloud parcel models that employ a moving-centre based calculation of the droplet size distribution require both the X and Y components of the dN/dlogdp size distribution function to be explicitly included in the objective function. Other possible improvements identified include an improved representation of the resolution of the region of the size spectrum associated with droplet activation within cloud parcel models, and further development of fixed-sectional cloud models that minimize numerical diffusion. Despite these developments, powerful search algorithms remain necessary to efficiently explore the parameter space and successfully solve the cloud-aerosol inverse problem...|$|E

These equations show that the calorimetric signal is related with concentration in a complex way. Therefore, a comparison between the signals of the three basic kinetics reactions (zero, first and second order) was made, as a first step to obtain a standard procedure to follow chemical kinetics using a calorimeter. In order to help understanding this relationship, the initial rate method was applied to the simulated data to assess the relationship between the order and the kinetic constants calculated with those used for the simulations. As it was expected, the initial rate method for the calorimetric data, do not give a slope directly related with the order of the reaction, as it would be produced, for example, in data from a spectrophotometer. However, a linear relationship was found between what we call the “calorimetric order” and the kinetic order.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{atmospheric}} structure {{in response to}} the propagation of gravity waves under nonisothermal (nonzero vertical temperature gradient), wind-shear (nonzero vertical zonal/meridional wind speed gradients), and dissipative (nonzero molecular viscosity and thermal conduction) conditions. As an alternative to the “complex wave-frequency” model proposed by Vadas and Fritts, we employ the traditional “complex vertical wave-number” approach to solving an eighth-order complex polynomial dispersion equation. The empirical neutral atmospheric models of NRLMSISE- 00 and HWM 93 are employed to provide mean-field properties. In response to the propagation of gravity waves, the atmosphere is driven into three sandwich-like layers: the adiabatic layer (0 – 130 km), the dissipation layer (130 – 230 km) and the <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> layer (above 230 km). In the lower layer, (extended-) Hines’ mode or ordinary dissipative wave modes exist, whereas viscous dissipation and thermal conduction fail to exert perceptible influences; in the middle layer, Hines’ mode ceases to exist, and both ordinary and extraordinary dissipative wave modes flourish; in the top layer, only extraordinary wave modes survive, and dissipations affect the real part of the vertical wavenumber (m r) substantially; however, they contribute little to the imaginary part, which is the vertical growth rate (m i). We also analyze the transition of Hines’ classical mode to ordinary dissipative wave modes, describe both the upward and downward modes of gravity waves and illustrate nonisothermal and wind-shear effects on the propagation of gravity waves of different modes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAfter {{mixing of}} the cement with water, {{most of the}} {{anhydride}} products sustain the hydration process and {{this leads to the}} hydrate products, e. g. CSH, Ca(OH) 2, Afm and Aft. The mentioned hydration process is a highly complex phenomenon involving the chemically based thermo-activation inside the cement mortars during the early age hydration process. The chemo-thermal hydration reactions drasticaly increase at the early age of hydration after the mixing action and then it becomes less important and turns to be nearly asymptotic. The progress of the hydration phenomenon drives the material properties change during the very early age of cement hydration. Regarding the mortar and concrete, such hydration process would not be homogeneous through the cement matrix due to the aggregates presence. These inclusions will affect the temperature distribution as well as degree of hydration. In the current contribution, the chemical and thermal hydration have been firstly investigated by means of SEM observations using replica method and secondly by the 3 D-FEM numerical experiments including two different case studies using glass beads as aggregates. The numerical experiments match fairly good the experimental measurements obtained using a <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> testing setup for the case studies herein. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images observation demonstrates the gap spaces around the glass beads next to the external surfaces.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Romps (JAS, vol. 72, p. 3639 - 3646, 2015, {{hereafter}} R 15) {{argues that the}} moist-air static energy (MSE) is only approximately conserved for an adiabatically lifted parcel, and that the quantity "MSE - CAPE" {{could be used as}} a true conserved variable, where CAPE is the convective available energy. It is shown in this comment that the quantity denoted by CAPE in R 15 is the opposite of the convective available energy. It is explained that the vertical adiabatic ascent considered in R 15 is not realistic, since it generates condensed water of the order of 10 to 20 g/kg at height above 6 km. Moreover, the thermodynamic equations are written in R 15 by making several assumptions, not all of which are explicitly mentioned. This comment aims to clarify the hypotheses made in R 15. It will show that these assumptions call into question the validity of the moist-air internal energy, enthalpy and entropy functions in R 15. It also demonstrates that it is possible to obtain more precise and general formulations for moist-air energy, enthalpy and entropy functions, in particular by using the third law of thermodynamics. The large differences between the thermodynamics formulas derived in R 15 and those depending on the third law are illustrated by studying a realistic <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> vertical profile.

40|$|The Kepler {{observations}} {{indicate that}} many exoplanets are super-Earths, which brings about a puzzle for the core-accretion scenario. Since observed super-Earths {{are in the}} range of critical mass, they would accrete gas efficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to be rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we propose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat transport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is investigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> regions within radiative zones, which pushes the radiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling luminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given lifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for the turbulent diffusivity, ν_ critical. If ν_ turb>ν_ critical, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet would become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant. We find that even a small value of turbulent diffusion has influential effects on evolutions of super-Earths. ν_ critical increases with the core mass. We further ascertain that, within the minimum mass extrasolar nebula (MMEN), ν_ critical increases with the semi-major axis. This may explain the feature that super-Earths are common in inner PPD regions, while gas giants are common in the outer PPD regions. The predicted envelope mass fraction (EMF) is not fully consistent with observations. We discuss physical processes, such as late core assembly and mass loss mechanisms, that may be operating during super-Earth formation. Comment: 6 figures, ApJ accepted, comments are welcom...|$|E

At urban scales, local phenomena take place, governed by the building canopy, together with large scale motion driven by vertical stratification, air humidity and heat sources created in the canopy. This situation requires up-to-date tools able to reproduce the physics complexities. In the present work the large-eddy simulation technique is used to model the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer at urban scales. The model, LES-AIR, has been already developed and is able to take into account geometric complexities and thermal stratification. In the present work we show an improved version of the model where stratification and heat exchange associated to water moisture in air are considered. In particular will be considered the transport of the potential temperature Θ and of the humidity content of the air parcel. Both will be treated as active scalars and their influence on the flow will be taken into account via the Boussinesq approximation. Moreover the Lift Condensation Level (LCL) will be computed run-time in order to incorporate the effects of the change of phase of water in the limit of <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> processes. The model is tested against real scale data. The data from the meteorological station situated in Campoformido (UD), Italy, are included into the definition of the boundary condition at the surface. The Monin-Obukhov similarity theory is invoked in order to properly compute the momentum, heat and water vapor fluxes. In particular the gradient method is adopted to compute the values at the surface from the linear interpolation of the hourly available quantities. Different cases in different methodological situations are analyzed in order to enlighten the role of humidity in the atmospheric boundary layer.

40|$|The sizing of {{emergency}} relief vents to mitigate runaway chemical reactions in batch or semi-batch reactors {{is important for}} the protection of the workers and the process unit. This has been a preoccupation in industry for many years and different design methods have been proposed depending on the type of system (gassy, vapor, or hybrid) and the flow characteristics of the reacting fluid. Industry needs simple, reliable and accurate sizing methods so as not to undersize nor oversize the vent area. In the present work, runaway reactions in two chemical systems were studied experimentally with various apparatuses in volumes from 30 µl up to 10 liters (DSC, PHI-TEC I, ARSST, VSP 2, Vent Sizing Simulator, 800 ml reactor, and the standard 10 liter vessel used for the United Nations test for sizing rupture disks for vessels containing self-reactive materials). The two systems were the decomposition of a solution of DiButylPeroxide in butyrate and the esterification of acetic anhydride by methanol. The first system is virtually purely gassy, meaning that the overpressure in the vessel during runaway is produced by incondensable gas while the second is purely vapor, meaning that the overpressure is due to the vapor pressure of the reaction mass as the temperature rises. The data recorded were used to determine the A/V ratio for the emergency relief vent or rupture disk for a 1 m 3 vessel. Two categories of sizing methods were used. The similarity method was employed, whereby the A/V ratio is directly determined experimentally for a given set of conditions, with three reactors : 0. 11, 0, 8 and 10 liters. The calculation method was based on the DIERS approach and was employed using the data from bench-scale <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> calorimeters.

40|$|New methodologies are {{required}} to probe the sensitivity of parameters describing cloud droplet activation. This paper presents an inverse modeling-based method for exploring cloud-aerosol interactions via response surfaces. The objective function, containing {{the difference between the}} measured and model predicted cloud droplet size distribution is studied in a two-dimensional framework, and presented for <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> cloud parcel model parameters that are pair-wise selected. From this response surface analysis it is shown that the susceptibility of cloud droplet size distribution to variations in different aerosol physiochemical parameters is highly dependent on the aerosol environment and meteorological conditions. In general the cloud droplet size distribution is most susceptible to changes in the updraft velocity. A shift towards an increase in the importance of chemistry for the cloud nucleating ability of particles is shown to exist somewhere between marine average and rural continental aerosol regimes. We also use these response surfaces to explore the feasibility of inverse modeling to determine cloud-aerosol interactions. It is shown that the "cloud-aerosol" inverse problem is particularly difficult to solve due to significant parameter interaction, presence of multiple regions of attraction, numerous local optima, and considerable parameter insensitivity. The identifiability of the model parameters will be dependent on the choice of the objective function. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the location of the information content within the calibration data to confirm that our choice of objective function maximizes information retrieval from the cloud droplet size distribution. Cloud parcel models that employ a moving-centre based calculation of the cloud droplet size distribution pose additional difficulties when applying automatic search algorithms for studying cloud-aerosol interactions. To aid future studies, an increased resolution of the region of the size spectrum associated with droplet activation within cloud parcel models, or further development of fixed-sectional cloud models would be beneficial.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to investigate cloud-aerosol interactions by coupling a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to a <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> cloud parcel model. Despite the number of numerical cloud-aerosol sensitivity studies previously conducted few have used statistical analysis tools to investigate the sensitivity of a cloud model to input aerosol physiochemical parameters. Using synthetic data as observed values of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) distribution, this inverse modelling framework is shown to successfully converge to the correct calibration parameters. The employed analysis method provides a new, integrative framework to evaluate {{the sensitivity of the}} derived CDNC distribution to the input parameters describing the lognormal properties of the accumulation mode and the particle chemistry. To a large extent, results from prior studies are confirmed, but the present study also provides some additional insightful findings. There is a clear transition from very clean marine Arctic conditions where the aerosol parameters representing the mean radius and geometric standard deviation of the accumulation mode are found to be most important for determining the CDNC distribution to very polluted continental environments (aerosol concentration in the accumulation mode > 1000 cm&minus; 3 ) where particle chemistry is more important than both number concentration and size of the accumulation mode. The competition and compensation between the cloud model input parameters illustrate that if the soluble mass fraction is reduced, both the number of particles and geometric standard deviation must increase and the mean radius of the accumulation mode must increase in order to achieve the same CDNC distribution. For more polluted aerosol conditions, with a reduction in soluble mass fraction the parameter correlation becomes weaker and more non-linear over the range of possible solutions (indicative of the sensitivity). This indicates that for the cloud parcel model used herein, the relative importance of the soluble mass fraction appears to decrease if the number or geometric standard deviation of the accumulation mode is increased. This study demonstrates that inverse modelling provides a flexible, transparent and integrative method for efficiently exploring cloud-aerosol interactions efficiently with respect to parameter sensitivity and correlation...|$|E
40|$|Ammonium nitrate (AN) {{is widely}} used in the {{fertilizer}} industry {{and is one of}} the most concentrated forms of nitrogen fertilizer. However, AN is associated with various hazards including fire and explosion, which have occurred continuously in the past. AN is not considered a flammable or combustible material at ambient temperature and pressure; however, it is a strong oxidizing agent that can detonate under certain conditions. The primary goals of this work are to advance the understanding of the root causes associated with AN explosions and find out ways to make AN storage inherently safer by studying its thermal stability. This research focuses on condition-dependent AN decomposition, including the effect of additives, confinement, heating rate, temperature, thermal history, and sample size. <b>Pseudo-adiabatic</b> and adiabatic calorimeters are used to study the characteristics of AN decomposition. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are evaluated; models are proposed to predict the temperature rise of AN mixtures with additives; decomposition pathways are analyzed; safer AN storage conditions are identified; and AN explosion phenomenology are reported. In addition, this work discusses the role of water as a chemical, interfering physically and chemically with AN-related fire scenarios possibly leading to explosions. Thermal stability analysis showed that AN is stable up to approximately 200 ?C. Sodium sulfate is a good inhibitor for AN in that its presence can mitigate AN decomposition, while potassium chloride is a promoter because it intensifies the runaway reaction. AN should be separately stored from promoters, even when inhibitors are also present. Furthermore, exposure of AN to heat and storage in confined spaces should be avoided, and the size of AN piles should be limited. While water remains the choice for tackling AN-related fires, care should be taken in doing so. It must be understood that a significantly sufficient quantity of water should be used. Actually, evidence shows that insufficient quantities of water may exacerbate the fires and consequences. This work demonstrates the complexity and the multiple studies required for making AN safer as a fertilizer, providing suggestions to the fertilizer industry. It can also serve as a model for studies on various reactive chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2005. A well {{documented}} shallow foehn and gap flow {{case in the}} Wipp valley in Austrian Alps from 20 Oct 1999 provided an excellent opportunity to examine {{the applicability of the}} Reduced Gravity Shallow Water (RGSW) model to such a flow. For that purpose a synthesized data set was constructed from ground-based Doppler lidar and the P 3 aircraft in situ measurements. The validity of the P 3 data was crucial for further analysis so a detailed comparison between the radial wind component observed by the Doppler lidar and the same component of the horizontal winds measured in situ by the P 3 was performed. It was found that the two data sets can be combined to give accurate composite analyses of the flow in the Wipp valley. Comparison of available radio soundings have shown a significant increase of potential temperature increase (approximately 3 K) inside the valley, in the lee of the Brenner pass, in a deep layer from the ground to above the elevated inversion. It was found that the warming cannot be explained by a <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> process of condensation and fallout of precipitation, but {{can be attributed to the}} net subsidence over the main Alpine crest. Examining the along-gap wind and potential temperature fields, some qualitative similarities but also discrepancies between the observations and the RGSW model were found. By far the most significant discrepancy is the failure of the elevated inversion to behave like a material surface. The evidence found in the P 3 data suggested that the strong inversion observed near the top of the gap flow in the valley was not transported over the Brenner pass, but was created in the lee by the combined effects of subsidence and turbulent mixing. Further evidence that the elevated inversion was not dominating the flow dynamics was obtained by comparing two semi-idealized numerical simulations. The first simulation, which included an elevated inversion in the initial conditions, resulted in a flow qualitatively similar to the observed. However, the second simulation, in which the elevated inversion was replaced by a uniform potential temperature profile, also produced a very similar flow pattern...|$|E
