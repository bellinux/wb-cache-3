5000|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bass,</b> {{along with}} other bass species, such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and spotted bass, are all sport fish. Competitive tournament events and {{recreation}} events for bass fishing has developed into a multibillion-dollar industry. Fishing supports 828,000 jobs in the United States. <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> are successfully surviving in their environments and are listed as a species of [...] "least concern" [...] on the IUCN red list. Based on their population stability, <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> do not require any special monitoring or conservation management plans. As a sport fish, <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> are managed to some extent by regulations. There are slot limits for <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> on some bodies of water.

50|$|Large bass, {{northern}} pike, muskie, and walleye prey {{on young}} <b>rock</b> <b>bass.</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> compete with smallmouth bass for food.

50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> prefer clear, rocky, and vegetated stream {{pools and}} lake margins.

50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> {{are sexually}} mature at about 2 to 3 years of age. <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> are polygynandrous, {{in which both}} females and males have {{multiple}} mates during the breeding season. Spawning occurs from April to early June in warm waters ranging from 12 to 15 degrees Celsius, with females laying from 2,000 to 11,000 eggs.Like {{other members of the}} sunfish family, the male will dig a nest near the lake shallows, and will aggressively guard it. A spawning area may be heavily used, with several other <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> nests very close together. As a result, males can become quite aggressive as they attempt to defend territory and attract and hold females. <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> lack courtship displays, so the female enters the nest and joins the male in his circular behavior. Both the female and male simultaneously release their sperm and eggs into the nest. The male guards and fans the eggs, and later raises the young for a short time. <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> are known to grow quickly.|$|R

40|$|Stable isotope and gut content {{analyses}} were completed on multiple age classes of Detroit River <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> (Ambloplites rupestris) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) {{to determine the}} importance of resource partitioning in littoral centrarchids. � 15 N signatures ranged from 10. 9 ‰ to 12. 8 ‰ in young of the year (YOY) to 7 -yrold <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> and from 10. 3 ‰ to 12. 1 ‰ for YOY to 4 -yr-old bluegills. YOY diets for both species had similar proportions of benthic and epiphytic prey, with YOY <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> also having a planktonic dietary component. YOY <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> consequently had a lighter � 13 C signature than similarly aged bluegills, suggesting that these individuals are able to exploit prey from more energetically efficient open water habitats. <b>Rock</b> <b>bass</b> became piscivorous during the first full year of growth, with concomitant depletion of the � 13 C signature with increasing age, typical of an isotopically depleted phytoplankton � 13 C signal. By 7 yr of age, <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> diets were dominated by crayfish and cyprinids, with no further significant depletion of the � 13 C signature. For bluegills, diets were dominated by small benthic invertebrates, regardless of age. � 13 C signatures in YOY and 1 -yr-old bluegills remained enriched relative to <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> of the same age, suggesting that bluegill sunfish remain in nearshore shallower littoral habitats for {{a greater proportion of}} their life history because of increased predation pressure.
