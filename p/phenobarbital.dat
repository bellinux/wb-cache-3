5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as <b>phenobarbital</b> or bromide in dogs and <b>phenobarbital</b> in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 the Institute for Safe Medication Practices {{reported}} that confusion between grains and grams {{led to a}} patient receiving <b>phenobarbital</b> 0.5grams instead of 0.5 grains (0.03grams) after the practitioner misread the prescription.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1800s, {{the first}} {{effective}} anti-seizure medication, bromide, was introduced. The first modern treatment, <b>phenobarbital,</b> {{was developed in}} 1912, with phenytoin coming into use in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The least {{expensive}} anticonvulsant is <b>phenobarbital</b> at around $5USD a year. The World Health Organization {{gives it a}} first-line recommendation {{in the developing world}} and it is commonly used there. Access however may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving <b>phenobarbital.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} drugs were the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and <b>phenobarbital</b> (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as <b>phenobarbital,</b> phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, <b>phenobarbital,</b> phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> is {{sometimes}} used for alcohol detoxification and benzodiazepine detoxification for its sedative and anticonvulsant properties. The benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and oxazepam (Serax) have largely replaced <b>phenobarbital</b> for detoxification.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of all types of seizures except absence seizures. It is no less effective at seizure control than phenytoin, however <b>phenobarbital</b> is not as well tolerated. <b>Phenobarbital</b> may provide a clinical advantage over carbamazepine for treating partial onset seizures. Carbamazepine may provide a clinical advantage over <b>phenobarbital</b> for generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Its very long active half-life means for some people doses {{do not have to be}} taken every day, particularly once the dose has been stabilized over a period of several weeks or months, and seizures are effectively controlled.|$|E
25|$|Primidone, like <b>phenobarbital</b> and the benzodiazepines, {{can also}} cause {{sedation}} in the newborn and also withdrawal within {{the first few days}} of life; <b>phenobarbital</b> is the most likely out of all of them to do that.|$|E
25|$|Barbiturates {{including}} thiopental, <b>phenobarbital,</b> primidone, etc.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam {{increases}} {{the levels of}} primidone and <b>phenobarbital.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{increases}} the serum levels of <b>phenobarbital.</b>|$|E
25|$|Barbiturates such as <b>phenobarbital</b> {{were long}} used as anxiolytics and hypnotics, but today {{have been largely}} {{replaced}} by benzodiazepines for these purposes because the latter are less toxic in overdose. However, barbiturates are still used as anticonvulsants (e.g., <b>phenobarbital</b> and primidone) and general anesthetics (e.g., sodium thiopental).|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> {{can also}} be used to relieve cyclic {{vomiting}} syndrome symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> has an oral {{bioavailability}} {{of about}} 90%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached eight to 12 hours after oral administration. It {{is one of}} the longest-acting barbiturates available – it remains in the body {{for a very long time}} (half-life of two to seven days) and has very low protein binding (20 to 45%). <b>Phenobarbital</b> is metabolized by the liver, mainly through hydroxylation and glucuronidation, and induces many isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system. Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) is specifically induced by <b>phenobarbital</b> via the CAR/RXR nuclear receptor heterodimer. It is excreted primarily by the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands alone, {{there were}} thirty-four cases of {{suspected}} primidone poisoning between 1978 and 1982. Out of these, Primidone poisoning {{was much less}} common than <b>phenobarbital</b> poisoning. Twenty-seven of those adult cases were reported to the Dutch National Poison Control Center. Out of these, one person taking it with phenytoin and <b>phenobarbital</b> died, twelve became drowsy and four were comatose.|$|E
25|$|The {{percentage}} of primidone converted to <b>phenobarbital</b> {{has been estimated}} to be 5% in dogs and 15% in humans. Work done twelve years later found that the serum <b>phenobarbital</b> 0.111mg/100 mL for every mg/kg of primidone ingested. Authors publishing a year earlier estimated that 24.5% of primidone was metabolized to <b>phenobarbital.</b> However, the patient reported by Kappy and Buckley {{would have had a}} serum level of 44.4mg/100 mL instead of 8.5mg/100 mL if this were true for individuals who have ingested large dose. The patient reported by Morley and Wynne would have had serum barbiturate levels of 50mg/100 mL, which would have been fatal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> {{properties}} {{can effectively}} reduce tremors and seizures associated with abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{drugs for}} treatment of status epilepticus are benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam or diazepam. If these fail, then phenytoin may be used, with <b>phenobarbital</b> being an alternative in the US, but used only third-line in the UK. Failing that, the only treatment is anaesthesia in intensive care. The World Health Organization gives <b>phenobarbital</b> a first-line recommendation {{in the developing world}} and it is commonly used there.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{metabolism}} of primidone into <b>phenobarbital</b> was {{inversely related}} to age; the highest rates were in the oldest patients (the maximum age being 55). People aged 70–81, relative to people aged 18–26, have decreased renal clearance of primidone, <b>phenobarbital,</b> and PEMA, in ascending order of significance, {{and that there was}} a greater proportion of PEMA in the urine. The clinical significance is unknown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> is a {{cytochrome}} P450 inducer, {{and is used}} {{to reduce}} the toxicity of some drugs.|$|E
25|$|The first {{barbiturate}} drug, barbital, was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering and {{was first}} marketed as Veronal by Friedr. Bayer et comp. By 1904, several related drugs, including <b>phenobarbital,</b> had been synthesized by Fischer. <b>Phenobarbital</b> {{was brought to}} market in 1912 by the drug company Bayer as the brand Luminal. It remained a commonly prescribed sedative and hypnotic until the introduction of benzodiazepines in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Caution {{is to be}} {{used with}} children. Of {{anticonvulsant}} drugs, behavioural disturbances occur most frequently with clonazepam and <b>phenobarbital.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike carbamazepine, {{there are}} few case reports {{mentioning}} the use of primidone {{in the treatment of}} trigeminal neuralgia. The first, published in the October 10, 1957 issue of Gazette Médicale de France, has no abstract. The second one was a case report of a woman taking primidone and then <b>phenobarbital</b> for trigeminal neuralgia. She developed toxic epidermal necrolysis, as well as endocarditis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The second recurrence, induced by <b>phenobarbital,</b> killed her within five weeks of onset.|$|E
25|$|In massive doses, <b>phenobarbital</b> is {{prescribed}} to {{terminally ill patients}} {{to allow them to}} end their life through physician assisted suicide.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{review on}} {{treatment}} for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous lidocaine {{as a second}} line treatment, if <b>phenobarbital</b> fails to stop seizures.|$|E
25|$|Primidone, carbamazepine, <b>phenobarbital</b> and {{phenytoin}} {{are among}} the most potent hepatic enzyme inducing drugs in existence. This enzyme induction occurs at therapeutic doses. In fact, people taking these drugs have displayed the highest degree of hepatic enzyme induction on record. In addition to being an inducer of CYP3A4, it is also an inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants, as well as potentially increasing the toxicity of tobacco products. Its metabolite, <b>phenobarbital,</b> is a substrate of CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP3A5, CYP1E1, and the CYP2E subfamily. The gene expression of these isoenzymes is regulated by human pregnane receptor X (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). <b>Phenobarbital</b> induction of CYP2B6 is mediated by both. Primidone does not activate PXR.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme inducersMay cause {{decreased}} {{levels of}} testosterone (and other sex steroid) levels: <b>Phenobarbital</b> and Dilantin (seizure medicines), Rifampin (antibiotic), and Alcohol.|$|E
25|$|In infants {{suspected}} of neonatal biliary atresia, <b>phenobarbital</b> {{is used in}} preparation for a 99mTc-IDA hepatobiliary study that differentiates atresia from hepatitis or cholestasis.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{intermittent}} porphyria, hypersensitivity to any barbiturate, prior {{dependence on}} barbiturates, severe respiratory insufficiency and hyperkinesia in children are contraindications for <b>phenobarbital</b> use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> {{is one of}} {{the initial}} drugs of choice to treat {{epilepsy}} in dogs, and is the initial drug of choice to treat epilepsy in cats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> {{is used as}} a {{secondary}} agent to treat newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome, a condition of withdrawal symptoms from exposure to opioid drugs in utero.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenobarbital</b> is a {{cytochrome}} P450 hepatic enzyme inducer. Drugs {{that are}} metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system will decrease effectiveness because of faster clearance from the system.|$|E
25|$|Rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and <b>phenobarbital</b> {{increase}} the metabolism of diazepam, thus decreasing drug levels and effects. Dexamethasone and St John's wort also {{increase the}} metabolism of diazepam.|$|E
