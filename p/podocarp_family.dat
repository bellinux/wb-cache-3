The genus was first described by Solander in 1786, and formerly included many more species, which were divided into sections A, B, and C by Florin in 1931. The revisions of de Laubenfels and Quinn (see references), reclassified the former section A as the new genus Falcatifolium, divided Section C into new genera Lepidothamnus, Lagarostrobos and Halocarpus, and retained Section B as genus Dacrydium.|$|E
50|$|Nageia is a genus of {{conifers}} {{belonging to}} the <b>podocarp</b> <b>family</b> Podocarpaceae. Nageia includes evergreen shrubs and trees, from one to 54 meters in height. A 2009 treatment of the genus recognized five species. Some authors consider Nageia formosensis to be a separate species from Nageia nagi, thus recognizing six species. The podocarp genera have been reshuffled by various botanists. Most recently, several species formerly classed as Nageia were moved to the new genus Retrophyllum, while Nageia falcata and Nageia mannii were moved to the new genus Afrocarpus.|$|E
5000|$|Microcachrys tetragona (Creeping Pine or Creeping Strawberry Pine) is {{a species}} of {{dioecious}} conifer belonging to the <b>podocarp</b> <b>family</b> (Podocarpaceae). It is the sole species of the genus Microcachrys. The plant is endemic to western Tasmania, where it is a low shrub growing to 1 m tall at high altitudes.

Podocarpus are evergreen shrubs or trees, usually from 1 to 25 m tall, known to reach 40 m at times. The cones have {{two to five}} fused cone scales which form a fleshy, berry-like, brightly coloured receptacle at maturity. The fleshy cones attract birds which then eat the cones and disperse the seeds in their droppings. There are approximately 97 to 107 species in the genus depending on the circumscription of the species.|$|E
5000|$|Saxegothaea is a genus {{comprising}} {{a single}} species, Saxegothaea conspicua. It is a conifer in the <b>podocarp</b> <b>family</b> Podocarpaceae, native to southern South America. It grows in Chile and Argentina from 35° to 46° South latitude; in its northernmost natural distribution it grows between 800 and 1000 (2600-3300 ft) m {{above sea level}} and in the south it lives at sea level[...] The species is most often known by its genus name, or sometimes as female maniu (a translation of its name in Spanish) and Prince Albert's yew; in South America it is known as mañío hembra or maniú hembra.|$|E
