40|$|Researchers at the Timken Company {{conceived}} {{a project}} to develop an on-line instrument for wall thickness measurement of steel seamless mechanical tubing based on laser ultrasonic technology. The instrument, which has been installed and tested at a <b>piercing</b> <b>mill,</b> provides data on tube eccentricity and concentricity. Such measurements permit fine-tuning of manufacturing processes to eliminate excess material in the tube wall and therefore provide a more precisely dimensioned product for their customers. The resulting process energy savings are substantial, as is lowered environmental burden. The expected savings are $ 85. 8 million per year in seamless mechanical tube piercing alone. Applied across the industry, this measurement has a potential of reducing energy consumption by 6 x 10 {sup 12 } BTU per year, greenhouse gas emissions by 0. 3 million metric tons carbon equivalent per year, and toxic waste by 0. 255 million pounds per year. The principal technical contributors to the project were the Timken Company, Industrial Materials Institute (IMI, a contractor to Timken), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Timken provided mill access as well as process and metallurgical understanding. Timken researchers had previously developed fundamental ultrasonic analysis methods on which this project is based. IMI developed and fabricated the laser ultrasonic generation and receiver systems. ORNL developed Bayesian and wavelet based real-time signal processing, spread-spectrum wireless communication, and explored feature extraction and pattern recognition methods. The resulting instrument has successfully measured production tubes at one of Timken's piercing mills. This report concentrates on ORNL's contribution through the CRADA mechanism. The three components of ORNL's contribution were met with mixed success. The real-time signal-processing task accomplished its goal of improvement in detecting time of flight information {{with a minimum of}} false data. The signal processing algorithm development resulted in a combination of processing steps that can be set to generate no spoofs from noise, while simultaneously missing fewer than 10 % of good trials. The algorithm leads to a 95 % probability that the estimate of time of flight is good to within 4 time bins or fewer for laser excitations above 30 mJ for the first two echoes of the signal. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the algorithm indicate that the algorithm is very robust against errors for excitations above at 35 mJ and above, tolerable at 30 mJ and unacceptable below 30 mJ...|$|E

50|$|Henry Lillie Pierce (1825-1896) {{was the son}} of Colonel Jesse Pierce (1788-1856) and Elizabeth Vose Lillie Pierce (1786-1871) of Stoughton, Massachusetts. His {{father had}} been an {{educator}} at Milton Academy and later served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As a gentleman farmer, he maintained a large farm in Stoughton (formerly a part of Dorchester) until he moved, in 1849, to Washington Street in the Lower Mills of Dorchester {{with his wife and two}} sons. Edward Lillie Pierce was then attending Brown University, while Henry Lillie Pierce was at Milton Academy and was to later attend the Bridgewater Normal School. In 1849, Henry L. Pierce was hired to work as a clerk at the Baker Chocolate Company. Walter Baker, the owner of the chocolate company and stepbrother of Pierce’s mother, hired him at a salary of three dollars per week. However, as their political views invariably clashed and caused tremendous animosity (Pierce was a vociferous and deeply opinionated Free-Soiler), Pierce left after only a year of politically tinged employment to take up newspaper work in the Midwest. At the request of Sydney Williams, brother-in-law of Baker and managing director of the chocolate <b>mill,</b> <b>Pierce</b> returned to Boston after a year and was appointed manager of the Walter Baker Counting House at 32 South Market Street in Boston (now a part of the Quincy Market retail area).

50|$|William Wood {{was born}} in 1858 in a cottage on Pease Point Way, in Edgartown, Massachusetts, {{on the island of}} Martha's Vineyard. His parents, Grace (Emma) Wood and William Wood Sr., were Portuguese {{immigrants}} from the Azores. His father, William Sr., Guilherme Medeiros Silva was a crewman on a New Bedford whaling ship from 1853 until his death in 1871. William Jr. was only 12 years old when his father died, and had {{to drop out of school}} and find a job to provide for his mother and younger siblings. Fortunately for William Wood, a wealthy New Bedford textile manufacturer named Andrew Pierce offered him a job working in his Wamasutta Cotton <b>Mill.</b> <b>Pierce</b> would soon see that hiring young William would prove to be extremely beneficial. Pierce was impressed with Wood's work and promoted him to the manufacturing department, where he learned cost structures and figures. At the age of eighteen, Wood left New Bedford for Philadelphia. With the help of Andrew Pierce, William was able to find a good job with a Philadelphia brokerage firm. This is where he learned about stocks and bonds. After tiring of Philadelphia, he returned to New Bedford and worked at a bank. According to the Dukes County Intelligencer, when a Fall River textile company went bankrupt, its new manager hired William as paymaster. Then in 1885, the Washington Mill in Lawrence went bankrupt and was purchased by Frederick Ayer of Lowell. Frederick Ayer and his brother James Cook Ayer were successful patent medicine producers.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{established}} to examine current viable opportunities {{for the expansion of}} the wood products industry in Clallam and Jefferson counties. The study updated existing and future harvest level projections in Clallam and Jefferson counties, highlighting the potential new supplies. It also examined precommercial thinning volumes on state and federal lands. The harvest level findings are used to complete an analysis including the flow, species and size of the raw material supply required to manufacture value-added products. Three opportunities are explored: Oriented strand board production utilizing harvest and current manufacturing waste material, biomass-based energy production, and second tier value-added products from production of random length alder. We projected harvest levels using timber harvest data by grade and species provided by the Department of Revenue Timber Tax Division and the Department of Natural Resources Marketing Division. These data provided a breakout of average volumes per acre by species and grade observed for timber sales in 2004. We applied the average volumes per acre to a projection of harvest acres constructed by Atterbury Consultants and published in their report for the council dated 2000. The analysis of the sales data indicated an average volume of nearly 40 thousand board feet (mbf) per acre. The majority of this volume is in # 2 and # 3 sawmill logs; over 15 mbf in each log class. The next highest volume is in the # 4 sawmill log with 7. 5 mbf. The greatest volume per acre is in western hemlock with over 15 mbf, followed by Douglas fir with 8. 8 mbf. An estimated 8, 070 acres are harvested annually during the projection period 2000 to 2004. Using the per acre averages calculated above we determined annual harvest levels to reach 322, 265 mbf during this period. For the period 2015 to 2020, harvest acres are projected to reach 8, 618 with an estimated annual harvest level of 344, 148 mbf. The majority of the annual harvest level during the period 2000 - 2004 is in # 2 and # 3 sawmill logs, over 300, 000 mbf equally distributed. Western hemlock annual harvest levels are 124, 236 mbf, followed by Douglas fir with 71, 293 mbf. Red alder annual harvests are estimated at 22, 849 mbf during the period 2000 to 2004. Timber consumed by local mills amounted to 122, 033 mbf for 2002, with an estimated slightly higher consumption for 2004. Total consumption of Clallam and Jefferson county timber by Washington sawmills reached nearly 230, 000 mbf in 2002. Over 90, 000 mbf of timber is exported to mills located in other Washington counties. The majority of this timber flow, about 77, 000 mbf went across the Puget Sound to Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, King and <b>Pierce</b> county <b>mills.</b> The annual volume of precommercial thinning is estimated at 125, 000 to 180, 000 green tons from federal and state lands. The majority of this thinned material is on State lands involving 4, 000 to 6, 000 acres annually for the next decade. The majority of the thinning volume is not commercial due to restrictions imposed by terrain conditions that lead to prohibitive harvesting and extraction costs. Oriented Strand Board (OSB) represents a product that utilizes low grade materials to produce a substitute for plywood. First generation OSB manufacturing plants were about 50 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis in size. Newer generation plants (continuous flow) are much larger in size; the latest plant capable of producing 800 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis. The majority of new plants have a capacity of 500 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis. Resource availability converting the volume of # 4 sawmill and utility grade logs into chip materials was estimated at 492, 000 green tons, or about enough material to produce 313 million square feet 3 / 8 inch basis of OSB. At most the projections reached 335 million square feet by 2020. Since the volume of required materials is much smaller than what a competitive new facility would consume, the potential for a new OSB plant in the region was determined early on during the study to be non-existent. Other limitations were also evident including the lack of sufficient hardwood resources, and the fact that current uses of chip materials and lower-sized saw logs would decrease the availability of raw materials to the new plant. Biomass-based energy can be produced by burning wood waste. To evaluate this option we first determined the fuel value of materials in the region. If a sufficient fuel value was present, we then estimated the competitiveness of the material for use in energy production. To determine the fuel value of the materials in the region we estimated the size of a potential power plant by converting the volume of # 4 saw mill and utility logs into green tons. This conversion indicated that the power plant sizes could ranged from 37 to 45 megawatts, representing substantial amounts of energy production. We then calculated the competitiveness aspects of the material if it were used to produce energy. Plants of these sizes in Vermont purchased chips at a price that ranges from $ 12 to $ 21 per green ton, a price that is substantially lower than current chip prices paid by local pulp mills, and lower than estimated harvesting and delivery costs (about $ 35 per dry ton). In addition the low price per kilowatt hour (about $ 0. 03) acts as a disincentive to utilize woody biomass as an energy source. These calculations indicate that wood as an energy source is uncompetitive with current energy pricing. Also, harvesting and delivery costs are still too high for woody biomass to be viable, even if supply is not a constraining factor. The utilization of red alder has increased dramatically, and the projected start of a new alder mill in 2006 suggested analyzing potential value-added products such as cabinetry, furniture and door manufacturing. We conducted interviews with the new mill manager and regional end-users of alder and determined constraints associated with attracting a value-added facility to the region. The constraints identified during these interviews included the inability to diversify products should a new manufacturing plant focus exclusively on alder. Various wood species are used in cabinetry, door and furniture manufacture. Currently alder is well received, but demand is highly responsive to changes in consumer preferences. Diversification of various species is perceived to be an important aspect of a successful end-user. The success of a value-added manufacturer will depend on its ability to utilize various sources of lumber and other materials. Our study findings included the following. The two county region is a net exporter of wood fiber. The recent announcement of plans for a new sawmill in the Everett area suggests that wood fiber from the area will continue to have demand outside of the region. Less than half of the volume harvested is utilized locally by saw mills, even with the projected new mill in Port Angeles. Biomass-based energy has the potential supply, but costs for woody biomass as an energy alternative are too high and energy prices are too low for it to be competitive. Other fiber using industries, such as OSB, would require more fiber than is available. Finally, an alder value-added manufacturing plant would require diversification for it to be successful. We recommend that future work analyze the potential for expanding the existing softwood lumber sawmill capacity in the region. The volume of sawmill logs that are exported from the area is estimated at less than 100, 000 mbf and is insufficient for a modern large mill, which can be twice as big. Expanding the sawmilling capacity of the existing mills may provide benefits for the local region and enhance their competitiveness with mills outside of the region that currently successfully bid for local timber. The announced plans for a new mill in the Everett area suggests an evaluation of timber values for the region and its competitiveness. An analysis currently underway to examine these values should be consulted when completed. While woody biomass is currently too costly, options should be explored for promoting “green energy” options. Finally, since the region is an excess supplier of timber, it should promote its position in order to attract potentially new manufacturing that can consume underutilized resources and compliment the existing milling infrastructure in the area...|$|R
