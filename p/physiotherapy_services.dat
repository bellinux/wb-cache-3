40|$|Questions: What {{proportion}} {{of people who}} are managed by a primary-contact <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> in an emergency department experience adverse events? For people presenting to the emergency department with minor trauma, does the length of stay differ between those managed by the <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> and those managed by medical staff? For people presenting to the emergency department with minor trauma, is diagnostic imaging ordered as often by the <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> as it is by medical staff? Design: Prospective, observational, cohort study. Participants: A consecutive sample of 1320 people presenting to an emergency department and managed by the <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> was analysed. Where possible, these patients were matched by diagnostic codes – typically for minor trauma including closed fractures of the periphery – to patients who were managed by medical staff in order to generate two matched cohorts for comparison. Outcome measures: The outcome measures were adverse events among the patients managed by the <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service,</b> the average length of stay of each cohort in the emergency department, and the {{proportion of}} patients in each cohort who underwent diagnostic imaging studies, including plain radiographs, computerised tomographic scans, and ultrasound imaging studies. Results: No misdiagnoses or adverse events were identified for any patient managed by the <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service.</b> The patients managed by the <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> had a significantly reduced length of stay (mean difference 83  minutes, 95 % CI 75 to 91) and significantly fewer requests for each type of imaging than the matched patients managed by medical staff. Conclusion: Primary-contact physiotherapists can manage a minor trauma caseload in the emergency department without adverse events. A <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> in the emergency department may result in a reduced length of stay and fewer requests for imaging. However, potential confounding of the results for length of stay and imaging must be recognised because matching diagnostic codes may not ensure completely equivalent cohorts.

40|$|Purpose: To {{document}} {{and describe the}} use of a hospital-wide, 24 -hour cardiorespiratory <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> run by an intensive care unit (ICU) team of physiotherapists. Methods: We prospectively collected data on all non-ICU hospital patients who used the 24 -hours-per-day cardiorespiratory <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> over a 1 -year period between July 2013 and June 2014. The ICU physiotherapists documented the reason, origin of referral, time of call, and type and frequency of treatment of each patient. Results: Over the 1 -year period, the ICU physiotherapists administered 2, 192 out-of-hours cardiorespiratory physiotherapy treatments (n = 685 patients) outside the ICU. Most referrals originated from the emergency department (25 %), the cardiopulmonary transplant unit (20 %), and the pulmonology department (16 %). Referrals were from a physiotherapist in 49 % of cases, from a nurse in 32 %, and from a physician in 19 %. Of these, 89 % were made between 4 : 00 p. m. and 8 : 00 a. m. and sputum retention was the most frequent reason (86 %). Conclusion: Although proving its cost effectiveness is difficult, organizing a 24 -hours-per-day, 7 -days-per-week cardiorespiratory <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> in a large hospital is feasible.

40|$|Background: Understanding {{decision-making}} {{about health}} service provision is increasingly important {{in an environment}} of increasing demand and constrained resources. Multiple factors are likely to influence decisions about which services will be provided, yet workforce is the most noted factor in the rural physiotherapy literature. This paper draws together results obtained from exploration of service level decision-making (SLDM) to propose 'conceptual' models of rural physiotherapy SLDM. Method: A prioritized qualitative approach enabled exploration of participant perspectives about rural physiotherapy decision-making. Stakeholder perspectives were obtained through surveys and in-depth interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and reviewed by participants. Participant confidentiality was maintained by coding both participants and sites. A system theory-case study heuristic provided a framework for exploration across sites within the investigation area: a large area of one Australian state with a mix of regional, rural and remote communities. Results: Thirty-nine surveys were received from participants in 11 communities. Nineteen in-depth interviews were conducted with physiotherapists and key decision-makers. Results reveal the complexity of factors influencing rural <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision and the value of a systems approach when exploring decision-making about rural <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision. Six key features were identified that formed the rural physiotherapy SLDM system: capacity and capability; contextual influences; layered decision-making; access issues; value and beliefs; and tensions and conflict. Conclusions: Rural physiotherapy SLDM is not a one-dimensional process but results from the complex interaction of clusters of systems issues. Decision-making about <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision is influenced by both internal and external factors. Similarities in influencing factors and the iterative nature of decision-making emerged, which enabled linking physiotherapy SLDM with clinical decision-making and placing both within the broader healthcare context. The conceptual models provide a way of thinking about decisions informing rural <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision...|$|R

40|$|Background: Insight {{into local}} health service {{provision}} {{in rural communities}} is limited in the literature. The dominant workforce focus in the rural health literature, while revealing issues of shortage of maldistribution, does not describe service provision in rural towns. Similarly aggregation of data tends to render local health service provision virtually invisible. This paper describes a methodology to explore specific aspects of rural health service provision with an initial focus on understanding rurality {{as it pertains to}} rural <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision. Method: A system theory-case study heuristic combined with a sequential mixed methods approach to provide a framework for both quantitative and qualitative exploration across sites. Stakeholder perspectives were obtained through surveys and in depth interviews. The investigation site was a large area of one Australian state with a mix of rural, regional and remote communities. Results: 39 surveys were received from 11 locations within the investigation site and 19 in depth interviews were conducted. Stakeholder perspectives of rurality and workforce numbers informed the development of six case types relevant to the exploration of rural <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision. Participant perspective of rurality often differed with the geographical classification of their location. The numbers of onsite colleagues and local access to health services contributed to participant perceptions of rurality. Conclusions: The complexity of understanding the concept of rurality was revealed by interview participants when providing their perspectives about rural <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision. Dual measures, such as rurality and workforce numbers, provide more relevant differentiation of sites to explore specific <b>services,</b> such rural <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> provision, than single measure of rurality as defined by geographic classification. The system theory-case study heuristic supports both qualitative and quantitative exploration in rural health services research...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} whether accident and emergency (A&E) department based physiotherapy has any advantages over its traditional counterpart in providing treatment for soft tissue injuries. METHODS [...] Two A&E departments were compared: hospital A had a traditional <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service,</b> while hospital B had A&E based physiotherapy. Groups of adult patients {{from these two}} hospitals were compared over a one month period. Data on injuries, number of physiotherapy treatment sessions, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS [...] There were 27 referrals for physiotherapy in hospital A {{during the study period}} (1. 17 % of attendances) and 111 referrals in hospital B (4. 03 %) (P < 0. 001). The waiting time for physiotherapy was significantly less at hospital B (3 v 7 d, P < 0. 001) despite a far greater number of patients referred. Non-referral at the hospital with the traditional service was due to a perceived long waiting time by the referring doctors. Patients with longer waiting times were found to be less likely to attend their first appointment, and this was therefore more common in the hospital with the traditional service (39. 5 % v 9. 8 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] An A&E based <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service</b> results in a greater referral rate and a shortened time between referral and first treatment. Further research is needed to evaluate and compare long terms outcomes following treatment by both types of <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R

5000|$|ACC {{initially}} had a [...] "pay-as-you-go" [...] funding model which collected [...] "only enough levies {{during the}} year {{to cover the cost}} of claims for that particular year". In 1999 a [...] "fully funded" [...] model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury - which might require compensation over a period of 30 years or more. However, getting ACC onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in 2009, ACC posted a $4.8 billion loss - described as the biggest corporate loss in New Zealand's history. This cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims, a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims. Another factor was <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>services</b> being made free at the point of delivery leading to over-servicing of clients. Between 2000 and 2008 this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of 214%.|$|E

5000|$|In 1935, an {{opportunity}} arose for Krusen {{to expand the}} field of physical medicine when he was appointed chair of the new Section of Physical Therapy at the Mayo Clinic. Actually, the roots of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) at the Mayo Clinic started in 1911, 25 years before Krusen arrived, when {{the new head of}} the Section on Orthopedic Surgery, Melvin S. Henderson, MD, established <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>services</b> for postoperative orthopedic patients. By 1918, the Section of Physiotherapy was formed within orthopedics. Members of the Social Services Department in 1921 established occupation therapy services due to the need for avocational, vocational, and community reintegration interventions for patients. Another physiotherapy service was developed, from 1923-1924, by Arthur Desjardins, MD, within the Section of Radiology. This service focused on the treatment and training on modalities for tissue healing using high-frequency diathermy, hydrotherapy, and electrotherapy. As could be predicted, tension developed between the 2 physiotherapy groups, and misunderstandings brewed for nearly a decade. Over time, neither of the departments had the time or interest in supervising physical medicine practices. Thus, the stage was set for recruiting a physician leader in this developing area of medicine centered on physical medicine. With all parties agreeing to an independent section, Krusen arrived in 1935, beginning a 28-year career at the Mayo Clinic, where he would further develop the field of PM&R through the major accomplishments of his career [...]The integrated group practice model at Mayo Clinic proved to be an ideal environment for Krusen to develop the specialty of physical medicine. Within his first seven years at the Mayo Clinic, he successfully integrated the various components of physiotherapy practice under one section. The department staff grew from a mere 18 to 108 people, with an increase of 83% in the patient population that received treatment. Krusen also established Mayo Clinic's School of Physical Therapy in 1938, with 54 students in each class, a program that has trained thousands of physical therapists over the past 75 years.Krusen was skillful at using educational formats to bring people together for collaboration. His initial 5 rotating residents from other specialties quickly evolved into the nation's first 3-year resident training program in physical medicine, established in 1936. Earl Elkins, MD), and Robert Bennett, MD 9, 2 other pioneers in the field of PM&R, were Krusen's first Mayo physical medicine residency graduates. The resident training program has since graduated hundreds of physiatrists and fellows.Statements in Krusen's diary suggest that it is likely the unique practice environment at the Mayo Clinic that facilitated his efforts to expand the field in a number of ways. It fostered his efforts to centralize all therapy efforts under one physician leader, and he found support to grow the practice from other established departments, including orthopedic surgery, radiology, and internal medicine. Krusen's intellectual, organizational, and interpersonal skills found their perfect expression at the Mayo Clinic, where his efforts resulted in physical medicine gaining needed visibility within an internationally known medical institution. “Rehabilitation is to be a key word in medicine,” predicted William Mayo in 1925. Years later, his nephew, Charles Mayo commented, “My late uncle made this prediction … and ten years later he brought to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the physician who, {{perhaps more than any other}} individual, has helped make this prediction come true”. In 1938, Krusen included the following comments in his personal journal on his experience at the Mayo Clinic: “As in past years, the relationship to other departments has been most satisfactory from our standpoint. As with every new field of medical endeavor, there is a certain amount of passive resistance to its development; however, this is less apparent in the Mayo Clinic than in any other institution with which I have been connected. The feeling of cordial cooperation which exists throughout the institution is a never-ending source of pleasure” (internal document, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN).|$|E
