25|$|Following the {{completion}} of the mainline test runs, Tornado entered the NRM <b>paintshop</b> to receive her first proper livery, and was unveiled in a launch ceremony on 13 December 2008. After some brief further work behind the scenes, Tornado returned to the NRM turntable on 22 December and was displayed there over the Christmas period until 11 January 2009, whereupon she was moved back into the workshops to undergo preparation for her main line passenger debut.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first full}} livery is LNER-style express {{passenger}} apple green, with [...] "British Railways" [...] on the tender, as {{worn by the}} original locomotives in 1948. The first 30 Peppercorn A1s delivered wore this colour. This was applied by the NRM paint shop after completion of mainline trials at the NRM in York. Painting was behind closed doors, with the finished article unveiled (without nameplates) on 13 December 2008, in front of 500 supporters of the A1 Trust. The green livery was applied in the traditional way, brush painted by hand. Tornado was unveiled on the turntable with the NRM North Eastern Railway (NER) dynamometer car. Due to time constraints, detailing had been completed only {{on one side of}} the locomotive at the launch, and Tornado re-entered the <b>paintshop</b> after the launch before going back on display.|$|E
50|$|The railcars {{from the}} County Donegal Railway {{were in a}} red and cream colour scheme when they arrived on the island in 1961, and when repainted by the railway company into {{a version of the}} then {{standard}} dark red and cream IMR carriage livery. This differed from the carriage livery in that cream was retained only for the waist stripe, whilst the window surrounds were painted deep red. They remained in this livery until 1981/1982 when they visited the <b>paintshops,</b> one being outshopped in a cheerful blue and white livery for a very short time. Unfortunately, the Falklands War broke out shortly thereafter, and having them in Argentine colours was not deemed appropriate so they were hastily repainted to a red and white scheme (the same as that carried by the island's buses at the time) and they remained like this until withdrawal from service in the early 1990s.|$|R

50|$|Adobe's {{decision}} to make the subscription service the only sales route for its creative software was met with strong criticism (see Creative Cloud controversy).

50|$|As {{the decade}} closed, in 2000 GAZ was in active {{preparation}} {{to launch the}} 3111 Volga. The vehicle demanded a serious upgrade to existing facilities at the plant, and as these came online, they were extensively tested by the 3110. For example, the new Haden Drysys <b>paintshop,</b> when introduced to the conveyor, with attractive acrylic and metallic finishes, helped to tackle the major corrosion problems of the 3110. Simultaneously came the new 265/70R15 tyres. A small series of licence-built Steyr Diesel engines (ZMZ-560) were available.|$|E

50|$|The bundled extras {{cannot be}} {{installed}} unless that {{version of the}} <b>PaintShop</b> program is already installed. However, once a bundled extra such as a plugin has been installed, the installed files can be copied to other versions, e.g., a plugin installed under X5 can be copied to X6 and even if X5 is then uninstalled, the plugin {{will continue to work}} under X6. Corel releases a new X version roughly annually, so this ability to copy means PSP users do not have to choose between updating or continued use of Ultimate add-ons from previous versions.|$|E
