40|$|Abstract: Like many mega {{cities in}} {{developing}} countries, commuters in Bangkok face problems of insufficient public transport under {{control of the}} government. Thus, <b>passenger</b> <b>vans</b> play important roles in providing alternative to serve these commuters. Conventional bus operators considered that the <b>passenger</b> <b>vans</b> were competitors to take the passengers. The government claimed that this competition caused lower revenue for the bus operators. Therefore, the government enforced regulations of maximum price and entry for the <b>passengers</b> <b>vans.</b> But market structure between the <b>passenger</b> <b>vans</b> and conventional buses is unclear. For evaluating {{the effect of these}} regulations, the study aimed to identify the market structure of public transport for commuters between the <b>passenger</b> <b>vans</b> and conventional buses using the northern corridor of Bangkok as a case study area. Oligopoly markets with implications of product differentiation and collusion were discovered from results of case study surveys. Deregulation of entry and price was recommended...|$|R

2500|$|Public {{transport}} is well-developed with bus (...) , tram (...) and trolleybus (...) lines {{running in}} all areas of the city. The Sofia Metro became operational in 1998, and now has two lines and 34 stations. , the system has [...] of track. Six new stations were opened in 2009, two more in April 2012, and eleven more in August 2012. In 2015 new 7 stations were opened and the subway extends to Sofia Airport on its Northern branch and to Business Park Sofia on its Southern branch. On July 2016 the Vitosha Metro Station was opened on the M2 main line. A third line is currently under construction and is expected to be finished {{in the second half of}} 2019. This line will complete the proposed subway system of three lines with about [...] of lines. The master plan for the Sofia Metro includes three lines with a total of 63 stations. In recent years the marshrutka, a private <b>passenger</b> <b>van</b> serving fixed routes, proved an efficient and popular means of transport by being faster than public transport, but cheaper than taxis. [...] these vans numbered 368 and serviced 48 lines around the city and suburbs. There are around 13,000 taxi cabs operating in the city. Low fares in comparison with other European countries, make taxis affordable and popular among a big part of the city population.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deployment}} of the city's Taxi of Tomorrow would result in almost all the existing fleet, of which about 6,000 are hybrid electric vehicles, to be replaced within 3 years with the non hybrid Nissan NV200 <b>passenger</b> <b>van.</b> Only about 1,000 taxis will be exempted for various reasons, such as 273 taxis whose medallions require that they be high-mileage vehicles. However, in early 2013 the Greater New York Taxi Association filed suit against the city arguing that the Taxi of Tomorrow plan violates {{a section of the}} city’s administrative code because the [...] Nissan NV200 is not a hybrid. In May 2013 a State Supreme Court judge blocked the Bloomberg administration’s plan for introducing the Taxi of Tomorrow, ruling that indeed it violated a New York City provision requiring a hybrid option for taxi operators. City officials did not challenge the judge’s ruling. In June 2013, [...] the Taxi and Limousine Commission on Thursday approved an adjusted set of rules in an effort to introduce the Taxi of Tomorrow as scheduled by October 2013. According to the adjusted rules, only hybrids with a large interior of at least [...] will be permitted. Taxi operators complained that the only compliant hybrids are prohibitively expensive.

50|$|As {{full-size}} {{school buses}} grew larger during the 1950s and early 1960s, they became difficult {{to navigate the}} crowded, narrow streets of urban neighborhoods; other rural routes were extremely isolated, with roads that could not accommodate full-size buses. To fill this role, yellow-painted vehicles such as the International Travelall and Chevrolet Suburban came into use. As they entered production in the 1960s, <b>passenger</b> <b>vans</b> such as the Chevrolet Van/GMC Handi-Van, Dodge A100, and Ford Econoline were converted to school bus use, largely {{by the addition of}} red warning lights and yellow paint. A drawback to using <b>passenger</b> <b>vans</b> and utility vehicles is that, along with their lower seating capacity, they could not offer the same level of safety as a full-size school bus.|$|R
