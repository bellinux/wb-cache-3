50|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution the first modern cranes were {{installed}} at harbours for loading cargo. In 1838, the industrialist and businessman William Armstrong designed a hydraulic water <b>powered</b> <b>crane.</b> His design used a ram in a closed cylinder that was forced down by a pressurized fluid entering the cylinder — a valve regulated the amount of fluid intake relative to the load on the crane.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hammerhead crane}} was built between 1944 and 1951 on the Fitting Out Wharf at Garden Island. The {{electrically}} <b>powered</b> <b>crane</b> had a radius of 131 ft {{and a total}} height of 203 ft. The electrical and mechanical equipment was sourced from England, while the steel frame was fabricated in Sydney. Although officially declared completed in January 1952, the crane was operational from March 1951. The crane's primary purpose was the removal and installation of warship gun turrets, although it was regularly used for other machinery and loads, and had a lifting capacity of up to [...] It was last used in 1996.|$|E

50|$|Impressed {{with the}} results of the Sno-Buggy, in late 1954 the Army Transportation Corps asked LeTourneau to combine the {{features}} of the Tournatrain and Sno-Buggy into a new vehicle. LeTourneau called the result the YS-1 Army Sno-Train but the Army knew it as the Logistics Cargo Carrier, or LCC-1. The LCC-1 combined the wheels of the Sno-Buggy with the power system of the Tournatrain to produce a 16x16 vehicle with one locomotive and three cars capable of handling a load of 45 tons in total. The control cab was itself articulated into two compartments; a heated driving compartment in front for the crew of three, and a rear section containing the 600-hp diesel engine, generators and fuel tanks. The cab also sported a <b>powered</b> <b>crane</b> on the rear.|$|E
50|$|During the 17th {{century the}} channel needed {{constant}} attention. Ships offloading ballast {{as they approached}} the quay added to the problem. However, after an intensive programme of dredging, ships of 40 tons could in 1685 once again dock at the quay. In the 18th century coal from Newcastle became the major import and the outlook was graced by three large coal pounds - on the quay, by the inn and on the site of what is now Quay Cottage. There was a crane, which in 1789 was said to be 'much out of repair, useless and obstructive'. The amount of goods delivered varied over the years. 2128 tons in 1786, 4085 in 1793, 2771 in 1800, 3043 in 1807 and 3602 in 1813. By 1908 there was a steam driven crane, running on rails, which was later replaced by a diesel <b>powered</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E

50|$|Stothert and Pitt {{supplied}} their earliest electric <b>powered</b> <b>crane</b> to Southampton Dock Authority in 1892. Electric power provided several advantages: powerful motors {{could be}} placed in each crane and powered centrally, without requiring a separate prime mover (i.e. steam engine and boiler) in each crane. The crane mechanisms were also lighter, allowing them {{to be placed on}} raised carriages that could then straddle a railway freight line- the portal crane. Rather than requiring a bare strip of unused quayside between the railway line and the harbour wall to leave space for cranes, the railway could now be brought right to the dock edge. Cranes were also available immediately, without waiting for boilers to raise steam. Most importantly though (and an advantage over centrally powered hydraulic cranes), electric cranes were now mobile along the dock edge on their own rail lines. Rather than ships queueing for a single berth space alongside a fixed crane, cranes could be brought to each ship's hold hatches as needed. This made a single crane far more efficient, in terms of cargo handled per day. Soon such mobile electric cranes were near universal.|$|E

50|$|The sidelifter {{loads and}} unloads {{containers}} via {{a pair of}} hydraulic <b>powered</b> <b>cranes</b> mounted {{at each end of}} the vehicle chassis. The cranes are designed to lift containers from the ground, from other vehicles including rolling stock, from railway wagons and directly from stacks on docks or aboard container ships. A standard sidelifter is also able to stack a container at a two containers' height on the ground. If the sidelifter chassis is of 40' length or more, the cranes of the sidelifter can be shifted hydraulically along the sidelifter chassis to be able to pick up either one 20', one 40', or two 20' ISO containers at a time.|$|R
50|$|The R-17 was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} R-11. It could carry nuclear, chemical, conventional or fragmentation weapons. At first, the Scud-B was carried on a tracked transporter erector launcher (TEL) {{similar to that of}} the Scud-A, designated 2P19, but this was not successful and a wheeled replacement was designed by the Titan Central Design Bureau, becoming operational in 1967. The new MAZ-543 vehicle was officially designated 9P117 Uragan. The launch sequence could be conducted autonomously, but was usually directed from a separate command vehicle. The missile is raised to a vertical position by means of hydraulically <b>powered</b> <b>cranes,</b> which usually takes four minutes, while the total sequence lasts about one hour.|$|R
50|$|The cranes {{were used}} in countless docks, railway yards, {{quarries}} and construction sites {{both at home and}} overseas. Some of the largest construction projects to use Smith cranes were the Manchester Ship Canal, the Aswan Low Dam, and the Sudan Barrage.As early as 1897 Thomas Smith were producing electrical <b>powered</b> <b>cranes</b> and in later years the internal combustion engine would replace the steam engine as the power source in their cranes. The cranes were adapted to become excavators with buckets replacing the usual crane hook, the company also provided magnets for use in sites handling metals. Caterpillar track fitted versions were offered and these became more numerous in later years as the railway industry lost its dominance.|$|R
5000|$|Uses of treadwheels {{included}} raising water, to <b>power</b> <b>cranes,</b> or grind grain.

50|$|One of the company's {{most popular}} {{products}} were fairly small steam <b>powered</b> <b>cranes.</b> Based on a tall central pivot {{and with the}} jib counterbalanced by the boiler these {{are commonly known as}} 'Leeds Type' cranes, they were either rail mounted where they were required to move around a site or ground mounted for the likes of quays. Joseph Booth also produced very similar cranes and with high demand at the time there were a few firms nearby that, though specialising in other products such as bridges and structural metal work, produced relatively small numbers of steam cranes. John Butler & Co, Samual Butler & Co (mentioned earlier), Isles and Whitaker Brothers are other local firms to have been involved in steam crane production.|$|R
5000|$|Sheds were {{constructed}} {{on top of}} the main wharves to accommodate goods waiting for export or to be distributed around the town. One shed was built for each of the five berths. The sheds at berths 1-3 were joined together in one continuous line; sheds 4-5 were built as one long structure. In 1938 the Cairns Harbour Board produced a handbook, detailing its activities in the port. This handbook described the wharfage facilities at Cairns as comprising some 1,900 linear feet of reinforced concrete wharves, with six [...] "airy spacious sheds having floor space of 89,020 square feet", as well as the shed for sugar storage. Electric and hand <b>powered</b> <b>cranes</b> were also built {{at the rear of the}} wharves to lift heavy goods onto ships.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with other}} ex-GWR locomotives, No 7, No 8, & No 9 all {{retained}} their numbers under British Railways ownership, and in 1956 {{were given the}} names which they still carry today, being unnamed up to that point.

Under the TOPS numbering arrangements introduced at this time they were allocated Class 98 and were nominally numbered 98007-98009, but these numbers were never actually carried on the locomotives. All three locomotives, and the rolling stock, carried standard British Rail 'rail blue' livery until the 1980s, when the locomotives were given more traditional liveries that they had carried in the past.|$|R
