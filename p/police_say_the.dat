5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E

50|$|<b>Police</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> bad-apple bikers bring a {{particular}} set of problems, mainly the use and sale of speed methamphetamine.

Users cruising for a fix were a common sight on some of the narrow side streets off Tujunga Canyon Boulevard. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> meth scene, though still active in Tujunga, is no longer the problem it was, thanks to block-by-block community policing efforts and the town's relative gentrification.|$|E

5000|$|The independence, however fictional, {{had to be}} preserved. German {{interference}} in internal <b>policing,</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> historian Julian T.

This could only be avoided by reassuring Germany that the French would carry out the necessary measures." [...] Jackson adds {{that the decision to}} arrest Jews and Communists and Gaullists was [...] "an autonomous policy, with its own indigenous roots." [...] In other words the decision to do so was not forced on the Vichy regime by the Germans. Jackson also explains that the roundup of Jews must have been driven by the French since the Germans would not have had the necessary information or the manpower to find and arrest a full 13,000.|$|R
