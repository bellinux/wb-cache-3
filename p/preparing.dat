This study {{compared}} the outcomes for less <b>prepared</b> and well <b>prepared</b> first year college students enrolled in learning communities at the University of Minnesota. Less <b>prepared</b> students were retained at the same rate, though their first year grades were significantly lower. In a second study the less <b>prepared</b> students were compared to an earlier cohort of matched pairs. The matched pairs had similar rates of retention and similar grades.
