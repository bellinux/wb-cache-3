25|$|Steam Pump Ranch: Located in {{the heart}} of Oro Valley, the Steam Pump Ranch dates back to the mid-1870s when George <b>Pusch</b> settled in the area. <b>Pusch</b> was an Arizona state {{legislator}} and delegate to the original Arizona Constitutional Convention in 1910.

5000|$|On the hill, {{slightly}} off the path on its ridge, Frederick Erdmann ordered {{the building of}} a summer house (Lustschloss), based on <b>Pusch’s</b> design, which was modeled on a previously published project by Carl Gotthard Langhans. Although there is no knowing of when precisely the construction began, we know exactly when the building was put into use - 25 June 1800. [...] Only the castle itself, later called “Fasanerie” - The Pheasantry, has remained. Frederick Erdmann died in 1797 before his project was finalized, and the construction was completed by his son Frederick Ferdinand.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{occasion}} of the infamous incest case of Amstetten in Austria, the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung writes: [...] "Amstetten between discomposure and media-hype: A dungeon amidst the town, a father inflicting martyrdom onto his children – how we struggle to put the pieces of the incomprehensible together. The dungeon in Amstetten touches something deep inside the marrow of the Austrians, their dark side, mirrored in the poems of their authors and in the Images of Gottfried Helnwein, depicting people with forkes <b>pusched</b> into their eyes. Or Girls with blood running down their legs. Helnwein's paintings are nightmares, that tell of the dungeons in our heads..." ...|$|R
40|$|The theme {{invites us}} to rediscover in {{landscape}} a text and/or a context already written, being able to read and rewrite it again cyclically, continuosly and even almost involuntarily. The urge {{to go back to}} read the places returns to the request for planned structures of equal thickness and complexity of the existing. Writing, leaving traces, leads us to reflect on the meaning of incision, which as in the metaphor of the palimpsest (A. Corboz) "support engraved on several occasions in which the succession of scriptures and cancellations car never completely eliminate the signs of pre-exesting", <b>pusches</b> to reconsider the persistence of actions that modify the materials of landscape.

25|$|After World War II, the Tucson area {{experienced}} dramatic population growth, impacting Oro Valley as well. In {{the early}} 1950s the Oro Valley Country Club {{opened at the}} base of <b>Pusch</b> Ridge, affirming the area's future as an affluent community. Although one tract housing development was built in the area in the early 1950s, the majority of homes in the Oro Valley area were built by individual land owners on large lots in a low density residential style.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 19th century, Americans {{increasingly}} {{settled in}} the Arizona Territory, following the Mexican-American War and the subsequent Gadsden Purchase including Southern Arizona. George <b>Pusch,</b> a German immigrant, {{settled in the}} area of Oro Valley in 1874, establishing a cattle ranch. This ranch was unique because it utilized a steam pump to provide water, eventually popularizing Pusch's property as the Steam Pump Ranch on the Cañada del Oro. The steam pump was one of only two in the Arizona Territory.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the {{genomics}} company iGENEA {{launched a}} Tutankhamun DNA project based on genetic markers that it indicated it had culled from a Discovery Channel special on the pharaoh. According to the firm, the microsatellite data suggested that Tutankhamun {{belonged to the}} haplogroup R1b1a2, the most common paternal clade among males in Western Europe. Carsten <b>Pusch</b> and Albert Zink, who led the unit that had extracted Tutankhamun's DNA, chided iGENEA for not liaising with them before establishing the project. After examining the footage, they also concluded that the methodology the company used was unscientific.|$|E
25|$|A {{research}} team, {{consisting of}} Egyptian scientists Yehia Gad and Somaia Ismail from the National Research Centre in Cairo, conducted further CT scans {{under the direction}} of Ashraf Selim and Sahar Saleem of the Faculty of Medicine at Cairo University. Three international experts served as consultants: Carsten <b>Pusch</b> of the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Germany; Albert Zink of the EURAC-Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy; and Paul Gostner of the Central Hospital Bolzano. STR analysis based DNA fingerprinting analysis combined with the other techniques have rejected the hypothesis of gynecomastia and craniosynostoses (e.g., Antley-Bixler syndrome) or Marfan syndrome, but an accumulation of malformations in Tutankhamun's family was evident. Several pathologies including Köhler disease II were diagnosed in Tutankhamun; none alone would have caused death. Genetic testing for STEVOR, AMA1, or MSP1 genes specific for Plasmodium falciparum revealed indications of malaria tropica in 4 mummies, including Tutankhamun's. However, their exact contribution to the causality of his death still is highly debated.|$|E

2500|$|Many Egyptologists {{have tried}} to produce an {{explanation}} for her prominence. Numerous scholarly discussions of Tutankhamun’s parentage during the late twentieth century, and {{the early years of}} the twenty-first, have mentioned the hypothesis that Kiya was Tutankhamun’s mother. If she had indeed borne a male heir to Akhenaten, this distinction might well merit unique honors. However, genetic studies of the Egyptian royal mummies, led by Zahi Hawass and Carsten <b>Pusch,</b> have now established that Tutankhamun’s biological mother was KV35YL, the [...] "Younger Lady" [...] discovered in the mummy cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II.|$|E
