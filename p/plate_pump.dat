50|$|Axial piston pump: many {{designed}} with a variable displacement mechanism, to vary output flow for automatic control of pressure. There are various axial piston pump designs, including swashplate (sometimes {{referred to as}} a valveplate pump) and checkball (sometimes {{referred to as a}} wobble <b>plate</b> <b>pump).</b> The most common is the swashplate pump. A variable-angle swashplate causes the pistons to reciprocate a greater or lesser distance per rotation, allowing output flow rate and pressure to be varied (greater displacement angle causes higher flow rate, lower pressure, and vice versa).|$|E
50|$|Radial {{piston pumps}} are used {{especially}} for high pressure and relatively small flows. Pressures {{of up to}} 650 bar are normal. In fact variable displacement is possible. The pump is designed {{in such a way}} that the plungers are connected to a floating ring. This floating ring can be moved horizontally by a control lever & thus causes an eccentricity in the centre of rotation of the plungers. The amount of eccentricity can be controlled to vary the discharge. The suction & discharge can be totally reversed seamlessly by shifting the eccentricity to the opposite side. Hence both quantity & direction can be varied in a radial piston pump, just as in the Swash <b>plate</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E

The concept consists of an open loop hydraulic system with the rotor main shaft directly coupled to a swash <b>plate</b> <b>pump</b> to supply pressurised sea water. A mathematical model is derived to cater for the steady state behaviour of entire system. A simplified model for the pump is implemented together with different control scheme options for regulating the rotor shaft power. A new control scheme is investigated, based on the combined use of hydraulic pressure and pitch control. Using a steady-state analysis, the study shows how the adoption of alternative control schemes in a the wind turbine-hydraulic pump system may result in higher energy yields than those from a conventional system with an electrical generator and standard pitch control for power regulation.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the performance of an industrial low-speed high-torque hydrostatic drive system. This type of hydrostatic transmission is commonly used in continuous operation {{in a wide range of}} heavy-duty drive applications. In many applications the transmissions have to compete with e. g. electromechanical drives, such as DC or AC electric motors combined with gearboxes. In such situations, energy efficiency is a key selection criterion in that even a small increase in the efficiency of high power industrial drives would give substantial savings. Apart from efficiency, lifetime and reliability requirements are important parameters for industrial drive systems, as unplanned stops in industrial working processes can be very costly. The work presented in this thesis is primarily focused on analysing the efficiency behaviour in the transmission, both on the system level and on the component level. Attention has also been paid to lifetime issues, with special emphasis on wear occurring in a sliding contact in a radial piston hydraulic motor. In Paper A the distribution of power losses in a variable axial piston swash <b>plate</b> <b>pump</b> is investigated. The pump under study is commonly used in stationary industrial hydrostatic transmission systems. The churning losses in the pump have been estimated experimentally by measurements in a test rig. The leakage flow and the power losses in the contacts between the piston and the cylinder and between the slipper and the swash plate respectively were simulated with the help of the simulation tool CASPAR. For the pump studied, the churning losses are significant under the operating conditions typically occurring in industrial drive applications. The simulation results indicate that the leakage to the pump casing mainly originates from the gaps between the pistons and their respective cylinders and between the slippers and swash plate. The aim of Paper B is to study two sliding contacts inside a radial piston hydraulic motor and investigate their influence on the torque and power losses. Moreover, it is investigated whether and when a change in the lubrication regime can be expected in these contacts. This is accomplished by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies, with a special focus on two lubricated sliding contacts: the distributor valve contact and the piston/cam roller contact. The theoretical analysis of the contacts indicates, among other things, that the piston/cam roller contact can enter the mixed lubrication regime at low motor speeds. At low running speeds, an increased wear rate has been noted in the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in a radial piston hydraulic motor. Paper C describes a comparative investigation into different hydraulic fluids' friction properties and wear protection abilities. To simulate the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in the hydraulic motor, tests were performed in a reciprocating test rig where the contact geometry was of the cylinder-plate type. In the model test a synthetic ester aimed at meeting the conditions in water turbine applications received a top ranking regarding both friction and wear protection properties.

40|$|Due to many advantages, swash <b>plate</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are wide}} spread in {{hydraulic}} systems. The main advantages are the through drive capability, the adjustability {{and most of}} all, the high power density. Their application range is limited, historically, to 450 bar including medium and higher volume sizes. In higher pressure range, constant pumps such as wobbling disks or radial piston pumps are normally used. This is because the higher stressed parts can be dimensioned much bigger. Pumps with lower power such as constant displacement gear pumps are generally used in low price applications. In order to enlarge the application range of swash <b>plate</b> <b>pumps,</b> their advantages have to be further improved and strengthened. This paper shows by example how {{the pressure of the}} basic series A 4 VSO was increased up to a nominal pressure of 630 bar and the historical pressure mark of 450 bar could be exceeded. This increase in pressure level enables for example steel treatment manufacturers to reduce their component sizes without the need of a pressure transducer. Furthermore the power density of the redesigned HA 4 VSO was increased by 36 %, compared to the standard A 4 VSO, by significantly increasing the self-priming speed. On {{the other side of the}} application range, in lower power mobile applications such as small tractors, forklift and skid steer loader, there is an increasing demand for less exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The energy saving potential by changing from a hydraulic system with constant hydraulic pumps to variable hydraulic pumps is already proven on high power applications. By developing the variable axial piston pump A 1 VO to the requirements of lower horse power application, it is now also possible to realize such savings in lower horse power applications. Furthermore efficiency of the pump itself can be improved. An example of this is shown by way of the new A 4 series 33...|$|R

40|$|Swash <b>plate</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are widely}} used to drive {{hydraulic}} systems, especially because they offer high specific power. In order to improve their performance and make them more reliable, {{it is necessary to}} reduce the flow fluctuations, incorporate a control system that is more responsive, and minimize vibration levels. Furthermore, the flow should be controlled according to load requirements and pipe response at the design level. Moreover, {{there is a need to}} monitor the health of the system by analysing its vibration signatures. A novel port plate design is used with a pair of deep silencing grooves on the edges of delivery and suction ports, which reduces the flow fluctuations and improves the pump output. In addition to the load information, the pipe dynamics are also used as a control input. Hence, pipe instabilities with different boundary conditions are studied, where simple, accurate and comprehensive expressions to describe the pipe instabilities are produced, solved, and plotted. In swash <b>plate</b> <b>pumps,</b> the control unit changes the pump output according to the load requirements. The current pump design is equipped with a double negative feedback strategy. The inner loop controls the spool position, and the outer loop controls the swash plate angle. Since this design has a high rise time, it was suggested to equip the pump with a single feedback PD controller. Although this reduced the rise time, it introduced high levels of vibration. The present research proposes a new control strategy with a single feedback PID controller that minimizes vibration levels. Results are obtained experimentally. The control strategy is generalized to control the pump flow according to load requirements and pipe vibration levels. A compensation factor is introduced to moderate the negative impact of the pipe vibrations, and to generate a new set value for the inclination angle. For timely detection of faults, the application of wavelet analysis to detect different defects is examined. Some defects are produced, such as pipe flutter, pump dynamic instability, and voltage unbalance in the driving electric motor. Continuous wavelet and discrete wavelet analyses are used to analyze the vibration signature by using Debauches' mother wavelet. The data is collected experimentally. The results show that wavelet analysis is very efficient at identifying defects in the pipe or pump. The results are discussed and appropriate conclusions are drawn based on the present research.

For this study a thick excited plate was attached to an auxiliary plate parallel to the surface, thereby trapping {{a thin layer of}} air. Relative vibration of these two <b>plates</b> <b>pumps</b> this air at high velocities, resulting in energy loss due to air viscosity. The theory employs an impedance approach to predict the loss factor of the coupled plates. Below the excited plate critical frequency the damping is controlled by gas pumping, while above the critical frequency the plate couplings are the controlling factor. Theoretical predictions were compared with experimental measurements. A brief examination of the bolting effect on the loss factor was also conducted. The second part is a theoretical and experimental investigation of squeeze-film damping on plates separated by heavy fluid, for example, oil. The attached plate can be either perforated or unperforated. The ratio of fluid dynamic viscosity to density controls the losses. Viscosity was artificially increased by inserting porous materials into the oil layer. The properties of the porous materials were obtained from macroscopic flow resistance measurements. Theoretical modelling of the loss factor of these layered configurations with oil alone and with oil impregnated porous material were conducted using the impedance approach and compared with experimental measurements. The third part is a theoretical and experimental investigation of granular infill damping treatments on plates. Sand was used in the experiments and the bulk and shear elastic constants were measured when the sand was subjected to varying hydrostatic pressures. Both the dilatational and rotational motions in the granular layer were considered and the loss factor predictions were compared with measured results...|$|R
