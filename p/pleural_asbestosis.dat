This retrospective/prospective {{study was conducted in}} 109 patients, workers of Plobest Ltd Asbestos Industry in PloŁe (group 1, predomi-nantly inhaling chrysotile asbestos) and 216 workers of Salonit Ltd from Vranjic near Split and Split Shipyard (group 2, predominantly inhaling crocidolite asbestos) with the diagnosis of pulmonary/ <b>pleural</b> <b>asbestosis.</b> Statistical analysis was done by Kappa test, χ 2 -test, and analysis of variance. Test results are shown in diagrams and table. Pulmonary asbestosis was confirmed in 38 (35 %), pulmo-nary and <b>pleural</b> <b>asbestosis</b> in 49 (45 %), and <b>pleural</b> <b>asbestosis</b> in 22 (20 %) group 1 patients (exposed to chrysotile). In group 2 patients (exposed to crocidolite asbestos), pulmonary asbestosis was con-firmed in only 9 (4 %), <b>pleural</b> <b>asbestosis</b> in 117 (54 %), and pleural and pulmonary asbestosis in 90 (42 %) patients. In 35 (32. 1 %) group 1 patients with normal chest roentgenograms (International Labour Organisation (ILO) perfusion categories 0 / 0 and 0 / 1), high-resoluton computed tomogra-phy revealed initial or moderate stage of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

40|$|As a rule, {{asbestosis}} is {{a disease}} of workers who are occupationally exposed to inhalation of asbestos dust, leaving permanent alterations on the lung parenchyma or pleura. In our ten-year study, we investigated 318 workers with <b>pleural</b> <b>asbestosis</b> from whom we took medical history which included occupational exposure to asbestos, radiological examinations and lung function, which is mandatory for the diagnosis and the follow up of the disease. We analysed functional parameters such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1) and intermediate forced expiratory flow at 25 % to 75 % (FEF 25 %- 75 %). In addition, we investigated the predicted values of functional parameters according to smoking and non-smoking habits. We found {{a significant reduction in}} vital capacity, particularly in smokers after 25 years of exposure to asbestos. During the first 15 years, values of vital capacity on the group basis remained inside the 80 % of the normal values and were not significant for assessing the dynamics of the lung function.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Until recently, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in a variety of}} industrial processes. Workers exposed to asbestos may develop lung and pleural diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer, benign pleural effusion, pleural plaques and mesothelioma. OBJECTIVE: To describe a clinical case of lung cancer in a female non-smoker with occupational exposure to asbestos. METHODS: The clinical and occupational history was based on the information kindly provided by the Occupational Unit of the National Health Service and on the case history of a hospital admittance in 2001, when the patient underwent surgery for lung cancer. RESULTS: The patient worked for 6 years in an asbestos manufacturing industry where she was exposed to high concentrations of asbestos, and then worked for 14 years in a sugar refinery only during the summer. She had benign pleural effusion, <b>pleural</b> plaques, <b>asbestosis</b> and lung cancer.

The experimental data presented that the serum level of HMGB 1 was significantly elevated in AE and ARDs subjects. Our findings indicated that serum HMGB 1 is a sensitive and specific biomarker for discriminating asbestosis- and MM-affected individuals from healthy or AE individuals.

40|$|The {{impairment}} of lung function associated with {{different types of}} asbestos related disease was examined in 1298 men. The 310 men with circumscribed pleural lesions (plaques) or diffuse <b>pleural</b> thickening without <b>asbestosis</b> were compared with 596 men with asbestosis only and with 322 men with <b>pleural</b> abnormalities and <b>asbestosis,</b> as classified from chest radiographs by ILO pneumoconiosis criteria. Spirometric indices and total lung capacity (TLC; determined by planimetry) were measured and expressed as percentages of predicted values. Non-smoking men with pleural disease only had reduced values of mid and terminal expiratory flows (80. 6 and 69. 9 % predicted) and a reduced FEV 1 (89 % predicted) with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 94 % predicted.

Non-smoking men with pulmonary asbestosis (ILO profusion of opacities mostly 1 / 0 and 1 / 1) had pulmonary function {{similar to that of}} men with pleural disease. FEV 1 and FVC and flow rates at other lung volumes were lower in smokers with asbestosis (after adjustment for duration of smoking) than in the non-smokers with asbestosis. Airflow limitation was worse in the men with both pleural abnormalities and pulmonary asbestosis with lower values for mid expiratory flow, FEV 1 and FVC (but not TLC) than those with either abnormality alone, in both non-smokers and current smokers.

Two chest radiologists independently and blindly read the examinations, following a detailed protocol. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and error rate of ULD CT were calculated using the exact method of Pearson with a confidence interval of 95 %.

The ULD CT's diagnostic performance in joint reading was high for the primary endpoint (sensitivity = 90. 9 %, specificity = 100 %, positive predictive value = 100 %, negative predictive value = 97. 8 %), high for lung nodules, diffuse pleural thickening and calcified pleural plaques (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV = 100 %) and fair for asbestosis (sensitivity = 75 %, specificity = 100 %, PPV = 00 %, NPV = 98. 1 %). Intra-reader accuracy between the ULD CT and the reference CT for the primary endpoint was 98 % for the senior and 100 % for the junior radiologist. Inter-reader agreement for the primary endpoint was almost perfect (Cohen's Kappa of 0. 81).

Results 250 patients (55. 2 ± 9. 6 years of age, 82. 4 % men) were enrolled (133 paroxysmal, 43 persistent, 58 permanent AF and 16 LAT). Fifty-eight patients (23. 2 %) had a total of 76 IF. Patients with IF were significantly older (59. 5 ± 8. 2 vs 53. 8 ± 9. 7 years old, p< 0. 001). No relationship exist between the type of arrhythmia and the existence of IF. The majority of IF were pulmonary (50 %). Two lung cancers were discovered. ConclusionsCardiac CT scan is a useful tool to evaluate LA and pulmonary veins morphology before AF ablation.

40|$|Background and objective: Asbestos {{can cause}} various {{pulmonary}} diseases including <b>asbestosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> plaques and pleural thickening. Animal and {{in vitro studies}} suggest that the toxicity of asbestos is due to the iron content of the fibres which not only generate oxidants directly, but also activate the inflammatory cells in the lung that contribute to oxidative stress. This study therefore sought to establish data in man to corroborate the animal and in vitro evidence. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection is a novel, non-invasive technique to collect samples from the lung for investigating inflammatory biomarkers of lung diseases. This technique is harmless, rapid and easily repeatable which leads itself to the investigation of lung diseases such as asbestos-related diseases and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) that are otherwise difficult to study. The hypothesis tested was that oxidative and nitrosylative stress markers will be elevated in the EBC of patients with asbestos-related diseases and PF compared to normal control subjects. Methods: The study design was a cross-sectional and observational in vivo study whereby EBC was collected and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and carbon monoxide (eCO) were measured. EBC markers including pH, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), total nitrogen oxides (NOx), 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT), 8 -isoprostane (8 -iso), total protein and transforming growth factor-&# 946; 1 (TGF&# 946; 1) were measured by microelectrode analysis, colorimetric and enzyme immunoassays. 3 -NT and 8 -iso were further examined by immunohistochemical techniques in samples of lung tissue. Results: Subjects with asbestosis had significantly raised levels of EBC H 2 O 2, 8 -iso, total protein and FeNO compared with healthy individuals. The same markers except H 2 O 2, but with 3 -NT and eCO were again significantly increased in those with other causes of PF, compared with control subjects. Heavy nitrotyrosine staining was found on the lung sections from patients with asbestosis and PF. 	 Conclusions: This study confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species is associated with asbestos exposure and pulmonary fibrosis in vivo confirming animal and in vitro studies. Analysis of EBC may prove a useful non-invasive tool in exploring the basic pathophysiology of lung diseases in clinical research and may in the future be used to monitor progress in asbestosis and pulmonary fibrosis...|$|R

The {{knowledge of}} its particular characteristics and its applications {{dates back to}} ancient times, for example, Egyptians already used it for embalming. Industrial use of asbestos {{dates back to the}} late nineteenth century, following the discovery of large Canadian deposits in Quebec (1877). The later discovery of important deposits in South Africa (crocidolite, chrysotile, amosite), Russia (chrysotile), United States (chrysotile), Australia (crocidolite) and Finland (anthophyllite), Italy (chrysotile) favoured its spreading and use on a large scale. Asbestos has been a well known confirmed human carcinogen since 1992, but before that date it was widely and regularly used for its insulating properties and its resistance. Exposure to asbestos appears associated to several diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis (characterized by typical lung lesions), and neoplasms such as pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma and pulmonary adenocarcinoma. To put the blame of a disease on exposure to asbestos, however, diagnostic criteria are needed, ranging from the discovery of asbestos fibers in lung parenchyma to an array of radio-immuno-histo-chemical findings, to the duration and extent of exposure, etc. Here is a case report of lung cancer attributed to exposure to asbestos, which reconstructs the history of the patient in a critical analysis of the diagnostic criteria. Data have been discussed {{in the light of the}} current knowledge, with the support of a scrupulous literary review, which lead us step by step along the evolution of our achievement about the carcinogenicity of asbestos. Mr P (1932 - 2002) worked for a transport tramway company at the routine maintenance and repairs and died for lung adenocarcinoma. Scientific information worldwide produced about asbestos and its effects on human health are abundant, but it can’t be assumed that what is now universally recognized and taken for granted was recognized and taken for granted and with the same diffusion in past years and in the years during which Mr. P worked (1955 - 1992). Hence, there is no certainty of the diagnosis of the lung primitive adenocarcinoma attributed to Mr. P because the diagnostic criteria suggested by the international literature have not been strictly applied. There are no clinical or instrumental or laboratory signs that can be considered as indicators of the effect of exposure to asbestos: pulmonary fibrosis, <b>asbestosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> plaques, asbestos fibers, asbestos corpuscles, and the hypotesis of a possible cause and effect relationship is not supported by valid data...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos is a {{naturally}} deposited fibrous mineral that was extensively mined and industrially used over many {{decades in the}} 20 th century. Today the use of asbestos is largely restricted or banned in many industrialised countries because of well-known adverse health effects. Apart from the carcinogenic effect (lung cancer, laryngeal cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma), exposure to asbestos dust can cause various benign changes of the lung (asbestosis) and the pleura (pleural plaques and diffuse pleural thickening). Statutory accident insurance institutions in Germany are legally required to actively detect clinical symptoms and conditions depending on occupational history, and to compensate asbestos-related diseases. The insurance institutions have therefore organised standardised surveillance programmes for the early detection of asbestos-related diseases. It is generally accepted that computed tomography has a higher sensitivity and specificity for the early detection of asbestos related changes of lung and pleura, but the required higher radiation dose in former times and the higher costs precluded a wider use in early detection programmes. 3257 most former power industry workers {{were included in the}} analysis. Based on exposure history, smoking history and age at the time of examination, a subgroup of participants was considered as having an increased risk of developing asbestos-related radiologic changes. These participants were examined with MDCT (n= 196), the participants with lower risk were examined with chest X-ray (n= 3061). The aim of our study was to assess the importance of common risk factors associated with specific radiological changes such as parenchymal fibrosis and pleural thickening. We did this with the view that determining rates of radiological changes typical for specific risk profiles would help differentiate large scale surveillance and early detection programmes. To assess the influence of selected risk factors (age, time since first exposure, exposure duration, cumulative exposure and pack years) on typical asbestos-related radiographic changes, we applied multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. On X-ray we found low rates of asbestos-induced parenchymal (1 %) and pleural changes (plaques 7. 9 %, diffuse pleural thickening 5. 9 %) compared to MDCT (20. 4 % parenchymal and 57. 1 % pleural changes). On CXR, <b>pleural</b> changes and <b>asbestosis</b> were strongly associated with age, years since first exposure and exposure duration. Plaques were also associated with cumulative exposure and diffuse pleural thickening and parenchymal changes with pack-years. In the CT group parenchymal changes were associated with age and pack-years whereas pleural changes were associated with latency, exposure duration and cumulative exposure. The ROC analysis resulted in optimal cut-offs of 55 years for age, 17 years for the exposure time and 38 years for latency to discriminate between patients with and without radiological chances. Participants aged 55 years and older and those with an asbestos exposure of at least 17 years or 28 years since first exposure should be seen as having an increased risk of abnormal radiological findings...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos, a fibrous mineral with {{excellent}} chemical and physical properties {{and a very}} wide application, especially in civil engineering, is now {{known to be a}} proven human carcinogen and therefore its utilization was forbidden. It causes <b>asbestosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> hyalinosis, acute exudative pleuritis, lung cancer and pleural mesothelioma. Recently, many reconstructions of school facilities took place and are still taking place across the Czech Republic. This causes the drilling and cutting of asbestos and thus the release of fibres into the atmosphere and the interiors of buildings. Many reconstructions were also executed in South Bohemia, where panels containing asbestos were handled. This was a cause of concern not only for teachers, the employees of the schools affected, but also for the parents of children attending schools containing asbestos materials. A whole number of bodies in mutual cooperation participated in the disposal of asbestos in schools in the Czech Republic. It is thus very necessary and useful for public health officers and the above-listed entities involved, to have information about how their approach to the given problem and the whole solution of the problem was assessed by the teachers. The thesis consists of two parts: theoretical and investigative. The work deals with the evaluation of the {{solution to the problem of}} asbestos by authorities involved in the school from the teachers' point of view. The theoretical part deals with selected chemical pollutants in the work environment. It also focuses on the pollutant asbestos in general. Lastly, another chapter is devoted to the issue of the assessment of health risks, which is very closely related to pollutants in the work environment. The practical part contains the results that emerged from interviews with teachers. In the discussion, the results are compared with online articles and specialist literature. The necessary data for the research part of the thesis was obtained through qualitative research interviews with educators from the elementary school Máj I. Through the evaluation of the interviews, I answered the research questions and identified several hypotheses that could be tested in future quantitative research. In this thesis, I aimed to identify the level of cooperation of stakeholders in addressing the issue of asbestos disposal in the school concerned in the South Bohemian Region. Research suggests that the solution to the problem of asbestos in the school was judged largely positively by the teachers. They particularly praised the approach of the Municipality of České Budějovice. They criticized the errors made by the OHL ŽS and Mapoz Zliv companies regarding the reconstruction and also the company Sita cz, which carried out the sanitation works, after whose intervention the teachers lacked many things. Educators confused the competences of the regional health authorities with the competences of the Health Institute, and therefore the general public should get acquainted with the competences of these bodies in order to facilitate the communication between the different entities and the public, not only in the asbestos issue...|$|R
