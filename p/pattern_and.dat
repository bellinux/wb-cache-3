40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a critical review}} of <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages in human-computer interaction (HCI). In recent years, <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages have received considerable attention in HCI for their potential {{as a means for}} developing and communicating information and knowledge to support good design. This review examines the background to <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages in HCI, and seeks to locate pattern languages in relation to other approaches to interaction design. The review explores four key issues: what is a pattern? what is a pattern language? how are <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages used? <b>and</b> how are values reflected in the pattern-based approach to design? Following on from the review, a future research agenda is proposed for <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages in HCI. </p...|$|R

5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are {{generally}} small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and rufous plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches {{on their backs}} or shoulders. Most have heavy bills, which in many species are hooked at the tip.|$|E
5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E

5|$|As the BBC {{broadcasting}} {{unit was}} about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} the supplier had modified the drive units, meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised.

Modifications were made to adapt to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance <b>pattern,</b> <b>and</b> the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E
5|$|For random initial conditions, the {{boundaries}} between the trees formed in this way themselves shift in a seemingly random <b>pattern,</b> <b>and</b> trees frequently die out altogether.

5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E

5|$|Massey and Brown {{introduced}} standardization to the fragmented company. After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model across the entire chain.

The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} how linguistic patterns {{can contribute to}} ontology development by enabling an easier reuse of some ontological resources. In particular, our research focuses on the reuse of ontology design <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> ontology statements by relying on linguistic constructs {{at different stages of}} the reuse process. With this aim, we propose the employment of lexico-syntactic patterns with two objectives: 1) the reuse of ontology design <b>patterns,</b> <b>and</b> 2) the validation of ontology statements for their subsequent reuse in the ontology development. To illustrate the proposed approaches, we will present some examples of lexico-syntactic <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> their employment in the reuse of ontology design <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> in the validation of ontology statements...|$|R
