For multi-actuators {{speed control}} system driven by single pump, several {{effective}} control {{methods have been}} proposed, such as flow feedback control, etc. These methods are effective only to the engineering equipment with fewer actuators. As for large ships with more than ten actuators required for speed control, using traditional control methods will result in that costs much, {{the structure of the}} hydraulic system is very complicated, even unable to realize. In order to meet the coordinate action of many actuators, two ways based on throttle control and <b>pressure</b> <b>compensation</b> control are introduced in this paper. The research results based on the theoretical analysis of speed control error and adaptability, simulation research and experimental confirmation indicate that the throttle control method is limited by the number of actuators, load size and the speed error, but the <b>pressure</b> <b>compensation</b> control method is helpful to enhance rationality and the coordination of flow distribution between various actuators...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the hydraulic performance of new and used (9 years of use with 4265 h of operation) self-compensating micro-sprinklers of the SuperNet LR model. The study was performed in a laboratory to evaluate flow in the range of <b>pressure</b> <b>compensation,</b> coefficient of manufacturing variation or discharge (CVF and CVQ), wetting pattern, distribution uniformity coefficient (DUC), and Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CUC).

The coverage diameters of the new and used micro-sprinklers were the same as those given in the manufacturer’s catalog.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of <b>pressure</b> <b>compensation</b> in the middle ear on the size of the {{response}} of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at frequencies from 1 to 6 kHz. The testing was performed on 150 patients, within three age groups (2 ­ 15; 16 - 40; 41 - 71 years of age). The pressure in the middle ear varied from negative to positive (- 329 to 195 daPa). Increasing the pressure in the compensation for 1 daPa led to an increase in amplitude at frequencies of 1. 0, 1. 3 and 1. 6 kHz to 0. 02, 0. 03 and 0. 02 dB SPL (decibel of sound pressure level), and the noise level at frequencies from 1. 0 to 2. 0 kHz, causing an increase of 0. 02 to 0. 03 dB SPL. Compensatory treatment led to an increase in DPOAE response (amplitude and noise level). The largest amplitude was determined at frequencies lower than 2 kHz within the levels of both examined influences. <b>Pressure</b> <b>compensation</b> had a stimulating influence on the detectability of DPOAE, which increases the reliability of this method when testing the functionality of the middle ear...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Deviant {{middle ear}} {{pressure}} {{has a negative}} effect on the forward and backward transmission of stimulus and emissions through the middle ear. Resolving this deviant middle ear pressure is expected to lead to better middle ear transmission and, as a result of this, stronger otoacoustic emissions, which are better detectable. We investigated the effect of compensation o a deviant tympanic peak pressure on click-evoked otoacoustic emissions (CEOAEs). Second, we compared patient data to model predictions made by Zwislocki's middle ear model. Setting: University Medical Center. Patients: Fifty-nine children aged between 0. 5 and 9 years (mean, 4. 4 yr). Intervention: Hearing investigations including CEOAE measurements at ambient and at compensated tympanic peak pressure (TPP). Main Outcome Measure: CEOAEs at ambient and compensated TPP. Results: Compensation of TPP resulted in higher emission amplitudes below 2 kHz (increase of 8 - 11 dB). In addition, the compensated measurement showed an increased phase lag (up to one-fourth cycle). For ears with mild deviations of TPP, Zwislocki's model could describe these changes. <b>Pressure</b> <b>compensation</b> was well described by a compliance increase of the tympanic membrane, the malleus, and the incus. Conclusion: Compensating the ear canal pressure for negative tympanic peak pressure increased CEOAE amplitudes below 2 kHz and increased the phase lag.

40|$|Age-standardised {{parameters}} Aims: The {{purpose of}} the study was to demonstrate autonomic nervous system (ANS) changes associated with treatment in hypertensive patients and utilization of these measurements in practice. Methods: Hypertensive patients were examined before the start of treatment and after blood <b>pressure</b> <b>compensation.</b> The telemetric system VarCor PF 5 was used for non-invasive heart rate registration and automatic evaluation of heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. The supine-standing-supine test with ortho-clinostatic loading in standard conditions was used for HRV evaluation. Results: The influence of antihypertensive therapy on ANS was demonstrated in two cases. The first was a case of a responder to therapy and the second case was example of a non-responder to monotherapy regarding more therapeutic steps for blood pressure control. Different modes of results presentation are demonstrated: 3 D graph, numeric form of standard parameters of HRV, computer interpretation of results by means of complex parameters and indices in numeric, graphic and verbal form with functional age calculation, cross graph of vagal activity index versus sympatho-vagal balance index was used for repeated measurements and follow-up. The increased spectral performance with augmented vagal activity and slope down of sympatho-vagal ratio are evident after blood pressure control achievement. Improvement of functional age parameter associated with blood <b>pressure</b> <b>compensation</b> is visible using a complex age-dependent parameters interpretation.
