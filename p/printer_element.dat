The lever arm amplification method were used as amplified piezoelectric actuator in 1980s as a piezoelectric impact <b>printer</b> <b>element</b> by T.Yano et al. from EM Precicison Technologies Ltd.(later renamed Mechano Transformer Corporation).|$|E

As {{exhibited}} in "Pioneers of Modern Graphic Design", October 16, 1997 -April 30, 1998 : Poster, Tentoonstelling van Nederlandsche Gemeente Werken te Utrecht (Exhibition of Dutch Municipal Works in Utrect), 1926 / Designed by Antonius Kurvers (Dutch, 1889 - 1940) / Printed by Van Leer, Amsterdam / Commecial color lithograph / TD 1990. 340. 137 / This poster {{is characterized by}} a vertical format, densely packed sans-serif letters composed from <b>printer's</b> <b>elements</b> (lines, bars, rules), and an asymmetrical page layout. Kurvers, a follower of H. T. Wijdeveld, the founder and designer of the journal Wendingen, worked in a typographical style known variously as the Amsterdam School, Amsterdam Expressionism or, most appropriately, the Wendingen style. The poster's beautiful modulations of color and solid forms reflect Amsterdam School brick architecture. // Poster / Tentoostelling van Nederlandsche Gemeente Werken te Utrecht (Exhibition of Dutch Municipal Works in Utrecht), 1926 / Designed by Antonius Kurvers (Dutch, 1889 - 1940) / Printed by Van Leer, Amsterdam / Commercial color lithograph / 39 1 / 8 x 31 3 / 8 inches (99. 4 x 79. 7 centimeters) / Credit: The Wolfsonian-Florida International University, Miami Beach, Florida, The Mitchell Wolfson, Jr. Collection / TD 1990. 340. 137...|$|R

Examples are micro mechanical sensors for car security systems, nozzle plates for <b>printer,</b> and optical <b>elements</b> for X-ray beam splitting. Wherever {{the accuracy of}} etched silicon structures is not required, laser processes with short pulses and small wave length can be an option with the advantage of shorter process time. High quality cutting and drilling of silicon {{can be achieved by}} application of diode pumped q-switched Nd:YAG-lasers and harmonics generation. The short pulses (15 ns) and the UV wave length (355 nm) of the Gator UV form Lambda Physik AG, for example, allow a reduction of thermal effects like deposition of molten material and heat effected zones at the edges. Especially in the case of deep structures the ablation plasma causes powerful heating of the walls. An reduction of the plasma temperatures and so the heat influence on the walls can be realized by a small laser wave length with low plasma absorption area into the bulk material. Also the duration and intensity of plasma heating is reduced by short laser pulses. In this contribution the possibilities and limits of laser machining of Si by diode pumped Nd:YAG-lasers with harmonics generation will be presented by means of structures processed by application of a scanner with f-theta-optic. The results will be discussed concerning the experimental setup and the laser parameters...|$|R
