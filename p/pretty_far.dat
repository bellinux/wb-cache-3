5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, <b>pretty</b> <b>far</b> away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still <b>pretty</b> <b>far</b> from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E
500|$|Further {{changes were}} made after the March 2007 preview {{screenings}} of the film in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona. This included the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits. A lot {{of people at the}} screenings found the original film too coarse, and some of Homer's behavior too unkind, so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer. Russ Cargill was redesigned several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld. The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure. Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story, and the [...] "Spider-Pig" [...] gag was also a late addition. One excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund. Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, which was featured on the DVD, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end, and a news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film. Several musical numbers, at various intervals throughout the film, were cut. These included a song about Alaska, featuring music by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics. Jean said it [...] "got <b>pretty</b> <b>far</b> along in the animation, and then we got scared that the movie began to drag in that section." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 30, 2008, The Oklahoman {{reported}} that Pickens {{was ready to}} start buying wind turbines for the project within a month, {{that he planned to}} buy between 1,700 and 2,000 turbines, and that they will cost from $200million to $300million. Pickens added that he has been approached by twenty potential partners on the project but has not yet made a final decision. [...] "We have not picked any banker and we have not picked any partner," [...] Pickens said. [...] "It is kind of nice ... I have decided I can get <b>pretty</b> <b>far</b> down the track before having to make those choices." [...] Pickens predicted that similar wind farm projects could be built in the Texas Panhandle and the Canada–US border in the future.|$|E
2500|$|On October 8, 1999, Clarkson {{was sworn}} in as the 26th Governor General of Canada, and was soon {{actively}} participating in her role, becoming immediately instrumental {{in the final stages of}} the repatriation of Canada's unknown soldier from France. Her eulogy read at the tomb's dedication ceremony on May 28, 2000, was described by the Royal Canadian Legion as [...] "powerful", and led journalist John Fraser to state: [...] "You have to go back <b>pretty</b> <b>far</b> to find anyone who stirred national emotions the way Clarkson did with her magnificent speech..." [...] In the same vein, after a decade of inaction on the part of the Cabinet, Clarkson moved to have Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry honoured with the Commander-in-Chief's Unit Commendation, on behalf of the Queen, beginning a long relationship between Clarkson and the regiment.|$|E
