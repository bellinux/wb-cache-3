5|$|In Leipzig, the Magnificat was {{regularly}} part of Sunday services, sung in German on ordinary Sundays {{but more}} elaborately and in Latin {{on the high}} holidays (Christmas, Easter and <b>Pentecost)</b> and on the three Marian feasts Annunciation, Visitation and Purification.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} this cantata for Whit Tuesday, {{the third}} day of <b>Pentecost.</b> It was likely based on an earlier secular cantata for New Year's Day composed in Köthen (BWV 184a). The musicologist Szymon Paczkowski suggests two other possible occasions for the secular model: the birthday of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Coethen on 10 December 1720, and the wedding of the prince and Friderica Henrietta on 11 December 1721.|$|E

5|$|Bach had an {{audience}} {{familiar with the}} text and its background. In Leipzig, a Latin Magnificat was sung on the high holidays (Christmas, Easter and <b>Pentecost,</b> then performed {{on two of the}} three days of celebration) and on the three Marian feasts Annunciation, Visitation and Purification. According to some scholars, further feast days included New Year's Day, Epiphany, Feast of the Ascension, Trinity Sunday, St. John's Day and St. Michael's Day, and the vespers before the feast days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pentecost</b> tracks down Raleigh at a wall {{construction}} site and persuades him {{to rejoin the}} program. Traveling to the Hong Kong base, the Shatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program and Pentecost’s adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in operation – the refurbished Gipsy Danger, the Russian Cherno Alpha, the Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and the Australian Striker Eureka that will carry the bomb, and piloted by father and son Herc and Chuck Hansen.|$|E
5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, <b>Pentecost,</b> Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals {{are tied to}} the {{moveable}} feast of Easter. Festivals take precedence over all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of <b>Pentecost).</b> For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E

25|$|The parish realizes its {{principal}} festival {{in honor of}} Nossa Senhora do Pilar and São Roque on the third Sunday of August. It also follows {{the tradition of the}} festivals of the Holy Spirit which are common in the islands of the Azores, here celebrated on the Sunday of <b>Pentecosts.</b>|$|R
5|$|The current name, Towson United Methodist Church, {{was adopted}} in 1968 {{to reflect the}} merger in that year of the Methodist and Evangelical United Brethren {{denominations}} in the U.S. On <b>Pentecost</b> Sunday, May 11, 2008, the fiftieth anniversary of the present sanctuary's completion was celebrated by a reenactment of the original May 11, 1958, dedication service.|$|E
5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at <b>Pentecost.</b> They then cite biblical {{examples}} in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 {{to show that it}} was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E
5|$|All Jaegers except Gipsy Danger are {{dispatched}} to intervene. Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon, while Leatherback destroys Cherno Alpha and paralyzes Striker Eureka with an EMP blast. Out of options, <b>Pentecost</b> reluctantly allows Mako and Raleigh to pilot Gipsy Danger. Gipsy successfully kills Leatherback and Otachi, while almost destroying Hong Kong in the process. Examining Otachi's body, Newton and Hannibal {{find out that}} it is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal but soon dies from being strangled by its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant’s brain, discovering that The Breach can only open {{in the presence of a}} Kaiju's DNA.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{notice that}} he celebrated mass in the parochial Church of Vila Nova (in Praia da Vitória) {{on the day of}} <b>Pentecosts,</b> {{signalling}} that the settlement of Ramo Grande was already, by the 16th century, the center of the Cult of the Holy Spirit on the island of Terceira.|$|R
50|$|The parish celebrates feasts {{associated}} with Nossa Senhora da Graça (Our Lady of Grace) on second Sunday in September, and whose images {{is located in}} the parochial church. Associated with the Cult of the Holy Spirit there feast days following <b>Pentecosts,</b> and include celebrations at the Impérios Ascensão, Trindade and S. João.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most of <b>Pentecost's</b> roads, {{the road}} through Melsisi is {{surfaced}} with concrete, a measure {{necessary to prevent}} erosion since this section of road is extremely steep. The surfacing of the road {{has been carried out}} in stages, with the last section (from the junction below the clinic to the junction behind the church) completed in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of <b>Pentecost</b> and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's revisions to the wedding cantata is not known. It is likely that he revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
5|$|Gaston B. Cashwell, a {{minister}} of the Methodist Church, joined Crumpler's group in 1903. He became a leading figure {{in the church and}} the Pentecostal movement on the east coast. In 1906, he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission. While there he professed having received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, in December 1906, Cashwell preached the <b>Pentecost</b> experience in the local holiness church.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 {{he built}} two pulpits {{for the church}} of Santa Maria in Blanes: the pulpit on the Gospel side had a {{hexagonal}} base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the Epistle side had {{the names of the}} apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of <b>Pentecost.</b> These pulpits were burned in July 1936.|$|E
50|$|Azores Day (Dia dos Acores) is a {{regional}} holiday established {{to commemorate the}} Azorean political autonomy established in the Portuguese constitution, following the Carnation Revolution. The date corresponds to the festival of the Holy Spirit, a celebration based in the archipelago's religious and cultural history, held on the Sunday of <b>Pentecosts,</b> a movable public holiday observed only in the archipelago of the Azores.|$|R
50|$|With an {{estimated}} 7,800 native speakers (in the year 2000), Apma {{is the most}} widely spoken of <b>Pentecost's</b> native languages, and the fifth largest vernacular in Vanuatu as a whole. In recent times Apma has spread {{at the expense of}} other indigenous languages such as Sowa and Ske. Apma is increasingly mixed with words and expressions from Bislama, Vanuatu's national language.|$|R
6000|$|As for {{the rest}} of the party at the other end of the boat, they were in a fair way to confirm Mrs. <b>Pentecost's</b> doubts whether the hilarity of the picnic would last the day out. Poor Neelie's natural feeling of {{irritation}} under the disappointment which Allan's awkwardness had inflicted on her was now exasperated into silent and settled resentment by her own keen sense of humiliation and defeat. The major had relapsed into his habitually dreamy, absent manner; his mind was turning monotonously with the wheels of his clock. The curate still secluded his indigestion from public view in the innermost recesses of the cabin; and the curate's mother, with a second dose ready at a moment's notice, sat on guard at the door. Women of Mrs. <b>Pentecost's</b> age and character generally enjoy their own bad spirits. [...] "This," [...] sighed the old lady, wagging her head with a smile of sour satisfaction [...] "is what you call a day's pleasure, is it? Ah, what fools we all were to leave our comfortable homes!" ...|$|R
5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of <b>Pentecost.</b> The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
5|$|In December 1523, {{the council}} set a {{deadline}} of <b>Pentecost</b> in 1524 {{for a solution}} to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year in Leipzig, Bach {{composed}} chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday, but for Easter he returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Nine of his cantatas for consecutive occasions in the period between Easter and <b>Pentecost</b> are based on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, this one being {{the first of the}} series especially written for Bach. He had possibly commissioned them in 1724 for his first cantata cycle but not composed them at that time, because of his exceptional workload in creating the St John Passion.|$|E
50|$|Most of Melsisi {{is built}} on a steep, grassy mountainside. Although located on <b>Pentecost's</b> west coast, due to a kink in the {{coastline}} {{the main part of}} the village faces almost due south. The island's main north-south road passes through Melsisi, climbing steeply up from the coast through the village and passing over the hill to the north-east. On the hilltop above Melsisi, near the village of Ilamre, is a prominent concrete cross.|$|R
5000|$|Like <b>Pentecost's</b> other languages, Apma {{is named}} after the local word for [...] "what" [...] or [...] "something". Locally it is usually {{referred}} to simply as dalekte [...] "language" [...] or daleda [...] "our language". Many people from other areas of Vanuatu recognise the language by the catchphrase te gabis meaning [...] "good" [...] or [...] "OK", or refer informally to its speakers as wakin, an Apma term of address for brothers or friends.|$|R
50|$|Polish-French {{relations}} were nascent until the 18th century, due to geographical distance and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's lack {{of involvement in}} the wars of Western Europe. A notable exception occurred in 1573, when Henry III of France was elected king of Poland, but he retired from that position the next year. The French Order of the Holy Spirit was dedicated to the Holy Spirit for commemorating Henry III's succession as king of Poland (1573) and France (1574) on two <b>Pentecosts.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books <b>Pentecost</b> (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{gave birth}} to her first son in March 1133 at Le Mans, the future Henry II. Henry was delighted by the news and came to see her at Rouen. At <b>Pentecost</b> 1134, son Geoffrey was born in Rouen, but the {{childbirth}} was extremely difficult and Matilda appeared close to death. She made arrangements for her will and argued with her father about where she should be buried. Matilda preferred Bec Abbey, but Henry wanted her to be interred at Rouen Cathedral. Matilda recovered, and Henry was overjoyed by the birth of his second grandson, possibly insisting on another round of oaths from his nobility.|$|E
5|$|More than a {{thousand}} services are held every year. There are daily services of Matins, Holy Communion and Choral Evensong, as well as major celebrations of Christian festivals such as Christmas, Easter, <b>Pentecost</b> and saints' days. The cathedral is also used for the baptisms, weddings and funerals of those with close connections to it. In July 2009 the cathedral undertook the funeral of Harry Patch, the last British Army veteran of World War I, who {{died at the age}} of 111.|$|E
50|$|Owing to its history, Rabo de Peixe {{is an area}} {{of strong}} {{heritage}} and cultural traditions, that includes traditional festivals, folklore, music and a large architectural patrimony. The religious festivals are valued by the local population, and attract many visitors throughout the year. The begin immediately {{on the first day of}} the New Year, with the ‘’Festa do Senhor Bom Jesus’’, the patron saint, but also include the devotional celebrations associated with the Holy Spirit throughout the summer after <b>Pentecosts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Cook and Evans also echo <b>Pentecost's</b> {{interpretation}} that the detail regarding [...] "many stadia away" [...] and [...] "battered by the waves" [...] {{were intended to}} emphasize that Jesus could walk on the water {{far away from the}} shore, on a rough sea, thus establishing his dominance over nature. R.T. France has also pointed out that the details regarding the boat being {{a long way from the}} shore, and the portrayal of Peter sinking are intended as a confirmation of the depth of the water.|$|R
5000|$|Following <b>Pentecosts,</b> {{many of the}} parishes {{within the}} {{municipality}} participate in feasts dedicated to the Holy Spirit. A tradition across the islands of the Azores, the Cult of the Holy Spirit dates to medieval traditions, involving [...] "promises" [...] made to God (promessas), the processions of faith {{to and from the}} Church and feasts of meat-broth soup and bread donated to the poor. In comparison to other islands/parishes of the Azores, most neighbourhoods of São Miguel allow the free participation of visitors, seen as fulfilling the tenets of the tradition, rather than the narrow sub-community of the Brotherhoods of the Holy Spirit.|$|R
