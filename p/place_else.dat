500|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} claimed {{for many years}} as {{the origin of the}} Prester John legend, but most modern experts believe that the legend was simply adapted to fit that nation in the same fashion that it had been {{projected}} upon Ong Khan and Central Asia during the 13th century. Modern scholars find nothing about the Prester or his country in the early material that would make Ethiopia a more suitable identification than any <b>place</b> <b>else,</b> and furthermore, specialists in Ethiopian history have effectively demonstrated that the story was not widely known there until well after European contact. Czech Franciscan Remedius Prutky asked Emperor Iyasu II about this identification in 1751, and Prutky states that the man was [...] "astonished, and told me that the kings of Abyssinia had never been accustomed to call themselves by this name." [...] In a footnote to this passage, Richard Pankhurst states that this is apparently the first recorded statement by an Ethiopian monarch about this tale, and they were likely unaware of the title until Prutky's inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{websites}} to comment on The Oracle, with their reviewer Jason Ankeny describing the album' as [...] "the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut", awarding it three stars out of five, and praising it for being a return to the band original sound, stating, [...] "The Oracle is, if nothing else, a return to the band’s signature sound of yore. It seems as if Godsmack heard the cry of their dedicated hoard and went back to making the kind of record that defined them.", then he added, [...] "Those fans seeking a return to Godsmack’s roots will not be disappointed; for others, the sound may be a retrenchment because there was no <b>place</b> <b>else</b> for them to go. The only undebatable thing is that The Oracle is the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbitt was {{employed}} as a mental hospital attendant in the late 1950s but, like his father, he fulfilled his love of music by performing at the Six Steps Down club in his hometown. He later won a talent contest and was given an hour of Saturday night radio show time to broadcast a live performance from a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1964, he signed his first record deal with 20th Century Records and released the singles, [...] "Next to the Note" [...] and [...] "Six Nights and Seven Days". Four years later, with $1,000.00 to his name, Rabbitt moved to Nashville where {{he began his career}} as a songwriter. During his first night in the town, Rabbitt wrote [...] "Working My Way Up to the Bottom", which Roy Drusky recorded in 1968. To support himself, Rabbitt worked as a truck driver, soda jerk and fruit picker while in Nashville. He was ultimately hired as a staff writer for the Hill & Range Publishing Company and received a salary of $37.50 per week. As a young songwriter, Rabbitt socialized with other aspiring writers at Wally's Clubhouse, a bar in Nashville; he said that he and the other patrons had [...] "no <b>place</b> <b>else</b> to go." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{had been}} a jolly {{mechanic}} again, in denim overalls and jumper and a defiant black skull-cap with long, shiny vizor; the tender of the motor-boat fleet at an Ontario summer hotel. One day he had looked up, sweating and greasy, to see Howard Griffin, of Plato, parading past in white flannels. He had muttered: [...] "I don't want Them to know I've just been bumming around. I'll go some <b>place</b> <b>else.</b> And I'll do something worth while." [...] Now {{he was on the}} train for New York, meditating impersonally on his uselessness, considering how free of moss his rolling had kept him. He could think of no particularly masterful plan for accumulating moss. If he had not bought a ticket through to New York he would have turned back, to seek a position in one of the great automobile factories that now, this early autumn of 1906, were beginning to distinguish Detroit. Well, he had enough money to last for one week in New York. He would work in an automobile agency there; later he would go to Detroit, and within a few years be president of a motor company, rich enough to experiment with motor-boats and to laugh at Howard Griffin or any other Platonian.|$|E

Brief descriptions explain the mind maps and why items were placed in certain areas where as traditionally {{they may have been}} <b>placed</b> <b>else</b> where.

I must have gone to Sligo sometimes in the Christmas holidays, for I can remember riding my red pony to a hunt. He balked at the first jump, to my relief, and when a crowd of boys began to beat him, I would not allow it. They all jeered at me for being afraid. I found a gap and when I was alone in a field tried another ditch, but the pony would not jump that either; so I tied him to a tree and lay down among the ferns and looked up into the sky. On my way home I met the hunt again and noticed that everybody avoided the dogs, and because I wanted to find out why they did so I rode to where the dogs had gathered {{in the middle of the}} lane and stood my pony amongst them, and everybody began to shout at me.|$|E

We fight not for ourselves--for we are but the {{momentary}} hands and eyes of the Life of the World. So you, Father Redwood, taught us. Through us and through the little folk the Spirit looks and learns. From us by word and birth and act it must pass--to still greater lives. This earth is no resting place; this earth is no playing <b>place,</b> <b>else</b> indeed we might put our throats to the little people's knife, having no greater right to live than they. And they in their turn might yield to the ants and vermin. We fight not for ourselves but for growth--growth that goes on for ever. To-morrow, whether we live or die, growth will conquer through us. That is the law of the spirit for ever more. To grow according to the will of God! To grow out of these cracks and crannies, out of these shadows and darknesses, into greatness and the light! Greater," [...] he said, speaking with slow deliberation, [...] "greater, my Brothers! And then--still greater. To grow, and again--to grow. To grow at last into the fellowship and understanding of God. Growing.... Till the earth {{is no more than a}} footstool.... Till the spirit shall have driven fear into nothingness, and spread...."
