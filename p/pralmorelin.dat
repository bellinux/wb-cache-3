50|$|In August 2017, the UCI {{confirmed}} that Samuel Sanchez had returned a positive out of competition drug test for GHRP-2 (<b>Pralmorelin).</b> He was immediately suspended {{by the team}} pending analysis of his B-sample.|$|E
50|$|Ravin {{broke the}} radius {{bone in his}} left forearm in a multi-vehicle {{automobile}} accident on February 29, 2016. The injury required surgery. Ravin began the 2016 season on the 15-day disabled list. On May 10, 2016, Ravin was suspended for 80 games by MLB for testing positive for <b>pralmorelin,</b> a banned performance-enhancing drug. Ravin was reinstated on August 3, and optioned to Triple-A. He rejoined the Dodgers on August 8. He appeared in 10 games with a 0.93 ERA in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Examorelin {{substantially}} and dose-dependently increases plasma {{levels of}} growth hormone (GH) in animals and humans. In addition, similarly to <b>pralmorelin</b> (GHRP-2) and GHRP-6, it slightly and dose-dependently stimulates {{the release of}} prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol in humans. There are conflicting reports {{on the ability of}} examorelin to elevate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) levels in humans, with some studies finding no increase and others finding a slight yet statistically significant increase. Examorelin does not affect plasma levels of glucose, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in humans.|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone secretagogues (GSHs) are a {{class of}} drugs which act as secretagogues (i.e., induce the secretion) of growth hormone (GH). They include {{agonists}} of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), such as ghrelin (lenomorelin), <b>pralmorelin</b> (GHRP-2), GHRP-6, examorelin (hexarelin), ipamorelin, and ibutamoren (MK-677), and agonists of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (somatorelin), CJC-1295, sermorelin, and tesamorelin. Many also induce the secretion of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), as well as of other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as prolactin and cortisol. The main clinical application of these agents is the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. They also see black market use, similarly to anabolic steroids, for bodybuilding purposes.|$|E
40|$|As a {{regulator}} of {{food intake}} and energy metabolism, {{the role of}} ghrelin in glucose metabolism is still not fully understood. In this study, we determined the in vivo effect of ghrelin on incretin effect. We demonstrated that ghrelin inhibited the glucose-stimulated release of glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) when infused into the portal vein of Wistar rat. Hepatic vagotomy diminished the inhibitory effect of ghrelin on glucose-stimulated GLP- 1 secretion. In addition, phentolamine, a nonselective α receptor antagonist, could recover the decrease of GLP- 1 release induced by ghrelin infusion. <b>Pralmorelin</b> (an artificial growth hormone release peptide) infusion into the portal vein could also inhibit the glucose-stimulated release of GLP- 1. And growth hormone secretagogue receptor antagonist, [D-lys 3]-GHRP- 6, infusion showed comparable increases of glucose stimulated GLP- 1 release compared to ghrelin infusion into the portal vein. The data showed that intraportal infusion of ghrelin exerted an inhibitory effect on GLP- 1 secretion through growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1 α (GHS 1 α receptor), which indicated that the downregulation of ghrelin secretion after food intake was necessary for incretin effect. Furthermore, our results suggested that the enteric neural net involved hepatic vagal nerve and sympathetic nerve mediated inhibition effect of ghrelin on incretin effect...|$|E
40|$|Human Growth Hormone (hGH, somatotropin) {{is one of}} the {{relevant}} forbidden substances to be detected in sport drug testing. Since the appearance of recombinant hGH (rhGH) in the 80 's, its expansion and availability through the black market have increased, so the detection of its abuse continues to be a challenge at present. New techniques or biomarkers that are robust, reliable, sensitive and allowing a large detection time window are welcome. rhGH produces an increase of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1). FN 1 (fibronectin 1) and RAB 31 (member of RAS oncogene family) genes have been suggested as two potential biomarkers for IGF- 1 abuse. Following this line, in the present study some genetic and proteomic approaches have been performed with fourteen healthy male subjects treated with rhGH (which produces increase of IGF- 1 concentrations) to study FN 1 gene, FN 1 protein, RAB 31 gene and RAB 31 protein as potential biomarkers for rhGH abuse. The results showed that both, RAB 31 and FN 1 genes and FN 1 protein could be potential biomarkers for rhGH administration. Preliminary assessments of gender, age, acute sport activities and GHRP- 2 (<b>pralmorelin,</b> a rhGH releasing peptide) influence suggest they are not relevant confounding factors. Thus, the selected markers present high sensitivity and a larger detection window for rhGH detection than IGF- 1 itself. This work was carried out with the partial financial support of the International Olympic Committee (2014 IOC Anti-Doping Research Fund) and the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competividad (MINECO) (DEP 2012 - 32048).
