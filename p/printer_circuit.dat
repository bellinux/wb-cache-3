40|$|The {{demand for}} high performance, more {{flexible}} and reconfigurable dc-dc converters has pushed dc-dc converter designers to seek for alternative ways {{to control the}} pulse-width modulated switch inside the dc-dc converter. During the past few years, efforts have been put forward both by academics and power semiconductor industries to phase out {{the most commonly used}} analog PWM controllers with digital controller with its associated software. This paper presents an experimental result of designing and building a 5 W synchronous buck converter that employs a microcontroller to process the output voltage signal and translate it into PWM signal to control the switches inside the buck converter and hence regulating the output voltage. Design requirements, procedures, component selections and measurement results will be described in this paper. In addition, operating performance of the buck converter as a result of implementing the digital controller will also be discussed, along with the description of the actual schematics and the final <b>printer</b> <b>circuit</b> board of the circuit...|$|E

The design can be automatically checked for spacing violations and many other design rules. If the PCB is ready designed it can be directly displayed and rotated in a live 3D view. The 3D data can be exported in STEP format to produce preview 3D dummies of the PCB on 3D <b>printers.</b> <b>Circuit</b> design on 3D bodies (Molded Interconnect Device, MID) is possible.|$|R
5000|$|The LaserJet 4 series {{had small}} {{printers}} in the range: the personal-use 4L and the small-business use 4P (and the Macintosh-compatible 4ML and 4MP). These printers both used the Canon PX engine, which like the EX was new {{at the time}} of release. The 4L used the 300 DPI PX engine, with the 4P using the upgraded 600 DPI PX-II engine. The 4L was the first LaserJet with power-saving technology that turned off the printer when not in use. [...] The 4L is also notable in that it was the first LaserJet printer manufactured via [...] "Mass Customization & Bulk Shipping", where the <b>printer's</b> <b>circuit</b> board, power cord and other final assembly items were assembled regionally, closer to the end-user. This saved the company millions in tariff and shipping costs as well as weeks in time-to-market. This process was used for low-end printers (4L, 4P, etc.), and initially in three regions: North America, Europe and Asia.|$|R

5000|$|A common {{business}} model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer {{at or below}} production cost, while dramatically marking {{up the price of}} the (proprietary) ink cartridges (a profit model called [...] "Freebie marketing"). Most current inkjet printers attempt to enforce this product tying by anticompetitive measures such as microchips in the cartridges to hinder the use of third-party or refilled ink cartridges. The microchips monitor usage and report the ink remaining to the printer. Some manufacturers also impose [...] "expiration dates". When the chip reports that the cartridge is empty (or out of date) the printer stops printing. Even if the cartridge is refilled, the microchip will indicate to the printer that the cartridge is depleted. For many models (especially from Canon), the 'empty' status can be overridden by entering a 'service code' (or sometimes simply by pressing the 'start' button again). For some <b>printers,</b> special <b>circuit</b> [...] "flashers" [...] are available that reset the quantity of remaining ink to the maximum.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the {{hardware and software}} design of the PC based electronic checker systems for standardized entrance examinations. The system consists of PC, <b>printer,</b> sensor <b>circuits,</b> multiplexer. The PC including designed software manipulates {{the operation of the}} system and the printer. The printer is used as feeder of the answer sheets answer key. The sensor circuit senses the shaded area in answer sheet and keys. The feeding of the answer sheets is the same as feeding paper in a printer. Items are answered by marking specified areas of the examination sheet with the use of carbon pencil. The answer key sheet is to be scanned first and to be stored in the memory where the rest of the sheets to be scanned are being compared with. The shaded area of the scanned sheets as well as the results of the scanned answer sheets such as name, ID numbers and scores are displayed in the monitor and can be manipulated through the software, programmed in Turbo C++. The software is capable of sorting the names and ID numbers, searching records, ranking the scores, and also provides the database used. The developed system will be beneficial for every faculty or admission personnel at least to ease burden and save time for checking test paper...|$|R
40|$|Printed {{circuit boards}} {{are a major}} {{component}} of most modern electronic devices. There are currently two major processes by which circuit boards are imaged; dry film and screen printing. This study investigated the screen printed circuit board. The resolution and registration limits are primary concerns of the screen <b>circuit</b> <b>printer.</b> These two factors are greatly influenced by two screen components; fabric and stencil system. The effects that two fabrics and two stencil systems had on the resolution and registration capabilities of a screen circuit printing system were determined. A test target was printed on a circuit substrate by a screen printing press under production conditions. Data on registration variation and line resolution was collected and analyzed statistically to determine if fabric, stencil or an interaction of both had a significant effect. A strong interaction effect of fabric and stencil upon resolution was found to occur when stainless steel mesh was used with the two stencil systems. Stainless steel combined with indirect stencil yielded the best resolution, while steel with capillary direct stencil yielded the worst resolution. A combination of polyester monofilament fabric and either indirect or capillary direct stencil yielded resolution between the two values found with the steel fabric. Registration variability was found to be significantly affected by the factor FABRIC. Steel mesh produced less registration variability than polyester mesh. However, this registration variability of fabrics seems to be significantly related to the condition of the fabric â€“ new or used. Conclusions of the study were that for best resolution and least registration variability, stainless steel fabric combined with indirect stencils should be used. The second choice would be dyed monofilament polyester combined with either indirect or capillary direct stencil systems. The combination of stainless steel and capillary direct stencil should be avoided. It should be noted that run length is a major consideration when choosing fabric/stencil combinations for circuit imaging. Further investigations of registration variability in stainless steel and polyester monofilament fabrics over numerous runs would also yield valuable information for the screen <b>circuit</b> <b>printer...</b>|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we report}} on carbon {{nanotube}} paper-based electroanalytical devices. A highly aligned-carbon nanotube (HA-CNT) array, grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), was processed to form bi-layered paper with an integrated cellulose-based Origami-chip as the electroanalytical device. We used an inverse-ordered fabrication method from a thick carbon nanotube (CNT) sheet to a thin CNT sheet. A 200 -layered HA-CNT sheet and a 100 -layered HA-CNT sheet are explored as a working electrode. The device was fabricated using the following methods: (1) cellulose-based paper was patterned using a wax printer, (2) electrical connection was made using a silver ink-based <b>circuit</b> <b>printer,</b> and (3) three electrodes were stacked on a 2 D Origami cell. Electrochemical behavior was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). We believe that this platform could attract {{a great deal of}} interest for use in various chemical and biomedical applications...|$|R

About nine years later, the world's first predecessor to a modern wafer stepper, produced by David Mann (later GCA), is equipped with optics from Carl Zeiss.In 1983, the first lithography optics from ZEISS are used in a wafer stepper from Philips. Just under ten years later, ZEISS and Philips carve-out company ASML enter into a strategic partnership.The Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology business group is established by ZEISS in 1994. Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH and its subsidiaries Carl Zeiss Laser Optics GmbH and Carl Zeiss SMS GmbH followed in 2001. The construction of the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology plant of ZEISS in Oberkochen commences during the same year, and reaches completion in 2006. In 2010, the semiconductor area achieves revenues of over a billion euros for the first time. Effective October 2014, the subsidiaries Carl Zeiss Laser Optics and Carl Zeiss SMS GmbH were merged into Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH.|$|R
