40|$|RATIONALE: Alkyd resins are {{synthetic}} polyesters used as {{paints and}} coatings. Current approaches for their analysis {{do not allow}} the characterization of pentaerythritol and phthalic acid esters, whose detection is interesting to fully characterize the materials, e. g. for forensic or cultural heritage applications. METHODS: A combined analytical approach based on Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) /MS and flow injection analysis (FIA) /MS was adopted. GC/MS was used to characterize the fatty acid profile and the polybasic acids in extracts from industrial alkyd resins. HPLC/MS and FIA/MS {{were used for the}} characterization of the triglyceride profile of the oil used to manufacture the resin and for the identification of reaction products deriving from the synthesis process. RESULTS: The multi-analytical approach was applied on two different industrial alkyd resins produced from two different oils. The GC/MS analysis was successful in characterizing the fatty acid profile and the aromatic fraction of the resin. The HPLC/MS analysis allowed us to characterize the pentaerythritol and <b>phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ester</b> and the triglycerides residues from the synthesis process, by studying their high-resolution tandem mass spectra. CONCLUSIONS: The application of liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to the study of industrial alkyd resins allowed us to characterize {{for the first time the}} esters formed by the transesterification reactions involving pentaerythritol, phthalic acid and triglycerides.

As plasticizers, phthalic acid esters are added to synthetic plastic resins to impart flexibility to the finished product, improve workability during fabrication, and extend or modify properties not present in the original resins (1). Plastic formulations may contain up to 60 % of plasticizers (2). Phthalic acid esters are {{the most widely used}} plasticizers, particularly in poly-(vinyl chloride) plastics. More than 800 million pounds of these plasticizers were produced in 1969 (1). Di-n-butyl and di- 2 ethylhexyl phthalates are used as plasticizers and also as an insect repellant and orchard acaricide, respectively (3). Phthalic acid esters have been identified as environmental contaminants because of their discovery in soil (4), a deep sea jellyfish (5), aquatic organisms and water (6), and bovine tissues (7, 8). The acute toxicities of various phthalic acid esters have been determined in mammals and birds and the compounds were found to have a very low order of toxicity (3, 9 - 12).

The results indicated that, in general, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, metallothionein (MT) content, the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and all the tested geno-toxicity parameters are promoted as time elapses and with increasing concentration of DEHP.

Although the Bengal tiger, Panthera tigris tigris, {{appears on}} the IUCN Red Data List for {{endangered}} animals, very little information {{is available in the}} literature on the components of this animal's marking fluid. Scent marking is the main form of communication in all cat species. In some species, including the Bengal tiger, the liquid used for spraying is not pure urine, but is mixed with scent gland secretions. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterise the volatile components in the marking fluid of the Bengal tiger to achieve a better understanding of the semiochemical communication of this animal. The marking fluid of the tiger was characterised through the use of analytical techniques, such as gaschromatography, low resolution gas chromatography - mass spectrometry and retention time comparison. Homologous series of alkanes, alcohols, aldehydes, methyl ketones, carboxylic acids, γ- and δ-lactones, amides and lactams, as well as esters and nitrogen containing compounds, were identified. Of these identified compounds the unbranched alkanes, saturated alcohols, aldehydes, branched methyl ketones, saturated carboxylic acids and γ- and δ- lactones are commonly found in mammalian secretions. Compounds that aren't as common in their secretions are the methyl ketones, branched carboxylic acids, dimethyl esters of dicarboxylic acids and amides. The marking fluid contains a <b>phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ester.</b> Phthalic acid esters are used in the polymer industry and are nowadays found almost everywhere in nature. It is known that these pollutants have endocrine disrupting properties. The heat, humidity and wet conditions that are characteristic of the Bengal tiger's natural habitat makes it necessary for the tiger to make use of a fixative to prolong the life of the semiochemical message. The compounds and the concentrations in which these compounds are present in the urine and the lipid fraction of the marking fluid of the tiger was determined and compared to assess the fixative role of the lipids. This study has provided evidence that the lipid material has a greater affinity for the volatile organic constituents of the marking fluid and that it can therefore extend the lifetime of a semiochemical message left by the tiger...|$|E

The better DEHP biodegradationrate (2. 4 Â 10 À 2 dayÀ 1) have been observed {{in the case of}} AS composting compared to LS compost (1. 53 Â 10 À 2 dayÀ 1). The mono-ethyl-hexyl phthalates MEHP has been shown to follow the same order of biodegradation as DEHP indicating that the same mechanism is followed(hydrolysis or dealkylation of each DEHP side-chain). Composting could be suggested as a detoxification process for the removal of PAEs(mainly DEHP) from sludges after a sufficient time of treatment to provide a safe end product...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{concern that}} <b>phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> (PAE) may present a health hazard and {{possible}} deleterious {{effects on the}} ecological system has led to increased interest in the more subtle toxicity of those compounds. Although the acute toxicity of PAEs as a group is quite low, the intrinsic cellular toxicity increases with molecular weight. Whether the intrinsic toxicity is great enough to exert a significant effect in vivo at the typically low levels of solubility of PAEs is of primary importance to the assessment of their potential hazard. This paper reviews work reported on the teratogenicity of PAEs and new work on the mutagenicity, cellular toxicity, and absorption, excretion, and distribution of those compounds.

30|$|While the use {{of sewage}} sludge to bring {{nutrients}} and organic matter could be beneficial for the soil, it also represents a risk due {{to the content of}} contaminants like heavy metals, organic compounds, and pathogens. Among the organic compounds, the most frequently detected in the municipal sewage sludge include absorbable organic halogens (AOX), linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (LAS), nonylphenols and nonylphenolethoxylates (NP and NPnEOs), di-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polychlorinated dibenzo-pdioxins and -furans (PCDD/F) as listed in Kapanen et al. [4]. The relative ranges of concentration are 0.09 – 98  mg kg− 1 dm for LAS, 7.8 – 13.3  mg kg− 1 dm for NPs, 0.3 – 8  mg kg− 1 dm for PAHs, 1.4  mg kg− 1 dm for PCBs, and > 70  mg kg− 1 dm for DEHP [4]. The presence of NP, NPnEOs, and of DEHP is particularly significant due to their wide range of uses. NPnEOs (with n ranging from 1 to 20) are the most extensively used alkylphenol ethoxylates (APnEOs) accounting for 80 – 85 % of the total use [5]. They are widely employed for industrial, agricultural, and domestic applications as nonionic surfactants. In sewage-treatment plants, NPnEOs undergo a series of rapid transformations, where the polyethoxylate chains break up and generate the short-chain nonylphenols which include nonylphenol (NP), nonylphenolmonoethoxylate (NP 1 EO), and nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP 2 EO). Di-ethyl-hexyl phthalate (DEHP) is, among the <b>phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters,</b> the most widely studied due to its persistence. <b>Phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> are industrial chemicals used as additives in different production process like polyvinylchloride, polyvinylacetate, and cellulosic and polyurethane resins [6]. These compounds have been proven to cause adverse effects, such as reproductive damage, carcinogenicity, and metabolic and obesity diseases [7]. In view of their toxicity and the evidence of pervasive environmental exposure risk, alkylphenol ethoxylates and phthalates/phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> have been listed as priority pollutants and restricted due to health concerns [8].|$|R
40|$|<b>Phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters,</b> {{including}} {{diethyl phthalate}} (DEP), which are considered as top-priority and hazardous pollutants, have received significant attention {{over the last}} decades. It is vital for industries to select the best treatment technology, especially when the DEP concentration in wastewater is high. Meanwhile, anaerobic biofilm-based reactors are considered as a promising option. Therefore, in the present study, for the biological removal of DEP from synthetic wastewater, two different anaerobic biofilm-based reactors, including anaerobic fixed film baffled reactor (AnFFBR) and up-flow anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor (UAnFFFBR), were compared from kinetic and performance standpoints. As in the previous studies, only the kinetic coefficients have been calculated {{and the relationship between}} kinetic coefficients and their interpretation has not been evaluated, the other aim {{of the present study was}} to fill this research gap.

40|$|Di-n-butyl {{phthalate}} (DBP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used <b>phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> (PAEs), which have shown increasing environmental concerns worldwide. A bacterial strain designated as QH- 11, was isolated from activated sludge and found to be capable of utilizing DBP as carbon and energy sources for growth. 16 S rRNA and gyrb gene sequence analysis revealed that strain QH- 11 was most closely related to Gordonia sp. Kinetics studies of DBP degradation by the strain QH- 11 revealed that DBP depletion curves fit with the modified Gompertz model (R- 2 > 0. 98). Meanwhile, substrate utilization tests showed that strain QH- 11 could utilize other common PAEs and also the main intermediate product <b>phthalic</b> <b>acid</b> (PA). A gene encoding the large subunit of the phthalate dioxygenase, which is responsible for PA degradation, was successfully detected in strain QH- 11. Furthermore, the results of reverse transcription quantitative PCR demonstrate that mRNA expression level of phthalate dioxygenase increased significantly after strain QH- 11 was induced by DBP and PA.
