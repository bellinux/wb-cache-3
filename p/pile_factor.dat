Os dados empregados são originários de um plantio de Eucalyptus grandis, visando à produção de celulose e pertencente ao GRUPO LWART, situado no município de Lençóis Paulista, SP, cortado aos sete anos de idade através do sistema semi-mecanizado. Foram analisados dados provenientes de vinte pilhas de madeira, formadas por toras de 2, 80 m de comprimento e diâmetro mínimo de 6, 0 cm. O fator de empilhamento de cada pilha foi obtido pela relação entre o volume da pilha em metros estéreos (st) e o correspondente volume sólido em metros cúbicos (m³). O volume sólido (m³) foi obtido pelo método de Smalian. Para {{calcular}} o volume estéreo (st) para três diferentes métodos de empilhamento foi utilizada uma régua graduada para medir a altura, a largura e o comprimento da pilha. Os três métodos de empilhamento foram comparados estatisticamente a partir de uma análise de variância, considerando um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, onde os métodos foram considerados tratamentos e as pilhas repetições. Na ocorrência de diferenças significativas entre tratamentos, o teste Tukey foi utilizado para comparar suas médias, considerando um nível de 5 % de significância. A análise estatística indicou diferenças significativas entre o método de empilhamento manual ou tratamento 3, dos demais métodos, ou seja, método do empilhamento em cima do caminhão e método de empilhamento mecânico. Conclui-se então, que é errôneo aplicar um fator de empilhamento médio, se houver diferentes formas de empilhar a madeira. Abstract The {{research objective}} {{has been to}} compare the wood <b>piling</b> <b>factors</b> obtained from three distinct methods: 1) piling up on the truck; 2) mechanical piling up of the wood at the factory patio; 3) manual piling up at the factory patio. The examined data are from a Eucalyptus grandis forest for cellulose production, {{which is owned by}} the GRUPO LWART, located at the city of Lençóis Paulistas – São Paulo. The seven-yearold trees were cut through the semi-mechanized system. The data was collected from twenty stacks of wood, made up with logs of 2, 80 m of length and a minimum diameter of 6, 0 cm. The <b>piling</b> <b>factor</b> (PF) of each stack was obtained from the relation between the stereometric volume of the stack (st) and the correspondent volume in cubic meters (m³). The solid volume (m³) was figured through the Smalian method. In order to calculate the stereometric volume (st) of the three different methods of piling up, a marked ruler was used to measure the height, width and length of the stack. The three piling up methods were compared statistically on the basis of variance analysis, considering a distribution entirely at random, with the methods taken as treatments and the stacks as repetitions. When significant differences between treatments were found, the Tukey test was used to compare their averages, considering a mean of 5 %. The statistical analysis indicated significant differences between the method of manual piling up (treatment 3) and the other methods, namely, the piling up on the truck method and the mechanical piling up method.

40|$|The {{construction}} of road and rail infrastructure on weak foundation soils presents many challenges for Geotechnical Engineers. Construction of embankments over soft soils, such as peat and soft clay, {{may result in}} large, often differential, surface settlements and expensive long-term maintenance costs. An innovative solution {{is the use of}} geosynthetic reinforced piled embankments (GRPE), which can reduce surface settlements, cost and construction time. In GRPEs, a redistribution of embankment load occurs whereby much of the vertical load on the soft soil is transferred to the piles, and hence to a firm stratum at greater depth. This redistribution of load is aided by a natural phenomenon known as arching that occurs in the granular embankment material. The design of piled embankments involves estimating the magnitude of arching that occurs in the fill over the <b>piles.</b> <b>Factors</b> that must be considered include the embankment geometry, shear strength of granular embankment material and support from the subsoil and the geosynthetic reinforcement. In this study, plane strain physical models of a piled embankment were investigated in a geotechnical centrifuge at up to 150 times Earth’s gravity (g). The centrifuge model facilitated the capturing of photographic images in-flight to allow the deformational response of the piled embankment to be assessed. Numerical analyses, using Plaxis 2 D, replicated the centrifuge model testing to allow further assessment of the deformational response, as well as the tensile stress along the geosynthetic and stress in the embankment fill above the reinforcement. Direct comparison of the data from the physical and numerical models largely validated Plaxis for use in piled embankment design. The study highlighted the importance of certain parameters on the performance of GRPEs. Reduced surface differential settlements were observed for increased embankment height to clear spacing ratio, subsoil stiffness and geosynthetic tensile strength. The location of the piled embankment critical height, determined using the centrifuge model testing and Plaxis analyses, was influenced by the embankment fill density and subsoil stiffness. Good agreement was found between the critical heights determined in this study and those associated with BS 8006 (2010), Naughton (2007), Collin (2004), Horgan & Sarsby (2002) and Hewlett & Randolph (1988) ...|$|R

40|$|Residual {{forces are}} {{compressive}} {{forces in a}} pile caused during pile driving due to elastic compression of the pile material and the rebound of the soil below the pile toe, {{as well as local}} deformation of the pile section. Residual forces have significant effects on pile driveability and the interpretation of pile behaviour. Eleven instrumented long steel H-piles with lengths between 34 - 60 m were driven into a construction site in Hong Kong and the residual forces were monitored. Based on field measured results, a method for estimating residual forces in long driven pile in weather soils is suggested. The analysis shows that the dimensionless <b>pile</b> flexibility <b>factor</b> and the toe capacity are two key factors influencing the residual toe resistance. The residual toe resistances in long driven piles increase with the pile length, the soil stiffness along the pile and the ultimate toe resistance, and decrease with the pile cross section area and material modulus. For the test piles founded in CDG with SPT-N values greater than 200, the unit residual toe resistance is approximately 25 % of the ultimate toe resistance of the pile. The residual toe residual resistances in piles in weathered soils are larger than those in piles in sand. Two idealized unit residual shaft resistance distributions are assumed and the residual shaft forces along the pile can be reasonably estimated...|$|R

40|$|Groups of piles are {{frequently}} used as bridge foundations. Different group configurations, characterized by different pile spacing, skew-angle, number, and arrangement of pile group columns interact differently {{with the flow}} field and lead to different scour patterns and equilibrium scour depth. There {{have been a number}} of past studies on the characterization of scouring at pile groups, but most of them report short duration scour experiments. A priori, such short durations may be postulated to inherently carry important uncertainties into existing scour predictors. In this study, 75 long-duration laboratory tests were run under steady, clear-water flow close to the threshold for initiation of sediment motion, to address the effect of time, pile spacing, skew-angle and number of pile group columns on the equilibrium scour depth. Pile groups consisted of matrical arrangements of one, two, or three columns of four rows, with spacings of 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, and 6 pile diameters; the tested skew-angles were 0, 15, 30, 45, and 90 °. Important contributions were achieved on (1) the impact of the duration of tests on the shape of the scour hole as well as on the precision of coefficients involved in current predictors, (2) the most unfavorable skew angle, (3) the behavior of collapsed pile groups, (4) the maximum scour depth at pile groups composed of a single alignment, and (5) the performance of two current predictors of scour depth at pile groups.

Deduced from Biot 2 ̆ 7 s theory, the fundamental {{functions of the}} quasi-static development for the force, displacement and pore pressure were acquired in cylindrical coordinates. The pile-soil system was decomposed into extended soil and fictitious piles, and the compatibility condition was set up between the axial strain of the fictitious piles and the corresponding average strain over the extended soil. This approach results in the governing equations, which consist of the Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and the basic unknowns of the axial forces along the fictitious pile shaft. The axial force and settlement along the pile shaft were calculated based on the axial forces of the fictitious piles. The interaction between the piles was investigated under different consolidation conditions through a two-pile model, and two <b>pile</b> interaction <b>factors</b> were obtained. Stemming from the two-pile analysis, numerical analyses on the settlement of the pile groups were conducted to probe pile interaction with consolidation.

The pile-to-pile interaction can also aggravate the percentage of consolidation settlement (PCS), and as the pile number increases, {{the value of the}} PCS will also increase.

40|$|An {{integral}} part of proper wood chip inventory management {{is the ability to}} accurately monitor wood chip quantities. This thesis examines the use of a new method of capturing the volume of mill yard wood chip piles through the utilization of aerial drones. The drones are used to capture images and the images are converted into digital 3 D models, which are then capable of measuring pile volume. This process allows for conversion of the volume into an accurate mass estimate by compensating for compression factors within the chip <b>pile.</b> These <b>factors</b> can change the volume by a maximum of 9. 46 %, but on average during simulations and real world applications, most piles exhibit a change in volume in the range of 1 % to 6 % difference. By performing the estimation procedure multiple times and averaging the results this method is able to generate a result that is more precise, timely and less labour intensive than the previous methods of using a ground survey to determine volume and applying a linear volume to mass conversion for the quantity of wood chips. The results suggest that this averaging technique can improve the standard deviation spread from over 5 % variation in the measurement to less than 2 %. This new method combines multiple techniques to improve both overall accuracy and precision. Each stage of the new method was examined to determine the accumulated degree of error. This included looking at operator error of about 2. 4 %, considering the precision of 3 D volume capture, which adds on average of 5 % to 10 % error, understanding the variation in bulk density due to pile shape, and size, which adds 1 % to 6 % error, using different 3 D software modeling for measuring pile volume, which adds about 4 % error. Combined together in extreme cases, these errors can skew the results by over 20 %. The results of this examination provides research-based recommendations as to how to collect the images, generate the models, and process the data for mass estimation and improve error reduction at all stages...|$|R

The result of this water level rise, if it were to reach equilibrium levels of two centuries ago, would be to cause a reduction in effective stress levels in the founding strata beneath London. The effect that such {{an increase in}} pore pressure would have on foundations in overconsolidated clay was investigated. The performance of foundations in stiff clay during a rising ground water event was investigated by means of centrifuge model tests. The model tests included comparisons of the behaviour of bored <b>piles</b> with different <b>factors</b> of safety on load, piles with different length to base diameter ratios, comparison of shallow and deep foundation behaviour and the effect of different initial pore pressure distributions. In two tests piezocone tests were carried out in low and high pore water pressure regimes. Triaxial testing and numerical analyses were used to provide information for use in analysis of the centrifuge test results. The main findings of the project were: The geometry of a pile foundation (slender or under-reamed) and the manner by which load is transferred from pile to soil were seen to effect pile settlement relative to the ground surface during a rising groundwater event. Piles which require mobilisation of end bearing resistance at working loads will typically settle more than predominantly friction piles of the same length. For similar geometry <b>piles</b> the initial <b>factor</b> of safety will effect settlement during a rising groundwater event. Piles with lower initial factors of safety settle more than those with higher initial factors of safety during a rising groundwater event. Differential settlements between shallow and deep foundations were almost entirely due to the deep foundation settlement relative to the heaving ground surface where there was a surface perched water table. Where there was no perched surface water both shallow and deep foundations settled relative to the surface. Soil heave, in this latter case, was largely due to the high percentage loss in vertical effective stress near the surface compared to the case where a perched water table existed. Piled foundation load capacity was seen to reduce {{as a result of a}} rising groundwater event. Base capacity, measured under largely drained conditions, was seen to be linearly related to the mean normal effective stress in the ground as was cone end resistance of piezocone tests carried out a slow penetration rates. The piezocone tests also showed that the percentage loss in drained end bearing esistance was larger that the loss in undrained resistance. Finite element analyses investigated pile installation effects for model and prototype piles and the effect that they have on pile behaviour during a rising groundwater event. The results have shown that, on a smooth pile surface, the prototype piles will suffer a larger percentage reduction in shaft capacity than the model piles. The analyses were valuable for assessing the applicability of the centrifuge model data to prototype situation...|$|R

The bottom upheaval of deep {{foundation pit}} is a key criterion of judging the foundation stability and deformation. This paper built the 3 D finite element model to analyze the influence of different <b>factors</b> (<b>pile</b> diameter, pile length and pile spacing) on the bottom upheaval, and concluded that: when pile length and pile spacing is constant, changing the pile diameter can hardly affect the bottom upheaval; as the pile length increased, the inhibitory effect to the bottom upheaval grew stronger with a gradually decreased growth rate; increasing pile spacing can significantly reduce the bottom upheaval, and the smaller the pile spacing, the smaller the upheaval. The concept of upheaval inhibition rate was defined to evaluate the influence of different <b>factors</b> of <b>pile</b> layout on the bottom upheaval. A correction method of calculating the bottom upheaval of foundation pit with engineering pile was proposed.

When the Horns Reef 1 wind turbine park in Denmark was designed the vertical wave run-up phenomenon was not well known in the. industry, hence not sufficiently considered in the design of Horns Reef 1. As a consequence damage was observed on the platforms. This has been the situation for several sites and design tools for platform loads are lacking. As a consequence a physical model test study was initiated at Aalborg University to clarify wave run-up on cylindrical piles for different values of diameter to water depth ratios (D/h) and different wave heights to water depth ratios (H/h) for both regular and irregular waves.

However, calibration of a load model showed that it was necessary to increase the run-up factor on the velocity head by 40 % {{to take into account the}} underestimation of run-up for breaking or nearly breaking waves given that they produce thin run-up wedges and air entrainment, two factors not coped with by the measurement system...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Wind-induced {{particulate}} {{air pollution}} from iron ore piles can causes environmental and economic problems for steel industries. In this experimental study, the effectiveness of various additives in reducing {{particulate air pollution}} from iron ore piles was investigated in a laboratory wind tunnel. Materials and Methods:  The experimental set up consisted of a prismatic pile and a wind tunnel. Four different wind speeds of 4. 3, 5, 7 and 11 m/s {{was used in the}} study  Municipal water, quick lime (2 %), seawater, treated industrial wastewater and Polylatice (0. 25 %) were used as additives to stabilize the upper layer of the <b>pile.</b> Results: Emission <b>factors</b> for non-stabilized (without additive) piles at 4. 3, 5, 7 and 11 m /s wind speeds were 46. 7, 73. 2, 1025. 4 and 13768. 7 g/m 2, respectively. Stabilized piles with 2. 6, 2. 7, 2. 8, 2. 7 and 2. 8 percent additive (moisture content of the upper layer of the pile) for municipal water, Polylattice (0. 25 %), treated industrial wastewater, seawater and quick lime (2 %) indicated a decrease of 99. 4 %, 100 %, 99. 3 %, 99. 5 % and 99. 5 % particulate emission reduction, respectively. Conclusions: Proper selection and use of additives on iron piles has the potential for decreasing  more than 99 % of the wind-induced particulate emissions. Operational factors such as covered area, spray frequency, pile geometry, seasonal adjustments related to ambient temperature and humidity, wind speed and operator training need to {{be an integral part of}} the pollutant reduction program. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Impact {{driving of piles}} is {{a complex}} process which depends on the {{interaction}} of the stress wave progressing down the pile and on the dynamic soil resistance along the shaft and at the toe. Pile driving vibrations can adversely affect adjacent structures, and the intensity of ground vibrations depends on the dynamic resistance along the pile rather than on the energy applied to the pile. The viscous damping factor, Jc, is one of the fundamental parameters when the static pile resistance is determined from dynamic tests. Theoretical analyses and field observations show that the Jc-factor is not solely a soil parameter, but a function of the ratio of pile impedance and soil impedance at the pile toe. Consequently, the <b>pile</b> toe damping <b>factor</b> for an open-toe pipe pile would be different when no plug develops in the pile and when the pile toe is fully plugged. Moreover, the mentioned aspect needs to be considered when the results of a test pile of one pile type are applied to a construction pile of a different type. Viscous damping along the pile shaft and at the pile toe is the source of ground vibrations. The vibration magnitude is governed by the interactive nature of dynamic pile-soil resistance, which {{is a function of the}} ratio between the pile impedance and the soil impedance for P-waves. It is shown that the vibration transmission efficacy and the dynamic resistance are inversely linearly proportional to the pile impedance, and that energy transmission efficacy correctly reflects the vibration emission from the pile t...|$|R
40|$|Construction of deep {{excavation}} in {{densely populated}} area is not a trivial thing. The execution could induce disturbance to the soil and adjacent buildings. Many researches have analysed building responses to deep excavation or tunnelling projects. But the studies were mostly limited to buildings with shallow foundations. The importance of understanding the behaviour of piled buildings is significant, especially {{in the analysis of}} buildings displacement. It is commonly found that deep excavation pits are situated close to piled buildings, especially in densely populated cities with soft subsurface. Even the buildings are founded on piles, there are no guarantees that the buildings are not affected by deep excavation activities. Currently, a metro extension project in Amsterdam is being built. It passes the historic centre {{of the city and the}} buildings are founded on pile foundations. The project involved numerous amounts of measurements. Based on the measurement results, it has been found that due to the project, the buildings settle more than the foundation layer, but less than the surface settlement. It is suspected that the settlement of the buildings is influenced by the behaviour of the pile foundation. This research is conducted to investigate and explain pile behaviour during the execution of deep excavation project. The focus of the study is at Ceintuurbaan station. The construction stages are modelled in 3 -dimensional finite element analysis, in order to include the diaphragm wall installation phases. Before analysing the pile behaviour, back analysis of soil displacement is performed. After reasonable agreement in the soil displacement has been achieved, the pile behaviour has been analysed in more detail. It is found that a reasonable agreement between measurement and simulation results can be obtained. Based on the analysis results, it is evident that the settlement of the building is influenced by several factors, including stress changes in the soil, neutral plane position, and the settlement of the soil adjacent to the <b>pile.</b> These <b>factors</b> are related interactively during each construction stage. The load on the pile also plays important role. Pile with higher load will experience larger settlement compared to pile with smaller load. Based on the monitoring data and the 3 D simulation results, the importance of each construction stage is demonstrated. Based on the analysis of monitoring data at Ceintuurbaan Station, it is shown that preliminary works could induce 31 - 59 % of soil and building settlement. In the analysis of soil-structure interaction, it is important to take into account each construction stages and it should not only focus on the excavation stages.

40|$|This note studies {{settlement}} ratio, R-s of pile {{groups in}} sandy soils, {{defined as the}} ratio of the settlement of a pile group to that of a single pile at the same average load per pile. 31 cases of field pile-group load tests and the corresponding field single-pile load tests were collected for this study. More than one-half of the cases consist of 3 -diameter spaced, 9 -pile groups. Based on the field test data, statistical analyses of R-s at different load levels were conducted for pile groups with cap-ground contact (PGCs) and pile groups with freestanding caps (PGFs), respectively. The mean of R-s decreases with the load level for both PGCs and PGFs, whereas the coefficient of variation of R-s increases with the load level. The influence of cap-ground contact on R-s {{does not appear to be}} significant based on a comparison of the mean R-s values of these PGCs and PGFs. In addition, a comparative study on R-s and group resistance ratio R-s which is defined as {{the ratio of the}} average resistance of a pile in a group to that of a single pile at the same settlement, was conducted to clarify possible misunderstanding between R-s and <b>pile</b> group efficiency <b>factor</b> eta for driven pile groups in sandy soils. The value of R-s compares settlement at the working load and is often larger than unity. The value of eta compares failure loads, which occur at different settlements for pile groups and their respective single piles. eta is usually larger than unity due to soil densification and additional contributions from the cap-ground contact for PGCs...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} of two Osterberg’s cell load tests (OLTs) and three conventional load tests (COLTs) {{in the same}} subsoil conditions on Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles carefully monitored during construction stages. The instrumentation along the pile shaft in all the tests allows interesting comparisons of both global behaviour and local load transfer. Significant differences in the stiffness of the soil-pile system with the different test procedures is outlined. The main {{differences between the two}} test procedures occur at the two opposite ends of the pile, as could have been expected, while the observed behaviour in the middle part of the tested piles is close for the two models. A relatively simple FEM model has been calibrated {{on the basis of the}} OLTs results. The same model is capable of accurately matching the experimental results of the COLTs, proving that the observed differences are not due to random factors. Furthermore, the same model has been used to simulate ideal load tests. Such a reliable simulation shows that both the experimental procedures are actually responsible for significant differences in the behaviour of the soil-pile system even in the simple case of a concentrated axial load. Large differences arise in terms of the stiffness of the system with the OLTs providing by far the stiffest response. Despite being intermediate between the OLT and the ILT, the COLTs provide a response of the pile-soil system, which is on the average about two times stiffer than the Ideal test, where the force applied on top of the pile does not depend on a tangible reaction system. Care should be thus taken when considering the results of such tests in the prediction of the settlement of a <b>piled</b> foundation. Correction <b>factors</b> should be applied to the experimentally observed behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{integral}} abutment bridge (IAB) {{constituted by}} the superstructure and the substructure can achieve a composite action responding {{as a single}} structural unit by eliminating or reducing expansion joints and bearings. Accordingly, the construction and maintenance costs can be reduced. Therefore, the IAB concept has recently become a topic of remarkable interest among bridge engineers, not only for newly built bridges but also during refurbishment processes. The research topic concerns the retrofit of existing bridges with the IAB concept. In order to investigate the retrofitting technique with the IAB concept, the literature survey on the practical applications of this approach in worldwide was carried out firstly, including retrofitting motivations, detailed processes and structural performance after retrofitting. Besides, another literature review on the critical issues of analysis on the IAB, such as soil-structure interactions, modelling approaches and plastic hinge simulations, was conducted {{in order to find}} out the most suitable method in modelling. The case study of a simply supported prestressed concrete bridge (named Viadotto Serrone) with three spans constructed in 1972 was analyzed, which has some durability problems nowadays. The finite element model was built, involving soil-structure interactions, non-linear behaviors and retrofitting processes. The original and updated Italian design codes are compared through static analysis and seismic analysis. Another investigation was conducted to prove the necessity of considering soil-structure interactions in the IAB. Based on the appropriate finite element model, a large number of static sensitive analyses were carried out, taking thermal actions; bridge types; soil conditions and substructure heights as parameters. Through analysing the responses of girders, piers, abutment stems and <b>piles,</b> some important <b>factors</b> and the corresponding influence were found, which could be adopted to guide the retrofitting technique with the IAB concept. Then, the verification was conducted in order to check if the existing sections could be reused without any changes and point out the most critical components, which need to be repaired or replaced. Moreover, the dynamic performance of bridge before and after retrofitting was investigated preliminarily through modal analysis and response spectrum analysis...|$|R
40|$|The use of tunnels {{for various}} {{purposes}} {{has become more}} and more popular in many congested metropolitan cities worldwide. However, tunnelling may induce excessive ground movements and adverse effects on nearby structures and piles. Therefore, it is necessary and vital to gain the fundamental understanding of tunnelling-induced ground movements, the stability of tunnel heading and tunnel interaction to nearby structures. In this study, three series of elasto-plastic coupled-consolidation numerical analyses were conducted to study the three-dimensional stress transfer mechanisms, ground movements, lining stresses, the stability of the tunnel heading with the use of soil nails, and the influence of tunnelling on a loaded pile (including pile movements and stresses) during a “NATM” open face tunnel excavation in isotropic and anisotropic stiff clays. Based on the study of the effects of soil stiffness ratio (n = Eh'/ Ev') and coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K 0) on ground movements, it is clear that for a given K 0, the ground settlement trough becomes shallower and wider as n reduces from 1. 6 to 1. 0, whereas for a given n, the ground settlement becomes shallower and wider as K 0 increases from 0. 5 to 1. 5. Generally, a stress influence zone extends 2. 0 D in front of tunnel face and 2. 0 D behind of the tunnel face. The effects of n do not have significant influence on lining stress. However, K 0 has significant influence on the distribution of lining stress around the tunnel. The stress coefficient Kxz(= σxx'/ σzz') for soil elements rises to 1. 8 at the crown and invert, while it falls to 0. 5 at the springline immediately behind and around the tunnel face (original K 0 = 1. 0). On the other hand, the stress coefficient Kyz(= σyy'/ σzz') rises above 1. 0 for all elements around the tunnel. The changes of Kxz and Kyz demonstrate a very non-uniform stress distribution around the tunnel heading during tunnel excavation. The use of soil nail in a tunnel heading does not only improve the stability of the tunnel heading, it also reduces surface settlements due to reduction of stress relief at tunnel face. Results show that an optimum axial rigidity of soil nail ((EnAn) opt= 300 MN in this study) for stabilizing a tunnel heading does exist. Beyond this optimum value, the stabilizing effect does not increase further. Tunnelling-induced ground movements near a loaded existing pile do not follow a normal Gaussian distribution. Additional settlement takes place at the pile head due to the development of plastic yielding around the tunnel and <b>pile</b> tip. The <b>factor</b> of safety of the pile with a working load of 1850 kN drops from 3. 0 to 1. 5 due to tunnelling effects...|$|R
40|$|A direct CPTu {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{for determining the}} capacity of an axially loaded pile. The method employs all of the CPTu data with the cone point resistance, qc, as the primary measurement. The sleeve friction, fs, which is an imprecise measurement, is limited to use {{in combination with the}} effective cone resistance, qE (cone point resistance adjusted to effective stress by deducting the measured pore pressure) to interpret the soil according to a classification chart, developed as a part of this dissertation. Both the pile unit toe and shaft resistances are functions of the CPTu effective cone resistance, with the toe and shaft correlation coefficients, Ct and Cs, respectively. A database consisting of 192 case histories was compiled to calibrate and develop an improved CPT direct method, and to reference to the current CPT direct methods for pile capacity calculation. The case histories contain results of full-scale pile loading tests, soil characteristics, and CPT soundings which were performed close to the pile locations. The proposed method relates both the pile unit toe resistance and the unit shaft resistance to the effective cone point resistance, qE. The hypothesis for the study was explored that both toe and shaft resistances are proportional to the effective cone resistance and can be determined by assigning a correlation factor to qE. Twenty-four pile case histories have been compiled including static loading tests performed in uplift, or in push with separation of shaft and toe resistances at sites which comprise CPT soundings. These case histories are used to calibrate the two formulae for estimation of pile toe and shaft resistances from CPTu data. As a result of the calibration based on 24 pile case histories with separate measurement of pile toe and shaft capacities, for pile unit toe resistance, a simple mathematical rule is used to relate the cone resistance to the pile unit toe resistance in a one-to-one relationship. Five CPT direct methods currently used in North American practice have been investigated to reference the proposed method. The five CPT direct methods are: The Schmertmann method, the European Method, the French method, the Meyerhof method, and the Tumay method. The results of estimated pile capacity from the proposed method and the other methods were compared to the measured pile capacity for 142 case records compiled in the database. It was verified that the main factors that cause significant error in pile capacity estimation by the current methods are: smoothing the CPT data, development based on mechanical cone data, employing undrained shear strength, Su, imposing an upper limit to the pile unit toe and shaft resistances, not including all CPT measurement, considerable difference between the correlation factors for steel and concrete piles, considerable difference between the correlation factors for tension and compression <b>piles,</b> disregard of <b>factors</b> such as soil sensitivity, dilatancy effects, and effective stress.

40|$|Foundations of {{laterally}} loaded single piles {{are widely}} used as part of power transmission lines, wind power stations, highway structures, etc. Ongoing pressure applied to a laterally loaded pile, particularly at the ground level, causes the soil deformation characterized by the bulging of the soil surface. In the majority of cases, the deformation strength of a pile depends on the front-face soil resistance, Horizontal beams, ground caps or rigid plates are used to increase the pile resistance. An effective method of pressure reduction contemplates {{the use of a}} rigid round cap at the front-face or upper level of the soil. In this paper, the authors analyse the data to examine how a round cap installed at the ground level impacts the bearing capacity of a single pile. This research based on the methodology developed by the authors demonstrates that a laterally loaded pile, supported by a rigid cap at the ground level, is exposed to increased resistance due to the following factors, including the passive pressure along the cap side that creates an unloading effect for a horizontally-loaded pile. The cap acts as a vertical soil rebuff creating an additional resistance moment; the horizontal shear of the cap causes supplementary lateral resistance of a pile. The following initial geometric and elastic material properties of the single pile are applied: total length = 5. 0 meters (3. 0 m above and 2. 0 m below the ground surface); pile diameter = 40 centimeters; circle plates of various diameters = 60; 70; 80 and 100 cm and their thickness = 20 cm. A lateral load is applied at various heights,, of 0. 2; 1. 0; 2. 0 and 3. 0 meters above the ground level. Elastic properties of the soil are assumed to be constant at each point {{below the surface of the}} ground, they are listed below: bulk modulus of soil E= 20 MPa; Poisson's ratio μ= 0, 37; unit Weight γ= 18, 5 kN/m; cohesion = 0, 05 MPa; angle of internal friction φ= 20 °. The data has proven that cap-covered piles are substantially more economical (over 40 %) in terms of materials consumption rate if compared to constant cross-section piles (cap-free or broadening <b>piles),</b> all other <b>factors</b> being equal.
