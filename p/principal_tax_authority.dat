Biswas et al. (2013) show that in a situation where the manager’s non-observable task is to disguise the <b>principal’s</b> <b>tax</b> evasion activities, the amount of tax evasion as well as the firm’s profit can only be maximized if the manager is not liable for those activities. Shifting the liability to the manager leads to a reduction in managerial compensation, lower levels of tax evasion, and lower managerial effort. Chen and Chu (2005) show that a risk-averse manager does not deviate from the efficient, non-observable productive effort level as long as the manager is not liable for tax evasion committed by the principal. However, if the manager is liable for the <b>principal’s</b> <b>tax</b> evasion, he or she exerts an inefficiently low effort level. This efficiency loss {{can be explained by the}} risk premium the manager demands ex-ante as compensation for the liability risk associated with tax evasion. In line with this result, Crocker and Slemrod (2005) illustrate that penalizing the manager is more effective in reducing tax evasion than penalizing the principal. In their model, the manager is responsible for claiming tax base reductions from the <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> while being privately informed about the permissible level of tax base reductions that can be claimed. The informational asymmetry between the contracting parties hinders the principal from fully transferring any penalties resulting from the manager’s misconduct back to the manager. The results of Biswas et al. (2013) and Crocker and Slemrod (2005) allow for the following empirical prediction: [...]...|$|R

The <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> gives monetary incentives to informants, and conducts random tax audits. The probability of a tax payer being audited depends on whether the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> received a tip about him from an informant or not. In subgame perfect equilibrium tax payers are divided into (at most) two groups. Those with income up to a certain level evade a small amount of taxes to assure that potential informants do not have sufficient incentives to report, and those with high incomes choose to declare zero income knowing that they will be reported by informants. The <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> chooses the probabilities of the two types of audits, under a budget constraint. In many cases the probabilities are chosen in a way that no informant actually reported, and in some cases the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> does not conduct any audits. ...|$|R

Firstly, it explores how small business taxpayers are treated (procedural fairness) when audited by the <b>tax</b> <b>authority.</b> Secondly, it discusses {{their perception of}} the <b>tax</b> <b>authority.</b> Using a qualitative approach, this research applies case studies and in-depth semi structured face to face interviews with small business participants.

40|$|Politicians and tax {{practitioners}} often {{claim that}} tax uncertainty negatively affects investment. In many countries, firms can request fee-based Advance Tax Rulings (ATRs) to mitigate tax uncertainty. We analyze theoretically {{the circumstances under}} which investors request ATRs, how <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> should price them and how they can affect investment. We assume that <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> integrate investors' reasoning into their decisions. We find that it is often optimal for <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> to charge prohibitively high fees to discourage firms from requesting an ATR. However, we find that revenue-maximizing <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> offer ATRs if the ruling enables them either to significantly reduce their tax audit costs or to increase the probability of detecting ambiguous tax issues. Under certain circumstances, ATRs may effectively foster investment and potentially benefit both the <b>tax</b> <b>authorities</b> and taxpayers. Our results provide new explanations for why taxpayers that face high levels of tax uncertainty often do not request ATRs, even when the fee is rather low. Our results also hold when the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> maximizes social wealth instead of its revenues. Regulatory changes in ATR requirements might serve as a natural quasi-experiment for an empirical study of our predictions regarding investment decisions.

Finally, we predicted that coercive power of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> is positively related with enforced tax compliance.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{circumstances}} under which “enhanced relationship” tax-compliance programs are mutually beneficial to taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>authorities,</b> as well as how these benefits are shared. We develop a model of taxpayer and <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> behavior inside and outside of an enhanced relationship program. Our model suggests that, despite the adversarial nature of the relationship, an enhanced relationship program is mutually beneficial in many settings. The benefits are due to lower combined government audit and taxpayer compliance costs. These costs are lower because taxpayers are less likely to claim positions with weak support and the government is less likely to challenge positions with strong support inside the program. Further, we show that an increase in the ability of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority</b> to identify uncertain tax positions makes an enhanced relationship tax-compliance program more attractive to both the taxpayer and the <b>tax</b> <b>authority...</b>|$|R
40|$|Following {{the classic}} {{economic}} model of tax evasion, taxpayers base their tax decisions on economic determinants, like fine rate and audit probability. Empirical {{findings on the}} relationship between economic key determinants and tax evasion are inconsistent and suggest that taxpayers may rather rely on their beliefs about <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power. Descriptions of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power may affect taxpayers’ beliefs and as such tax evasion. Experiment 1 investigates the impact of fines and beliefs regarding <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power on <b>tax</b> evasion. Experiments 2 - 4 are conducted to examine the effect of varying descriptions about a <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power on participants’ beliefs and respective tax evasion. It is investigated whether tax evasion is influenced by the description of an authority wielding coercive power (Experiment 2), legitimate power (Experiment 3), and coercive and legitimate power combined (Experiment 4). Further, it is examined whether a contrast of the description of power (low to high power; high to low power) impacts tax evasion (Experiments 2 - 4). Results show that the amount of fine does not impact tax payments, whereas participants’ beliefs regarding <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power significantly shape compliance decisions. Descriptions of high coercive power as well as high legitimate power affect beliefs about <b>tax</b> <b>authority’s</b> power and positively impact tax honesty. This effect still holds if both qualities of power are applied simultaneously. The contrast of descriptions has little impact on tax evasion. The current study indicates that descriptions of the <b>tax</b> <b>authority,</b> e. g., in information brochures and media reports, have more influence on beliefs and tax payments than information on fine rates.
