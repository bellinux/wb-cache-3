5|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, {{is known}} to be associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been reports in other genetic conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta type 1, {{autosomal}} dominant <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, α1 antitrypsin deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis, but evidence for these associations is weaker. Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results. Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, {{have been reported in}} a proportion of cases. Atherosclerosis does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Faced {{with the}} long waiting list for a kidney transplant, the use of donors with {{expanded}} criteria, like <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys,</b> is an option that aims to increase {{in a short time}} the supply of kidneys for transplant. This report of two cases of transplants performed from a donor with <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys</b> showed promising results, and the receptors evolved with good renal function, serum creatinine measurements within the normal range and with adequate glomerular filtration rate, evaluated over a period of four years post transplant. This fact confirms that the option of using donors with <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys</b> is safe and gives good results...|$|R

Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease, familial Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD {{appears to be a}} misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.|$|E

25|$|Usually, the {{diagnosis}} of ADPKD is initially performed by renal imaging using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. However, molecular diagnostics can be necessary in the following situations: 1- when a definite diagnosis is required in young individuals, such as a potential living related donor in an affected family with equivocal imaging data; 2- in patients with a negative family history of ADPKD, because of potential phenotypic overlap with several other kidney cystic diseases; 3- in families affected by early-onset <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease, since in this cases hypomorphic alleles and/or oligogenic inheritance can be involved; and 4- in patients requesting genetic counseling, especially in couples wishing a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|An {{attractive}} {{feature of}} human iPS cells {{is the ability}} to derive them from adult patients to study the cellular basis of human disease. Since iPS cells are self-renewing and pluripotent, they represent a theoretically unlimited source of patient-derived cells which can be turned into any type of cell in the body. This is particularly important because many other types of human cells derived from patients tend to stop growing after a few passages in laboratory culture. iPS cells have been generated {{for a wide variety of}} human genetic diseases, including common disorders such as Down syndrome and <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease. In many instances, the patient-derived iPS cells exhibit cellular defects not observed in iPS cells from healthy patients, providing insight into the pathophysiology of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Besides TKV and HtTKV, the {{estimated}} glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {{has also been}} tentatively used to predict the progression of ADPKD. After the analysis of CT or MRI scans of 590 patients with ADPKD treated at the Mayo Translational <b>Polycystic</b> <b>Kidney</b> Disease Center, Irazabal and colleagues developed an imaging-based classification system to predict the rate of eGFR decline in patients with ADPKD. In this prognostic method, patients are divided into five subclasses of estimated kidney growth rates according to age-specific HtTKV ranges (1A, <1.5%; 1B, 1.5–3.0%; 1C, 3.0–4.5%; 1D, 4.5–6.0%; and 1E, >6.0%) as delineated in the CRISP study. The decline in eGFR over the years following initial TKV measurement is significantly different between all five patient subclasses, with those in subclass 1E having the most rapid decline.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePrimary cilia are antenna-like {{structures}} projected {{from the}} apical surface of various mammalian cells including renal tubular cells. Functional or structural defects of the cilium lead to systemic disorders comprising <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys</b> {{as a key}} feature. Here we show that anoctamin 6 (ANO 6), {{a member of the}} anoctamin chloride channel family, is localized in the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. ANO 6 was not essential for cilia formation and had no effect on in vitro cyst expansion. However, knockdown of ANO 6 impaired cyst lumen formation of MDCK cells in three-dimensional culture. In the absence of ANO 6, apoptosis was reduced and epithelial cells were incompletely removed from the center of cell aggregates, which form in the early phase of cystogenesis. In line with these data, we show that ANO 6 is highly expressed in apoptotic cyst epithelial cells of human <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys.</b> These data identify ANO 6 as a cilium-associated protein and suggest its functional relevance in cyst formation...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate CKD from acute kidney injury (AKI) because AKI can be reversible. Abdominal ultrasound, in which {{the size of the}} kidneys is measured, is commonly performed. Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller (≤ 9nbsp&cm) than normal kidneys, with notable exceptions such as in early diabetic nephropathy and <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease. Another diagnostic clue that helps differentiate CKD from AKI is a gradual rise in serum creatinine (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine (several days to weeks). If these levels are unavailable (because the patient has been well and has had no blood tests), it is occasionally necessary to treat a patient briefly as having AKI until the kidney impairment has been established to be irreversible.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic testing: Diagnostic {{testing is}} used to {{diagnose}} or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In many cases, genetic testing {{is used to}} confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on physical mutations and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed {{at any time during}} a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about health care and the management of the disease. For example, people with a family history of <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease (PKD) who experience pain or tenderness in their abdomen, blood in their urine, frequent urination, pain in the sides, a urinary tract infection or kidney stones may decide to have their genes tested and the result could confirm the diagnosis of PKD.|$|E
25|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidney</b> disease (ADPKD) is {{the most}} prevalent, potentially lethal, monogenic human disorder. It is associated with large interfamilial and intrafamilial variability, which can be explained {{to a large extent}} by its genetic heterogeneity and modifier genes. It is also the most common of the inherited cystic kidney diseases — a group of disorders with related but distinct pathogenesis, characterized by the development of renal cysts and various extrarenal manifestations, which in case of ADPKD include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles, pancreas, and arachnoid membrane, as well as other abnormalities, such as intracranial aneurysms and dolichoectasias, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias. Over 50% of patients with ADPKD eventually develop end stage kidney disease and require dialysis or kidney transplantation. ADPKD is estimated to affect at least 1 in every 1000 individuals worldwide, making this disease the most common inherited kidney disorder with a diagnosed prevalence of 1:2000 and incidence of 1:3000-1:8000 in a global scale.|$|E

40|$|Expression of a cut-related {{homeobox}} gene {{in developing and}} <b>polycystic</b> mouse <b>kidney.</b> cut is a diverged {{homeobox gene}} that is essential for normal development of the Malpighian tubules in Drosophila melanogaster. Homologues of Drosophila cut that encode transcriptional repressors {{have been identified in}} several mammalian species and cell lineages. We examined the expression of a murine cut homologue (named Cux- 1) in the developing mouse using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. At 12. 5 d. p. c. and 13. 5 d. p. c, Cux- 1 was highly expressed in a subset of embryonic tissues, including the developing metanephros. Within the metanephros, Cux- 1 was expressed in the nephrogenic zone including both mesenchymal cells (uninduced and condensed mesenchyme) and epithelial cells (ureteric buds, renal vesicles, S-shaped bodies). During later stages of nephrogenesis, Cux- 1 was down-regulated such that there was minimal expression in mature glomeruli and tubules. In addition, Cux- 1 was detected in the mesonephros, mesonephric duct, and bladder. Expression of Cux- 1 was also examined in <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys</b> from C 57 BL/ 6 J-cpk/ cpk mice. At 21 days of age, Cux- 1 was highly expressed in cyst epithelium of <b>polycystic</b> <b>kidneys</b> but was minimally expressed in kidneys from phenotypically normal littermates. These results demonstrate that a cut-related homeobox gene is expressed in the developing kidney and urinary tract of the mouse. Expression of Cux- 1 in the kidney is inversely related to degree of cellular differentiation. Cux- 1 may encode a transcriptional repressor that inhibits terminally differentiated gene expression during early stages of nephrogenesis...|$|R
