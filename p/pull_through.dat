5|$|In series five Adam hires a nanny, Jenny (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), to {{look after}} Wes while he takes part in operations. Midway through the series, she and Adam start a brief love affair, which ends in the {{penultimate}} episode. In the fifth series, particularly in its later episodes, Adam suffers from several mental breakdowns following the loss of Fiona. He has recurring nightmares that involve his being wounded and unable to return home to his son, and in the eighth episode, he has a panic attack after learning that Wes has briefly run away from home; this attack jeopardises his life during an operation. In the series finale, Adam is revealed to be suicidally depressed, wishing he had died in Fiona's place. But after another panic attack, {{he is able to}} <b>pull</b> <b>through,</b> save fellow officer Ros Myers (Hermione Norris), and escape from the Thames Barrier before they both drown.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Ferdinand and Marie {{moved to}} Cotroceni Palace, {{which had been}} {{extended}} by the Romanian architect Grigore Cerchez, and to which Marie added her own designs. The following year, Ferdinand was struck down with typhoid fever. For days, he was delirious and, despite his doctor's best efforts, came close to dying. During this time, Marie exchanged numerous letters with her family in Britain and was terrified {{at the prospect of}} losing her husband. King Carol still had an heir in Prince Carol, whose young age presented issues; thus, the whole family desperately wished for Ferdinand to <b>pull</b> <b>through.</b> Eventually, he did, and he and Marie went to Sinaia, the site of Peleș Castle, for a period of recovery. Nonetheless, the couple was not able to attend celebrations for Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee that summer. During Ferdinand's convalescence, Marie spent most of her time with her two children, taking them on long walks and picking flowers with them. The winter of 1897/1898 was spent with the Russian Imperial family on the French Riviera, where Marie often rode horses, in spite of the low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} was of {{inherently dangerous}} design, in {{that a long}} vehicle could be trapped partly on the crossing while held by a red light at the intersection.

25|$|Baldwin {{struggled}} {{to survive the}} Panic of 1837. Production fell from 40 locomotives in 1837 to just nine in 1840 and the company was heavily in debt. As part of the survival strategy, Matthias Baldwin took on two partners, George Vail and George Hufty. Although the partnerships proved relatively short-lived, they helped Baldwin <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> the economic hard times.|$|E

25|$|The cotton gin is a {{mechanical}} device that removes the seeds from cotton, {{a process that}} had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word gin is short for engine. The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh. The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> some of the feathers.|$|E
25|$|Recording company Južni Vetar (Southern Wind) {{reached the}} peak of {{popularity}} in (late) 80s with their famous quinto, consisting of Dragana Mirković, Sinan Sakić, Mile Kitić, Kemal Malovčić and Šemsa Suljaković (Pristajem na sve, Zar za mene nema sreće). After they fell apart due to personal disputes and disagreements, and after Dragana left the group, Južni vetar had made strong promotion for the debut of Indira Radić - new singer {{who was supposed to}} fill the place of the absent Yugoslavia It girl. Indira couldn't <b>pull</b> <b>through,</b> and the company sank into oblivion. Radić however made big success 15 years after.|$|E

25|$|The type of {{crossing}} where the crash occurred {{is known as}} an interconnected crossing {{because of the need}} to link the railroad signals to the road signals to ensure safe passage. On this particular route, bus drivers on Algonquin Road had been known to cross the tracks to stop at the line at Northwest Highway, leaving them vulnerable to passing trains if they happened to still be stopped when the gates lowered. In addition, vehicle sensors were only present {{on the north side of}} the railroad tracks. Buses, trucks and other large vehicles were forced to <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> the railroad crossing in order to activate the signals at the intersection.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short final pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, trying to understand what he should have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could have done more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after missing}} out on the program, Rhys finds himself {{performing}} surgery on Chris Pappas (James Mason). Rhys initially treats Chris at the hospital after he is attacked at work by an unknown assailant. Chris refuses to stay for any further medical treatment and later collapses with a punctured lung. Barber said {{that as soon as}} Rhys sees Chris's X-rays, he [...] "goes beyond the call of duty" [...] to find him. The actor explained [...] "When he finds him on the floor, he knows exactly what's happened, but he isn't sure how long he's been unconscious for. For all he knows, Chris could be dead within the minute— so he goes straight into emergency mode." [...] In a bid to save Chris's life, Rhys performs an emergency procedure to get him breathing again using a screwdriver and a piece of piping. Rhys should not be conducting any type of surgery as he is not a qualified surgeon, but he does not think of the consequences. All About Soap's Laura Morgan said Rhys' [...] "quick thinking" [...] pays off and Chris starts breathing again, but at the hospital Karl warns him he will be held accountable if Chris does not <b>pull</b> <b>through.</b>|$|E
500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} well {{received}} amongst critics, especially {{in regards to}} the episodes with Kevin Smith and the storylines on oral sex and the school shooting. The Palm Beach Post said the series [...] "is told from a teenager's point of view since the writers have no interest in appealing to a broad-based demographic like the writers on, say, Fox's The O.C. ... it connects with teens on their level", though it was still [...] "surprised Jay used the graphic oral sex term you'd hear in just about every high school hallway in America", that word being [...] "blow-job". The Boston Herald said [...] "it is important for teens to learn about sexually transmitted diseases and the cost of unprotected sex ... and should help parents begin conversations with their own children". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn described Degrassi: The Next Generation as [...] "the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre". Another comparison was made between Degrassi: The Next Generation and The O.C., saying [...] "The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life", while the events in the two-part episode [...] "Voices Carry" [...] with [...] "hotel room trashing, projectile launching, fist fighting at weddings bi-polar loon Craig , was like an actual scene from my actual teenage life and just like me, Ashley thinks they're going to <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> it together". AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media praised the series for [...] "not only focusing on gay teens, but it showcases gay sex, and relationships. By not stereotyping [...] they are helping thousands of confused and shameful teenagers feel accepted, in Canada and America alike." [...] Ben Neihart called Degrassi: The Next Generation [...] "tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD!" [...] (the best teen TV in the world) in a six-page article in The New York Times. Commenting that [...] "the explosive-issue-per-capita ratio is seriously out of whack", he admitted that [...] "the teen-diary attention to microissues (zits, periods, parents' night) gives the episodes a peculiar authenticity no matter how outrageous their story lines".|$|E

[...] It appeared that he might <b>pull</b> <b>through</b> but later that evening Lukwiya's lungs began haemorrhaging, a worst-case scenario. [...] Lukwiya died at 1:20 am on Tuesday, 5 December 2000. [...] When Margaret was informed and came to the ward, the body had already been put into a polyethylene bag. [...] When she asked if they could unzip it a little so she could have a last look, she was refused; the body was too infectious to take any risks.|$|E
