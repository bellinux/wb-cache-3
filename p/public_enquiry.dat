5|$|The Roads for Prosperity {{white paper}} {{published}} in 1989 detailed a major {{expansion of the}} road building programme and included plans for the M12 Motorway between London and Chelmsford, {{as well as many}} other road schemes. Although Harry Cohen, MP for Leyton and Wanstead suggested in May 1989 that the government should scrap the scheme, a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> was held for the scheme in November.|$|E
5|$|Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was {{designed}} by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, and is the dominant architectural feature of the area. Some of its original market premises fell into disuse in the late 20th century and faced the prospect of demolition. The Corporation of London's <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> in 2012 drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving Smithfield's historical identity.|$|E
5|$|The Clevedon Pier Preservation Society {{was formed}} in 1972 and started campaigning for the {{restoration}} of the pier. The district council applied for permission to demolish the pier in 1979, but a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> the following year ruled that it should be retained. The pavilions {{from the end of the}} pier were taken ashore in 1982 for storage in anticipation of eventual restoration; insufficient funds were available to complete restoration and the first stage was to open the Toll House as an exhibition centre in 1984.|$|E

5|$|A <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> {{was held}} in 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they ought to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson {{was elected}} a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1950, and {{appointed}} Recorder of Cambridge, a part-time judge, in 1952; {{he had previously}} served as Recorder for Rye from 1944 to 1951. In 1954 he represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel Mau Mau; Kenyatta was a moderate, and is now considered unlikely {{to have been a}} member of the organisation. He was imprisoned until 1959, lived under house arrest until 1961, and became the first president of the newly independent Kenya in 1964. Also in 1954 Stevenson represented the Marten family in the Crichel Down affair. The Air Ministry had compulsorily purchased land for bombing practice before the war, promising to return it after the end of hostilities. When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry,</b> changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.|$|E
25|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation into the}} accident was opened on 13 January by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The investigation was chaired by Lord Nathan, who stated that he was considering {{whether or not a}} <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> should be held into the accident. In its 16 January 1947 issue, Flight magazine called for a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> to be held. That day, it was announced that a Public Inquiry would be held.|$|E
50|$|First Scotland East has {{appeared}} before the Traffic Commissioner on five occasions, in relation to various issues surrounding the company. <b>Public</b> <b>enquiries</b> were held in 2004 and again in 2005, regarding maintenance; in 2008, regarding both maintenance and timekeeping; and again in 2010 regarding timekeeping. A formal warning with regards to maintenance was given in November 2011. Following the first four <b>public</b> <b>enquiries,</b> the company dealt {{with many of the}} issues raised and sorted out all outstanding issues. In August 2012 the company appeared for the fifth time in front of the Traffic Commissioner due to further issues regarding services in the Falkirk area.|$|R
50|$|The current Perth and Kinross council {{headquarters}} {{are located}} in Perth {{at the bottom of}} the High Street, near Tay Street, although many <b>public</b> <b>enquiries</b> and council services are handled from the nearby Pullar House at Mill Street.|$|R
50|$|This {{process was}} slow as it {{involved}} research into historic usage and often <b>public</b> <b>enquiries,</b> {{and so was}} not completed {{by the time the}} Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 was passed. This reclassified all remaining RUPPs as 'restricted byways' on 2 May 2006.|$|R

25|$|In 2012 the Constabulary merged its six territorially based, local {{policing}} divisions {{known as}} Operational Command Units (OCUs) into three areas, each {{made up of}} a number of districts. These three areas were then merged into one in 2016. In 2012 there was a {{reduction in the number of}} stations maintaining <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> offices and more limited opening hours were introduced. Stations retaining a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> office are marked thus: † A number of police stations closed in the period 2012-2016.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{objections}} received was almost 3,000 and triggered the requirement under the Transport Act 1962 {{to hold a}} <b>public</b> <b>enquiry,</b> at which {{the merits of the}} proposal would be examined by the South Eastern Transport Users' Consultative Committee (TUCC). This was held in April 1967.|$|E
25|$|The LRO {{was passed}} in 1922, {{following}} a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry.</b> The budget was £75,000 {{and much of the}} funding was borrowed from the Ministry of Transport and local authorities. According to the historian Peter Johnson, this would become a burden as the railway needed to generate the unlikely sum of £3,750 profit each year to service the debt.|$|E
25|$|Construction was not {{expected}} to start until 2013, and the earliest expected completion date was 2017. However, the financial downturn meant that TfL requested a delay to the <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> while funding was clarified. Given {{that the purpose of}} the extension was to serve as-yet unbuilt homes, it became very difficult to predict timescales for this project. The project has been reported to have been cancelled by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson as a cost-cutting measure, although there have been calls for this to be reconsidered, the extension being regarded by Barking and Dagenham council as essential to regenerating the area.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, after fierce {{opposition}} and three <b>public</b> <b>enquiries,</b> the M54 motorway was completed, connecting {{the town to}} the M6 and thence {{the rest of the}} UK's motorway network.

25|$|In February 2011 a local {{solicitor}} {{acting as}} a 'friend of the club' and on behalf of Dunmore Developments Ltd, a local property development company, made an application to de-register the land as common land under the Commons Registration Act 2006 {{on the basis that}} the land was never subject to the right of common – and thus was never common land to be left to the CCT in the first place. Following a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry,</b> in January 2012 Top Field was de-registered as common land, whilst however reaffirming the ownership of the land by the CCT.|$|E
25|$|He {{was finally}} {{released}} following intervention by the Canadian government. The Canadian government lodged an official {{complaint with the}} US government protesting Arar's deportation. On 18 September 2006, a Canadian <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> presented its findings, entirely clearing Arar of any terrorist activities. In 2004 Arar filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New York against senior U.S. officials, on charges that whoever sent him to Syria {{knew he would be}} tortured by intelligence agents. US Attorney General John Ashcroft, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI Director Robert Mueller were all named in the lawsuit. In 2009, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that U.S. law did not allow victims of extraordinary rendition to sue U.S. officials for torture suffered overseas.|$|E
25|$|After a {{delay of}} more than {{eighteen}} months, the Labour Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, announced in September 1966 that the line from Three Bridges to Groombridge would close. Despite the outrage provoked by this decision, she refused {{to meet with a}} deputation from East Grinstead Urban District Council which was told that it was impossible for the Minister to withdraw her irrevocable consent to closure. No reference was made to the objections raised at the <b>public</b> <b>enquiry,</b> nor to the construction of 3000 houses near Crawley Down or the growing traffic congestion in East Grinstead. The decision had also been taken on the basis of figures drawn from when the line was worked by steam locomotives, the losses would presumably have been smaller with the new diesel units. Finally, it was still clear that the Three Bridges - East Grinstead section was well-used during peak-hour periods.|$|E
50|$|Thus, while a road scheme {{may take}} {{a decade or two}} to work through the {{planning}} system, there would still be sections of society who would feel disenfranchised from the process. While protests were often seen at <b>public</b> <b>enquiries</b> in the 1970s and 1980s, some of the more recent protests have been characterised by civil disobedience at the construction site after the enquiry concluded.|$|R

25|$|However, {{it seems}} that a {{southern}} portion will now be built as the Scottish Executive has determined that the M74 motorway will be extended through the Southeast of Glasgow {{to connect with the}} Kingston Bridge (although not along the original route identified in the Bruce Report). This is a controversial plan as it involves plowing the motorway through the city, something that many residents do not want, and a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> recommended that construction not proceed. However the Executive contends that the economic benefits as well as congestion on the current motorway dictate that it will go ahead. Despite this, the opposers to the scheme mounted a legal challenge in June 2005, which will probably mean that opening of the extension will be delayed until 2009 at the earliest. The City Council have indicated that should this extension be complete they will reconsider building the eastern flank of the ring road which will necessitate either a second motorway bridge over the river, or a tunnel.|$|E
25|$|As head of each {{district}} office, {{the district}} officer is {{the representative of}} the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government at the district level. He has the responsibility of overseeing directly the operation of the District Administration Scheme in the district. He is charged with implementing and co-ordinating the execution of district programmes, ensuring that the advice of the district council is properly followed up, and promoting residents' participation in district affairs. In addition, he is required to maintain close liaison with different sectors of the community and reflect their concerns and problems to the Government. It is his duty to ensure that district problems are resolved promptly through inter-departmental consultation and co-operation. Also, he acts as a link between the district council and departments and serves as a mediator between them when problems arise.

25|$|In view of {{proposals}} {{to abandon the}} canal, B. A. Mallender, {{who lived in the}} locality, asked the fledgling Inland Waterways Association to help mount a campaign for its revival in 1947. The author Tom Rolt made a series of cruises on threatened waterways at this time, but could not obtain permission to navigate the Derby Canal. Rolt took his case to the Ministry of Transport, seeking to invoke the conditions of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888, but was told that they would not sanction an inspection of the canal, because the company had intimated that they were preparing to restore the waterway. In 1956 a local committee was formed to campaign for restoration. By 1961, Derby Council were actively promoting the infilling of the canal, and so the Inland Waterways Association together with the Derby Canal Restoration Committee wrote to the Derby Evening Telegraph, calling for the canal's restoration. Although the council refused to comment, the letter, which was published on 1 February 1961, caused considerable local debate, and a protest cruise was organised on the Erewash Canal, with the Derby Canal entrance lock as the destination. The Times national newspaper carried details of the event, and a subsequent meeting held on 27 May called for a <b>public</b> <b>enquiry</b> into how best to restore the canal for commercial and amenity use. Despite the campaigns, the company obtained a warrant to abandon the whole canal in 1964.|$|E
