The <b>projective</b> <b>grid</b> space is defined by two basis views and the fundamental matrix relating these views.

In the <b>projective</b> <b>grid</b> space as a general space that is related to all images, a projective shape can be reconstructed from all the images of weakly calibrated cameras. The projective reconstruction is one way to reduce the effort of the calibration because it does not need Euclid metric information, but rather only correspondences of several points between the images. For demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed <b>projective</b> <b>grid</b> definition, we modify the voxel coloring algorithm for the projective voxel scheme.

40|$|Freehand {{sketching}} {{has long}} had appeal as an artistic medium for conceptual design because of its immediacy in capturing and communicating design intent and visual experience. We present a sketching paradigm that supports {{the early stages of}} design by preserving the fluidity of traditional freehand drawings. In addition, it attempts to fill the gap between 2 D drawing programs, which have fixed views, and 3 D modeling programs that allow arbitrary views. We implement our application as a two-dimensional drawing program that utilizes a projective representation of points — i. e. points that lie on the surface of a unit sphere centered at the viewpoint. This representation facilitates the production of novel re-projections generated from an initial perspective sketch and gives the user the impression of being immersed in the drawing or space. We describe a method for aligning a sketch drawn outside the system using its vanishing points, allowing the integration of computer sketching and freehand sketching on paper in an iterative manner.

40|$|In Zombies and Survivors, {{a set of}} zombies {{attempts}} to eat a lone survivor loose on a given graph. The zombies randomly choose their initial location, and {{during the course of}} the game, move directly toward the survivor. At each round, they move to the neighbouring vertex that minimizes the distance to the survivor; if there is more than one such vertex, then they choose one uniformly at random. The survivor {{attempts to}} escape from the zombies by moving to a neighbouring vertex or staying on his current vertex. The zombies win if eventually one of them eats the survivor by landing on their vertex; otherwise, the survivor wins. The zombie number of a graph is the minimum number of zombies needed to play such that the probability that they win is at least 1 / 2. This variant of the game was recently investigated for several graph families, such as cycles, hypercubes, incidence graphs of <b>projective</b> planes, and <b>grids</b> $P_n \square P_n$. However, unfortunately, still very little is known for toroidal grids $C_n \square C_n$: the zombie number of $C_n \square C_n$ is at least $\sqrt n/(\omega\log n) $, where $\omega = \omega(n) $ is any function going to infinity as $n \to \infty$, and no upper bound is known except a trivial bound of $O(n^ 2 \log n) $. In this note, we provide an approach that gives an embarrassing bound of $O(n^ 2) $ but it is possible that (with more careful, deterministic, argument) it might actually give a bound of $O(n^{ 3 / 2 }) $. On the other hand, by analyzing a specific strategy for the survivor, it seems that one could slightly improve the lower bound to $\sqrt n/\omega$. In any case, we are far away from understanding this intriguing question. Your help is needed!Comment: Private note...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method to {{synthesize}} free-viewpoint images for a moving object, which is captured by uncalibrated multiple moving cameras.

40|$|Studies of {{the origins}} of linear {{perspective}} in European painting tend to focus on developments in treatment of the spatial dimension, with attention especially devoted to mathematical principles that underlie the representation of three-dimensional space. The theoretical understanding of this is first articulated in Alberti’s treatise De pictura (1435). Given that carpets are relatively flat objects, and that their patterning, no matter how complex, was intended to be viewed as two-dimensional, the linking of carpets to the representation of three-dimensional space would seem to be paradoxical. But the relationship may actually find a basis in historical reality. Carpets produced in the “Orient” in the fifteenth century and earlier were imported into an emerging early modern Europe from lands to the east. When they appear in European paintings, they are often depicted as flat objects, conforming to a vertical picture plane, while in the same paintings the depictions of human beings, architecture, furniture and objects are depicted as if they exist in three-dimensional space. This paper presents the results of my study of representations of carpets in European paintings, which suggests that different conceptualizations of space exist in the same painting. Considering patterns of trade and the transmission of ideas, we may begin to recognize that carpets in Europe, expressive of the traditions of Islamic art that rely upon grids for patterning, may indeed be significant antecedents to the development of linear perspective in the subtle shift from square grid to <b>projective</b> <b>grid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in the}} present dissertation is aimed at the analysis of complex physical phenomena involving instabilities and nonlinearities occurring in fluids through state-of-the-art numerical modeling. Solutions of intricate fluid physics problems are devised in two particularly arduous situations: fluid domains with moving boundaries and the high-Reynolds-number regime dominated by nonlinear convective effects. Shear-driven flows of incompressible Newtonian fluids enclosed in cavities of varying geometries are thoroughly investigated in the two following frameworks: transition with a free surface and confined turbulence. The physical system we consider is made of an incompressible Newtonian fluid filling a bounded, or partially bounded cavity. A series of shear-driven flows are easily generated by setting in motion {{some part of the}} container boundary. These driven-cavity flows are not only technologically important, they are of great scientific interest because they display almost all physical fluid phenomena that can possibly occur in incompressible flows, and this in the simplest geometrical settings. Thus corner eddies, secondary flows, longitudinal vortices, complex three-dimensional patterns, chaotic particle motions, nonuniqueness, transition, and turbulence all occur naturally and can be studied in the same geometry. This facilitates the comparison of results from experiments, analysis, and computation over the whole range of Reynolds numbers. The flows under consideration are part of a larger class of confined flows driven by linear or angular momentum gradients. This dissertation reports a detailed study of a novel numerical method developed for the simulation of an unsteady free-surface flow in three-space-dimensions. This method relies on a moving-grid technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) kinematics and discretized by the spectral element method. A comprehensive analysis of the continuous and discretized formulations of the general problem in the ALE frame, with nonlinear, non-homogeneous and unsteady boundary conditions is presented. In this dissertation, we first consider in the internal turbulent flow of a fluid enclosed in a bounded cubical cavity driven by the constant translation of its lid. The solution of this flow relied on large-eddy simulations, which served to improve our physical understanding of this complex flow dynamics. Subsequently, a novel subgrid model based on approximate deconvolution methods coupled with a dynamic mixed scale model was devised. The large-eddy simulation of the lid-driven cubical cavity flow based on this novel subgrid model has shown improvements over traditional subgrid-viscosity type of models. Finally a new interpretation of approximate deconvolution models when used with implicit filtering as a way to approximate the <b>projective</b> <b>grid</b> filter was given. This led to the introduction of the grid filter models. Through the use of a newly-developed method of numerical simulation, in this dissertation we solve unsteady flows with a flat and moving free-surface in the transitional regime. These flows are the incompressible flow of a viscous fluid enclosed in a cylindrical container with an open top surface and driven by the steady rotation of the bottom wall. New flow states are investigated based on the fully three-dimensional solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for these free-surface cylindrical swirling flows, without resorting to any symmetry properties unlike all other results available in the literature. To our knowledge, this study delivers the most general available results for this free-surface problem due to its original mathematical treatment. This second part of the dissertation is a basic research task directed at increasing our understanding of the influence of the presence of a free surface on the intricate transitional flow dynamics of shear-driven flows...|$|E
