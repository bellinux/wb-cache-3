5000|$|The school's goals {{centered}} {{on the concept of}} Black Power and Pan-Africanism. Initially, Fuller designed MXLU's curriculum with two different types of courses. For the first ten months, students took courses in Nation-Building: Independent African Civilization, Slavery, Neo-Colonialism, Colonialism, and Independent African World; Swahili, French, and Spanish for foreign languages; and other courses for physical education. Then, students and faculty would stay in Africa for two months, followed by Areas of Concentration. Student would have up to ten months to complete the technical courses in order to pursue careers as the following: [...] "food scientists, tailors, architects, engineers, medics, cadre leaders, communications <b>technicians,</b> <b>physical</b> developers, teachers, black expressionists, administrators, and linguists." [...] Finally, MXLU would grant students internships so that they could practice their respective fields before graduating after the fourth year.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} {{class of}} rehabilitation equipment is destined for facilitating {{the recovery of}} the upper limb affected by lesions or various diseases. The paper presents a study on the bio-mechanics of the arm and forearm, as well as equipment for mobilizing and rehabilitation of the upper limb. The pneumatic drive of the equipment determines its compliant behaviour, based on air compressibility. The equipment described in the paper can be used for the rehabilitation of patients with deficiencies of the upper limb, as well as for training of high-performance athletes. Given its simple and low cost construction, the equipment can be purchased not only by health care units, but also by nonspecialist individuals, as it lends itself to home training, without requiring the presence of a <b>physical</b> therapist or <b>technician.</b> Index Terms — bio-mechanics, pneumatics, rehabilitation, robotic arm...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Accreditation {{standards}} for healthcare professions education emphasize {{the use of}} active learning interprofessional education strategies {{as a means to}} create professional that are collaborators. Purpose: To designed a learning strategy to help students explore other healthcare professions and begin the process of building relations between them. Description of Innovation: First-year pharmacy students were divided into 39 groups and asked to interview a healthcare professional of their choice other than a pharmacists, and reflect on the experience. Assignment instructions were provided to guide the activity. The interview included questions on education, scope of practice, barriers to interaction and perception of the pharmacist’s role in health care. Post interview reflection addressed—what new information was learned; how pharmacists were viewed; how the experience affected future interactions with health professionals, and what students would do different in the future. Outcomes: Preliminary evaluation shows that health professionals from 7 professions were interviewed— 18 physicians; 12 nurses; 5 dentists; and 1 podiatrist, physician assistant, <b>physical</b> therapy <b>technician</b> and medical technologist. All but one group identified one new thing they learned, 97 % indicated that the interviewee had a positive view of the pharmacy profession and 90 % indicated that the experience changed how they will interact with healthcare professionals in the future. Discussion: Using student interviews of health professionals is a good group-based, active learning tool that engages students to learn about other health professions early in the curriculum. Data is being gathered to gauge the value students placed on the interview experience...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{undesirable}} phenomena in life and child’s development. Chronic disease makes very difficult to meet the needs of a child. Chronic failure affects not only the child himself but the child and the whole family. This is often difficult and sometimes even impossible to explain and accept. Lengthiness of type I diabetes often causes the child to stay in hospital where he comes across pain (insulin injections, diagnostic puncture), hospital rigor, impediment in learning. For school-age child is not enough „to be sick”, especially if the disease is associated with sensations such as pain and malaise. In situations like that it is necessary and important to inform the child about the disease. Supply him with basic information of the need for testing, the rules of diet and adverse symptoms such as acidosis, hypoglycemia. Lack of knowledge about the disease exacerbated by stress cause forced isolation of the child. Type I diabetes may be perceived by young people as a disease which limits social contacts. Furthermore may affect sense of otherness in relation to their contemporaries. Peer support is very important. It helps not only in adjusting to the environment but also in overcoming daily duties associated with chronic disease – testing of glucose level, insulin, diet and exercise plan. Treatment of diabetes may not focus solely on achievement of metabolic balance. It also aims at creation of good relationship within therapeutic team (patient, parent, doctor, nurse, laboratory <b>technician,</b> <b>physical</b> therapist, health trainer, psychologist) as well as between friends, colleagues and school mates...|$|R
40|$|Generic {{representation}} of skeletal remains from burials {{consists of three}} dimensions which include <b>physical</b> anthropologists, replication <b>technicians,</b> and promotional educators. For the reason that archaeological excavation is irreversible and disruptive, detail documentation and replication technologies are surely needed for many purposes. Unearthed bones {{during the process of}} 3 D digital scanning need to go through reverse procedure, 3 D scanning, digital model superimposition, rapid prototyping, mould making, and the integrated errors generated from the presentation of colours and textures are important issues for the presentation of replicate skeleton remains among professional decisions conducted by physical anthropologists, subjective determination of makers, and the expectations of viewers. This study presents several cases and examines current issues on display and replication technologies for human skeletal remains of prehistoric burials. This study documented detail colour changes of human skeleton over time for the reference of reproduction. The tolerance errors of quantification and required technical qualification is acquired according to the precision of 3 D scanning, the specification requirement of rapid prototyping machine, and the mould making process should following the professional requirement for physical anthropological study. Additionally, the colorimeter is adopted to record and analyse the “colour change” of the human skeletal remains from wet to dry condition. Then, the “colure change” is used to evaluate the “real” surface texture and colour presentation of human skeletal remains, and to limit the artistic presentation among the human skeletal remains reproduction. The“Lingdao man No. 1 ”, is a well preserved burial of early Neolithic period (8300 B. P.) excavated from Liangdao-Daowei site, Matsu, Taiwan, as the replicating object for this study. In this study, we examined the reproduction procedures step by step for ensuring the surface texture and colour of the replica matches the real human skeletal remains when discovered. The “colour change” of the skeleton documented and quantified in this study could be the reference for the future study and educational exhibition of human skeletal remain reproduction...|$|R
