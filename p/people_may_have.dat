5|$|Malaria is a mosquito-borne {{infectious}} disease affecting humans {{and other animals}} caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.|$|E

5|$|Of the 332 {{people on}} board, 64 were rescued. Most {{of the crew}} and {{passengers}} were asleep {{at the time of}} attack and had little chance to escape. It was estimated that up to 200 <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been alive at the time Centaur submerged. Several who made it off the ship later died from shrapnel wounds or burns; others were unable to find support and drowned.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E

Quiwonkpa was captured, killed, and mutilated, his body being dismembered and parts eaten.

As many as 1,500 <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been killed. The AFL was purged of Gio soldiers.|$|E

5|$|A {{member of}} the Whadjuk Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name, {{according}} to Robert Lyon, was Beeliar. Scholars now believe that the Beeliar <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a family subgroup (or clan) of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called Beelgar. According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers, {{as far south as}} Mangles Bay. The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>have.</b> The Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{seems to}} have been laid out on a single occasion and used for only a short time afterwards. It is thought that the mourners would have entered through the south side and assembled in the empty south-western area of the cemetery before proceeding to the shrine to carry out the burial rites. After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different groups of <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> used the two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves do not fit into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E

25|$|Sometime {{around the}} 1st century AD, Germanic <b>peoples</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{migrated}} from Scandinavia to Gothiscandza, in present-day Poland.
