50|$|The {{concept of}} feature demons, {{that there are}} {{specific}} neurons dedicated to perform specialized processing is supported by research in neuroscience. Hubel and Wiesel found there were specific cells in a cat's brain that responded to specific lengths and orientations of a line. Similar findings were discovered in frogs, octopuses {{and a variety of}} other animals. Octopuses were discovered to be only sensitive to verticality of lines, whereas frogs demonstrated a wider range of sensitivity. These animal experiments demonstrate that feature detectors seem to be a very <b>primitive</b> <b>development.</b> That is, it did not result from the higher cognitive development of humans. Not surprisingly, there is also evidence that the human brain possesses these elementary feature detectors as well.|$|E

The bill died, but the inclusion of many of its elements in the 1913 appropriations bill encouraged Hay to offer a revision in May, HR5304. The House Committee on Military Affairs held hearings in August 1913. Beck appeared to testify {{on behalf of the}} bill, the only officer to do so, repeating his views on military applications for the airplane. Appearing for the opposite view, among others, were Major William L. [...] "Billy" [...] Mitchell representing the General Staff, and Foulois and Arnold representing the Signal Corps, all of whom within six years became staunch advocates for an independent Air Force. Opposition in general held that the creation of an [...] "Air Corps" [...] independent of the Signal Corps was premature given the <b>primitive</b> <b>development</b> of military aviation to that time, while Beck argued that keeping aviation within the Signal Corps would stifle the very development needed. The original bill had its language expunged following the hearings and was rewritten to include some of the provisions while keeping aviation in the Signal Corps. The revised bill passed and became the enabling legislation for the Aviation Section, Signal Corps.|$|E

This article addresses the design, implementation and experimentation of gaits to negotiate uneven terrain with a real machine. The gaits presented are a mixture of free and discontinuous gaits. Discontinuous gaits were selected because of their ground adaptability features and ease of implementation, while free gaits were chosen because they facilitate path tracking. The fusion of these two main gaits plus the addition of extra constraints to avoid leg-transfer deadlocking produced a new free-crab gait, a free-spinning gait and a free-turning gait. Some experiments have been conducted to illustrate the features of these gaits on a real machine.

Under a more <b>primitive</b> <b>development,</b> when trade was principally local, when {{the present state of}} division of labor was unknown, when commerce was carried on mainly by a system of barter, money prices had but little real meaning. But under the present system of division of labor and the constantly increasing interdependence of the units of industrial society, money has become the one principal agency of production whose object is to bring about the co-ordination of the various industrial elements of society, and we now consider the results of all industrial activities in terms of the monetary unit...|$|E
40|$|Human {{pregnancy}} poses {{a fundamental}} immunological problem because the placenta and fetus are genetically {{different from the}} host mother. Classical transplantation theory has not provided a plausible solution to this problem. Study of naturally occurring allogeneic chimeras in the colonial marine invertebrate, Botryllus schlosseri, has yielded fresh insight into the <b>primitive</b> <b>development</b> of allorecognition, especially regarding the role of natural killer (NK) cells. Uterine NK cells have a unique phenotype that appears to parallel aspects of the NK-like cells in the allorecognition system of B. schlosseri. Most notably, both cell types recognize and reject "missing self" and both {{are involved in the}} generation of a common vascular system between two individuals. Chimeric combination in B. schlosseri results in vascular fusion between two individual colonies; uterine NK cells appear essential to the establishment of adequate maternal-fetal circulation. Since human uterine NK cells appear to de-emphasize primary immunological function, it is proposed that they may share the same evolutionary roots as the B. schlosseri allorecognition system rather than a primary origin in immunity...|$|E
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} {{has become}} {{a powerful tool for}} analysis of vertebrate hematopoiesis. Zebrafish, unlike mammals, have a robust primitive myeloid pathway that generates both granulocytes and macrophages. It is not clear how this unique primitive myeloid pathway relates to mammalian definitive hematopoiesis. In this study, we show that the two myeloid subsets can be distinguished using RNA in situ hybridization. Using a morpholino-antisense gene knockdown approach, we have characterized the hematopoietic defects resulting from knockdown of the myeloid transcription factor gene pu. 1 and the unique zebrafish gene c/ebp 1. Severe reduction of pu. 1 resulted in complete loss of <b>primitive</b> macrophage <b>development,</b> with effects on granulocyte development only with maximal knockdown. Reduction of c/ebp 1 did not ablate initial macrophage or granulocyte development, but resulted in loss of expression of the secondary granule gene lys C. These data reveal strong functional conservation of pu. 1 between zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis and mammalian definitive myelopoiesis. Further, these results are consistent with a conserved role between c/ebp 1 and mammalian C/EBPE, whose ortholog in zebrafish has not been identified. These studies validate the examination of zebrafish <b>primitive</b> myeloid <b>development</b> as a model for human myelopoiesis, and form a framework for identification and analysis of myeloid mutants...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is the observation of autistic barriers presented in art-therapy with two {{patients who suffer from}} diverse somatization problems. This is a case study, in which psychoanalytical epistemology is theoretically supported by several modern theories of the <b>primitive</b> <b>development</b> of self and object relations, notably 'autistic barriers' by Frances Tustin (1990) and 'autistic-contiguous position' by Thomas Ogden (1989). In this research, it is proposed that fibromyalgia and self mutilation, in the cases studied, are primitive autistic defense mechanisms, like the ones described by Tustin. Ogden's theory, on the other hand, permits one to theoretically position the persistence of these autistic defense phenomena in people suffering from diverse somatization problems. Ogden introduces, within the post-kleinian theory, a first position, one of object relations, named "the autistic-contiguous" position as well as a conceptual dialectic of the functioning psyche. The autistic-contiguous position is conceived as the primitive and sensory background of the paranoid-schizoid position. This research will also attempt to describe and distinguish autistic-contiguous (Ogden) and paranoid-schizoid (Klein) positions. Two clinical cases will be presented, offering signs of the presence of autistic defensive mechanisms throughout the study.

40|$|Introduction]. The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{analyzing}} the reform and modernization process of fishing industry in Galicia (Spain) during the 1989 - 1998 period in the framework of the Autonomous Community and the European Union Administrations performance. The fishing industry is identified as a strategic sector in the Galician economy, either in the direct way for its contribution to the GNP (9 %), to the employment creation and balance of trade, or indirect in the generation of an important volume of complementary and services activities. The fishing relevance as a productive activity must be considered also, valuing its multiplier effect over the coastal economies. Fishing industry involves: distant water fishing (in international and third countries waters), coastal and inshore fishing (in interior and community waters), aquaculture (including shellfishing), companies dealing with processing of sea food (canneries, refrigerating companies, frozen products companies, etc.), auxiliary sector (shipyards, raw material suppliers, packaging, machinery [...] .) and marketing sector. The wide range of sectors has taken us to select a case study, shellfishing, based on three reasons: i) in the power distribution between the Spanish Government and the Autonomous Community of Galicia, shellfishing constitutes an exclusive domain of the later, that allows an analysis of its performance in the industry ordination and promotion; ii) it’s one of the most traditional and rooted socioculturally sector in Galicia; iii) the <b>primitive</b> <b>development</b> of its exploitation model...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of numerous catalytically active RNAs in various living species {{as well as}} the in vitro selection of a large series of RNA aptamers able to bind specifically various molecules such as metabolites and co-factors, emphasize the adaptability of RNAs through the plasticity of their secondary structure. Furthermore, all these observations give support to the “RNA world” hypothesis as a step in the <b>primitive</b> <b>development</b> of life on Earth. On this background, we used high pressure to study the mechanism of action of a model hairpin ribozyme which exhibits self-cleavage and ligation. The activation volume (ΔV≠) of the cleavage reaction (34 ± 4 ml/mol) indicates that an important compaction of the RNA molecule occurs during the reaction and must be accompanied by a significant movement of water molecules. Indeed, such a release of 78 ± 4 water molecules per RNA molecule could be measured by complementary osmotic shock experiments. These results are consistent with the information provided by the structural studies which indicate that two loops of the RNA molecule should come into contact for the reaction to occur. The high pressure study of a modified form of the ribozyme whose activity is strictly dependent on the presence of adenine as a co-factor should bring some information about the structural significance of this important ΔV≠ of activation...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} the ontogeny of blood cells throughout foetal development in sheep. Design A haematological study on blood and bone marrow from 42 sheep foetuses aged between 19 days gestation and full term. Procedure Virgin Merino ewes were mated and the developing foetuses removed surgically {{at different stages}} of gestation. Blood and bone marrow samples were collected, stained for cytological examination or processed for electron microscopy. Blood samples were also examined haematologically. Foetuses were incubated with H- 3 -thymidine and autoradiographed. Results During the first 4 weeks of <b>development</b> <b>primitive</b> erythroblast constituted the majority of the circulating blood cells. Definitive erythroid cells, originating in the liver, first appeared in the blood at around 27 days gestation and entirely replaced the primitive erythroblasts by 50 days gestation. Leukocyte numbers, especially lymphocyte count, increased rapidly after 49 days gestation. Erythropoiesis predominated in the marrow of all foetuses older than 70 days. In bone marrow, myelopoiesis was the major activity and lymphopoiesis was not significant. Conclusions Red blood cell numbers and haemoglobin content progressively increases during foetal <b>development.</b> <b>Primitive</b> erythroblasts are not the precursors of the definitive erythroblasts.

40|$|We {{illuminate}} {{several important}} aspects of the nature and causes of growth and institutional change. To do this, we focus on the role resource pressures have played in the historic development of Hawaii's institutions. We discuss the Hawaiian story {{in the context of the}} natural co-evolution of production systems, organizational forms and authority structures in a resource dependent economy. We model the resource dependency as a multi-trophic ecologically based system. Productivity is a dynamic function of the available resource, human populations of laborers and wealth (capital) accumulation that funds management and governance through a non-productive elite class. We use both archeological and historical evidence from natural resource use during the settlement and modernization of the Hawaiian economy. Hawaii's resources are first controlled by hierarchy, which intensifies over time. Decentralization occurs after Western contact (1778), though not immediately. Unlike many existing analyses of <b>primitive</b> economic <b>development,</b> there does not exist a monotonic relationship between population and resource pressure.

40|$|Abstract. Biallelic {{mutations}} of the SLC 25 A 13 gene {{result in}} citrin deficiency (CD) in humans. Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) {{is the major}} CD phenotype in pediatrics; however, knowledge on its geno-typic and phenotypic characteristics remains limited. The present study aimed to explore novel molecular and clinical characteristics of CD. An infant suspected to have NICCD {{as well as her}} parents were enrolled as the research subjects. SLC 25 A 13 mutations were investigated using various methods, including cDNA cloning and sequencing. The pathogenicity of a novel mutation was analyzed bioinformatically and function-ally with a yeast model. Both the infant and her father were heterozygous for c. 2 T>C and c. 790 G>A, while the mother was only a c. 2 T>C carrier. The novel c. 790 G>A mutation proved bioinformatically and functionally pathogenic. The infant had esophageal atresia and an accessory hepatic duct, along with bile plug formation confirmed by laparoscopic surgery. However, the father seemed to be healthy thus far. The findings of the present study enrich the genotypic and phenotypic char-acteristics of CD patients, and provided clinical and molecular evidence suggesting the possible non-penetrance of SLC 25 A 13 mutations and the likely involvement of this gene in <b>primitive</b> foregut <b>development</b> during early embryonic life...|$|R
40|$|Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is {{the most}} common {{forebrain}} and craniofacial malformation syndrome in humans. The genetics of HPE suggest that it often stems from a synergistic interaction of mutations in independent loci. In mice, several combinations of mutations in Nodal signaling pathway components can give rise to HPE, {{but it is not clear}} whether modest deficits of Nodal signaling along with lesions in other pathways might also cause such defects. We find that HPE results from simultaneous reduction of Nodal signaling and an organizer BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) antagonist, either Chordin or Noggin. These defects result from reduced production of tissues that promote forebrain and craniofacial development. Nodal promotes the expression of genes in the anterior primitive streak that are important for the development of these tissues, whereas BMP inhibits their expression. Pharmacological and transgenic manipulation of these signaling pathways suggests that BMP and Nodal antagonize each other prior to intracellular signal transduction. Biochemical experiments in vitro indicate that secreted Bmp 2 and Nodal can form extracellular complexes, potentially interfering with receptor activation. Our results reveal that the patterning of forebrain and medial craniofacial elements requires a fine balance between BMP and Nodal signaling during <b>primitive</b> streak <b>development,</b> and provide a potential mechanistic basis for a new multigenic model of HPE...|$|R
40|$|Human hematopoietic {{stem cells}} are defined by their ability to repopulate {{multiple}} hematopoietic lineages in the bone marrow of transplanted recipients and therefore are functionally distinct from hematopoietic progenitors detected in vitro. Although factors capable of regulating progenitors are well established, in vivo regulators of hematopoietic repopulating function are unknown. By using {{a member of the}} vertebrate Wnt family, Wnt- 5 A, the proliferation and differentiation of progenitors cocultured on stromal cells transduced with Wnt- 5 A or treated with Wnt- 5 A conditioned medium (CM) was unaffected. However, i. p. injection of Wnt- 5 A CM into mice engrafted with human repopulating cells increased multilineage reconstitution by > 3 -fold compared with controls. Furthermore, in vivo treatment of human repopulating cells with Wnt- 5 A CM produced a greater proportion of phenotypically primitive hematopoietic progeny that could be isolated and shown to possess enhanced progenitor function independent of continued Wnt- 5 A treatment. Our study demonstrates that Wnt- 5 A augments <b>primitive</b> hematopoietic <b>development</b> in vivo and represents an in vivo regulator of hematopoietic stem cell function in the human. Based on these findings, we suggest a potential role for activation of Wnt signaling in managing patients exhibiting poor hematopoietic recovery shortly after stem cell transplantation...|$|R
40|$|The first site exhibiting hematopoietic {{activity}} in mammalian {{development is the}} yolk-sac blood island, which originates from the hemangioblast. Here we performed differentiation assays, as well as genome-wide molecular and functional studies in blast colony-forming cells to gain insight into {{the function of the}} essential Ldb 1 factor in early <b>primitive</b> hematopoietic <b>development.</b> We show that the previously reported lack of yolk-sac hematopoiesis and vascular development in Ldb 1 -/- mouse result from a decreased number of hemangioblasts and a block in their ability to differentiate into erythroid and endothelial progenitor cells. Transcriptome analysis and correlation with the genomewide binding pattern of Ldb 1 in hemangioblasts revealed a number of direct-target genes and pathways misregulated in the absence of Ldb 1. The regulation of essential developmental factors by Ldb 1 defines it as an upstream transcriptional regulator of hematopoietic/endothelial development. We show the complex interplay that exists between transcription factors and signaling pathways during the very early stages of hematopoietic/endothelial development and the specific signaling occurring in hemangioblasts in contrast to more advanced hematopoietic developmental stages. Finally, by revealing novel genes and pathways not previously associated with early development, our study provides novel candidate targets to manipulate the differentiation of hematopoietic and/or endothelial cells...|$|R

Here, we investigate a key step in <b>primitive</b> endoderm <b>development,</b> the acquisition of apico-basolateral polarity and epithelial characteristics by the non-epithelial inner cell mass cells. Embryoid bodies, formed from mouse embryonic stem cells, were used as a model to study this transition. The outer cells of these embryoid bodies were found to gradually acquire the hallmarks of polarised epithelial cells and express markers of primitive endoderm cell fate. Fgf receptor/Erk signalling is known to be required for specification of the primitive endoderm, but its role in polarisation of this tissue is less well understood. To investigate the function of this pathway in the primitive endoderm, embryoid bodies were cultured {{in the presence of a}} small molecule inhibitor of Mek. This inhibitor caused a loss of expression of markers of primitive endoderm cell fate and maintenance of the pluripotency marker Nanog. In addition, a mislocalisation of apico-basolateral markers and disruption of the epithelial barrier, which normally blocks free diffusion across the epithelial cell layer, occurred. Two inhibitors of the Fgf receptor elicited similar phenotypes, suggesting that Fgf receptor signalling promotes Erk-mediated polarisation.
