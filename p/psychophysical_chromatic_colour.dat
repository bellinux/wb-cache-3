The present study shows that pupillary responses evoked by such stimuli behave as if they are composed of functionally separable components.

40|$|AbstractPsychophysical {{chromatic}} sensitivity deteriorates in peripheral retina, {{even after}} appropriate size scaling of targets. This decrease is more marked for stimuli targeted at the long- (L) to middle-wavelength (M) cone opponent system than for stimuli targeted at short-wavelength (S) pathways. Foveal chromatic mechanisms integrate over several hundred milliseconds for pulse detection. If the time course for integration were shorter in the periphery, this {{might account for}} sensitivity loss. <b>Psychophysical</b> <b>chromatic</b> temporal integration (critical duration) for human observers was estimated {{as a function of}} eccentricity. Critical duration decreased by a factor of 2 (from ∼ 200 to ∼ 100 ms) from the fovea to 20 ° eccentricity. This partly (but not completely) accounts for the decrease in |L–M| sensitivity in the periphery, but almost completely accounts for the decrease in S-cone sensitivity. Some loss of |L–M|I sensitivity thus has a cortical locus. In a physiological analysis, we consider how the |L–M| cone parvocellular pathway integrates chromatic signals. Neurometric contrast sensitivities of individual retinal ganglion cells decreased with the square-root of stimulus duration (as expected from Poisson statistics of ganglion cell firing). In contrast, psychophysical data followed an inverse linear relationship (Bloch’s law). Models of cortical pooling mechanisms incorporating uncertainty as to stimulus onset and duration can at least partially account for this discrepancy...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} related to colour reproduction in the darker regions of the print. The limitations to the printer’s colour gamut restrict the ability to replicate {{a vast number of}} colours that can be achieved with printmaking and paint colourants. And despite the options in rendering intents, the reproduction of out of gamut colour immediately becomes a trade off between colour accuracy and maintaining the relationships between adjacent colours. Many problematic colours are predominantly seen in the darker, yet still <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> regions of the gamut. Furthermore, dark colours tend to be printed by mixing the chromatic ink colourants with high proportions of black ink. The black then dominates the printed colour, leading to a smaller perceivable gamut of printed dark colour.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} found that humans are able to {{distinguish}} colours without luminance cues by about 2 – 4 months of age and that sensitivity to colour difference develops during childhood, reaching a peak around adolescence. This prolonged period of maturation is reflected by improvements in psychophysical threshold measures and by the VEP characteristics of morphology, latency and amplitude. An intra-individual comparison of VEP and psychophysical responses to isoluminant colour stimuli has not been made in children, however, and this was the aim of the present study. VEPs were recorded from 49 subjects, children (age range: 4. 8 – 12. 6 years) and adults (age range: 25. 7 – 33. 2 years). Psychophysical and VEP thresholds were both measured in 40 of those subjects. Nominally isoluminant chromatic (L–M) sinewave gratings were presented in onset-offset mode and identical stimuli were used for psychophysical and VEP recordings to allow comparison. In agreement with previous reports, morphology of the transient VEP in response to this stimulus differed considerably between children and adults. There was a significant difference between psychophysical and VEP thresholds in children, but not in adults. Our findings support and expand on previous work on maturation of the L–M chromatic pathway and indicate a larger discrepancy between VEP and <b>psychophysical</b> <b>chromatic</b> thresholds in children than in adults...|$|R

Colour perception and processing is commonly thought to occur mainly in high visual areas, and indeed most evidence for <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> contrast adaptation comes from cortical studies. We show that colour contrast adaptation starts in the retina where ganglion cells adjust their responses to the spectral properties of the environment. We demonstrate that the ganglion cells match their responses to red-blue stimulus combinations according to the relative contrast {{of each of the}} input channels by rotating their functional response properties in colour space. Using measurements of the chromatic statistics of natural environments, we show that the retina balances inputs from the two (red and blue) stimulated colour channels, as would be expected from theoretical optimal behaviour.

For animals that rely on crypsis to avoid predators, one solution is to alter their behaviour or appearance to maximize crypsis {{in ways that are}} specific to different types of predator. We tested whether dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion transvaalense) showed different behavioural responses, including colour change, towards multiple predators (bird and snake models) that detect and capture prey in different ways, and whether these antipredator responses varied geographically. Chameleons consistently used the same body postures (lateral compression and flipping to {{the opposite side of the}} branch) and displayed similar <b>chromatic</b> (<b>colour)</b> contrast against the natural background in response to both predator types. However, they became significantly more achromatically contrasting (brighter) in the presence of the snake compared to the bird.

It presents {{part of an ongoing}} work, the aim of which is to formulate a spatially based colour knowledge. Our scientific approach is holistic and mainly directed towards colour and light phenomena as such, not towards underlying physiological processes. Earlier research has discussed lightness perception in colours very near neutral grey, with so low chromaticness that you can ignore the hue. In our research we have found that surfaces with nominally <b>chromatic</b> <b>colours</b> under special circumstances can be perceived as white and thus serve as anchors for perception of other colours in the field of vision. We also discuss how distinctions are made between perceived colours caused by on the light colour and such caused by the surface qualities. What we call adaptation is not limited to basic perception.

A hue plane is a geometrical half-plane defined by the neutral axis and a <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour.</b> A problem with the original HPCC method is that the selection of chromatic colors was a user defined choice (and the user might choose poorly) and the method as formed was not open to optimization. In this paper we present a flexible method of hue plane preserving colour correction which we call Hue Plane Preserving Colour Correction using Constrained Least Squares (HPPCC-CLSQ). This colorimetric characterization method is also based {{on a series of}} 3 by 3 matrices, each responsible for the transformation of a subregion, defined by two adjacent hue planes, of camera RGB values to the corresponding subregion of estimated colorimetric XYZ values. The matrices are constrained to white point preservation. In this new formulation, the subregions can flexibly be chosen in number and position in order to regularize and optimize the results, whilst constraining continuity crossing the hue planes.

40|$|The {{distinct}} behaviours {{of animals}} and the varied habitats in which animals live place different requirements on their visual systems. A trade-off exists between resolution and sensitivity, with these properties varying across the retina. Spectral sensitivity, which affects both achromatic and <b>chromatic</b> (<b>colour)</b> vision, also varies across the retina, though the function of this inhomogeneity is less clear. We previously demonstrated spatially varying spectral sensitivity of double cones in the cichlid fish Metriaclima zebra owing to coexpression of different opsins. Here, we map the distributions of ganglion cells and cone cells and quantify opsin coexpression in single cones to show these also vary across the retina. We identify an area centralis with peak acuity and infrequent coexpression, which may be suited for tasks such as foraging and detecting male signals. The peripheral retina has reduced ganglion cell densities and increased opsin coexpression. Modeling of cichlid visual tasks indicates that coexpression might hinder colour discrimination of foraging targets and some fish colours. But, coexpression might improve contrast detection of dark objects against bright backgrounds, which might be useful for detecting predators or zooplankton. This suggests a trade-off between acuity and colour discrimination in the central retina versus lower resolution but more sensitive contrast detection in the peripheral retina.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{calibration}} experiments were run {{in order to}} determine the effect of the colour of suspended sediment on the response of optical backscatter sensors (OBS). Munsell notation describes the properties of soil and sediment colour using the three parameters, hue, chroma, and value, which represent, respectively, the spectral position, lightness level, and amount of pure <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> present. The exposure of the OBS to Munsell Soil Chart patches revealed that the OBS is sensitive to variations in Munsell value and not Munsell hue or chroma. Since OBS output decreased with darkness level (and increased with lightness level and Munsell value), it is suggested that the level of blackness of particles acts to absorb the near-infrared (IR) signal of the OBS, modifying its output. A strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 984) was found between the observed and predicted OBS outputs of varying concentrations and ratios of black and white suspended sediment. The OBS output was predicted using a linear mixture-model incorporating end-member calibrations of black and white sediment (similar to Green and Boon [Green, M. O., Boon, J. D., III, 1993.

40|$|Whereas {{humans have}} {{three types of}} cone photoreceptor, birds have four types of single cones and, unlike humans, are {{sensitive}} to ultraviolet light (UV, 320 - 400 run). Most birds {{are thought to have}} either a violet-sensitive single cone that has some sensitivity to UV wavelengths (for example, many non-passerine species) or a single cone that has maximum sensitivity to UV (for example, oscine passerine. species). UV sensitivity is possible because, unlike humans, avian ocular media do not absorb UV light before it reaches the retina. The different single cone types and their sensitivity to UV light give birds the potential to discriminate reflectance spectra that look identical to humans. It is clear that birds use UV signals for a number of visual tasks, but there are few studies that directly demonstrate a role for UV in the detection of chromaticity differences (i. e. colour vision) as opposed to achromatic brightness. If the output of the violet/UV cone is used in achromatic visual tasks, objects reflecting more UV will appear brighter to the bird. 11, however, the output is used in a chromatic mechanism, birds will be able to discriminate spectral stimuli according to the amount of reflected light in the UV part of the spectrum relative to longer wavelengths. We have developed a UV 2 ̆ 7 colour blindness 2 ̆ 7 test, which we have given to a passerine (European starling) and a non-passerine (Japanese quail) species. Both species learnt to discriminate between a longwave control of orange vs red stimuli and UV vs 2 ̆ 7 non-UV 2 ̆ 7 stimuli, which were designed to be impossible to differentiate by achromatic mechanisms.

A completely automated system means a computer will perforin the entire task from low level detection to higher level motion analysis. Since conventional system practically using human power to monitor and did not applicable for a long hour monitoring, thus automated system had been created to replace the conventional system. This thesis focuses on a method to detect and classify a moving object that pass through the surveillance area boundary. Moving object is detected by using combination of two frame differencing and adaptive image averaging with selectivity. Technically, this method estimate the motion area before updates the background by taking a weighted average of non-motion area of the current background altogether with non-motion area of the current frame of the video sequence. This step had created a focus of attention for higher level processing and it helps to decrease computation time considerably. The output of a motion-based detector is essentially a collection of foreground that might correspond to the moving objects. But usually the output image produced from this process contaminated with noise and shadow. As a solution, morphological operation has been employed as an approach to remove noise from the foreground object. Mutual shadow that exists with the object had been abolished by combining <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> values with lightness variable. Then, standardized moment invariant is employed to extract the features for each moving blobs. To recognize these blobs, the calculated moment values are fed to a support vector machine module that is equipped with trained extracted moment values for human and vehicle silhouettes.

40|$|Four studies {{including}} ten experiments adresses {{interrelations between}} some major and classical issues in visual perception: 3 -D perception, colour constancy, colour perception and colour vision deficiencies. The main experimental paradigm {{to investigate the}} issues is within that of simulated shape from shading. 3 -D impressions are induced by projecting space-modulated illuminations onto flat surfaces (displays), varying the colours and layout of the displays and the colour and modulation of the illumination. Study I includes four experiments investigating three types of space- modulated illumination. All experiments confirmed earlier findings that <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> and complex display layout with reflectance edges crossed by illumination edges enhances shape from shading. In Study II the impressions of shape from shading and real 3 -D objects were compared between persons with deutan colour vision deficiencies and normals. As predicted, the deutans show fewer and less distinct 3 -D impressions in situations with their specific "problem colours" red and green. They also show a generally lower tendency for 3 -D impressions, interpreted as a generally weaker colour constancy. Study III presents the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon; a novel twofold ambiguous shape from shading situation, continuously alternating between two different 3 -D impressions coupled with different colour attributions. One solution is of an object with two clear surface colours, the other one of an object with greyish (desaturated) colours in coloured illumination which means classical colour constancy. The phenomenon illustrates the visual processes of separating reflectance and illumination characteristics and may provide a useful experimental setting to study colour constancy. In Study IV the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon {{is found to be}} robust as to chromaticness and different luminance contrasts for both normals and deutans. However, the deutans show slower shifts between percepts and a less pronounced desaturation of colour, which indicates a weaker colour constancy. The studies add evidence to the contribution of colour to 3 -D shape perception, validated in a novel way by the results on "colour-blinds". The AMBEGUJAS phenomenon provides further support that the factors affecting shape from shading and the deutans different impressions are to be understood with reference to colour constancy. The deutans different impressions compared to normals are remarkable per se, but probably with very limited implications to everyday life. Diss.
