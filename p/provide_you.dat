500|$|Gaga had posted two {{handwritten}} {{notes of the}} lyrics to [...] "Dope" [...] on social media site Instagram. The verses, then believed {{to be from the}} song, included references to drug intake with lines such as [...] "Been hurtin' low from living high, Toast one last puff and two last regrets" [...] and [...] "each day I cry, I feel so low, from living high", along with the hashtag #DOPE. The images raised concern from Instagram who felt that Gaga needed help and decided to reach out to her. They mailed the singer with the following message: [...] "Hi, Members of the Instagram community have raised concern for your well-being after seeing posts you’ve shared. We’re reaching out to <b>provide</b> <b>you</b> with some important safety information." [...] Gaga mockingly responded to the letter and was dismissive of their concern; she posted on her Twitter account about the mail from the social media. Following the release of the full track list for Artpop, Gaga posted an image of herself on Instagram, wearing a snapback hat, emblazoned with the NASA [...] "meatball" [...] insignia, but replacing the word NASA with DOPE, referring to the design label with the same name.|$|E

2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to <b>provide</b> <b>you</b> with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E
