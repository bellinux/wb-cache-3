If the player decides to {{start as a}} human, {{he or she will}} begin their game in the Uladh village of Tir Chonaill, or the Qilla Base Camp in Iria. If the player chooses to be an elf, the game begins in Iria at Filia, in the region Connous. Should the player decide to start as a Giant, they will begin their game at Vales, in the region <b>Physis,</b> which is located far north in the continent of Iria. As of the Generation 13 patch, a realm outside of Erinn, Avon (based on Stratford-upon-Avon), is able to be accessed by an item found in the first mainstream quest of that generation. As of Generation 15, Belvast Island was introduced (based upon the city Belfast). This island is accessible by taking a ship from the continent of Uladh.|$|E

500|$|The word {{nature is}} derived from the Latin word natura, or [...] "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, {{literally}} meant [...] "birth". Natura is a Latin translation of the Greek word <b>physis</b> (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries.|$|E
500|$|Hippocratic {{medicine}} was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach {{was based on}} [...] "the healing power of nature" [...] ("vis medicatrix naturae" [...] in Latin). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (<b>physis).</b> Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed [...] "rest and immobilization [...] of capital importance." [...] In general, the Hippocratic {{medicine was}} very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though [...] "dry" [...] treatment was preferable. Soothing balms were sometimes employed.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{the works}} of {{prominent}} members of theological schools of Antioch and Nisibis, and shaped by liturgical and linguistic traditions of the East-Syriac rite, christology of the Church of the East was very early faced with particular terminological challenges. Exceptional complexity of Greek theological terminology led to frequent debates and controversies {{over the use of}} various terms, both in the Latin West and in Syriac East. Among such terms were: ousia ( [...] , [...] "essence"), <b>physis</b> ( [...] , [...] "nature"), hypostasis ( [...] , [...] "substance"), and prosopon ( [...] , [...] "person"). In Syriac language, term <b>physis</b> was translated as kyānâ (ܟܝܢܐ) and hypostasis was translated as qnômâ (ܩܢܘܡܐ). In the Church of the East, the term qnoma (or qnuma) was used to emphasize the dyophysite position in its radical form, by designating a particular hypostasis to each of the two natures of Christ. Official adoption of such theological positions, that were in odds with the Chalcedonian definition, was gradual (starting from the Synod of Beth Lapat in 484). After several oscillations during the 6th century, the process was completed {{by the beginning of the}} 7th century, and thus a final christological distinction was created between the Church of the East and the [...] "western" [...] Chalcedonian Churches.|$|E
2500|$|Metaphysical naturalism {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in early Greek philosophy. The earliest presocratic philosophers, such as Thales, Anaxagoras or especially the atomist Democritus, were labeled by their peers and successors [...] "the physikoi" [...] (from the Greek φυσικός or physikos, meaning [...] "natural philosopher," [...] borrowing on the word φύσις or <b>physis,</b> meaning [...] "nature") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as Epicureanism, which sought to explain everything that exists {{as the product of}} atoms falling and swerving in a void.|$|E
2500|$|The Oriental Orthodox Churches, having {{rejected}} the Chalcedonian Creed, {{were known as}} Monophysites because they would only accept a definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature. [...] The Chalcedonian [...] "in two natures" [...] formula was seen as derived from and akin to a Nestorian Christology. [...] Contrariwise, the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards Eutychian Monophysitism. [...] However, the Oriental Orthodox have in modern ecumenical dialogue specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches, that they have always affirmed that Christ's humanity is consubstantial with our own, and they thus prefer the term [...] "Miaphysite" [...] to refer to themselves (a reference to Cyrillian Christology, which used the phrase [...] "mia <b>physis</b> tou theou logou sesarkomene").|$|E
2500|$|Greek {{philosophy}} {{emphasized the}} distinction between [...] "nature" [...] (<b>physis,</b> φúσις) {{on the one hand}} and [...] "law", [...] "custom", or [...] "convention" [...] (nomos, νóμος) on the other. What the law commanded would be expected to vary from place to place, but what was [...] "by nature" [...] should be the same everywhere. A [...] "law of nature" [...] would therefore have the flavor more of a paradox than something that obviously existed. Against the conventionalism that {{the distinction between}} nature and custom could engender, Socrates and his philosophic heirs, Plato and Aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (dikaion physikon, δικαιον φυσικον, Latin ius naturale). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.|$|E
2500|$|Physics (from the Ancient Greek φύσις <b>physis</b> meaning [...] "nature") is the {{fundamental}} branch of science that developed out {{of the study of}} nature and philosophy known, until around the end of the 19th century, as [...] "natural philosophy". Today, physics is ultimately defined as the study of matter, energy and the relationships between them. Physics is, in some senses, the oldest and most basic pure science; its discoveries find applications throughout the natural sciences, since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world. The other sciences are generally more limited in their scope and may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right. Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics.|$|E
2500|$|In {{religious}} matters, Zeno {{is famous}} for his Henotikon, [...] "Act of Union", issued in 482 to mediate between Chalcedonian and Miaphysite opposing views {{about the nature of}} Christ. The Chalcedonians recognised two natures (<b>physis)</b> in Christ, the Miaphysites only one; the Council of Chalcedon (451) had issued the Chalcedonian Creed and condemned the Miaphysite position, but the Miaphysites were still strong, especially in the Eastern provinces of the Empire, and the Patriarch of Alexandria, Peter Mongus, was a Miaphysite. Supporting the Miaphysites was one of the mistakes made by Basiliscus, as the people of Constantinople were Chalcedonian, but Zeno needed the support of the Miaphysite provinces, Egypt, Syria, Palestine and Asia Minor; also the Patriarch of Constantinople, Acacius, was interested in reducing the distance between the two positions.|$|E
2500|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} was first described by Swiss entomologist Felix Santschi in a 1916 journal article published by <b>Physis.</b> Originally named Solenopsis saevissima wagneri from a syntype worker collected from Santiago del Estero, Argentina, Santschi believed the ant was {{a variant of}} S. saevissima; the specific epithet, wagneri, derives from the surname of E.R. Wagner, who collected the first specimens. The type material is currently housed in Naturhistorisches Museum Basel, Switzerland, but additional type workers are possibly housed in the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, Paris. In 1930, American myrmecologist William Creighton reviewed the genus Solenopsis and reclassified the taxon as Solenopsis saevissima electra wagneri at [...] rank, noting {{that he could not}} collect any workers that referred to Santschi's original description. In 1952, the S. saevissima species complex was examined and, together with nine other species-group names, S. saevissima electra wagneri was synonymised with S. saevissima saevissima. This reclassification was accepted by Australian entomologist George Ettershank in his revision of the genus and in Walter Kempf's 1972 catalogue of Neotropical ants.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have claimed that}} Western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing {{of the limits of}} tension between [...] "unaided" [...] reason and faith in [...] "revealed" [...] truths—figuratively summarized as Athens and Jerusalem, respectively. Leo Strauss spoke of a [...] "Greater West" [...] that included all areas {{under the influence of the}} tension between Greek rationalism and Abrahamic revelation, including the Muslim lands. He was particularly influenced by the great Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi. To consider to what extent Eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to Nature (by which we mean <b>physis</b> in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the [...] "discovery or invention of nature" [...] and the [...] "pre-philosophical equivalent of nature" [...] was supplied by [...] "such notions as 'custom' or 'ways, which appear to be really universal in all times and places. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding archai (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.|$|E
2500|$|McKenna saw the universe, in {{relation}} to Novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as [...] "the transcendental object at the end of time." [...] When describing this model of the universe he stated that: [...] "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll {{down the side of the}} bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor." [...] Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a [...] "concrescence", a [...] "tightening 'gyre'" [...] with everything flowing together. Speculating that [...] "when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into <b>physis</b> as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into 'hyperspace', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination." ...|$|E
60|$|Pantheism is {{therefore}} not necessarily irreligious or heretical; {{though it may be}} taught atheistically.

6000|$|And {{what has}} this century caught from these philosophers? One rule it has learnt, {{and that a}} most {{practical}} one--to appeal in all cases, as much as possible, to [...] "Reason and the Laws of Nature." [...] That, at least, the philosophers tried to do. Often they failed. Their conceptions of reason and {{of the laws of}} nature being often incorrect, they appealed to unreason and to laws which were not those of nature. [...] "The fixed idea of them all was," [...] says M. de Tocqueville, [...] "to substitute simple and elementary rules, deduced from reason and natural law, for the complicated traditional customs which governed the society of their time." [...] They were often rash, hasty, in the application of their method. They ignored whole classes of facts, which, though spiritual and not physical, are just as much facts, and facts for science, as those which concern a stone or a fungus. They mistook for merely complicated traditional customs, many most sacred institutions which were just as much founded on reason and natural law, as any theories of their own. But who shall say that their method was not correct? That it was not the only method? They appealed to reason. Would you have had them appeal to unreason? They appealed to natural law. Would you have had them appeal to unnatural law?--law according to which God did not make this world? Alas! that had been done too often already. Solomon saw it done in his time, and called it folly, to which he prophesied no good end. Rabelais saw it done in his time; and wrote his chapters on the [...] "Children of <b>Physis</b> and the Children of Antiphysis." [...] But, born in an evil generation, which was already, even in 1500, ripening for the revolution of 1789, he was sensual and, I fear, cowardly enough to hide his light, not under a bushel, but under a dunghill; till men took him for a jester of jests; and his great wisdom was lost to the worse and more foolish generations which followed him, and thought they understood him.|$|E
50|$|Whereas Plato, {{according}} to the Timaeus, regards <b>physis</b> {{as the result of}} poiesis, viz. the poiesis of the demiurge who creates from ideas, Aristotle considers poiesis as an imitation of <b>physis.</b> In short, the form or idea, which precedes the <b>physis,</b> contrasts with the living, which is the innate principle or form of self-motion. In other words, the technomorphic paradigm contrasts with the biomorphic; the theory of nature as a whole with the theory of the living individual.|$|E
