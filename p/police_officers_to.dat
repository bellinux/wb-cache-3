5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>to</b> remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>to</b> face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E

The system is uses Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{and allows for}} a common public safety network for all emergency agencies.

The {{rest of the country}} uses an analog radio system specific for each police district. In addition to lack of interoperability with paramedics and fire fighters, none of the systems are encrypted, forcing <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>to</b> rely heavily on GSM-based mobile telephones for dispatch communication when transmitting sensitive information.|$|E

5|$|The deposed Sultan made an {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Kenya and Tanganyika for military assistance, although Tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>to</b> Zanzibar to contain rioting. Other than the Tanganyika Rifles (formerly the colonial King's African Rifles), {{the police were}} the only armed force in Tanganyika, and on 20 January the police absence led the entire Rifles regiment to mutiny. Dissatisfied with their low pay rates and with the slow progress of the replacement of their British officers with Africans, the soldiers' mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both Uganda and Kenya. However, order on the African mainland was rapidly restored without serious incident by the British Army and Royal Marines.|$|E
5|$|Tera McArthur asked two <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>to</b> {{accompany}} {{her to a}} trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The city {{expanded}} police protection, even temporarily having volunteer <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>to</b> {{assist the}} three paid officers. Fire protection was expanded in 1882, with the city's first 13 paid firefighters.

The city also expanded with the incorporation of the city of Rockingham and the establishment of the Davenport Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with changes {{made for the}} 1924 final onwards, all tickets were sold in advance to prevent {{a repeat of the}} overcrowding at the 1923 final. Approximately 91,000 tickets were available. 53,000 were standing tickets, 15,000 were uncovered seats and 23,000 were covered seats. Standing tickets cost two shillings, seat prices ranged from five shillings to one guinea. The majority of tickets were sold before the finalists were known. As a result, few supporters of the participating teams attended; most were unable to afford the remaining tickets available to the general public, which were typically in the more expensive areas of the stadium. 1,750 tickets were allocated directly to each club. Bolton fielded 6,000 enquiries and lodged a formal protest about the inadequacy of their allocation. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway laid on a total of seven special trains from Manchester to London on the eve and morning of the match. A number of supporters travelled to London without tickets in the hope of securing one outside the stadium. 5s tickets changed hands for up to 15s, provoking the ire of ticketless supporters who accused the sellers of profiteering. In one such instance, a man selling twenty 2s tic|kets at 10s each required the assistance of five <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>to</b> escape the wrath of the crowd. The total gate receipts for the match were £23,157, a new record.|$|E
