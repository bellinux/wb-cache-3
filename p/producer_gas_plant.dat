40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the problems of}} energy supply and waste utilization of the forest industries. As a solution, it proposes to use gasification to utilize wood leftovers, which is followed by electric power generation from combustion of <b>producer</b> <b>gas.</b> The <b>plant</b> was {{expected to have a}} power of 150 kW. The proposed power technology plant comprises a line for pre-treatment of wood chips, a gas generator (gasifier) and a gas turbine unit. The paper justifies a need for preliminary preparation of wood waste, particularly chipping and drying. Various drying schemes have been analyzed. A line for pre-treatment of wood chips comprises a drum chipper, a receiving raw material wood container and a drum dryer using fume gases. A co-current gasifier is chosen because of the high content of tar in the original fuel. In the co-current gasifier, most of the tar, passing through the high temperature area, is burned. The paper offers high temperature dry cleaning of <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> in the cyclone separator. Such a scheme of cleaning provides high efficiency of the plant and simplifies its design, but suspended particles still remain in the <b>producer</b> <b>gas.</b> When analyzing the schemes of power converters this is taken into account. A choice of the gas turbine as a power converter is justified. To reduce the erosion damage of the turbine blades there is a proposal to use an unconventional gas turbine scheme with air turbine and a combustion chamber located downstream of the turbine. In this plant the air rather than the combustion gas passes through the turbine. The air from turbine goes into the combustion chamber, the combustion gas passes through the air heater, where it transfers heat to the air. Such scheme allows reducing power costs for the fuel gas compression before the combustion chamber. Optimization of the gas turbine cycle is performed. The optimum compressor pressure ratio is 3, 7. The plant efficiency for this pressure ratio is 25, 7 %. Calculation results of the main elements are reported. Thus, the power technology plant, which allows us to solve problems of energy supply and waste utilization of the forest industries, is proposed. </p...|$|R

This advanced design of gasifier has the ability to generate <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> with a lower heating value (LHV) of 11. 5 - 13. 4 MJ/Nm 3, which is two to three times higher than yielded by conventional gasification systems. This is accomplished because the gasification and combustion processes occur in two physically separated reactors. Several modifications to the gasifier were required after it was first constructed in order to achieve stable and reliable operation. <b>Producer</b> <b>gas</b> yields were measured through the use of helium as a tracer gas. A new simultaneous <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> and tar sampling system was developed, allowing accurate samples to be obtained in a matter of minutes.

This helped in achieving stable and reliable operation of the <b>plant.</b> <b>Producer</b> <b>gas</b> yields of 14. 6 Nm 3 /h were recorded with a fuel (radiate pine wood pellets) feed rate of 18. 9 kgdry/h. The cold gas efficiency ranged from 16 - 40 % with limited heat recovery in place, but depended noticeably on the plant operating conditions especially gasification temperature. The amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) tars measured in the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> ranged between 0. 9 - 4. 7 g/Nm 3 with naphthalene and acenapthylene being the most abundant compounds.

Leaching {{is used as}} a pre-treatment process targeted on the elimination of alkali metals such as K and Na as well as chlorine to reduce/eliminate the ash-related problems during gasification. The leaching pre-treatment process could affect the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> composition toward the lower or higher yield of CO and H 2 of the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> depending on the moisture content of parent fuels. The lower total tar yield of the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> in the case of leached olive residue was observed compared to untreated olive residue. At the same time, there are present wider varieties of different tar components in the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> of the leached olive residue compared to the untreated one. The distinctions in tar composition and content between the leached and untreated olive residue are attributed to the alkali and alkali earth metal and chorine chemistry affected by leaching pre-treatment. The addition of woody fuels and reed at elevated proportions resulted in the lower LHV value compared to the leached olive residue. The tar content of the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> is seen to increase adding reed and woody fuels to the leached olive residue, i. e. the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> contained additional variety of tar components whereas phenol becomes one of the key components determining the total tar content, apart from benzene, toluene and naphthalene. This is seen to be due to the higher cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin as well as higher chlorine content of the reed and woody fuels compared to the leached olive residue. The olive residue is seen to be better fuel for gasification compared with woody fuels and reed.

Experiments on naturally aspirated and turbo-charged engine operation and subsequent analysis of the cylinder pressure traces reveal significant differences in the heat release pattern within the cylinder compared with a typical fossil fuel. The heat release patterns for gasoline and <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> compare well in the initial 50 % but beyond this, <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> combustion tends to be sluggish leading to an overall increase in the combustion duration. This is rather unexpected considering that <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> with nearly 20 % hydrogen has higher flame speeds than gasoline. The influence of hydrogen on the initial flame kernel development period and the combustion duration and hence on the overall heat release pattern is addressed. The significant deviations in the heat release profiles between conventional fuels and <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> necessitates the estimation of producer gas-specific Wiebe coefficients. The experimental heat release profiles are used for estimating the Wiebe coefficients. Experimental evidence of lower fuel conversion efficiency based on the chemical and thermal analysis of the engine exhaust gas is used to arrive at the Wiebe coefficients.

40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} is {{a technology}} under development that presents {{a means of}} generating hydrogen using renewable energy. While many forms of gasification have been investigated, steam gasification using a dual fluidised bed (DFB) reactor {{has been shown to}} efficiently produce high hydrogen content <b>producer</b> <b>gas.</b> The aims of this research were to increase the hydrogen yield from the 100 kW DFB gasifier installed at the University of Canterbury, and thereby improve {{the current state of the}} art of gasifier operation. Calcium carbonate-based minerals such as calcite and dolomite were shown to be able to improve hydrogen production by absorbing carbon dioxide in the <b>producer</b> <b>gas,</b> promoting the water gas shift reaction. Bed material mixtures of olivine and calcite were the most effective at improving gasifier performance, increasing <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> yield by 20 %, increasing cold gas efficiency by 6 % and increasing hydrogen yield by 85 %. In addition, the carbon monoxide content was reduced and the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> was ideal for Fisher-Tropsch synthesis of liquid fuels...|$|R
40|$|Design of a {{carburetor}} for <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> application {{with special}} reference for reduced {{loss of pressure}} is taken up to generate the optimal fuel–air mixture to meet different load conditions of the engine {{as well as for}} varying operating conditions of <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> reactor. A specially designed <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> carburetor is comprehensively analyzed for its mixing performance and response with a CFD modeling. The model is made up of a mixer chamber that has the essential orifices for air and fuel (<b>producer</b> <b>gas)</b> inlets to generate stable stoichiometric mixture at near to ambient conditions using the induction of the engine as the driving pressure differential for the flow, and tested for a case of engine of 25 kWe capacity. The CFD simulations are carried out followed with experimental studies to validate the analysis. The results show a consistency in the experimental data and the modeling has provided a good insight into the flow details and has paved way in optimization in the geometrical design to get a good mixing efficiency...|$|R
