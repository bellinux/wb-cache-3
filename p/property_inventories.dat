40|$|ABSTRACT: TItis article reconstructs slave family Ige in a {{rural town}} in which a large ntiniber of slaves married, slave wonren had high fertility, and slaves lived {{primarily}} in nuclear families. The marriage and fertility rates of slaves lag behind those of the free population, but do not dirfer radically from them. Thisportrait ofslave family Ige contrasts with the conrnion portrayal of slave families in Brazil in which historians report that few slaves married and slave fertility was low. Despife the demographic similarities between slave andfree families. the key dgerences between the slave and the free populations rested on the niasterk legal right to own slaves as property. Because slaves were property, the Portuguese laws of inheritance mandated the division of slaves among the heirs of the deceased master. Probate judges and heirs often broke up slave families; thus the nrortality of masters severely affected the ability of slave faniilies to survive over time. Through the analysis of censuses, parish registers, <b>property</b> <b>inventories,</b> and planta-tion lists, most Brazilian historians now agree that many more slaves lived in fami-lies than previously thought. Yet no con-sensus exists on whether it was common fo...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{publication}} of two 18 th century inventories from Raciążek Castle in Kujawy, Włocławek Province. Thle castle is being examined by the Department of Archaeology, University of Łódź since 1978. Besides field studies there is also conducted search in the archives which unearthed two inventories not published so far. The castle of Włocławek bishops at Raciążek was undergoing numerous changes over the past centuries. When in 1330 a tlmber-earth cagtrum was destroyed, a brick Gothic castle was erected in its place to be next remodelled into a late-Renaissance residence by bishop Hieronim Rozdrażewski ln the late 16 th century. The next remodelling was initiated by Krzysztof Szembek (1720 - 1738) and completed by Walenty Czapski (1751). It was then that a considerable part of old walls was pulled down shaping the main castle buildings into a late-baroque palace. Both inventories were found in Diocesan Registry at Włocławek in hooks of <b>property</b> <b>inventories</b> acts. The first one (1720) contained in book No. 148 registers the state of a deserted castle when all housing and residential functions were performed by a wooden "palace" erected {{at the beginning of}} 18 th century on the approaches to the castle. The other inventory (from 1751) contained in book No. 156, depicts the state of the residence after remodellings of K. Szembek and W. Czapski containing an excat description of "Italian" palace and auxuliary buildings. The descriptions published in this article were utilised only by W. Górzyński, the author of the first monograph devoted to the history of the castle (1913). Both inventotiree are a valuable source allowing a better insight into the history of the castle at Raciążek in the late stages of its development.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} two interrelated {{sources of}} blight in cities: so-called "problem properties" (PP), or properties in poor physical condition where owners have stopped performing basic maintenance, and tax-delinquent properties (TDP), where owners have stopped paying their property taxes. It focuses on how cities {{can be more}} effective in addressing PP and TDP both "before" (through proactive prevention) and "after" (through correction/collection) they emerge. Fundamentally, it argues that cities should recognize the relationship between PP and TDP, which often constitute the same properties, but, more importantly, both can be "liened up" and taken through foreclosure if their owners are truly unresponsive. These liens can be established through unpaid code violation fines and receivership liens, as well as unpaid taxes. This approach is {{based on the premise that}} cities want to receive as few properties as possible through foreclosure, because of the costs associated with holding excess land and buildings, but also want to avoid the "worst of the worst" PP and TDP becoming a blight on neighborhoods. Thus, if owners are going to refuse to correct severe code violations and/or delinquency, cities want to transfer properties to responsible owners as quickly as possible. Recognizing the links between PP and TDP enables cities to switch from a reactive to proactive approach in treating blight. This thesis also discusses barriers to addressing PP and TDP. It suggests that cities treat them through comprehensive "enforcement pathways" targeted to specific property and owner types. In particular, owners are divided into three groups: cooperative, non-cooperative, and "missing in action. " This segmentation methodology recognizes that different properties present different enforcement challenges and require different strategies to return them to productive use. In addition, this thesis examines the three collection methods available to cities: public collection, contracted third-party servicing, and privatized collection (tax lien sales), and addresses a major limiting factor on tax lien sales: their dependence on private market demand. Finally, it examines how cities can {{be more effective in}} managing and disposing of their <b>property</b> <b>inventories.</b> To guide property usage and disposition timing, it suggests that cities establish a central property inventory that includes critical land and building characteristics, a property potential reuse scoring system, and a market model that segments neighborhoods and identifies spatial and temporal "inflection points. " It also recommends that cities not take a "one size fits all" approach to their entire inventory, but rather select the disposition method, [...] sheriff's sale/auction, RFP, third-party transfer, or land banking, [...] that is most appropriate for the property type, (sub) market condition, and desired outcome(s). Finally, it outlines strategies to overcome under-management of public assets, weak markets, and financing challenges. To support the discussion about how to best manage delinquency and disposition, it includes detailed case studies of Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. by Sara E. Brown. Thesis: M. C.
