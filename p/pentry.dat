5000|$|Excavations {{have also}} {{uncovered}} post-Roman pottery {{from a number}} of sources including Crockerton near Warminster; Savernake Forest, Marlborough; Laverstock and Verwood near Salisbury, and Bath (90 1997); thus indicating other movements and occupation in and around Bulkington. There are several green lanes now used as bridle paths that run close to the village including The Drove that extends to Marston, Worton and Erlestoke. The lane that leads to the Drove, across Brass Pan Bridge, carried on itself to the former hamlet known as Folly Green. There are also other tracks towards Keevil and the surrounding area (xxxiii 1904). With a possible pottery production centre at Potterne and the proximity to the River Avon at Melksham, joined by the aforementioned brooks, Bulkington was in no means isolated. This is exemplified by several examples of folklore from the village including links with the giant said to have lived at the Barge Inn, Seend Cleeve, and [...] "Turpins Stone" [...] which lies by <b>Pentry</b> Bridge, depicting an inscription said to have run: ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInvestigation of the hydro-mechanical {{effects on}} gas {{migration}} in saturated materials with low permeabilityis of great {{theoretical and practical}} significances in many engineering fields. The conventional two-phaseflow (visco-capillary flow) theory, which regards the capillary pressure as the only controlling factor in gasmigration processes, is commonly adopted to describe the gas flow in geo-materials. However, formaterialswith lowpermeability, the conventional two-phase flow theory cannot properly describe the gasmigration. In this work, hydro-mechanical coupled gas injection tests were conducted. The volumetric variation of theliquid for applying the confining pressure in the specimen cell and the gas flow rate were monitored. Testresults indicate that gas migration {{is influenced by the}} capillary pressure and the mechanical stress simultaneously. The two key parameters of the gas entry pressure <b>Pentry</b> and the gas induced-dilatancy pressurePdilatancy are introduced for description of gas migration with respect to the capillary pressure and the mechanicalstress effects, respectively. When the gas injection pressure is smaller than the <b>Pentry</b> and thePdilatancy, the balance between the gas injection pressure and the confining pressure will lead to an intermittentgas flow. Sudden increase of gas flow rate could be observed once the gas injection pressure approachesthe <b>Pentry</b> or the Pdilatancy. For higher gas injection pressures, the mechanical stress effects on gas migrationcould not be neglected. The sudden increase of gas flux under high gas injection pressures could be causedby the mechanical induced-dilatancy of channels, capillary pressure induced-continuous flow pathways, aswell as the failure of sealing-efficiency. The failure of sealing-efficiency is closely related to the differencebetween the gas injection pressure and the confining pressure rather than the properties of the materialtested. Monitoring the volume of liquid for applying confining pressure is helpful for detecting the failureof sealing efficiency and the mechanism of gas breakthrough...|$|E
30|$|HBV virus {{replication}} was suppressed by all siRNAs expressed {{as indicated by}} diminished HBsAG titers in cell culture supernatant. Imitations of miR- 122, miR- 26 a 1 and miR- 30 -a containing HBV-specific attachment sequences were cloned in <b>pENTRY</b> vectors under U 6 and H 1 RNA polymerase III promotor control. H 1 promotor expression of microRNAs was slightly superior to U 6 promotor expression of microRNAs. shRNAs lead to stronger genetic dysregulation than HBV-specific microRNA imitations.|$|E
30|$|Next, we {{constructed}} {{a set of}} binary transformation vectors using the transient expression vectors as backbones. The following {{were added to the}} transient expression vectors to make 21 transformation vectors: T-DNA border LB and RB, selection marker gene HptII (for hygromycin) or NptII (for G 418 /kanamycin) {{under the control of the}} 35 S promoter, and the sequence ori-REP-STA from pVS 1 for plasmid stabilization and replication in A. tumefaciens. Among the 21 transformation vectors, eight (four pRHEs and four pRGEs) did not contain the Ubi promoter and were suitable for gene regulable expression (Fig.  1 f, g), and 13 vectors (8 pRHVs and 5 pRGVs) for gene overexpression (Fig.  1 h, i, Additional file  1 : Table S 1). These vectors were classified and named according to their selection markers (with H standing for hygromycin and G standing for G 418 /kanamycin) and promoters (with E standing for regulable expression without the Ubi promoter, and V standing for overexpression with the Ubi promoter). Two CRISPR vectors, pRHCas 9 and pRGCas 9, were constructed for Cas 9 -mediated rice genome editing (Fig.  1 j). The genome editing tool suites contain two additional compatible entry vectors, <b>pEntry</b> A and <b>pEntry</b> B, for packing the sgRNA cassette (Fig.  1 j). These binary vectors can be used for almost all rice transgenic experiments.|$|E
30|$|For {{construction}} of the CRISPR/Cas 9 plasmid pRHCas 9 -IPA 1, the specific sequence primer pairs with the complementary PAM site of IPA 1 (LOC_Os 08 g 39890) (Jiao et al. 2010) target sequence 5 ’-ccaCCGACTCGAGCTGTGCTCTC- 3 ′ were synthesized, cloned to <b>pEntry</b> A, and then sub-cloned to pRHCas 9. The detailed construction procedure of pRHCas 9 -IPA 1 targeting rice IPA 1 is described in Additional file  1 : Additional Methods. The pRHVnGFP empty vector and pRHCas 9 -IPA 1 plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium strain EHA 105. Rice calli were induced from the mature seeds of NPB. Transgenic rice plants were generated by the Agrobacterium-mediated method (Qu et al. 2006).|$|E
30|$|To test our CRISPR/Cas 9 vectors for {{generating}} rice mutants, {{we tried to}} edit the rice IPA 1 (Ideal Plant Architecture 1) gene, which {{is involved in the}} regulation of plant architecture and grain yield (Jiao et al. 2010). A previously reported CRIPSPR/Cas 9 target sequence with complementary NGG PAM structure in IPA 1 gene (Li et al. 2016) was cloned into the <b>pEntry</b> A vector and then sub-cloned into the binary vector pRHCas 9. Over 30 independent transgenic plants were generated through Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation. We then randomly selected 20 plants for genotyping by PCR and sequencing. Among them, 16 (80 %) showed gene editing at the target site of the IPA 1 gene (Fig.  5 g), which was much higher than the editing rate (27.5 %) of IPA 1 in the previous report (Li et al. 2016). Additionally, most of the edits appeared in a bi-allelic manner, and the most abundant editing pattern was one base pair insertion at 3  bp downstream of the complementary NGG PAM site (Fig.  5 h). This result demonstrated that our CRISPR/Cas 9 system has a high gene editing efficiency and is a useful tool {{for generating}} rice mutants.|$|E
