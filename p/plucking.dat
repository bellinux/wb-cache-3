5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, entering their web and <b>plucking</b> its silk threads until the spider approaches. This vibrational aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E

5|$|Styracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; they {{probably}} fed mostly on low growth {{because of the}} position of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk.

5|$|Males {{tend to take}} tits, finches, sparrows and buntings; females {{often take}} thrushes and starlings. Larger quarry (such as doves and magpies) may not die {{immediately}} but succumb during feather <b>plucking</b> and eating. More than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey. The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings, though chicks in the nest and carrion are sometimes eaten. Small mammals, including bats, are sometimes caught but insects are eaten only very rarely.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} forages mainly by diving from the water, with dives usually lasting less than 30 seconds. These dives are usually shorter in time when in more shallow water. In between dives, this grebe rests {{for an average}} of 15 seconds. It also forages by {{gleaning}} foliage, <b>plucking</b> objects off of the surface of water, having its head submerged while swimming, and sometimes capturing flying insects.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with <b>plucking</b> the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of <b>plucking</b> other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E
5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and a long black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in <b>plucking</b> buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E

50|$|When all ten strings are <b>plucked,</b> {{one method}} of tuning the begena is to tune {{each pair of}} strings {{to one of the}} pitches in a pentatonic scale. When using five of the stings, only the first, fourth, sixth, eighth and tenth strings are tuned and <b>plucked</b> to give sound. Finally, while playing the begena using six strings, the left hand <b>plucks</b> strings one, three, four, six, eight, and ten (starting from the left side when facing the instrument). The {{pointing}} finger <b>plucks</b> strings three and four while the other fingers are in charge of controlling one string each. The remaining strings are used for the finger rests or stops after the strings have been <b>plucked,</b> allowing the <b>plucked</b> string to vibrate.|$|R

[...] These words, an olive-leaf <b>plucked</b> off, do intimate, that Noah was now {{inquisitive}} {{and searching}} how the dove obtained the leaf; that is, whether {{she found it}} as dead, and upon the waters; or whether she <b>plucked</b> it off some tree: But he found by the greenness and freshness of the slip, that she <b>plucked</b> it off from the olive. Wherefore, he had good ground now to be comforted; for if this leaf was <b>plucked</b> off from a tree, then the waters could not be deep; especially, because as the story tells us, the olive used also {{to stand in the}} bottoms, or valleys.|$|R
5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, <b>plucking</b> or cutting the nest. If the {{resident}} spider eventually leaves the nest, P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident spider tries to counterattack and then retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata may attack the other spider as it re-enters the nest, or may wait motionless until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey spider retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters the nest, but {{waits for the}} prey to move out, and then P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather <b>plucking</b> is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine <b>plucking</b> in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

50|$|Together with Konrad Wölki, Herman Ambrosius, Heinrich Konietzny and others, Behrend {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents in the {{development}} of mandolin and <b>plucked</b> string music towards higher quality and enhanced expressivity in Germany after the war. Apart from many arrangements of baroque and folk music for <b>plucked</b> string instruments, Behrend focused on contemporary music. He conducted many premieres of works of Anestis Logothetis, Heinrich Konietzny, Klaus Hashagen, Dietrich Erdmann, Friedrich Gaitis and others. In the years 1960 to 1973, Behrend was conductor of the Saarland <b>Plucked</b> String Orchestra - at that time the leading <b>Plucked</b> String Orchestra in Germany. From 1968 to 1990, he conducted the newly founded German <b>Plucked</b> String Orchestra.|$|R

5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or <b>plucking,</b> or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then <b>plucking</b> them {{from the surface of}} the water with their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule bat, which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat, also known as the American false vampire bat, and the ghost bat of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after <b>plucking</b> the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
50|$|The box zither is a {{class of}} {{stringed}} instrument {{in the form of}} a trapezoid-shaped or rectangular, hollow box. The strings of the box zither are either struck with light hammers or <b>plucked.</b> Now, the most popular <b>plucked</b> box zither is the Arab qānūn and its various derivatives, including the harpsichord (a <b>plucked</b> zither controlled by a keyboard).|$|R

5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either <b>plucking</b> them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E
5|$|The male wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male will enter the female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The Courtship process consists of the male bobbing, <b>plucking</b> and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E
5|$|When the ducklings {{were ready}} for slaughter, the duckers would {{generally}} kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally {{take place in the}} morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been plucked. The <b>plucking</b> was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.|$|E
