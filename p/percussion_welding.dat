50|$|<b>Percussion</b> <b>welding</b> {{is similar}} to flash welding and upset welding but is {{generally}} considered to be more complex. It is considered to be more complex because it uses an electric discharge at the joint, followed by pressure being applied to join the materials together. <b>Percussion</b> <b>welding</b> is used to join dissimilar metals together, or used when flash is not required at the joint. <b>Percussion</b> <b>welding</b> is used on materials that have small cross sectional areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Percussion</b> <b>welding</b> (PEW) {{is a type}} of {{resistance}} welding that blends dissimilar metals together. <b>Percussion</b> <b>welding</b> creates a high temperature arc that is formed from a short quick electrical discharge. Immediately following the electrical discharge, pressure is applied which forges the materials together. This type of joining brings the materials together in a percussive manner.|$|E
50|$|Advantages {{of using}} <b>percussion</b> <b>welding</b> types include a shallow heat {{affected}} zone, {{and the time}} cycle involved is very short. Typical times can be found {{to be less than}} 16 milliseconds.|$|E
50|$|Modern forge-welding {{is often}} automated, using computers, machines, and {{sophisticated}} hydraulic-presses {{to produce a}} variety of products {{from a number of}} various alloys. For example, steel pipe is often forge-welded during the manufacturing process. Flat stock is heated and fed through specially-shaped rollers that both form the steel into a tube and simultaneously provide the pressure to weld the edges into a continuous seam. Diffusion bonding is a common method for forge welding titanium alloys in the aerospace industry. In this process the metal is heated while in a press or die. Beyond a specific critical-temperature, which varies depending on the alloy, the impurities burn out and the surfaces are forced together. Other methods include flash welding and <b>percussion</b> <b>welding.</b> These are resistance forge-welding techniques where the press or die is electrified, passing high current through the alloy to create the heat for the weld. Shielded active-gas forge-welding is a process of forge welding in an oxygen-reactive environment, to burn out oxides, using hydrogen gas and induction heating.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{development for}} preventive technology of Sn whisker in welding of aluminum electrolytic condenser lead. Sn whisker is the crystal of tin {{and the length}} of Sn whisker is from several μm to several mm. Sn whisker has been causes for failure in electric device occasionally. The lead of aluminum electrolytic condense is composed of Sn and Cu plated Fe wire (named CP wire) and Al wire by <b>Percussion</b> <b>welding.</b> From observation, Sn whisker occurred from Al-Sn alloy area in welding point. We considered exclusion Sn from welding point. In this experiment, we used Sn plated-less CP wire with mold in welding. This mold is addition to chucking unit of welding machine. We obtained good shape and sufficient bonding strength by this method. There is no Sn whisker on the welding point after accelerated test during 4000 hr...|$|E
