These findings can be compared with a study conducted in Jordan (Al-Niemat et al. 2014), which showed that out of 85 % <b>prescriptions</b> with antibiotics, 88 % <b>prescriptions</b> had one antibiotic, 11 % had two and 1 % had three antibiotics.

40|$|AIMS: To date only a {{few studies}} {{investigated}} the clinical reasons supporting and explaining non-classical antipsychotic <b>prescriptions.</b> The present study was carried out to develop concepts which help understand this phenomenon in a natural setting, giving emphasis to views of clinicians according to quali - quantitative research methodologies. SUBJECTS: From the South-Verona Psychiatric Case Register all antipsychotic <b>prescriptions</b> issued during 2005 were extracted. Concurrent prescribing {{of two or more}} antipsychotics, prescribing antipsychotic drugs outside the licensed indications, and outside the licensed ranges of doses reported in the Italian National Formulary, were considered non-classical <b>prescriptions.</b> Reasons for non-classical <b>prescriptions</b> were collected by means of brainstorming sessions with clinicians. Non-classical <b>prescriptions</b> and the corresponding reasons were grouped according to whether they were "clinically sound" or "clinically not sound". RESULTS: During 2005 a total of 259 patients received 376 non-classical <b>prescriptions.</b> The most frequently reported reasons for non-classical prescribing were that <b>prescriptions</b> were inherited from another clinician with or without benefit, and that <b>prescriptions</b> were motivated by the need of reducing psychotic symptoms. More than 60 % of these non-classical <b>prescriptions</b> were categorised as "clinically sound". Clinically not sound <b>prescriptions</b> were related with negative clinicians' views and opinions about the patient/clinician relationship. CONCLUSION: Clinically not sound <b>prescriptions</b> appeared just a reflection of a problematic doctor/patient relationship, where no individual treatment plan existed and psychiatric visits had the only goal of monitoring ongoing <b>prescriptions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether <b>prescription</b> amphetamine, <b>prescription</b> amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several <b>prescription</b> drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the trends {{and characteristics of}} pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> and users in Taiwan from 2002 to 2007. METHOD: All pethidine users (n = 3, 301, 136) in Taiwan from 2002 to 2007 were linked to National Health Insurance claims to identify pethidine <b>prescriptions.</b> We examined the trends in pethidine user prevalence {{and the proportion of}} pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> according to health care characteristics. A logistic regression model was used to compare patient demographics and health care characteristics associated with pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> between 2002 and 2007. RESULTS: Despite the {{decline in the number of}} pethidine users and <b>prescriptions</b> over the six-year period, more than half a million people were prescribed pethidine annually. In fact, an increasing proportion of pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> were observed in clinics, outpatient settings, and patients who had both operations and cancer diagnoses. Pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> were mostly associated with a non-operation status without a cancer diagnosis (> 60 %). However, approximately 10 % of the total pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> were found in patients with a cancer diagnosis but no operation. Compared to those in 2002, pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> in 2007 were more likely to be found in people 80 years or older, rural residents, patients from clinics, outpatient settings and operation patients with cancer diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: A population-based survey in Taiwan demonstrated decreasing consumption of pethidine from 2002 to 2007; however, an increased proportion of <b>prescriptions</b> in certain health care settings was observed. In addition, 10 % of the pethidine <b>prescriptions</b> were for cancer patients without operations. These cases need further evaluation for the determination of appropriate pethidine use...|$|R
