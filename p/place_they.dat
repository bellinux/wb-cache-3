5|$|A poor {{start to}} the 1966–67 season {{prevented}} another push for the title, and Leeds eventually finished in fourth <b>place.</b> <b>They</b> {{made it to the}} FA Cup semi-finals, before Chelsea knocked them out with a 1–0 win. In Europe they beat DWS (Netherlands), Valencia (Spain), Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Dinamo Zagreb (Yugoslavia); Zagreb won 2–0 at the Stadion Maksimir and held Leeds to a 0–0 draw at Elland Road to leave Leeds with another second-place finish.|$|E
5|$|By 1963 McNamara had {{convinced}} Kennedy that the Zeus {{was simply not}} worth deploying. The earlier concerns about cost and effectiveness, {{as well as new}} difficulties in terms of attack size and decoy problems, led McNamara to cancel the Zeus project on 5 January 1963. In its <b>place</b> <b>they</b> decided to continue work on Nike-X. Nike-X development was based in the existing Nike Zeus Project Office until their name was changed to Nike-X on 1 February 1964.|$|E

Bale apologized publicly and said he resolved his differences with Hurlbut, explaining that he sometimes has a problem with someone walking on set, and that when the incident took <b>place</b> <b>they</b> continued to work together for a number of hours that day.|$|E

5|$|Leeds {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1966–67 season, though despite winning just three of their opening eleven games they went on to finish in fourth <b>place.</b> <b>They</b> reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 to Chelsea at Villa Park. They reached the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Yugoslavian side GNK Dinamo Zagreb, but were unable to scout the opposition due to Syd Owen having his flight cancelled on him; Leeds lost 2–0 on aggregate and Revie was criticised for his negative tactics.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, {{the company}} {{launched}} Swarm, a companion app to Foursquare, that migrated the social networking and location sharing {{aspects of the}} service into a separate application. Swarm acts as a lifelogging tool for the user to keep {{a record of the}} <b>places</b> <b>they</b> have been, featuring statistics on the <b>places</b> <b>they</b> have been, and a powerful search capability to recall <b>places</b> <b>they</b> have visited. Swarm also lets the user share where they have been with their friends, and see where their friends have been. Swarm check-ins are rewarded with points, in the form of virtual coins, and friends can challenge each other in a weekly leaderboard. Checking in to different categories of venue also unlocks virtual stickers. Though {{it is not necessary to}} use both apps, Swarm works together with Foursquare to improve a user's recommendations - a user's Swarm check-ins help Foursquare understand the kinds of <b>places</b> <b>they</b> like to go.|$|R

Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating.

5|$|Over {{the years}} after her sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes have been put forward to raise Titanic from her resting <b>place.</b> <b>They</b> have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it inside a giant iceberg that would float back to the surface.

5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took <b>place.</b> <b>They</b> confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E

They took the lead on July 2, and held on to that lead throughout the rest of July and all of August.

5|$|Benfica began March with an away game in Braga. They lost 3–1 {{in their}} first league loss since December. They dropped to fourth place in the standings. On the {{following}} Saturday, Benfica visited Belenenses and lost {{for a second time}} in a row. A week later, Benfica received Paços de Ferreira at home. The match ended with a 3–2 win for the visitors and Benfica dropped to fifth <b>place.</b> <b>They</b> were now eleven points behind leader Boavista. In the last game of March, Benfica faced Campomaiorense on the road. With a 1–1 draw, the team avoided losing all of their matches in March. However, their need to get points was aggravated, especially if they wanted to qualify for the European competitions.|$|E

Chaoyong was boarded by Hongzhang, and the two cruisers took the diplomat to inspect the dredging of the port at Taku (now the Port of Tianjin).

5|$|Following their {{successive}} championships, Liverpool's fortunes declined {{as their}} side aged. Some {{of the players}} had begun their careers before the war; goalkeeper Scott {{had been in the}} side since 1912. The club began the 1923–24 season aiming to win three league titles in a row, but finished in twelfth <b>place.</b> <b>They</b> achieved fourth place the following season, which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War. Changes to the offside rule in the 1925–26 season resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of goals scored during matches. Liverpool contributed to this, with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United, but could only manage a seventh-place finish.|$|E

The following results were obtained: 1) The actual distances to <b>places</b> <b>they</b> cite are generally within 700 m, though the mental distance varied {{depending on the type of}} place and the area characteristics, such as the number of feature facilities in the area. 2) The mental direction to a place is affected by the location of the child's school with respect to his/her house. Children tended to name <b>places</b> <b>they</b> frequently visit. 3) The relationship between the mental distances and the mental directions revealed that children cite places in various directions near their houses, whereas the <b>places</b> <b>they</b> cite tend to be in the direction of their schools as the distance from their houses increases...|$|R
5|$|Gary Mills, who was {{starting}} {{his first full}} season as manager, signed 11 players before the summer transfer window closed.

Luton Town were then beaten 2–1 in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, which meant the club was promoted to League Two, returning into the Football League after an eight-year absence. Eight days beforehand, York won their first national knockout competition, with a 2–0 victory over Newport County at Wembley Stadium in the 2012 FA Trophy Final. They were knocked out of the 2011–12 FA Cup in the fourth qualifying round, after being beaten 2–1 away to Wrexham.|$|E

Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a <b>place</b> <b>they</b> could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship.
