We used Nocardia corallina B- 276 for the oxidative kinetic resolution of (±) - 4 -(chlorophenyl) <b>phenylmethanol,</b> 1. Two experimental methods were used: 1) Suspension of cells in a phosphate buffer solution and 2) Cells in the culture media, in a 3 -L bioreactor.

Trifluoroacetic anhydride induced dehydration of substituted 2 -(pivaloylaminomethyl) phenyl- and 2 (dimethylaminocarbonylmethyl) <b>phenylmethanols</b> gives the corresponding isoindolines in excellent yields. Lithiation of 2 - and 4 -substituted pyridines, namely N-(pyridinylmethyl) pivalamides, N'-(pyridinylmethyl) -N,N-dimethylureas and pyridinylmethyl tert-butylcarbamates, with two mole equivalents of f-BuLi in anhydrous THF at - 78 C takes place on the nitrogen and on the methylene group of the side-chain. The lithium reagents thus obtained react {{with a variety of}} electrophiles to give the corresponding side-chain substituted derivatives in high yields. While the lithiation and substitution of N-(pyridin- 3 -ylmethyl) pivalamide, N'-(pyridin- 3 -ylmethyl) -N,N-dimethylurea and pyridin- 3 - ylmethyl tert-butylcarbamate with two mole equivalents of alkyllithium in anhydrous THF at - 78 C takes place on the nitrogen and on the ortho-position or on the side-chain {{depending on the type of}} lithium reagent. Treatment of one of the ring substituted products with trifluoroacetic anhydride in dichloromethane under reflux conditions led to formation of the corresponding 1 H-pyrrolo 3, 4 -c pyridine. A convenient method for Knoevenagel condensation of aromatic aldehydes with active methylene compounds to synthesize arylidene compounds was developed using inexpensive and environmentally friendly reagents such as K 2 C 03.

The excess molar volumes were derived from the experimental data and were fitted with the Redlich-Kister equation to obtain their coefficients and standard deviations. The Grunberg-Nissan equation was used to correlate the viscosity data. Furthermore, kinematic viscosities were compared with those predicted by the UNIFAC-VISCO model.

In acidic solution, 1 (center dot+) and 2 (center dot+) display very low reactivities toward fragmentation, consistent with the presence of groups at Ce, (aryl and cyclopropyl) that after C-alpha-C-ss bond cleavage would produce relatively unstable carbon-centered radicals. In basic solution, 1 (center dot+) and 2 (center dot+) display oxygen acidity, undergoing -OH-induced deprotonation from the alpha-OH group, leading to the corresponding 1, 1 -diarylalkoxyl radicals 1 r(center dot) and 2 r(center dot), respectively, as directly observed by time resolved spectroscopy. The product distributions observed in the reactions of 1 (center dot+) and 2 (center dot+) under these conditions (cyclopropyl phenyl ketone, cyclopropyl(4 -methoxyphenyl) ketone, and 4 -methoxybenzophenone from 1 (center dot+); cyclopropyl(4 -methoxyphenyl) ketone and 4, 4 '-dimethoxybenzophenone from 2 (center dot+)) have been rationalized in terms of a water-induced competition between 0 -neophyl shift and C-cyclopropyl ss-scission in the intermediate 1, 1 -diarylalkoxyl radicals 1 r(center dot) and 2 r(center dot) ...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption {{of organic}} {{molecules}} at a surface of titanium dioxide (101) anatase is studied using quantum-chemical density functional theory. Anatase {{can be used}} in solar cells. For the clean anatase surface the band gap is so large that only UV-light can excite electrons. Different groups with conjugated systems are attached to obtain a more suitable band gap. Phenol was attached in different positions to a cluster of anatase and geometry optimized using the B 3 LYP-functional. The geometry that was energetically most favorable was used to put in <b>phenylmethanol,</b> phenylethanol, naphthol, 2 -phenanthrol, 1 -pyrol and 2 -perylol. To give a more realistic model of phenol at anatase, a study of a two- dimensional periodic anatase surface was also made. Molecular orbitals were calculated to study the overlap between HOMO and LUMO orbitals. The calculation shows that phenol will remain as a molecule and will not dissociate. The band gap gets smaller when molecules are attached at the cluster and with 2 -perylol it reaches the energy of visible light. The molecular orbitals for HOMO, LUMO and LUMO of the adsorbed molecule were investigated. HOMO was localized at the molecule, LUMO at the cluster and LUMO of the adsorbed molecule move closer to the energy of LUMO when the number of rings increases...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} background for this thesis {{is given in}} Chapter 1. It covers the field of supramolecular chemistry including the phenomena of self-assembly, the history and synthesis of dendrimers, the concept of coordination chemistry and the chemistry of iridium, the history and principles of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), and the theory and applications of solid state lighting, especially of the light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs). The background chapter {{is followed by a}} short introduction to the materials, methods, and instruments used in this thesis (Chapter 2). In the following two chapters, the syntheses of achiral and chiral Fréchet dendrimers (Chapter 3) and the subsequent reactions to the achiral and chiral Fréchet dendronised 2, 2 '-bipyridine ligands (Chapter 4) are described. Additionally, for most of the compounds presented in these chapters, the monolayer behaviour on graphite was studied with STM. For example, for 3, 5 -bis(dodecyloxy) <b>phenylmethanol,</b> a very highly resolved image could be detected and detailed considerations of the adopted monolayer could be performed. Chirality was introduced into the molecules for the purpose of altering the preference for a particular conformation, as it has been shown before by L. Scherer[1] that these type of ligands tend to adopt different conformations when adsorbed on graphite. Unfortunately, the measurements of the chiral ligands did not reveal any significant information. Therefore, no detailed discussion of the conformations in the monolayer could be given. Nevertheless, in a monolayer of the diastereomeric mixture of 4, 4 '-bis(1 -(3, 5 -bis(dodecyloxy) phenyl) propoxy) - 2, 2 '-bipyridine, two clearly differing patterns could be observed which were attributed to different stereoisomers. Chapter 5 deals with the synthesis of dendrons decorated with perfluorinated alkyl chains and their use in the functionalisation of 2, 2 '-bipyridine ligands. Adsorbed monolayers on graphite of such a ligand were studied with STM. Due to a, apparently, lower propensity to establish monolayers, only few examples of visualised patterns could be observed. The following three chapters cover the synthesis and STM-visualisation of 2, 2 '-bipyridine-based ligands (Chapter 6), their iridium(III) complexes (Chapter 7), and the use thereof in LEEC devices (Chapter 8). In Chapter 6, simple and more advanced ligands were synthesised and characterised. In the case of the ligands which were functionalised with dendrons presented in Chapter 2, STM studies of monolayers on graphite are discussed. Chapter 7 presents the synthesis and characterisation of iridium(III) complexes obtained from ligands described in the previous chapter. The characterisation comprises measurements of NMR, MS, UV-Vis, photoluminescence, electrochemistry, and, where single crystals could be obtained, their solid state structures. For the complexes bearing dendronised ligands, STM measurements were performed which revealed highly resolved patterns. In the last chapter (Chapter 8), results from LEEC devices fabricated with complexes described in Chapter 7 are shown. The device preparation and the measurement of their characteristics were performed by the group of H. Bolink who kindly allowed the publication of their results in this thesis. It could be shown that for all complexes exhibiting an intramolecular π-π stacking, the stability of their devices was increased dramatically. This thesis has brought together the realms of chemical design with, firstly, studies of the physical behaviour of the envisioned molecules on the surface and, secondly, systematic structural optimisation of iridium(III) complexes for the application in solid state lighting. With the work presented in this thesis, a major breakthrough for long-lived LEECs has been achieved allowing lifetimes of several thousands of hours, an increase of several orders of magnitude compared to the best-performing devices reported to date (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 8) ...|$|E
