The evidence points to an active type of oxidation under hydrothermal conditions, i. e. there are no <b>primary</b> <b>condensed</b> reaction products.

The base of the Thanetian Stage at Pegwell Bay lies above {{the base of the}} Alisocysta margarita (Area) biozone; the overlying type-Thanetian is assigned to the Apectodinium hyperacanthum (Ahy) and Apectodinium augustum (Aau) biozones. The base of the Ypresian succession is drawn {{at the base of the}} Harwich Formation at Lower Upnor corresponding to the base of the Glaphyrocysta ordinata (Gor) biozone. The Wetzeliella astra (Was) biozone is characteristic of the lower London Clay Formation at Herne Bay. Five Thanetian and three Ypresian sequences are identified through consideration of dinoflagellate cyst palaeoecology and sedimentological evidence. Deepening and shallowing trends enable transgressive and highstand systems tracts to be identified.

40|$|Zinc (Zn) {{recovery}} {{rate and the}} properties of Zn particles obtained by pyrolysis of alkaline and Zn-C battery waste were studied at a reaction temperature of 950 degrees C for 60 min residence time using various N- 2 (g) flow rate (0. 5 - 3. 014 min) without using any additive. The battery black mass was characterized {{with respect to the}} properties of waste battery particles, and chemical content. The thermodynamics of the pyrolysis process was studied using the HSC Chemistry 5. 11 software. A carbothermic reduction reaction of the washed battery black mass by Milli-Q water takes place at choosen temperature and makes it possible to produce fine Zn particles by a rapid condensation following the evaporation of zinc from the pyrolysis batch. The amount of Zn that can be separated from the black mass slightly increases at higher N- 2 (g) flow rates than 0. 5 L/min and stabilizes by controlling the gas flow. Zn recovery of 80 % was achieved at 950 degrees C and 60 min residence time using 1. 0 L/min and higher flow rates by pyrolysis of the washed battery black mass. The pyrolysis residue was shown to be mainly composes of MnO and Mn 2 O 3 with traces of impurities. The particle size of the produced Zn particle decreased from 874 nm to 534 nm with increasing flow rate and those particles are formed by the aggregation of <b>primary</b> <b>condensed</b> particles with nano-range sizes. The morphology of the zinc particles also changes from hexagonal shape to spherical morphology by increasing gas flow rate...|$|R

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{passive solar}} still with separate condenser {{has been studied}} theoretically and experimentally. The system has one basin in the evaporation chamber and two basins (middle and upper) in the condenser chamber, with a glass cover over the evaporator basin and an opaque condensing cover over the upper basin. The evaporator, middle and upper basins form the primary, secondary and tertiary effects respectively. The top part of the condensing cover is shielded from solar radiation and heat. Water vapor from the <b>primary</b> effect <b>condenses</b> under the glass cover while the remainder of it flows into the condenser, by purging and diffusion, and condenses under the liner of the middle basin. Outdoor tests of the present solar still and a conventional system were conducted at the University of Strathclyde. The two systems are also simulated under the same meteorological conditions. It is found that the solar shield effectively keeps the condenser cover relatively cool. Under favorable weather conditions the present solar still produced up to 34 % more distillate than the conventional type. Experimental and estimated results are in close conformity.

40|$|Understanding the {{formation}} of natural particles in the atmosphere, and their growth to radiatively active sizes, is critical to quantifying the role of anthropogenic emissions on cloud formation, climate change and public health. Only a few regions {{have been identified as}} strong natural sources of aerosols in the boundary layer: in particular, the coastal region seems to be the strongest natural source of these new particles. The PARFORCE program was designed to elucidate and understand the underlying processes leading to observed coastal nucleation and to quantify the factors promoting coastal nucleation. Initial results indicate that nucleation rates in the coastal environment are of the order of 107 cm- 3 s- 1 and can be explained by ternary nucleation of sulphuric acid, water vapor and ammonia; however, growth to detectable sizes can only be explained by additional condensation of, probably, organic vapor-otherwise these new stable embryos are lost due to coagulation.

40|$|AbstractStructural analogs of {{adenosine}} 5 ′-acylphosphates, {{which are}} intermediates {{of the reaction}} catalysed by acyl-CoA synthetases, were synthesized by <b>condensing</b> <b>primary</b> alcohols with AMP to examine the inhibitory effects on the lignoceroyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activities. Hexadecyl, octadecyl, eicosyl, docosyl and tetracosyl esters of AMP were remarkably potent inhibitors of the lignoceroyl-CoA formation. On the other hand, the eicosyl, docosyl or tetracosyl esters of AMP did not behave as significant inhibitors of the palmitoyl-CoA formation at the concentration at which the two other shorter chain analogs were effective. Namely, these longer alkyl esters of AMP have selective inhibitory effects on the lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activity. The Ki value of adenosine 5 ′-tetracosylphosphate, the most potent inhibitor, was about one tenth lower than the Km value for the substrate lignoceric acid.

40|$|A {{myriad of}} {{different}} {{volatile organic compounds}} is emitted to the atmosphere through biogenic and anthropogenic pathways. In the atmosphere, they get oxidised forming products of lower volatility, which may then condense {{and contribute to the}} formation and growth of aerosol particles. Extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOC) is a group of highly oxidised molecules that were recently observed in oxidation of biogenically emitted molecules, monoterpenes. It has been shown that ELVOCs from monoterpene oxidation in the atmosphere explain most of the aerosol growth rates in the boreal forest. In this work, I investigate the ELVOC formation from aromatic compounds, which are primarily emitted from anthropogenic sources. This thesis focuses on oxidation of benzene, a simplest aromatic molecule, although ELVOCs forming from toluene, naphthalene and phenol are also presented. The experimental work with all compounds, except phenol, was conducted in a flow tube at the Universtity of Helsinki, Finland, while in-depth study of benzene was performed in the chamber at Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Germany. The oxidation products were detected using nitrate-based scheme chemical ionisation atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometer (CI-APi-TOF). It was found that all four molecules in the reaction with a hydroxyl radical produced ELVOC. In case of benzene, the detected ELVOC monomers had maximum of 11 oxygen atoms, while dimers had up to 18. Toluene and naphthalene oxidation gained ELVOC monomers with maximum 10 oxygen atoms. The possibility of multiple reactions with the hydroxyl radical, however, could not be eliminated as the products of aromatic oxidation usually have higher reaction rate coefficients than their parent molecule. The average ELVOC molar yield in benzene oxidation was 3. 7 %, while in phenol case it was 1. 5 %, which suggested that primary OH attack and further autoxidation is an important pathway for ELVOC formation in oxidation of benzene. The study of the ELVOC – aerosol particle interactions in the chamber revealed that ELVOCs from aromatic precursors behave similarly to the ELVOCs formed from monoterpenes, rapidly condensing on the introduced aerosol particles. The organic fraction of the aerosols had similar O:C ratio to the total gas-phase ELVOC, indicating that ELVOCs were <b>primary</b> <b>condensing</b> species. The decreasing O:C ratio of aerosol phase with higher aerosol loading confirmed that ELVOCs are dominating aerosol growth at low aerosol loading. In this thesis, also a review of known chemical pathways of benzene oxidation is presented and some further steps towards ELVOC formation are suggested. Benzene oxidation pathways may {{serve as a model for}} studying the oxidation of other aromatic molecules. Substituted aromatic molecules are more reactive with the hydroxyl radical and are likely to yield more ELVOCs, which may be dominant factor in the aerosol growth in urban and industrialised areas.

40|$|Abstract—Nuclear {{power plant}} has a {{provision}} of two independent sources {{of power for}} its in-plant auxiliary loads required for the operation of plant. These loads include high inertia, large capacity motors such as <b>primary</b> coolant pump-motor, <b>condenser</b> cooling water pumps; boiler feed pumps, condensate extraction pumps etc. Two sources of power are meant for increased reliability of power supply to the plant. One of these feed two buses through Unit Transformer (UT) taking its incoming supply from either the generator or Grid while the rest two buses are supplied directly from the grid through Start-Up Transformer (SUT). In case, {{one of these two}} supplies fails, the buses are restored through the other healthy source by closing the tie circuit breakers. This is termed as Automatic Load Transfer (ALT). In this paper the existing set up for load transfer is analyzed and the optimal settings are prescribed for the safe and successful load transfer based on experience.

40|$|The {{centromere}} is a specialised chromosomal {{structure that}} regulates faithful chromosome segregation during cell division, as it dictates {{the site of}} assembly of the kinetochore, a critical structure that mediates binding of chromosomes to the spindle, monitors bipolar attachment and pulls chromosomes to the poles during anaphase. Identified {{more than a century}} ago as the <b>primary</b> constriction of <b>condensed</b> metaphase chromosomes, the centromere remained elusive to molecular characterisation for many years owed to its unusual enrichment in highly repetitive satellite DNA sequences, except in budding yeast. In the last decade, our understanding of centromere structure, organisation and function has increased tremendously. Nowadays, we know that centromere identity is determined epigenetically by the formation of a unique type of chromatin, which is characterised by the presence of the centromere-specific histone H 3 variant CenH 3, originally called CENP-A, which replaces canonical histone H 3 at centromeres. CenH 3 -chromatin constitutes the physical and functional foundation for kinetochore assembly. This review explores recent studies addressing the structural and functional characterisation of CenH 3 -chromatin, its assembly and propagation during mitosis, and its contribution to kinetochore assembly...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{systems are}} {{frequently}} modeled as sets of points in space, each representing {{the position of}} an atom, molecule, or mesoscale particle. As many properties of such systems depend on the underlying ordering of their constituent particles, understanding that structure is a <b>primary</b> objective of <b>condensed</b> matter research. Although perfect crystals are fully described {{by a set of}} translation and basis vectors, real-world materials are never perfect, as thermal vibrations and defects introduce significant deviation from ideal order. Meanwhile, liquids and glasses present yet more complexity. A complete understanding of structure thus remains a central, open problem. Here we propose a unified mathematical framework, based on the topology of the Voronoi cell of a particle, for classifying local structure in ordered and disordered systems that is powerful and practical. We explain the underlying reason why this topological description of local structure is better suited for structural analysis than continuous descriptions. We demonstrate the connection of this approach to the behavior of physical systems and explore how crystalline structure is compromised at elevated temperatures. We also illustrate potential applications to identifying defects in plastically deformed polycrystals at high temperatures, automating analysis of complex structures, and characterizing general disordered systems.

40|$|The centromere, {{visible as}} the <b>primary</b> {{constriction}} of <b>condensed</b> metaphase chromosomes, is a defined chromosomal locus essential for genome stability. It mediates transient assembly of a multi-protein complex, the kinetochore, which enables interaction with spindle fibers and thus faithful segregation {{of the genetic}} information during nuclear divisions. Centromeric DNA varies in extent and sequence composition among organisms, but a common feature of almost all active eukaryotic centromeres {{is the presence of}} the centromeric histone H 3 variant cenH 3 (a. k. a. CENP-A). These typical centromere features apply to most studied species. However, a number of species display atypical centromeres, such as holocentromeres (centromere extension along almost the entire chromatid length) or neocentromeres (ectopic centromere activity). In this review, we provide an overview of different atypical centromere types found in plants including holocentromeres, de novo formed centromeres and terminal neocentromeres as well as di-, tri- and metapolycentromeres (more than one centromere per chromosomes). We discuss their specific and common features and compare them to centromere types found in other eukaryotic species. We also highlight new insights into centromere biology gained in plants with atypical centromeres such as distinct mechanisms to define a holocentromere, specific adaptations in species with holocentromeres during meiosis or various scenarios leading to neocentromere formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of pH, cations, F- and temperature on the aggregation, gelation and ageing of aqueous silica gels {{has been investigated}} using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). At both low and intermediate pH (pH = 4 and 6 - 8, respectively), fractal aggregates are formed during gelation from silicic monomers or small oligomers. The fractal dimensionality is 2. 20 (5), to be expected for reaction-limited cluster-cluster aggregates. During ageing silicic ions dissolve from the more soluble peripheral <b>primary</b> particles and <b>condense</b> in the crevices of {{the core of the}} aggregates. This process results in an increase {{in the size of the}} scattering primary particles and in a decrease in the fractal dimensionality of the silica aggregates from D = 2. 25 to D = 2. 0 or D = 1. 85. The ageing processes are strongly enhanced by a slight increase in the pH of the solution, addition of fluorine anions and a rise in temperature. The aged silica gel is constructed of an ensemble of densified aggregates of which the density variation within the aggregates is larger than that of the freshly prepared aggregates. The primary particles of which the aggregates are built grow during ageing from molecular size to dense particles in the nanometer range, the ultimate radius depending on the type and duration of the ageing proces...|$|R

Tank capacity {{is based on a}} requirement to absorb the pressurizer discharge during a specified step load decrease. The review of the pressurizer relief tank, as described in the applicant's Safety Analysis Report (SAR), includes the tank, the piping connections from the tank to the pressurizer relief and safety valves, the tank spray system and associated piping, the nitrogen supply piping, and piping leaving the tank to the cover gas analyzer and to the reactor coolant drain tank. The pressurizer relief tank system is nonsafety related; the review is primarily directed toward assuring that its operation is consistent with transient analyses of related systems and that failure or malfunction of the system could not adversely affect essential systems or compo-nents in accordance with applicable criteria.

40|$|In-situ {{airborne}} {{measurements of}} trace gases, aerosol size distributions, chemistry and optical properties were conducted over Mexico and the Eastern North Pacific during MILAGRO and INTEX-B. Heterogeneous reactions between secondary aerosol precursor gases and mineral dust during long-range transport lead to irreversible sequestration of sulfur and nitrogen compounds in the supermicrometer particulate size range. Simultaneous measurements of aerosol size distributions and weak-acid soluble calcium {{result in an}} estimate of 11 wt% of CaCO 3 for Asian dust. During transport across the North Pacific, 10 – 30 % of the CaCO 3 is converted to CaSO 4 or Ca(NO 3 ) 2 through reactions with trace gases. The 11 -year record from the Mauna Loa Observatory confirm these findings, indicating that, on average, 16 % of the CaCO 3 has reacted to form CaSO 4 and 14 % has reacted to form Ca(NO 3 ) 2 . Heterogeneous reactions resulting in ~ 3 % increase in dust solubility is shown to have an insignificant effect on their optical properties compared to their variability in-situ. However, competition between supermicrometer dust and submicrometer <b>primary</b> aerosol for <b>condensing</b> secondary aerosol species led to a 25 % smaller number median diameter for the accumulation mode aerosol. A 10 – 25 % reduction of accumulation mode number median diameter results in a 30 – 70 % reduction in submicrometer light scattering at relative humidities in the 80 – 95 % range. At 80 % RH submicrometer light scattering is only reduced ~ 3 % due to a higher mass fraction of hydrophobic refractory components in the dust-affected accumulation mode aerosol. Thus reducing the geometric mean diameter of the submicrometer aerosol has a much larger effect on aerosol optics than changes to the hygroscopic:hydrophobic mass fractions of the aerosol. In the presence of dust, nitric acid concentrations are reduced to &lt; 50 % of total nitrate (nitric acid plus particulate nitrate). NOy as a fraction of total nitrogen (NOy plus particulate nitrate), is reduced from &gt; 85 % to 60 – 80 % {{in the presence of}} dust. These observations support previous model studies which predict irreversible sequestration of reactive nitrogen species through heterogeneous reactions with mineral dust during long-range transport...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Epigenetic {{control is}} {{essential}} for maintenance of tissue hierarchy and correct differentiation. In cancer, this hierarchical structure is altered and epigenetic control deregulated, but {{the relationship between these}} two phenomena is still unclear. CD 133 is a marker for adult stem cells in various tissues and tumour types. Stem cell specificity is maintained by tight regulation of CD 133 expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. In this study we investigated the role of epigenetic regulation of CD 133 in epithelial differentiation and cancer. Methods DNA methylation analysis of the CD 133 promoter was done by pyrosequencing and methylation specific PCR; qRT-PCR was used to measure CD 133 expression and chromatin structure was determined by ChIP. Cells were treated with DNA demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors. All the experiments were carried out in both cell lines and primary samples. Results We found that CD 133 expression is repressed by DNA methylation in the majority of prostate epithelial cell lines examined, where the promoter is heavily CpG hypermethylated, whereas in primary prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia, low levels of DNA methylation, accompanied by low levels of mRNA, were found. Moreover, differential methylation of CD 133 was absent from both benign or malignant CD 133 + /α 2 β 1 integrin hi prostate (stem) cells, when compared to CD 133 - /α 2 β 1 integrin hi (transit amplifying) cells or CD 133 - /α 2 β 1 integrin low (basal committed) cells, selected from <b>primary</b> epithelial cultures. <b>Condensed</b> chromatin was associated with CD 133 downregulation in all of the cell lines, and treatment with HDAC inhibitors resulted in CD 133 re-expression in both cell lines and primary samples. Conclusions CD 133 is tightly regulated by DNA methylation only in cell lines, where promoter methylation and gene expression inversely correlate. This highlights the crucial choice of cell model systems when studying epigenetic control in cancer biology and stem cell biology. Significantly, in both benign and malignant prostate primary tissues, regulation of CD 133 is independent of DNA methylation, but is under the dynamic control of chromatin condensation. This indicates that CD 133 expression is not altered in prostate cancer and it is consistent with an important role for CD 133 in the maintenance of the hierarchical cell differentiation patterns in cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{works from}} the {{conceptual}} premise that the parent-child relation is constitutive of both subjectivity and narrative form in the Victorian novel: {{the role of the}} orphan, the dislocation of the family and the drive to reconstitute it, are <b>primary</b> concerns and <b>condense</b> complex issues of narrative structure, genealogical failure, and the problematisation of parental roles. There have been valuable feminist readings of specific family positions in the Victorian novel, such as ‘the mother’ or ‘the daughter’, but there is still a lack of analyses which locate narrative and thematic concerns in the dynamic interplay between parental and childhood desires: the relation between two or more subjects. I look at four novels in detail: Charles Dickens’ Dombey and Son and Little Dorrit, and Wilkie Collins’ No Name and Armadale. The thesis shows how parent-child relationships are mediated through gendered conflicts: it is, in fact, almost impossible to isolate singular relationships for analysis; the family is a gestalt, becoming greater {{than the sum of its}} parts. Throughout the novels repudiated family members, or strange family ‘doubles’, become the focus for the movement of the plot: the way in which fantasy operates across a family group, rather than as an intrasubjective phenomenon, is a key concern. The analyses of the literary texts will demonstrate the processes of transformation that familial desires and fantasies undergo in the characters and in the novels themselves. The concept of generational inheritance, central to the aesthetics and psychologies of the Victorian novels considered here, motivated my turn to psychoanalytic theory. I do not limit my use of psychoanalysis to one model, instead using a dialogical approach dictated by the novels themselves; I incorporate aspects of Jean Laplanche’s theories of ‘general seduction’, in addition to Sigmund Freud’s own writings and later psychoanalytic ideas of inheritance and influence. The ‘family’ is the structuring force for the four novels under consideration. Without always attempting to create a ‘realistic’ psychology of character, Dickens creates competing worlds of personal, familial and social fantasy. The family is a site of anxiety, an anxiety which is not wholly contained, or controlled, by the narrative. Collins likewise engages with the question of inheritance, but, increasingly throughout his writings, he prioritised the emergence of female agency in the wake of a persecutory paternal narrative.

30|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing technologies has boosted {{oil and gas}} production from tight reservoirs in the last decade. Although commercial development is enabled by the advanced technologies, estimated primary recovery factors remain to be as low as 5 %– 15 %, owing to the ultra-low permeability (Hoffman 2012). Currently, a liquid-rich tight gas reservoir (e.g., Montney Formation) has attracted interest (Cui et al. 2013; Rivard et al. 2014). In a gas condensate reservoir, reservoir fluids appear as gas phase under initial conditions. With the depressurization of the reservoir during the <b>primary</b> production, liquid <b>condenses</b> from the gas phase and builds up once the in situ reservoir pressure drops below the dew-point pressure, especially around the fractures and the well bottom hole. The condensate liquid will not flow until a critical condensate saturation is achieved. It is generally accepted that three zones are present in the formation from the wellbore to the reservoir boundary: (1) mobile gas and mobile condensate region near the wellbore, (2) transition zone including mobile gas and immobile oil, and (3) gas phase zone without condensate dropout (Penuela and Civan 2000). The trapped condensate typically cannot flow, leaving a large amount of high-quality oil unproduced in the reservoir. Nevertheless, gas production will decrease as the presence of condensate restricts the gas flow toward the wellbore (Hinchman and Barree 1985; Moses and Donohoe 1987; Vo et al. 1989; Li and Firoozabadi 2000; Pope et al. 2000). Meanwhile, the condensate blockage problem is exacerbated significantly by the ultra-low reservoir permeability in a tight gas condensate reservoir, and the gas production rate could decrease by 50 %– 80 % within the first 2  years (Ayyalasomayajula et al. 2005). Thus, it is important to investigate the potential performance of the EGR methods to alleviate condensate blockage and further increase the recovery factor in tight gas condensate reservoirs. Extensive study has been performed to maintain the reservoir pressure above the dew-point pressure in conventional gas condensate reservoirs, using techniques such as water injection (Matthews et al. 1988), lean gas injection (Smith and Yarborough 1968; Abel et al. 1970; Sigmund and Cameron 1977; Abasov et al. 2000), CO 2 injection (Goricnik et al. 1995; Narinesingh and Alexander 2014) and N 2 injection (Aziz 1983; Abdulwahab and Belhaj 2010; Sadooni and Zonnouri 2015). Usually, two schemes of fluid injection are employed for pressure maintenance in a condensate reservoir. One is full pressure maintenance where the fluid is continuously injected into the reservoir, while at the same time, the condensate is produced. The other is the partial pressure maintenance where gas is injected into the reservoir after the primary depletion to slow pressure decline and re-vaporize the condensate (Abel et al. 1970; Meng and Sheng 2016). Currently, researchers mainly rely on laboratory studies or reservoir simulations to investigate the performance of EGR methods in unconventional tight reservoirs {{due to the lack of}} field test data. Yu et al. (2014) studied the efficiency of CO 2 injection to enhance the gas recovery in a shale gas reservoir, considering the adsorption of CO 2 in the shales with a high total organic content. An experimental design method was employed to search for the best operational scenario for the CO 2 injection. Sheng (2015 a, b) investigated the huff-n-puff performance of the produced gas in a shale gas condensate reservoir via a simplified simulation model containing only one fracture stage. They concluded that huff-n-puff methane injection is an effective option to enhance the gas and oil recovery for a shale gas reservoir with a permeability of 100  nD (i.e., 0.0001  mD). Haghshenas et al. (2017) simulated CO 2 huff-n-puff in a liquid-rich Canadian unconventional reservoir accounting for the fluid adsorption and the compositional heterogeneity. CO 2 huff-n-puff results were only positive for certain operating conditions, and additional sensitivity study to EGR operations was needed. The mechanism and feasibility of the EGR is still not very clear, and it is necessary to investigate the key factors affecting the effectiveness in the tight gas condensate reservoir.|$|R
