5|$|In a {{referendum}} {{called by the}} National Council, and held {{on the same day}} as {{the second round of the}} presidential election, the electorate voted to overturn a law <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law. After both election and referendum results were announced, the Prime Minister Janez Janša announced that he might resign, following what he perceived to be a heavy defeat for the Government. The Government later won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Peterle conceded immediately. In {{his first}} statements, Peterle said his defeat was a {{vote against the}} ruling Janša government, {{and that he had}} {{expected}} a better result.

Türk won in all eight electoral units, with Peterle narrowly winning in only four of 88 electoral districts. Together with {{the second round of the}} election, a referendum on a law <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company was held as well. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law.|$|E

He was chosen to represent Nelson County at the constitutional convention held at Frankfort, Kentucky in 1799 to draft the second Kentucky Constitution. As a delegate, he advocated the supremacy of the legislative branch over the executive and judicial branches, which he believed provided ordinary citizens {{a greater role in}} state government. The constitution adopted by the convention abolished the use of electors to choose the governor and state senators, <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> direct election of these officers instead.|$|E

5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> needs of the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well {{after the end of}} the war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E

The same year Foreign Policy magazine listed Bezmer Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the USAF due to its proximity to the Middle East. A total of 756 troops are deployed abroad as part of various UN and NATO missions.

5|$|In 1992, the Croat-Bosniak {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, just as each was {{fighting with the}} Bosnian Serbs. The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops {{on one side and}} the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> creation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, for mainly {{patriotic}} reasons, the Australian Natives' Association helped establish the Federation League, a society {{dedicated to the}} creation of a federal nation. Following a series of addresses by the future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border. One of these towns, Corowa, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, Dr John Quick, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to pass an act <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal constitution. This has been seen as the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on 1 January 1901.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|The new Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock, {{launched}} {{a crackdown on}} communist and leftist groups, imprisoning many trade union leaders and several pro-communist members of the PAP under the Internal Security Act. The British government approved of Lim's tough stance against communist agitators, and when {{a new round of}} talks was held beginning in March 1957, they agreed to grant complete internal self-government. A State of Singapore would be created, with its own citizenship. The Legislative Assembly would be expanded to fifty-one members, entirely chosen by popular election, and the Prime Minister and cabinet would control all aspects of government except defense and foreign affairs. The governorship was replaced by a Yang di-Pertuan Negara or head of state. In August 1958, the State of Singapore Act was passed in the United Kingdom Parliament <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the State of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The period {{also saw}} the rise of piracy across the Eastern Mediterranean. Pirate {{activity}} was high in the Aegean, while pirate captains frequently offering themselves as mercenaries to {{one or the other}} of the region's powers, <b>providing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> latter a quick and cheap way of raising a fleet for particular expeditions, without the costs of a standing navy. Thus a Byzantine fleet of 66 vessels sent by Isaac II to recapture Cyprus from Isaac Komnenos was destroyed by the pirate Margaritus of Brindisi, who was in the employ of the Normans of Sicily. The depredations of the pirates, especially the Genoese captain Kaphoures, described by Niketas Choniates and his brother, the Metropolitan of Athens Michael Choniates, finally forced the Angeloi to action. The fleet tax was once again levied from the coastal regions and a navy of 30 ships was equipped, which was entrusted to the Calabrian pirate Steiriones. Despite scoring a few early successes, Steiriones' fleet was destroyed in a surprise attack by Kaphoures off Sestos. A second fleet, augmented by Pisan vessels and again commanded by Steiriones, was finally able to defeat Kaphoures and end his raids.|$|E

5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club.
