50|$|Horniman's Tea is a {{brand of}} tea {{currently}} owned by Douwe Egberts. The original tea trading and blending business 'Horniman's Tea Company' was founded in 1826 in Newport, Isle of Wight, by trader John Horniman. In 1852 he moved the company to London {{to be closer to}} the bonded warehouses of London Docks, then the biggest tea trading port in the world. Until 1826, only loose leaf teas had been sold, allowing unscrupulous traders to increase profits by adding other items such as hedge clippings or dust. Horniman revolutionised the tea trade by using mechanical devices to speed the process of filling <b>pre-sealed</b> packages, thereby reducing his cost of production and hence improving the quality for the end customer. This caused some consternation amongst his competitors, but by 1891 Horniman's was the largest tea trading business in the world. Friedrich Nietzsche mentioned in private correspondence that it was his favorite tea.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{referred}} to as drywall taping mud, joint compound is the primary material used in the drywall industry by a tradesperson, or applicator, called a [...] "drywall mechanic," [...] "taper," [...] or [...] "drywall taper." [...] A similar compound is used in various ways as a sprayed-on textural finishing for gypsum panel walls and ceilings that have been <b>pre-sealed</b> and coated with joint compound. The flexibility and plastic qualities of joint compound make it a very versatile material both as sealer or finishing coat for wall surfaces, and also in decorative applications that range from machine sprayed texturing to hand-trowelled or even hand-crafted and sculptural finishes. In North America the application of joint mud and drywall tape sealer and trowelled joint compound on gypsum panels is a standard construction technique for painted wall and ceiling surfaces. Until more recently in North America, and through the world, several different plasters such as veneer plaster and [...] "plaster of Paris" [...] {{have been used in}} a similar ways to joint compounds as fillers or for decorative purposes since ancient times, and the actual make up and working properties of these compounds is much similar. Modern ready-mixes or powder and water mixes are available {{in a wide range of}} styles from slow-drying to quick-drying to suit specific demands for use by contractors or decorators.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Air {{inflated}} cushion using <b>pre-sealed</b> two-layer plastic films forms air filled structural cushion when {{compressed air}} is charged to <b>pre-sealed</b> airtight chambers during packaging operation. The plastic films {{are made by}} co-extrusion of polyethylene/polyamide/polyethylene (PE/PA/PE) to keep required strength, permeability of the cushioning materials and easy production of the cushion. The air filled cushion structure is designed into column chambers with five different selective widths which form five different–cushion thick-ness when regulated compressed air is charged into the chambers using controlled pressure gauge during packaging performance. Uniquely designed charge port to each chamber provides individual chamber {{with the ability to}} work independently, hence ensures the protective function of packaging and allows the air cush-ions to be easily manipulated to a given product to be packaged. Static cushioning performance tests to air filled cushion materials at desirable air pressures showed that minimum cushion factor was about 4, and ap-peared at compressive strain of the materials from 55 - 80 %. Dynamic impact to the samples with dimension of 180 by 180 cm at drop height of 76 cm demonstrates relationship between impact mass and acceleration levels, indicating the suitability of the materials {{for a wide range of}} packaging application to electronic products and devices. Overall packaging properties of the material relating to co-extruded film strength, permeability, seal-ing strength of the plastic films were discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{correlation}} {{has been}} determined between die attach cure processes, <b>pre-seal</b> bake processes and sealed package moisture content after high temperature stress. While <b>pre-seal</b> bake times may be reduced to 4 hours and resisdual gas analysis, RGA, through mass spectroscopy shows a dry package after assembly, << 0. 5 percent of moisture, results after a high temperature bake can be markedly different. A part with a 4 hour <b>pre-seal</b> bake will show up to 3. 0 percent of moisture content after 24 hours at 175 °C, after a 48 hour <b>pre-seal</b> bake it will only show 0. 2 percent moisture. With the decomposition of the epoxy other gases are produced besides water such as methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons any and {{all of which can}} cause corrosion or create charged particles in the package, changing device performance characteristics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the Si-glass anodic bonding process to fill micro Cs vapor cells with a buffer gas (Ar or Ne) at a {{controlled}} pressure (up to 20 kPa), {{which is one of}} the technological key steps to fabricate Cs vapor cells for miniature atomic clocks. In the atmosphere of these gases, the applicable bonding voltage was not high enough to achieve strong bonding because of the electrical breakdown caused by ionization of the gas. To improve the bonding quality, an original two-step anodic bonding method was proposed. The first step of the anodic bonding. which intends to <b>pre-seal</b> the gas in microcells, is carried out in the presence of a buffer gas by applying a voltage lower than the breakdown voltage. Subsequently, the second bonding is performed in air at sufficiently high voltages to improve the sealing quality. By employing optical spectroscopy, it was demonstrated that the cells maintain the buffer gas at an appropriate pressure for atomic clock operation. The accelerated aging tests show that Cs vapor as well as the buffer gas remained in the cells without any significant change in the pressure, which allow us to estimate the lifetime of the cells to be at least 3 years. Further CPT experiments revealed that the buffer-gas pressure change is less than 6. 13 x 10 (- 4) kPa throughout the aging test at 125 degrees C for more than 3 weeks. These results show that these microcells are appropriate for applications to atomic frequency references...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{work with}} {{different types of}} low temperature plasmas and their use in microbiological applications. Herein is described the development and results from a novel system for decontamination of packaged produce using a dielectric barrier discharge. It also describes the results of growth by pulsed laser deposition of nominally undoped and doped zinc oxide thin films at low temperature on plastic substrates. This work was carried out to develop transparent conducting electrodes {{for the growth of}} electroactive biofilms for microbial fuel cells. The system described herein utilises a floating high voltage (± 15 kV) that sustains an atmospheric plasma in a plastic bag between parallel plate electrodes. This is characterised using current, voltage and charge measurement and also emission spectroscopy over electrode separations from 30 to 100 mm. Results are analysed to unravel physical processes present in this plasma for optimisation as a method of food decontamination. Plasma parameters are measured by the interpretation of electrical measurements by the “capacitor-in-series” model. The power consumed by the discharge and the reduced field strength decrease quadratically from 12. 0 W to 4. 5 W and linearly from 140 Td to 50 Td, respectively, in this range. Spectroscopy reveals the presence of molecular nitrogen, oxygen, NO, OH and helium. Temperature estimates are made by comparing intensity calibrated spectra with plots generated by the SPECAIR program. At 40 mm, this comparison yielded electron, vibrational and translational (gas) temperatures of (4980 ± 100) K, (2700 ± 200) K and (300 ± 100) K, respectively. In conjunction with colleagues from the DIT School of Food Science and Environmental Health, the bacterial inactivation properties of the system were examined. A 1. 5 log reduction in bacterial populations was achieved through indirect exposure to the plasma over a 5 minute treatment. This work also presents the results of characterisation of zinc oxide and ZnO:Al (2 %) thin films deposited at pressures of 1 to 300 mTorr in oxygen using several investigative techniques (AFM, XRD, contact profilometry, Van der Pauw and water contact angle). These investigate the effects of growth parameters on physical and electrical properties of thin films grown on amorphous substrates at low temperatures as a function of growth pressure, thickness and target doping. Films grown at 5, 000 to 20, 000 shots vary in thickness from 125 nm to 500 nm. Resistivity ranges from 10 ^- 2 to 10 ^ 7 Ω cm, with low pressure films exhibiting the lowest resistivities. Crystal structure becomes apparent above 1 μm, the majority of films, which have thicknesses of 500 nm or less, exhibit no crystallinity. Water contact angle decreases with increasing deposition pressure. In conjunction with colleagues from the DCU School of Biotechnology, electroactive biofilms were grown on the thin films and their electrical behaviour measured with chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry. The results outlined herein show the viability of non-equilibrium low temperature atmospheric plasma to decontaminate food inside a <b>pre-sealed</b> package, which is of use in the food industry. The results also show that zinc oxide thin films have potential as transparent conducting substrates for the growth of electroactive biofilms for use in microbial fuel cells...|$|E
