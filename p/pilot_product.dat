5000|$|In {{the first}} few years after the {{introduction}} of commodity markets, new exchanges opened with wild abandon, and speculative volume ballooned. Soon a directive titled The Notice of Firmly Curbing the Blind Development of the Futures Market was launched. In October 1994, the State Council rectified over 50 futures exchanges down to 15 futures exchanges, delisted 20 futures contracts (leaving 35), began issuing licenses to futures commission merchants for the first time while lopping their number by over 70%, restricted trading on foreign futures exchanges, introduced new rules and regulations, and shifted the control of the exchanges from local governments to regulatory authorities. DCE's market share then ranked No. 9 in China with Dry kelp as a <b>pilot</b> <b>product.</b> DCE traded soybeans and corn back then. [...] Continued abuse in the market brought forth the Second Rectification in 1998, most of the surviving 15 futures exchanges were restructured, and subsequently closed. Three national level future exchanges emerged: Shanghai Metal Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. The number of futures contracts was cut back further to 12 from 35, and more brokers were closed, leaving just 175 standing from the early 1990s peak of 1,000. Margins were standardized and regulations further toughened. Trading on foreign futures exchanges was further restricted to a small number of large, global entities. Soybeans, soy meal and beer barley were traded at DCE.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the valuation and optimal {{timing of the}} launch of two complementary/substitute products (or projects), {{one of which is}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>product.</b> As a first step, we study the problem from a strategic point of view and analyze the ability of the <b>pilot</b> <b>product</b> per se to create shareholder value. Next we provide a model to evaluate the option to launch the <b>pilot</b> <b>product</b> in order to create the option to launch the key product. The model is designed to analyze the value of the <b>pilot</b> <b>product</b> and the optimal timing to invest as functions of the degree of complementarity/ substitutability among the two products. As a specification, we analyze under what conditions it is worth investing in a <b>pilot</b> <b>product</b> with a negative NPV, whose option to invest is worthless due to perfect competition. The <b>pilot</b> <b>product</b> and the key product are driven by two different but correlated sources of uncertainty. The case is enriched by the presence of a patent on the key product and by the related consideration of a change in the competition due to patent expiry. By resorting to numerical analysis, we evaluate the embedded options and determine the optimal investment policy for both products. Our analysis allows us to capture the value of the options to invest in both the key and pilot products (as a compound option) and shows how the investment decision is aected by a higher correlation among products and a higher degree of substitutability. The major outcome of the model is that a higher correlation and a higher degree of substitutability among products increase the option value and expand the investment thresholds of the whole investment project, thus making the investment relatively less likely in the case of either a lower correlation or a lower degree of substitutability.

40|$|Like {{many other}} {{creative}} industries, the book publishing industry {{is experiencing a}} shift away from the physical into the digital. This fundamental change impels firms to examine their products and competences, and look at how they stand {{in relation to the}} new technology. Through a case study of Norway’s three largest book publishers; Gyldendal, Aschehoug and CappelenDamm, this thesis investigates how the Norwegian publishing industry think of, and respond to, the internet paradigm, high uncertainty and digitalisation. The data collection is based on semi-structured interviews with managers from both educational and general departments, and so reflects on both these markets, and their relation. The thesis finds that publishers in Norway have come relatively far in developing digital <b>pilot</b> <b>products</b> and distribution-systems. However, this technology-push approach is hindered by the lack of a dominant design. Diverging formats and aims have created an uneven knowledge uptake, and resulted in a split between educational and general literature markets. This divergence is enhanced by the educational system, which has taken on a lead user role. In addition, the internet technology imposes social and cultural values that go against the grain of existing business models and established industry networks, and as such still represents a significant challenge for individual firms and the industry...|$|R

40|$|Demands for shorter {{lead times}} and smaller order quantities, a greater {{emphasis}} on sustainable sourcing, and better management of supply chain risks are challenges Li & Fung is addressing by reshaping its relationship with its vendor base. The current work seeks to develop a data-driven approach for vendor base rationalization and vendor engagement {{as part of a larger}} initiative within the company to move from transactional vendor relationships to ones of greater collaboration and support. The primary contribution of this project is to provide Li & Fung with a rationalization and engagement methodology that leverages vendor performance and capability data collected by Li & Fung, as well as the author's own on-site observations of vendors, to address three main topic areas: vendor evaluation, vendor selection, and vendor engagement. 1. Vendor evaluation addresses the question of how Li & Fung measures the performance of vendors. This is an important aspect of vendor rationalization because the performance parameters used to evaluate the vendors are the behaviors that are promoted. A balanced scorecard taking into account a variety of performance considerations is presented as the tool to evaluate vendor performance. 2. Vendor selection addresses the question of how Li & Fung decides which vendors to continue to do business with and to what extent. These are essential questions to answer because the strength of the supply chain depends on the strength of the links in that chain. Two data streams providing a holistic picture of a vendor's historical performance, production capacity, production capabilities, and engagement level are used to select the right mix of vendors fit for the business's needs. 3. Vendor engagement addresses the question of how to build vendor relationships in a way that provides mutual incentive and benefits in improving performance and profitability over time. Presented as the foundation for this relationship is a vendor engagement package, which includes an objective set of performance data to monitor the vendor over time. It is through this vendor engagement package that Li & Fung exercises its influence to commit vendors to improvement plans aligned with business goals. The short-term accomplishment of the work was to successfully implement the rationalization methodology on a <b>pilot</b> <b>product</b> category within an operating group to reduce the vendor base from 39 to 19 and to identify three vendors for strategic partnerships. The long-term accomplishment of the work was to provide a robust vendor rationalization and engagement methodology that can be improved upon over time and applied across the remainder of the product categories within the operating group. by Jonathan Prout.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of e-learning, and consequently the driving forces behind the e-learning uptake {{in higher education}} have been widely discussed. They include greater accessibility and flexibility, a more cost effective and cost efficient program of study, and a higher quality of student learning experience. However, in 2001 Zenger and Uehlein observed that in the recent "rush to e-learning the emphasis has been largely on the e {{and not on the}} learning" (p. 60). What Zenger and Uehlein are suggesting is that in the current focus on technological applications in higher education the reason for the application (i. e. meaningful learning for students) has been forgotten. The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is committed to "[providing] outstanding learning environments and programs that lead to excellent outcomes for graduates" (QUT, 2003, p. ii). In pursuit of this goal the university has identified as one of its "top priorities" the "[integration of information and communications technology into our teaching…functions and infrastructure" (QUT, 2003, p. ii). In direct defiance to the observations of Zenger and Uehlein, QUT will "make a coordinated and strategic effort to use the increasing capacity and flexi-bility of technologies to transform our teaching and learning environment in ways which engage and challenge students, and which enable different learning envi-ronment [italics added], on-campus and off-campus, to be used in ways which are complementary and mutually reinforcing" (QUT, 2003, p. 4). This chapter will provide a case study on how e-learning is being de-signed, developed and implemented with QUT with a balanced focus on both the e and the learning. The Faculty of Information Technology at QUT is dedicated to the development of graduates who are not only discipline savvy but also highly information literate. To facilitate the development of informa-tion literacy the Faculty supported a project which involved the crea-tion of an online learning tool known as the Reflective Online Search-ing Skills (ROSS) Environment. ROSS is a flexible and interactive online learning tool for developing student skills and knowledge within the area on online searching. It was developed for use within the un-dergraduate unit ITB 322 Information Resources. This chapter will dis-cuss how ROSS was developed to take advantage of emerging technol-ogy (the e) whilst grounded in sound instructional theory and meaning-ful learning principles (the learning). In this paper we will also briefly outline the various types of e-learning models and indicate which of these models we used in our design, and explain the learning theory and research findings which underpin the overall development of ROSS. The learning theory is variation theory and the research method was phenomenography. In our work, the student perspective was also con-sidered with student expectations and perceptions informing both the design and the use of ROSS. The paper will also discuss how ROSS, an e-learning strategy developed for use within a specific undergraduate IT unit, is being developed into an online learning object for use by other QUT academics regardless of discipline. The many challenges in the creation and use of ROSS will be outlined, as well as examples from the <b>Pilot</b> <b>product</b> in one subject unit, and its subsequent beta version used in other faculties. These challenges occur for both the teaching staff during the instructional design phase and for the students during the implementation phase. The lessons learnt, or the pitfalls, in the development of re-usable learning objects will all be discussed and summarised {{at the end of the}} chapter. The chapter will provide recommendations on how to ensure the design and implemen-tation of e-learning and learning objects is considered in a holistic man-ner guided by sound pedagogy and student needs and attitudes. The chapter is significant because it provides a best practice example of how to blend together imaginative use of technology, instructional theories and principles, and student’s expectations, to careful craft e-learning and learning objects so as to facilitate the learning experience of stu-dents in a holistic manner...|$|E
