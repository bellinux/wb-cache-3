25|$|This was {{followed}} by Abraham Darby, who made great strides using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale in 1709. However, the coke pig iron he made was used mostly {{for the production of}} cast iron goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his <b>patented</b> <b>process,</b> were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron in forges until the mid-1750s, when his son Abraham Darby II built Horsehay and Ketley furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron. Since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it began being a structural material following the building of the innovative Iron Bridge in 1778 by Abraham Darby III.|$|E

The Victor gained popularity {{due to its}} light weight—achieved through a <b>patented</b> <b>process</b> of bending flat steel {{at right angles to}} create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when smoking was common indoors, particularly in the workplace. In 1915, the company began manufacturing and distributing steel desks after designing and producing 200 for Boston's first skyscraper, the Custom House Tower. In 1937, the company collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on office furniture for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The partnership lasted two years and resulted in some of the first modern workstations.|$|E

60|$|Wang in {{his native}} {{province}} in China {{might have been an}} aggressively, sensitively genial person; but in Samburan he had clothed himself in a mysterious stolidity and did not seem to resent not being spoken to except in single words, at a rate which did not average half a dozen per day. And he gave no more than he got. It is to be presumed that if he suffered he made up for it with the Alfuro woman. He always went back to her at the first fall of dusk, vanishing from the bungalow suddenly at this hour, like a sort of topsy-turvy, day-hunting, Chinese ghost with a white jacket and a pigtail. Presently, giving way to a Chinaman's ruling passion, he could be observed breaking the ground near his hut, between the mighty stumps of felled trees, with a miner's pickaxe. After a time, he discovered a rusty but serviceable spade in one of the empty store-rooms, and it is to be supposed that he got on famously; but nothing of it could be seen, because he went to the trouble of pulling to pieces one of the company's sheds in order to get materials for making a high and very close fence round his patch, as if the growing of vegetables were a <b>patented</b> <b>process,</b> or an awful and holy mystery entrusted to the keeping of his race.|$|E
6000|$|These {{facts were}} as nothing, however, in {{presence}} of his quick and strong impression that his pale, nervous, smiling, clean-shaven host had undergone since their last meeting some extraordinary process of refinement. He had been ill, unmistakably, {{and the effects}} of a plunge into plain clean living, where any fineness had remained, were often startling, sometimes almost charming. But independently of this, and for a much longer time, some principle of intelligence, some art of life, would discernibly have worked in him. Remembered from college years and from those two or three luckless and faithless ones of the Law School as constitutionally common, as consistently and thereby doubtless even rather powerfully coarse, clever only for uncouth and questionable things, he yet presented himself now as if he had suddenly and mysteriously been educated. There was a charm in his wide, [...] "drawn," [...] convalescent smile, in the way his fine fingers--had he anything like fine fingers of old?--played, and just fidgeted, over the prompt and perhaps a trifle incoherent offer of cigars, cordials, ashtrays, over the question of his visitor's hat, stick, fur coat, general best accommodation and ease; and how the deuce, accordingly, had charm, for coming out so on top, Mark wondered, [...] "squared" [...] the other old elements? For the short interval so to have dealt with him what force had it turned on, what <b>patented</b> <b>process,</b> of the portentous New York order in which there were so many, had it skilfully applied? Were these the things New York did when you just gave her all her head, and that he himself then had perhaps too complacently missed? Strange {{almost to the point of}} putting him positively off at first--quite as an exhibition of the uncanny--this sense of Newton's having all the while neither missed nor muffed anything, and having, as with an eye to the coup de théâtre to come, lowered one's expectations, at the start, to that abject pitch. It might have been taken verily for an act of bad faith--really for such a rare stroke of subtlety as could scarce have been achieved by a straight or natural aim.|$|E

But protecting your intellectual property is vitally important to your future success, no matter how brilliant your idea. Large businesses and corporations typically have their own patent attorneys to deal with intellectual property issues [...] a luxury most small businesses and entrepreneurs can 2 ̆ 7 t afford. If you have intellectual property to protect, but you lack the resources of a major company, then The <b>Patent</b> <b>Process</b> is for you. Written for individuals, entrepreneurs, and small companies, it provides readers with a solid introduction to patents and other forms of intellectual property, without becoming exhaustive and overly complicated. It clearly and concisely explains the things you need to know to understand the <b>patent</b> <b>process</b> and make it work for you. It features an overview of the history and the primary issues in intellectual property, as well as a section that answers common questions about the <b>patent</b> <b>process.</b> Illustrative case studies are included to highlight important issues, such as:* Patents, copyrights, and trademarks [...] what they are, what they do, and which one you need to protect your intellectual property* The application <b>process</b> for <b>patents,</b> trademarks, and copyrights* Foreign patents [...] protecting your intellectual property abroad* The financing, licensing, and sale of patents* Trade secrets and how they differ from patentsCreators of intellectual property want to focus on what they do best [...] create and innovate [...] rather than deal with the technicalities of patents and copyrights.
