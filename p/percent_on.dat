In addition, Elite Force was recipient to several Editor's Choice commendations from individual publications.|$|E

5|$|Gladstone {{is served}} by the Gladstone School District, which {{includes}} John Wetten Elementary School, Kraxberger Middle School, and Gladstone High School. In 2006, a bond was passed to allow approximately $40 million worth of construction on the three schools. The majority (approx. 26 million) of the money was applied towards a remodel of the high school. The district later refinanced the bond, saving taxpayers over 5 <b>percent</b> <b>on</b> its total ($805,040), with savings to begin in the 2024 tax year.|$|E
5|$|Having {{succeeded in}} {{reversing}} the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next {{to reverse the}} effects of the McKinley tariff. The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two <b>percent</b> <b>on</b> income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E

5|$|Huntsville was {{the largest}} city with no {{electricity}} from TVA. All the traffic lights were off, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, students were sent home from United States Space Camp, and the Panoply Arts Festival was canceled. Power was restored gradually to Huntsville, beginning with 3 <b>percent</b> <b>on</b> the morning of May 1. Only localized outages remained eight days after the storm. In addition to traffic and safety issues, the outage caused difficulties with water treatment and distribution and retail of all kinds, including gasoline and food purchases.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} legislation involved {{two measures}} to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), {{and a new}} Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 <b>percent</b> <b>on</b> incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a flat tax of 15 <b>percent</b> <b>on</b> private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E
5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 <b>percent.</b> <b>On</b> 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 <b>percent</b> <b>on</b> Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, McMaster's School of Medicine adopted {{progress}} testing, {{developing the}} personal progress index (PPI), a {{system based on}} progress testing invented concurrently by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's medical school and the Maastricht University. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at regular intervals to {{all students in the}} program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 <b>percent</b> <b>on</b> their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E

Although the game was nearly universally praised for the storyline and the two endings the game presented and critics consistently mentioned the immersive atmosphere and environment as being true to the Saw series, the quality level of puzzles were mixed, depending on the reviewer. The controls in general were not well received by many, and worse the combat system was panned by nearly every reviewer.|$|E
