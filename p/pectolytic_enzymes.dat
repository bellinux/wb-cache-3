Optimum PG and pectinesterase (PE) production on pectin medium occurred in nine days while 11 days were required for optimum pectin methyl trans-eliminase (PMTE) synthesis. PMTE was the predominant enzyme synthesized on polygalacturonic acid (PGA) with trace amounts of PG and PE. Optimum PMTE synthesis occurred in five days, while PG and PE activity decreased after three days of incubation. Only trace amounts of PG and PMTE were detected in cultures in which glucose was the sole carbon source, and PE production was greater on glucose than on PGA. Polygalacturonate trans-eliminase was not detected in any of the cultures. The action of these enzymes was determined on purified pectic substrates, using improved viscosity reduction and reducing group assays, as well as thin layer chromatography (TLC) procedures for the detection of hydrolysis products. Only endo-PG and endo-PMTE activity was present in the pectin, PGA, and glucose culture filtrates.

A strain of Lactobacillus fermentum was extracted from a tomato juice concentrate. Meanwhile, eight different tomato juice mixtures were heated and the survival rate of Lactobacillus fermentum was measured.

When plants were grown aeroponically, cell numbers increased with increasing root length to a mean of 3400 cells per root, at which point the release of new cells ceased.
