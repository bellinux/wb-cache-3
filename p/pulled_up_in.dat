25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E

He finished a distant third to One Man in the King George VI Chase at Sandown Park in January 1996 and second to Imperial Call when favourite for the Hennessy Gold Cup a month later.

25|$|Frank DeSimone {{was born}} in 1909 in Pueblo, Colorado. As a child {{his family moved to}} California. Desimone {{graduated}} from the University of Southern California Law School and became a lawyer in May 1933. Soon after he turned to a life in crime. DeSimone was involved in one of the botched assassination attempts on Mickey Cohen. Jimmy Fratianno signaled DeSimone after a meeting with Cohen and DeSimone <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a car with Frank Bompensiero, Leo Moceri, and another armed man. By the time they got past Cohen's bodyguards, Cohen escaped. With a job as an attorney, DeSimone was able to avoid police scrutiny. His lawyer career was no front job however. In the 1940s and 1950s DeSimone served as lawyer for mobsters such as Jimmy Fratianno and Johnny Roselli as well as providing legal aid to others.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E
