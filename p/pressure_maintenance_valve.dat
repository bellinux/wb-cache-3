30|$|Results {{show that}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{strategy}} {{has the advantage of}} keeping brine and gas production rates constant during the 20 -year period. Hence, the energy recovery factor is much higher compared to that of the depletion case. Also, the recovery factor is almost 10 %, indicating the presence of significant amounts of energy still in place {{at the end of the}} 20 -year period. Thus, we conclude that the <b>pressure</b> <b>maintenance</b> scenario requires a much smaller aquifer size compared to that of the aquifer depletion case.|$|R

30|$|Also, case SLD (the {{staggered}} line drive waterflood) shows the highest pressure increment after waterflooding for all patterns analyzed.

30|$|The decline {{curves of}} the two {{production}} strategies exhibit different characteristics. The main production mechanisms of the no-injection case are fluid and rock expansion, while the main production mechanism of the reinjection case is <b>pressure</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Therefore, a much larger drainage area is needed for the no-injection scenario to keep the production rate constant over a 20 -year production period.|$|R
