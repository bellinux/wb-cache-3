Particles {{are found to}} aggregate towards {{the center of the}} curved liquid surface, due to buoyancy force. Two macroscopically distinct states, the triangular lattice and the <b>packed</b> <b>Rod</b> State of stacking particles, are observed in the aggregation process. It is also observed that there is a transition between the two distinct states. A simple model using buoyancy-induced pressure field explains the phenomena in this transition. A double layer construction is introduced to explain the <b>packed</b> <b>Rod</b> State. The order in 2 D colloidal system under magnetic dipole interaction is also studied. A local order parameter S is introduced to characterize the system state. I find a logarithmic relation between S and the inner pressure. As to high-pressure approximation, I show theoretically that S is inversely proportional to the potential of particle site. Besides local order, the translational and orientational correlation is also studied. I show that the phase observed in the experiment is an isotropic liquid state, and the correlation length of the two correlation functions is consistent with the prediction of KTHNY theory [4]...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Geometrical {{conditions}} of existence of curved bundles of hexagonally <b>packed</b> <b>rods</b> are presented. Closure of the bundle {{results in a}} group of automorphisms of the cross-sectional lattice. The elastic energy accounts for bending and torsion of the rods. Equilibria of the bundle correspond to solutions of a variational problem formulated for the axis of the bundle. The Euler-Lagrange equations are obtained in terms of curvature and torsion and the problem is reduced to the quadrature. The Ilyukhin-type equations describe the shape of the bundle in special cylindrical coordinates. The results are of universal nature and are applicable to various fibrous structures, including DNA and nanotubes. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Turbulent mixing across {{adjacent}} subchannels in <b>packed</b> <b>rod</b> bundles was studied using conductivity {{measurement and}} sodium chloride solution as the tracer. Single phase water was the fluid investigated. The <b>packed</b> <b>rod</b> bundles were seven stainless steel tubes, 1. 905 cm {{in diameter and}} 152. 4 cm long, arranged in hexagonal close-packed configuration and housed inside a 7. 551 cm acrylic plastic tube. The geometric configuration enabled simultaneous investigation of turbulent mixing between triangular-triangular, triangular-trapezoidal and trapezoidal-trapezoidal channels. A set of coupled differential equations describing the mass transport between adjacent channels in rod bundles was written using the "lumped-parameter" approach which treated the large intersticies between the rods as the differential elements. The channel lumping technique resulted in a 4 -channel model and a 2 -channel model, {{reducing the number of}} differential equations that had to be investigated. A modified matrix method, made possible by successive data collected, was used in evaluating the crossflow mixing coefficients. The flow rate of water covered a range from 1000 cm³ to 5000 cm³. The gap spacing studied was 0. 47 cm. The Reynolds number covered was from 6 x 10 ³ to 2. 5 x 10 ⁴. The following were the result of the investigation: 1) The probe and the conductivity measurement is a very promising means of tracer technique if some improvement is made on the data-taking scheme. 2) The modified matrix technique evaluates the crossflow mixing coefficient directly from the input and output concentration data, provided there is very little or no error associated with the concentration data. 3) The turbulent mixing coefficient is shown to be a strong function of the subchannel Reynolds number. 4) Comparison with the works of the previous investigator shows that the turbulent mixing coefficient is not a strong function of gap spacing, it is indistinguishable within statistical significance. 5) The turbulent mixing coefficient is shown to be a weak function of subchannel geometry...|$|R

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{transition from}} vesicles to inverted hexagonally <b>packed</b> (hollow) <b>rods</b> was studied for asymmetric diblock copolymers of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) in dilute solutions. The self-assembled aggregates were {{prepared by the}} addition of water to the copolymer solutions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to induce the aggregation of the PS blocks, and the morphological transition was induced by an increase in the water content. Many intermediates, such as vesicles with hollow regions in the wall running parallel to the surfaces, as well as various quasihexagonal structures, were trapped. The mechanism of the transition involves a thickening of the vesicle walls accompanied by the formation of the hollow rods in the walls and a decrease {{in the size of the}} original water core. Evidence is presented that the transition proceeds in three steps. In the first step, hollow regions form in the walls of the vesicles. The second step involves further thickening of the walls and some alignment of the rods in a hexagonal pattern leading to the formation of quasihexagonal structures. Finally, the fully developed structures of inverted hexagonally <b>packed</b> <b>rods</b> form. This mechanism, especially in the initial step, is different from those found either in polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) diblocks or in small molecule amphiphile systems, both of which involve fusion of vesicles. A comparison of the mechanisms is presented. Because of the ease of trapping of intermediates, the present study of the morphological transition may improve our understanding of the later stages of the process of the biomembrane fusion and the lipid lamellar (L) to inverted hexagonal (HII) phase transition.

30|$|Many {{of these}} {{copolymers}} associate {{in aqueous solution}} to form spherical micelles [8, 59, 73], while at higher concentration, block copolymers can also self-assemble into lyotropic liquid crystals [54, 74, 75]. The progressive growth of the hydrophobic core with increasing temperature due to the increasing dehydration of PEO blocks in the corona induces instability in the spherical micellar dispersion, leading {{to the formation of}} rod-like structures. The addition of multivalent salts to aqueous copolymer solutions produces a dramatic effect on the transformation of the copolymer [76]. At low concentration, spherical micelles form, whereas at high concentration, the formation of hexagonal, cubic, and lamellar liquid crystalline phases takes place [58]. The morphology spectrum runs from micelles (L 1), through a cubic array of micelles (I 1), hexagonally <b>packed</b> <b>rods</b> (H 1), and cubic bicontinuous spheres (V 1), to lamellae (L 3) where phase inversion takes place, and the inverted morphologies develop: cubic (V 2), reversed hexagonal (H 2), cubic (I 2), and reversed micelle (L 2) [77, 78]. Regular micelles are formed in polar solvents such as water and alcohols; thus, the corona has a hydrophilic character. Micelles formed in nonpolar solvents such as toluene have a hydrophobic corona and are referred to as ‘reverse.’ Recently, much attention has been devoted to highly asymmetric block copolymers that form aggregates characterized by a large core and a thin coronal shell of the soluble block: the crew-cut systems [79, 80]. ‘Crew-cut’ micelle-like aggregates represent a new type of aggregate. They are formed via the self-assembly of a highly asymmetric amphiphilic block copolymer, in which the insoluble core-forming blocks are much longer than the soluble corona-forming blocks [81, 82]. One of the noteworthy phenomena associated with crew-cut aggregates is the accessibility {{of a wide range of}} morphologies [79, 81, 83, 84]. These include spheres, rods, vesicles, lamellae, large compound micelles, large compound vesicles, a hexagonally packed hollow hoop structure (the ‘HHH’ structure) [85], onions [86], a bowl-shaped structure [87], and several others [88, 89].|$|R

After their development, the protocols are field-tested, often improved, and then made available to interested users via Guideline Series reports such as this one. Typically, verifications conducted by the Center involve substantial measurements, so an effort is made here to recommend only the most important measurements for the guideline. Guidelines for verifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions for two types of technologies used in the natural gas transmission industry are presented here. One technology reduces and recycles methane leaks from natural gas compressor <b>rod</b> <b>packing,</b> while the other reduces <b>rod</b> <b>packing</b> leaks when compressors are in standby operating mode. The guideline includes two different levels of emission reduction determination: th...|$|R
