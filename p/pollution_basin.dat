Water quality parameters, such as temperature, water transparency, water depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate {{were measured}} in situ from two sites (littoral and open water zone) of the reservoir. Phytoplankton compositions and abundances were analyzed in Tana fisheries and other aquatic organisms’ research center. ANOVA {{result of the}} physicochemical parameters included chlorophyll-a showed the presence of significance difference among seasons and between sites (P <  0.05). A total of seven families, 36 genera from three groups (Diatom, Blue green algae and Green algae) of phytoplankton were identified during the study period. From all groups, diatoms were the most abundant at both sites and Blue green algae were the least abundant. ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P <  0.05). ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P <  0.05). Based on the stepwise regression, a total number of phytoplanktons had positive correlation {{with some of the}} physicochemical parameters (R 2  =  0.99, P <  0.001, N =  16). The study concluded that some of physicochemical parameters (NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P) indicated the presence of reservoir water pollution. This is supported by the presence of pollution-resistant phytoplankton species such as Melosira and Microcystis. The reservoir water was eutrophic (productive) throughout the year.

These cities are called “The Basin City”. A GIS-based decision support system (DSS) was developed in this paper for water trade management of basin cities in order to investigate water trade mechanisms. Several subsystems are included in the developed DSS, i. e., data-driven subsystem for predicting the change of water quality and water volume which will be used for water quality assessment and <b>pollution</b> control purpose; <b>basin</b> information subsystem; trading information subsystem, a ranking subsystem for water environment management; a information subsystem including various standards, laws, regulations;spatiotemporal relations of water attributes etc. All of these subsystems benefit the sustainable management of cities along the study river and water basin. The GIS-based management of the basin city water environment was a multi-objective and hierarchical comprehensive DSS. The change of basin water resources and the using situation together with the pollution discharge of from cities along the river can be observed visually, intuitively, and rapidly. It is a platform for the basin city water trades and a water resources transaction system...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} global {{assessment}} of nitrogen-related water <b>pollution</b> in river <b>basins</b> with a specification of the pollution by economic sector, and by crop for the agricultural sector. At a spatial resolution of 5 by 5 arc minute, we estimate anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loads to freshwater, calculate the resultant gray water footprints (GWFs), and relate the GWFs per river basin to runoff to calculate the N-related water pollution level (WPL) per catchment. The accumulated global GWF related to anthropogenic N loads in the period 2002 – 2010 was 13 × 1012 m 3 /y. China contributed about 45 % to the global total. Three quarters of the GWF related to N loads came from diffuse sources (agriculture), 23 % from domestic point sources and 2 % from industrial point sources. Among the crops, production of cereals had the largest contribution to the N-related GWF (18 %), followed by vegetables (15 %) and oil crops (11 %). The river basins with WPL > 1 (where the N load exceeds the basin’s assimilation capacity), cover about 17 % of the global land area, contribute about 9 % of the global river discharge, and provide residence to 48 % of the global population...|$|R
