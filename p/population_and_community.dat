25|$|The {{concepts}} of spatial ecology are fundamental {{to understanding the}} spatial dynamics of <b>population</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> ecology.

The rapidly expanding field of landscape ecology utilizes the basic aspects of spatial ecology in its research.|$|E

Nematodes do not decompose organic matter, but, instead, are parasitic and free-living organisms that feed on living material. Nematodes can effectively regulate bacterial <b>population</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> composition — they may eat up to 5,000 bacteria per minute. Also, nematodes {{can play an important}} role in the nitrogen cycle by way of nitrogen mineralization.|$|E

40|$|Top-down consumptive control (suppression) is an {{important}} driver of <b>populations</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> of prey organisms. Diverse predator assemblages often yield non-linear suppression with respect to constituent species’ effects (emergence); most often diversity enhances suppression. Predators also affect prey organisms non-consumptively through changes in prey physiological, physical, spatial, temporal, and behavioral responses to predators. Role of predator diversity in non-consumptive response by prey is relatively un-studied.
