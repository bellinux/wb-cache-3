50|$|The paper {{passes through}} rollers in the fuser assembly, where {{temperatures}} up to 200 C and pressure {{are used to}} permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) {{and the other is}} a rubber backed roller (<b>pressure</b> <b>roller).</b> A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the centre of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside.

40|$|Abstract. Through {{changing}} working pressure, {{the crushing}} tests of bauxite {{were made by}} using laboratory high <b>pressure</b> grinding <b>roller.</b> The results indicated that, with working pressure increased, high <b>pressure</b> grinding <b>roller</b> capacity first increased and then decreased. High <b>pressure</b> grinding <b>roller</b> capacity reached maximum when working pressure was 9 MPa, and reduced deeply and then gradually slowed down when working pressure was more than 11 MPa. The particle size of bauxite crushing product P 80 gradually reduced when working pressure increased from 7 MPa to 15 MPa, and gradually increased when working pressure was more than 15 MPa. The working pressure of 11 MPa was appropriate when bauxite crushed by laboratory high <b>pressure</b> grinding <b>roller...</b>|$|R

50|$|Cans {{are filled}} before {{the top is}} crimped on. The filling and sealing {{operations}} need to be extremely fast and precise. The filling head centers the can using gas pressure, purges the air, and lets the beverage flow {{down the sides of}} the can. The lid is placed on the can, and then crimped in two operations. A seaming head engages the lid from above while a seaming roller to the side curls the edge of the lid {{around the edge of the}} can body.

Then a <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the characteristics of mechanically separated meat produced from turkey as example. The status survey of 35 separates of turkey produced by <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> or rotation auger technology was done {{in view of the}} criterion bone/histometrical (digital area determination and particle analysis, conventional particle counting in the histological section) and bone/chemical (Calcium determination). Additionally the tissue composition and the microbiological status of the samples were determinated. Apart from doing the status survey the second focus was to prove the analysis of phases in terms of the software supported area determination and particle analysis. The proof compared two reference methods, the conventional particle counting and the Calcium determination, with the digital investigated results. 1. With all used methods it was shown, that the <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> technology provided lower bone tissue contents than the rotation auger technology. Furthermore it seems to be an interrelation between the occurrence of the bone particles and the anatomical origin of the deboned material within both separated groups. The MSM produced by rotation auger yields higher bone quotas in the finished product whereas it is hardly to prove the raw material produced by <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> because of its infinitesimal bone contents. 2. The Calcium content of more than 2 / 3 of the examined samples was lower than the limit of 100 mg / 100 g from the EU Regulation 2074 / 2005. There were only some overruns by the rotation auger produced samples. 3. The results of the microbiological examination showed insistently, {{that it is necessary to}} improve the hygienic conditions for the production of the separates. All samples showed higher counts than the limit of 50 cfu Escherichia coli / g as a hygienic parameter according to the EU Regulation 2073 / 2005. In terms of the health risk the high numbers of colony forming units of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and Clostridia should be taken into account. 4. Salmonella spp. was isolated 9 x from 35 samples and Campylobacter spp. from only one pooled sample. Listeria monocytogenes was not found at all. 5. The qualitative and semi-quantitative histological examination resulted in differences of the occurrence of cartilage, renal structures and collagen parts by the particular samples showing an interdependence between the separation technology and the anatomical origin of the deboned material but these informations are not sufficient for the diagnosis of mechanically separated meat or more than ever for an assignment to certain procedures or kind of bone. 6. The experiment involved paraffin slides stained by Alizarin-S according to German official collection of food examination methods for the automatic determination of the bone area (PFEIFFER et al. 1975). The bone tissue appears orange-red using this staining formula and the residual tissue blue. The problems involving the achromatic color black for the analysis by the additive HSI system prohibited the Kossa staining (KÃNIGSMANN 1978) as an alternative. The 60 particular pictures were scanned automatically and gradually by a digital camera and conglomerated to a general overview picture. The discrimination, marking and determination of the two areas of concern were yielded subsequently upon a visual controlling according to the HSI parameters. 7. The particle analysis turned out to be helpful for the judgment of its homogeneity in relation to parameters as single area and equivalent circle diameter as well as affinity of particles to build so called bone nests. The continuous produced separates show a lower dispersal of the particular characteristics and indicate a higher morphological homogeneity and tendency for the bone nests. 8. The results of the digital microscopic analysis of phases and the reference methods correlate for the determination of the bone quotas in spite of different analytical basics very tight. The analysis of the regression shows a high significant correlation (<. 001) between the phase analytical area determination and manual particle counting (r =. 96) and also to the chemical method (r =. 92). The phase analytical particle counting correlates with the conventional particle counting in a similar way (r =. 95). Altogether the different analytical techniques show very close correlations. A standard and full contrast staining is the most important precondition for a software supported discrimination of the areas of concern. This condition is fulfilled by the Alizarin-S staining. Principally it is possible to correct the misstained areas by visual controlling, but it interferes also the automation of the procedure and makes necessary personal manipulations. And this individual intervention should be eliminated and substituted by a full automatic standard examination for avoiding the personal error from the point count technique. It cannot be assessed, which grade of perfection could be reached by further tests, but meanwhile this procedure satisfies the requirements for a valid method and can be recommended for the routine analysis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{a method}} of {{producing}} silica particle-modified glass fibre-reinforced polyester composite is introduced. Silica particles, which are of low density, high hardness and good chemical compatibility with the polymer matrix, are coated on the glass fibre by a thin film of polyester resin which is also subsequently incorporated into the composite as the matrix phase. After initial coating of the fibre by the silica particles, the fibre plus polyester plus silica is passed through carefully spaced <b>pressure</b> <b>rollers</b> to produce a uniform coating on the continuous fibre. The effect of the particles on the vis-cosity of the bulk-phase polyester matrix and the shear strength of the composites made from the modified fibre were investigated. Also, the mechanism of reinforcement of the modified fibre is discussed. The modified fibres have higher shear strength, a larger sur-face area and show better bonding with the polyester matrix than conventional fibres.

A broad fusing latitude, defined by the temperature range between which cold and hot offset occurs, is a critical factor in achieving a robust printing process and ensuring the highest print quality.
