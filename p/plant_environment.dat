25|$|There {{is a big}} gap {{among various}} {{countries}} {{between high and low}} yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between 38–44 tonnes per hectare. China and India accounted for over a third of world's production in 2010, and had yields of 14.7 and 19.9 tonnes per hectare respectively. The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes of potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed, seed age and quality, crop management practices and the <b>plant</b> <b>environment.</b> Improvements in {{one or more of these}} yield determinants, and a closure of the yield gap, can be a major boost to food supply and farmer incomes in the developing world.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{regulation}} of plant growth responds to many stimuli. These responses allow environmental adaptation, thereby increasing fitness. In many cases, the relay {{of information about}} a <b>plant’s</b> <b>environment</b> is through <b>plant</b> hormones. These messengers integrate environmental information into developmental pathways to determine plant shape. This review will use, as an example, auxin in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana to illustrate the complex nature of hormonal signal processing and transduction.

We argue by dint of complexity analysis that the networked automotive production system characterized by just in time and lean production creates states far from equilibrium in individual parts manufacturers and assembler plants. Positive feedback creates system disturbances and adverse health and safety issues in the local <b>plant</b> <b>environments.</b> In addition, we examine four mechanisms that serve as negative feedback loops to absorb stresses in local <b>plant</b> <b>environments</b> and rectify health and safety related issues.

50|$|Moreover, {{microbes}} {{could also}} potentially utilize nitrilase for detoxifying and assimilating nitriles and cyanide {{that exist in}} the <b>plant</b> <b>environment.</b> An example of this is the β-cyano-ʟ-alanine nitrilase by the plant bacterium P. fluorescens SBW25. Although it is unknown whether this plant bacterium encounters toxic levels of β-cyano-ʟ-alanine in natural settings, nitrilase activity has been observed in cyanogenic plants; thus, it seems that the nitrilase serves as a predominant mechanism for detoxifying cyanide instead of β-cyano-ʟ-alanine. Other bacterial applications of nitrilases produced by plant-associated microorganisms include the degradation of plant nitriles for a carbon and nitrogen source. P. fluorescens EBC191 hydrolyzes many arylacetonitriles, namely mandelonitrile, which serves as a defense against herbivores.|$|E
50|$|Emulation for Logic Validation also {{referred}} to as virtual commissioning. This process involves replicating the behavior of one or more pieces of hardware with a software environment (typically for a system under design). The goal of the emulation engineer is to create an environment that mimics the real automation hardware. The ultimate goal of emulation is to provide an environment for the manufacturing automation controls engineer to validate their PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) ladder logic and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) files prior to system debug in the <b>plant</b> <b>environment</b> therefore improving quality and enabling a seamless transition from the virtual to physical environment. Another benefit is to deliver plant maintenance operators and machine conductors with realistic virtual environments for training themselves in safe and optimum conditions.|$|E
50|$|Houseplants in a {{controlled}} production greenhouse are kept in an ideal conditions for rapid growth. Some plants and production flowers are even hybridized for fast growth characteristics.Nutritional needs of a plant in a production green house are greater than in a typical personal house <b>plant</b> <b>environment</b> where humidity, light, irrigation, and air circulation are not ideal. After being removed from the production greenhouse the plant slows evapotranspiration. Likewise after being brought into a typical household the watering and nutitional requirements decline, the plants growth rate declines and the nutritional needs decline. Plants use most of the carbon that they release from CO2 to create energy {{but some of the}} carbon feeds plant growth. Far less plant food comes from the soil.|$|E

5000|$|Saskatchewan {{possesses}} a continental climate and the seasonal {{variations in temperature}} provide a short growing season. On average the province supports 159 to 160 frost-free days, in the far north that number diminishes to 85 to 95 frost free days. [...] In 1967, Canadian scientists created a map outlining Plant Hardiness Zones. The hardiness zones examine climatic gradations such as length of frost-free period, summer rainfall, maximum summer temperatures, minimum winter temperatures, and wind speed. The harshest <b>plant</b> <b>environment</b> is 0 and the mildest is rated as 8. Corresponding data was correlated for plant requirements. Such an examination provides direction to which flora may survive the geographical hardiness zone conditions. [...] A development in the late 1800s encouraged homesteaders to pursue agriculture. Red Fife wheat (Triticum aestivum) matured 20 days before other wheats, which allowed plants to ripen before the autumn frost.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{cultivation}} of the waratah {{as a single}} process is a tricky one as flowering time, number and quality are easily affected by changes in the <b>plant</b> <b>environment.</b> These factors must be considered as early as prior to buying land for production. North facing aspect ensures a maximum of sun exposure. A combination of northerly, easterly and westerly aspects will spread the flowering time with the western slope flowering slightly later on. As the location approaches the equator, flowering time will be earlier. Elevation also has to be considered as it will affect temperature, {{a major influence on}} flowering time. More flowers will be produced in full sunlight although better quality flowers are found in the shade. Paul Nixon (1997) in his book ‘The Waratah’ claims that ‘the ideal situation is to have rich, well drained, deep soil with a north-easterly aspect giving the plants full sun until the flowers buds have initiated and then put shade cloth over the bushes until they have flowered’.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{interest}} recently in the Japanese approach to manufacturing, growing out of a concern for finding ways to reduce inventories and increase productivity. At this project's inception, its objective was to assess whether the kanban system could perform well in the manufacturing environments found in this country. Based on observations from managers visiting Japan, the project was enlarged to also assess which factors in a production environment have the biggest impact on performance [...] -regardless of the system in use. Guided by a panel of production and inventory managers from diverse <b>plant</b> <b>environments,</b> a comprehensive list of factors thought most important to manufacturing effectiveness was constructed. The panel established low and high values for each one. These settings were considered representative of the range experienced in U. S. <b>plant</b> <b>environments.</b> The factor settings allowed a variety of representative plants to be tested with a large scale simulator. Results show that kanban, when implemented in certain environmental settings, does indeed perform exceptionally well. However, so do the more traditional systems used in the United States. Conversely, there are other <b>plant</b> <b>environments</b> in which all systems perform much worse. This suggests that the factors themselves are the keys to major improvement. Simultaneously reducing setup times and lot sizes is found to be the single most effective way to cut inventory levels and improve customer service. Shop factors of particular importance are yield rates and worker flexibility. Degree of product standardization and the product structure are also high impact factors. Less crucial than earlier believed, at least over the factor settings simulated, are inventory record inaccuracy, equipment failures, and vendor reliability. Such results suggest that the selection of a production/inventory system can be of less importance than the improvement of the manufacturing environment itself. inventory/production: operating characteristics, inventory/production: simulation, production/scheduling...|$|R
