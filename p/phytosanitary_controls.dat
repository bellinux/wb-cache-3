In this study, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed allowing the detection of Mmd, the forma specialis that is economically harmful. A set of primers and hydrolysis probe were designed based on sequence polymorphisms in the large ribosomal RNA subunit (28 S). The real-time PCR assay was optimized and performance criteria of the detection method, i. e. sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and robustness, were assessed. The real-time PCR method was highly specific and sensitive and allowed the detection of one single urediniospore of Mmd in a mixture of 2 mg of urediniospores of other Melampsora species. This test offers improved specificity over currently existing conventional PCR tests and can be used for specific surveys in European nurseries and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>controls,</b> in order to avoid introduction and spread of this pathogen in Europe...|$|E

The {{factors associated}} with the distribution of parasitic weed Orobanche cumana Wallr. (Broomrape), limiting sunflower production in Europe and the surrounding continents of Asia and Africa, have not been adequately investigated. The goals {{of this study were}} to broaden the understanding of environmental {{factors associated with}} broomrape’ distribution in Europe, and to predict suitable habitats based on environmental factors which would be vulnerable to invasion and establishment of broomrape in North and South America. A robust agroecological database included 35 quantitative parameters associated with trials conducted by ten public research organizations from five continents. The database consisted of 117 sites (habitats), Europe (79), Africa (3), Asia (6), and Americas (29), equally distributed between invaded and non- invaded habitats. Environmental parameters analyzed using an ANOVA and PCA showed that all sunflower areas from Europe were vulnerable to broomrape attack. The parasitic weed develops in soil and climate environmental conditions similar to non-invaded areas. Its expansion to nearby areas of the Africa and Asia continents seems to indicate a broadening of the environmental conditions to which the parasitic weed can tolerate. Habitat conditions of sunflower crop areas in South America showed more similarity to invaded habitats than North America. The absence of the ability to predict actual broomrape distribution based on environmental factors enforces the need to use cultural practices of crop rotation and genetic resistance in infected areas. Strict <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>controls</b> need to be enforced to prevent the inadvertent introduction into non-infected areas and its spread in infected areas.

40|$|Eva Ortet is Director General of Agricultural Production in the Cape Verde Ministry of Rural Development The ACP islands {{states are}} {{generally}} in the Caribbean, the Pacific or the Indian Ocean. However {{there are a}} few islands or archipelagos off the coast of West Africa with agricultural conditions which are peculiar to themselves. Cape Verde is a Portuguese-speaking archipelago off the coast of Senegal. It falls in the Sahel region and Is thus dry and prone to erosion. But because this small state has added difficulties of its own, especially in the area of plant protection, it cannot afford to forego its strict <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>controls</b> for the sake of African agricultural integration. Recently, Western and Central African Ministers of Agriculture met in conference in Dakar, Senegal, to lay the foundations of what has now become known as African integration in the field of agriculture and food production. The problem they add reseed was an important one: how can the Africa of tomorrow reach a point where each country can flourish within a continental framework where economic growth is stimulated; and where it has some chance of survival in the international agricultural produce markets? As a result, African countries have felt compelled to give up their protectionist practices and to open up their produce {{to the rest of the}} world. Cape Verde is neither able nor wishes to be self-sufficient, and relies heavily on foreign trade in order to provide all that is necessary to the functioning of a modern state. IMPORTED PARASITES But this leads to problems, especially in the field of plant protection. Our isolated geographical position once protected us from the pests that ravaged mainland Africa, and we do our utmost to keep them out. For this reason, in 1970, we imposed a quarantine for all imported fruit and vegetables. Any imported product coming into Cape Verde which has not been through this control, and this includes foodstuffs carried by travellers, is destroyed as soon as it reaches the country. Our phytosanitary inspectors board every flight coming in from Bissau, Dakar or Banjul and confiscate any vegetative material carried by passengers. Measures such as these can control the spread of pests, but none the less they were inadequate to prevent a huge invasion by millipedes in Sto Antao. A few years ago a traveller brought in some wooden objects from a country south of the Equator; the parasite was inadvertently introduced into the country, and so one small slip brought in what has become public enemy number one for Cape Verde farmers. From then on, not a single vegetable could be exported out of Sto Antao which had been one of our principal food-producing islands. In 1990 the African cassava mosaic virus, a problem of extreme gravity for African cassava producing countries, was introduced into Sao Tiago. We are therefore on permanent alert. Our controls do not apply solely to travellers; all foodstuffs, including food aid, are subject to them as well. At one time, maize from Togo, donated by Germany, was refused entry, and the cargo had to be taken to the Netherlands for fumigation. This was repeated last year, and even more exceptional precautions were taken: the country of origin was chosen according to where there was the least risk of contamination; spraying was carried out pre-harvest; then a fumigation specialist accompanied the harvested grain between Lome port and Praia. Maize is the most important cereal crop for us, and it is imperative that it should not be put at risk by imports. Drought does quite enough damage without that. LITTLE TRADE WITH AFRICA Although restrictions are less severe for animal products, the hygiene control documents are scrutinized with extreme care. ' Imported' pests do not come solely from the continent of Africa: citrusdiseases come from Europe, and animal products coming in from Brazil are also a threat. Our country could offer a lucrative market for many neighbouring states, but they have to ensure that they have the means to guarantee that what is sold is healthy. This still has not happened. We have even taken precautions between our own islands. For example, cassava from Sao Tiago is submitted to quarantine regulations before it can be sold elsewhere in Cape Verde. The result of this vital prophylactic policy is that the only imports from mainland West Africa are for research purposes. Virus-free cassava seedlings were imported in vitro from IITA in Ibadan, Nigeria, with the help of FAO, for distribution to Cape Verde farmers whose crops have been devastated by mosaic. In 1988 Cape Verde imported only 5 % of its total from the African continent, against 10 % only five years earlier. ECOWAS now provides only 1. 5 % of our imports. The creation of a single African market is a fine initiative in principle, but the countries involved must be mindful of the practical constraints.

40|$|Existing plant {{protection}} regulations in the Caribbean {{are not only}} outdated but suffer {{from a lack of}} technical backup. That explains why over the last 25 years these islands have been menaced by many pests that have been introduced from other countries. Pillaging pirates and other outlaws have come back to threaten many countries in the Caribbean. They sneak in by boat or plane, evade customs officials, break into warehouses and rampage through their new found bounty before wreaking havoc with the lives of ordinary people throughout the islands. These modern day plunderers brandish no swords but, seen from close up, are no less menacing with their armour and built-in weapons. They are, in fact, insects, bacteria and diseases that despoil crops and harvests by attacking them on all fronts. To combat such pests, most countries have developed laws and implemented them with more or less effective regulations. It is in this area, however, that many Caribbean countries have fallen behind to the advantage of all sorts of persistent pests. It is not uncommon to see {{plant protection}} laws passed over a century ago still on the books. While they may include relatively complete regulations enabling the control of imported vegetation by various sanitation measures, including the destruction of infected shipments, for many islands this is no longer sufficient. Unfortunately, there acoears to be little initiative to update such laws. This leaves those responsible for their implementation a difficult task for which they are, at best, ill-prepared. In some cases, the lack of personnel and technical support means that only a token effort can be made to deal with the problem. The result in many countries is that plant protection measures boil down to a simple bureaucratic procedure: issuing certificates that simply delay exports. Grenada {{is a good example of}} the state of plant protection controls in the Caribbean. A law passed in 1891 gives authority to local officials to prohibit or restrict the import of plant material and to order any treatment judged necessary, but it has never been updated. If the situation is not this bad on all the islands, there are various loopholes through which many pests have passed on their way to establishing themselves as local problems. In recent years, some organizations (notably the Caribbean Plant Protection Commission - CPPC - of the FAO and the Regional Programme for Vegetation Protection of the Inter- American Institute for Agricultural Cooperation - IIAC) have made considerable efforts in this direction. Meetings and seminars at both the national and regional level have been organized in close cooperation with agricultural departments of different countries in order to promote better plant protection controls. Direct technical support has also been given to help update and enforce regulations. As a result of an IIAC study on phytosanitation measures in various Caribbean countries, a certain number of common problems have been identified: insufficent records, inexperienced personnel, outdated legislation, and a general lack of both material and staff. Some of these obstacles are now being overcome thanks to the various programmes noted above, but much remains to be done To deal effectively with this problem, one must first of all know how the pests in question arrive. Most of them are brought in on vegetable matter, notably live plants, fruit and grains. Studies in the Caribbean have identified three major vectors. The first is the use of exotic HYV seeds, seedlings, cuttings or tubers. The second is the importation of staple foods needed to complement the country's food supply deficit. Finally, there is the exchange of agricultural products within the region. Whether in the form of vegetable matter or another agricultural product, processed or not, all of these vectors run the risk of introducing serious plant diseases or infestations. Experience in some ACP countries has shown that, if properly applied, plant protection measures that are constantly revised to keep up with modern transmission patterns can reduce such risks. National measures, however, will never be enough to deal with these 'pests without borders'. We now know that effective international control measures must do more than try to keep pests out of uninfected countries. Attention must also be given to reducing the export of such problems. As with human health, sanitary measures must be taken on both sides: by protecting others, one protects oneself and by exporting only uninfected products, one reduces the likelihood of importing infected products in the future. This principle is particularly valid in the Caribbean where there is a constant flow of products between the islands. The lesson has been well learned in the Barbados, St. Vincent and Antigua. Unlike their neighbours, these countries have not suffered from an infestation of Anastrepha on fruit. In order for them to keep this pest out, they must ensure that control measures be taken beyond their borders. Their best allies are thus the inspection services of exporting countries which must be able to ensure that only uninfected products are shipped. Even in regions where such controls are adequate and applied effectively by all countries concerned, new pests have still been introduced. As recent studies have confirmed, the loopholes and poor enforcement of regulations are not the only cause for the failure of plant protection measures. Of the world's 350 or so major agricultural pests listed by the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology, more than 60 % have been introduced. This has led to the 'inevitability theory' which holds that 'all pests will eventually get to all parts of the world because <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>controls</b> can only retard their spread'. Unfortunately, some specialists are beginning to agree. For evidence, they cite the recent introduction of a citrus scab in Florida, a mango seed beetle in Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia, and the slow but steady spread northward of the African killer bee despite draconian protection measures. A recently discovered element also supports this thesis: it seems that natural vectors, such as winds, storms and ocean currents, also spread diseases and insects. Hurrican Allen, for example, is blamed for having introduced thrips (Fulmekiola serrate) into the Caribbean. Previously unknown in the region, it had disastrous effects on sugarcane plantations in Guadeloupe and the Barbados before moving on to Guyana and Trinidad. Another problem in Guyana's plantations is a smut disease whose spores appear to be carried by the wind over the Atlantic from West Africa. In this case, no number of laws or inspections would be effective. Even if after all precautionary measures have been taken some pests still manage to reach another country, the battle is far from over. One can still fight a rearguard action to stop them from spreading. It is at this point that good technical support can play a pivotal role. Unfortunately, few phytosanitary services in the Caribbean have access to such facilities. This shortcoming was primarily responsible for the spread of moko disease among bananas. Introduced to Grenada earlier this decade, it has resulted in over 2 million dollars worth of losses and poses enormous risks to the banana industry in the region. As the closest country, St. Vincent is at the greatest risk due to the fact that the Grenadine archipelago acts as a land bridge between the two larger islands. The lack of a good plant protection service was also responsible for the 1965 invasion of a sugarcane beetle (Diatraea centella) on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas. It was introduced by sugarcane seeds brought in from Guyana. An effective protection service could at least have avoided its spread once it was introduced. If it is easy to evaluate the losses caused by such pests, it is much harder to predict the economic impact of identified threats and thus to gauge the investment warranted to prevent their spread. The cruciferae moth (Plutella xylostella). for example, was discovered for the first time in Trinidad in 1945 but it caused little damage until 25 years later. The cherry beetle was first observed in coffee plantations in 1978 in Jamaica, but has not been noticed anywhere else. On the other hand, sugarcane smut and rust, identified in 1974 and 1978 respectively, spread like wildfire through all Caribbean sugarcane plantations as well as those in Central and South America. The best protection against such pests remains prevention. First of r all, every effort must be made to : stop them from leaving or entering countries. Once introduced, eradication and treatment measures are both complicated and very costly. It took no less than 27 months and 176 million dollars to control the 1980 Mediterranean fruitfly epidemic in California. It is thus easy to understand why the Barbados banned the import of mangoes from St. Lucia when mango seed beetles were discovered there in 1984. Many measures are now needed to improve plant protection in the Caribbean. The first seems to be better information. Whether designed to evaluate the risks of spreading pests through internal circulation or international commerce, studies of transmission methods will be very useful. Unfortunately, even basic data such as lists of existing pests in these countries is not always available. In addition to studies on the risks and modes of infestations, analyses of the economic impact of introduced pests are needed. Finally, it must be remembered that phytosanitary control personnel can only help to ensure the food security of their countries if they are given the necessary training and technical support.

40|$|The risk of {{microbiological}} {{or chemical}} contamination was determined {{in each of}} the processes of the production system of produce for fresh consumption, in a population of 164 agricultural companies in the central valley of Costa Rica. The risk quantification was calculated using the responses to a 46 -item survey conducted with the managers of the companies included in the study. The responses to the 46 items were grouped according to the production process; the risk contamination calculation formula validated by the authors in another study was used to obtain the risk value per process. The microbiological or chemical contamination risk results were calculated for the land preparation and planting process, cultural management of the crop, human factor performing the cultural management of the crop, <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control,</b> harvesting, packaging, and the human factor involved in packaging. The risk analysis results indicate that the human factor participating in the packaging obtains the highest risk rating, followed by the cultural management of the crop and, in third place, by the harvesting process. In all processes where the risk was quantified, the results showed values close to or greater than 50 in a 0 to 100 risk scale. These results should alert producers and consumers of produce for fresh consumption in the analyzed population. The effect of the buyer on the packaging risk values was also observed; when the producers are supermarket chain suppliers the risk values are lower as compared to those of producers who are not supermarket chain suppliers...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that the stem nematode, Ditylenchus dipsaci (Nematoda: Anguinidae), is genetically more related to the gall-forming {{nematodes}} from genera Anguina, Heteroanguina, and Mesoanguina than to other members of the genus Ditylenchus. This finding was provided by molecular data written in the evolutionary variable, non-coding internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and ITS 2) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In the current paper, we analyze the nucleotide sequences and predict the secondary structures of two expansion segments (D 2, D 3) of the 28 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) -coding gene for the plant-parasitic nematodes from the genus Ditylenchus and their related anguinids. In general, the expansion segment D 2 appeared to be more variable than the segment D 3 illustrating their different evolutionary constraints. Comparative analysis of the aligned sequences and predicted secondary structures revealed similar trend showing the tight relationships between the stem nematodes (D. dipsaci, D. gigas, D. weischeri) and gall-forming nematodes from the subfamily Anguininae. Phylogeny reconstructions disjoined the family Anguinidae into two monophyletic clusters (Clade 1 and 2). Clade 1 constitutes the stem nematodes (D. dipsaci, D. gigas, etc) and gall-forming nematodes from the genera Anguina, Heteroanguina, Subanguina and Mesoanguina, while clade 2 includes other Ditylenchus species like D. destructor and D. halictus. Collectively, deciphering the exact phylogenetic relationships within the family Anguinidae (Nematoda: Tylenchida) with respect to our results should provide a framework for a taxonomic revision in order to reflect biological history of these nematodes. In addition, we provide novel molecular data, which may be exploited in diagnostic tools for <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control</b> of these economically important plant parasites...|$|R
40|$|Rhagoletis completa Cresson (Diptera: Tephritidae) is {{native to}} North America and invaded Western Europe in the late 1980 s, causing {{important}} damage to its principal host, walnut (Juglans spp.). In this review, we summarize the important elements of R. completa’s biology, phytosanitary status and methods used in Europe for its control, and then present the main conclusions associated with a completed risk analysis performed in 2014 to evaluate the dispersion and establishment potential of R. completa in Europe. The walnut husk fly was initially identified in Switzerland (1988) and Italy (1991), from where it spread to at least seven additional countries: France, Spain, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary. R. completa has not reached the limits of its potential distribution. The main dissemination pathways within Europe include: (1) natural adult dissemination; (2) adult hitchhiker behaviour; and, to a lesser extent, (3) transportation of larvae in fresh fruits. R. completa host plants are widely distributed in Europe, either as isolated wild trees or in orchards, favouring the probability of fly establishment in currently fly-free areas. In addition, the European territories where Juglans species are present share biogeographic similarities. In orchards where R. completa is present and uncontrolled, 100 % of walnut trees can be infested, causing losses in walnut yields of up to 80 %. The negative effect is low (< 10 % yield loss) under <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control,</b> although additional costs {{must also be considered}} to support specific monitoring for R. completa. The information presented here underlines a strong need for better walnut husk fly monitoring across European countries, as well as for increasing efforts to develop biological methods to control this emerging pest.

40|$|Our aim was {{to examine}} the {{virulence}} of eight Phytophthora isolates belonging to three species (Phytophthora cryptogea, Phytophthora plurivora and Phytophthora quercina) obtained from diverse European ecosystems (in Bulgaria, Poland and Germany) towards three forest tree hosts – English oak (Quercus robur L.), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). All plants grown from seeds in a greenhouse conditions were artificially inoculated under the stem bark with Phytophthora cultures. The tested isolates turned to be more aggressive to Turkey oaks than to English oak trees. In case of European beech, the isolates of P. cryptogea and P. plurivora exposed various virulence. The potential hazard of the introduced foreign isolates for the oak and beech forests in Poland and Bulgaria is discussed. Amongst the tested isolates, P. quercina P 290 from German highly infected Bulgarian Turkey oaks; therefore, its negative potential impact on Bulgarian oak forests could be considered as high (if unintentionally introduced). Also, two Bulgarian isolates belonging to P. cryptogea and P. plurivora are risky for Polish beech forests, if exposed to the pathogen. The observed pathogenicity of the tested Phytophthora species proved their potential as important contributors to decline of valuable forest ecosystems dominated by oaks (Q. robur and Q. cerris) or beech (F. sylvatica), in both Poland and Bulgaria. We found that investigated Phytophthora pathogens could develop in the living plant stem tissues without causing any disease symptoms, which is another demonstration that <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>control</b> by simple observation of plant material is not effective.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Conservation Ecology and Entomology) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The South African {{table grape}} {{industry}} exports approximately 60 % {{of the table}} grapes produced. A major threat to the export of these grapes is the phytosanitary risk that insect pests pose. This {{study was conducted in}} the Hex River Valley, South Africa’s main table grape producing area. The aim {{of this study was to}} reduce the number of phytosanitary rejections from insects on table grapes from the Hex River Valley. Thus the main objectives of the study were to identify the most important phytosanitary pests in the Hex River Valley; the determination of their presence in the vineyards with possible means to control them; and to assess the possibility of using postharvest quarantine treatments in the Western Cape. Further aims were to determine the effect of different colour harvesting crates on the phytosanitary pests and whether the phytosanitary pests infested the grapes via packhouses. The most important phytosanitary pests of table grapes of the Hex River Valley are in order of importance: Phlyctinus callosus (Schonherr) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Epichoristodes acerbella Walker (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), Planococcus ficus (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), Gonocephalum simplex Fabricius (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Dysdercus fasciatus Signoret (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae). 12. 71 % of rejections were from species that were not identified, while a further 33 % of the rejections were possibly identified incorrectly. <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>control</b> of P. callosus appeared to be far more effective using Plantex® than pesticides. Weather conditions appeared to affect the abundance of P. callosus, especially warm weather, while bunches harboured less P. callosus later in the day. Control of E. acerbella with DiPel® (Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki) appeared to at least reduce the population within the vineyards, and so its use is recommended. P. ficus is a non-actionable species for the USA market and is not listed as a phytosanitary pest for the Israeli market and so should not be causing any phytosanitary rejections. C. capitata appeared to be successfully controlled by the fruit fly sterile release program and the cold sterilisation it currently undergoes. G. simplex caused few rejections. It is still unclear where this pest infests the grapes, as it was found in both the field and in the packhouses. D. fasciatus occurrence on grapes was probably accidental. It was shown that picking during the early and late parts of the day, when this species was less active, reduced its occurrence in bunches. Gryllus bimaculatus (De Geer) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), although not reported as a reason for rejections in table grapes for the past two years, was an actionable species that was present in large numbers in the Hex River Valley. There was a strong correlation between increasing quantities of pesticides and higher abundances of G. bimaculatus. It appeared to be an indicator of the overuse of pesticides. Results of this study showed that infestation by the phytosanitary pests came from neighbouring vineyards. The creation of barriers to prevent the movement of these pests between vineyards is suggested. Methyl bromide is the most commonly used postharvest quarantine treatment. Owing to the ozone-depleting properties of methyl bromide, it is scheduled to be outlawed in many countries from 2005. Alternative postharvest treatments are irradiation, extreme temperatures, forced air, vapour-heat treatments and the use of controlled atmospheres. Irradiation treatments appeared to control the pests at doses that do not damage the grapes. Controlled atmosphere treatments also have a high probability of success, although more research is required on this treatment. Low temperature treatments are relatively cheap as most exported fruit already undergoes cold storage, and appears to control species in the families Pseudococcidae and Tephritidae, although further research is required for the other pest. Colour or location of the harvesting crates in the vineyards appeared not to influence the number of phytosanitary pests collected, as they were not attracted to these crates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Theobroma cacao L. is {{economically}} {{speaking the}} most important species of the genus Theobroma. Cacao is cultured in tropical regions and its yield is affected by several diseases, such as black pod. Black pod rot in cacao. Cacao black pod, particularly, is an economically serious problem {{in all areas of}} the world where cacao is grown, causing significant pod losses of up to 30 % and killing up to 10 % of the trees annually. The disease is caused by different species of the stramenopile genus Phytophthora and, once it has infected a cacao field, its control is fairly difficult. Black pod rot control strategies. Several approaches are used to manage black pod: chemical <b>control,</b> <b>phytosanitary</b> and cultural methods, genetic resistance, and biological control. Losses in yield due to black pod could be reduced through integrated management practices, although the results may vary for each cacao-growing region. Main challenges and new approaches. Black pod control could be achieved if an integrated management strategy is established, with the combination of biological and chemical methods, genetic control, and adequate cultural methods in an integrated program. © 2011 Cirad/EDP Sciences.
