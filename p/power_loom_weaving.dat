He {{was the son of}} a cotton weaver, and it was his parents' desire that he should become a physician, but, his father's {{business}} not being successful, he was unable to continue his studies, and so turned his attention to inventing. He showed an inventive genius at the early age of 14, when he invented a machine to manufacture piping cord, for which he received $100. Before he had reached the age of 18, he had devised a handloom for suspender webbing. His work on Stenography, a short manual on shorthand writing, was written and published about this time. In 1838, he invented a <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> for <b>weaving</b> knotted counterpanes, and later a <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> to <b>weave</b> coach lace and took his brother, Horatio, in with him.|$|R

His father joined forces with Henry Lee and Joseph Lee and Robert Scott to form a partnership that became Tootal, Broadhurst Lee Limited, which integrated cotton spinning and <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> <b>weaving.</b> [...] It was the third largest vertically integrated cotton business in Lancashire, with around 5,000 employees in 1887. Its mills included Sunnyside Mill in Bolton, and Ten Acres Mill and Hemming Works near Manchester.Broadhurst's main responsibility in the company was on the finance committee of which he became chair in 1900; in 1907he became company chairman. Broadhurst lived in the Manor House at North Rode near Congleton, and lived the lifestyle of a country gentleman, spending August and September of each year at his grouse moor in Scotland.

With his first loom he succeeded in obtaining ten or twelve yards daily, which he increased by improvements until a product of twenty-five yards was regularly obtained. Afterward he invented a <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> for <b>weaving</b> [...] "Brussels" [...] (i.e. pictorial tapestry) and velvet tapestry carpets, his most important invention, which attracted much attention at the World's Fair in London in 1851. The town of Clinton, Massachusetts, owed its growth and manufacturing importance to him, as it contained the coach-lace works, the Lancaster Quilt Company, and the Bigelow Carpet Company, {{all of which were}} direct results of his inventive ability.

50|$|Richard Hattersley {{the founder}} of the company served his {{apprenticeship}} at Kirkstall Forge. He set up his own business in 1789 at Stubbings Mill, Airworth, manufacturing nuts, bolts, screws and small parts for textile machines. Richard's son George came into the business and took over its running. In 1834 he was asked to build a <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> for <b>weaving</b> worsted cloth which previously had only been woven on handlooms The first loom was produced in 1834, it was never delivered as it was smashed up in transit by a group of handloom weavers of the Luddite persuasion fearful for their livelihood.The replacement was delivered. Hattersley's prospered developing an extensive catalogue, adding new products to their range which included as tobacco machines and garden furniture. Hattersley's continued to prosper with the number of employees peaking to around 1100 just prior to the First World War. They also ventured into production and the subsidiary companies have survived where the parent did not. It closed in 1983.|$|R
50|$|Weaving sheds {{added in}} 1836 and 1838 were of two storeys and housed 305 looms. Before the 1830s, {{spinning}} mills produced cotton, that was put-out to hand-loom weavers {{who worked in}} their own homes or small loom shops, like the one Greg owned at Eyam. Hand-loom weaving continued in parallel to <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> <b>weaving</b> throughout the 19th century. Around 1830 the power loom became sufficiently viable for independent weaving sheds to be set up, and for larger owners to add weaving sheds to their spinning mills. A weaving shed needed the correct light and humidity and a floor that was stable enough to withstand the vibration caused by the picking of many looms. Quarry Bank Mill is of national significance in that it used two-storey side-lit buildings rather the a single storey sheds with a saw-tooth roof. The first two-storey shed at Quarry Bank was 33 m by 6.5 m. The 1838 building was 30 m by 10 m to which a storey was added in 1842 for warping and beaming. In the Gregs pragmatic way, looms were purchased gradually.|$|E
25|$|Innovations in carding and {{spinning}} enabled by advances in cast iron technology {{resulted in the}} creation of larger spinning mules and water frames. The machinery was housed in water-powered mills on streams. The need for more power stimulated the production of steam-powered beam engines, and rotative mill engines transmitting the power to line shafts on each floor of the mill. Surplus power capacity encouraged the construction of more sophisticated <b>power</b> <b>looms</b> working in <b>weaving</b> sheds. The scale of production in the mill towns round Manchester created a need for a commercial structure; for a cotton exchange and warehousing. The technology was used in woollen and worsted mills in the West Riding of Yorkshire and elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> {{arrived in}} Briercliffe in 1848. The only family in Briercliffe that had any capital were the Smiths of Hill End. William Smith {{as the owner}} of a {{handloom}} factory was under the same pressures as individual rural hand loom weavers- and needed to modernise. In 1848 he opened Hill End Shed, a <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> shed with 400 looms at Lane Bottom. It employed 220 powerloom weavers half of whom were under twenty, 60% of them came from the village of Lane Bottom and only ten came from Haggate. Hand <b>loom</b> <b>weaving</b> using the domestic system still continued with 317 families in the district containing a handloom weaver. In Haggate there were 25 adult male handloom weavers. When Hill End Mill was fully staffed, there was low staff turnover and it was never expanded. Though the <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> offered a better living than the domestic system or quarrying there were no mills to offer further jobs.|$|R
40|$|Self Assembly was {{inspired}} by Sir Aaron Klug’s Nobel award-winning work exploring the results of X-ray crystallography tilting methods {{which led to the}} discovery of helical and spherical virus structures through 2 D– 3 D Fourier transform methods and to the self assembly properties of DNA. Brock’s reflexive and methodical process-led approach to research is documented in an ‘experiments journal’. The research takes a biomimetic approach to create innovative structures and practice within digital jacquard <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> industrial <b>weaving.</b> The Self Assembly series of 11 pieces explores the transition from 2 D flat weaving to 3 D forming through ‘on-loom’ finishing. Brock uses 2 D binary information combined with innovative yarn and complex weave structure interactions on an industry standard Dataweave jaquard loom. These approaches, combined with the textile ‘catalyst’ of steam and/or natural humidity, enable the works to 3 D ‘self assemble’ when tension is released as they come off the loom. Through this research Brock expands the boundaries of what can be produced on digital industrial <b>power</b> <b>looms.</b> Brock was one of five textile artists invited by the Medical Research Council to interpret the work of a Nobel Prize winning scientist, with the aim of using textiles to communicate biological discoveries to the general public through the exhibition ‘Nobel Textiles’ (St James’s Park, London) and to explore the parallels between scientific discovery and innovative design. The exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue, website, and conference (ICA London) with a panel ‘Question and Answer’ session with the artists and scientists. Three pieces from the Self Assembly series were obtained for the Crafts Council’s permanent collection...|$|R
