40|$|A {{nonlinear}} analysis which {{is necessary to}} adequately model elastic helicopter rotor blades experiencing moderately large deformations was examined. The analysis {{must be based on}} an appropriate description of the blade's deformation geometry including elastic bending and twist. Built-in <b>pretwist</b> angles complicate the deformation process ant its definition. Relationships between the twist variables associated with different rotation sequences and corresponding forms of the transformation matrix are lasted. Relationships between the twist variables associated with first, the <b>pretwist</b> combined with the deformation twist are included. Many of the corresponding forms of the transformation matrix for the two cases are listed. It is shown that twist variables connected with the combined twist treatment are related to those where the <b>pretwist</b> is applied initially. A method to determine the relationships and some results are outlined. A procedure to evaluate the transformation matrix that eliminates the Eulerlike sequence altogether is demonstrated. The resulting form of the transformation matrix is unaffected by rotation sequence or <b>pretwist</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{behavior of}} spinning, pre-twisted laminated composite plates was investigated. The {{purpose of these}} experiments was to establish an experimental database consisting of strain, deflections, and natural frequencies {{as a function of}} rotational velocity. Six different plate sets were tested, that included three different stacking sequences (two symmetric, one asymmetric), two different initial twist levels (0 deg, 30 deg), and two different initial twist axis locations (midchord, quarter-chord). The plates were spin tested at four different combinations of pitch and sweep. It was observed that the location of the <b>pretwist</b> axis and the level of <b>pretwist</b> greatly affects the strain and deflections of the spinning plate, while only the <b>pretwist</b> level affects the measured natural frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>pretwist</b> and warping on the {{torsional}} vibration of short-aspect-ratio rotating beams is examined for {{application to the}} modeling of turbofan, turboprop, and compressor blades. The equations of motion and the associated boundary conditions by using both Wagner's hypothesis and Washizu's theory are derived and a few minor limitations of the Wagner's hypothesis, as applied to thick blades, are pointed out and discussed. The equations for several special cases are solved in a closed form. Results are presented indicating the effect of warping, <b>pretwist,</b> and rotation on torsional vibration of beams as aspect ratio is varied. The {{results show that the}} structural warping and <b>pretwist</b> terms {{have a significant effect on}} torsional frequency and mode shapes of short-aspect-ratio blades whereas the inertial warping terms have negligible effect. Since the torsional frequencies and mode shapes are very important in aeroelastic analyses by using modal methods, the structural warping terms should be included in modeling turbofan, turboprop, compressor, and turbine blades...|$|E

First, displacement functions based on two coupled displacement fields (the polynomial coefficients are coupled through consideration of the differential equations of equilibrium) are derived for <b>pretwisted</b> beams. Next, the stiffness and mass matrices of the finite element model are obtained by using the energy expressions. Finally, the natural frequencies of <b>pretwisted</b> rotating Timoshenko beams are obtained and compared with previously published both theoretical and experimental results to confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the present model.

40|$|A {{finite element}} method of discretizing beam {{segments}} of <b>pretwisted</b> rotating blades is presented. Employing the matrix displacement method, stiffness and mass properties are developed from basic mechanics of a <b>pretwisted</b> beam theory. By introducing the proper displacement functions, the effect of rotor blade rotational motion on the stiffness matrix is obtained systematically from the kinetic energy expression. Comparing with other beam elements the derivation of this element is more fundamental. This allows one to apply the same approach to more complicated problems including nonlinear effects or complex dynamic motions. Illustrative examples are given comparing numerical results with available data and other numerical solutions from rotating and nonrotating force fields. These examples show that accurate prediction of vibration frequencies for <b>pretwisted</b> blades {{can be obtained by}} employing a quite modest number of degrees of freedom...|$|R

The theoretical results have been verified experimentally using natural rubber strands and nylon multifilament yarns. In the case of monofilament component strands the theoretical and experimental results are in agreement. However, in the case of multifilament component strands the theoretical and experimental results are in agreement only at low levels of <b>pretwist.</b> The discrepancy between theoretical and experimental data, at high levels of <b>pretwist,</b> {{can be attributed to the}} effect of friction in increasing the bending rigidity of the singles yarns...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{rotating}} thin-walled beam theory incorporating fiber-reinforced and piezo-composite is developed {{and used to}} study the active control for vibration suppression. The structural model accounts for transverse shear strain, primary and secondary warpings, <b>pretwist</b> and presetting angles. In addition, the centrifugal stiffening effect, tennis-racket effect, flapping-lagging-transverse shear and extension-twist couplings are accounted as well. Based on a negative velocity feedback control algorithm, the effective damping performance is optimized by studying anisotropic characteristics of piezo-actuators and elastic tailoring of the host structure.

The method used {{is based on the}} general thin-shell theory, so it is applicable to investigate vibrations of the cylindrical panel having large <b>pretwist</b> and camber. The convergence of frequency parameters is studied with the increase of numbers of the strip and of terms in assumed solution functions. To demonstrate the usefulness of the method, the frequency parameters obtained are compared with available results in the literatufe.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{behavior of}} spinning laminated composite <b>pretwisted</b> plates (turbo-fan blade-like) with small (less than 10 % by volume) integral viscoelastic damping patches was investigated at NASA-Lewis Research Center. Ten different plate sets were experimentally spin tested {{and the resulting}} data was analyzed. The first-four plate sets investigated tailoring patch locations and definitions to damp specific modes on spinning flat graphite/epoxy plates {{as a function of}} rotational speed. The remaining six plate sets investigated damping patch size and location on specific modes of <b>pretwisted</b> (30 degrees) graphite/epoxy plates. The results reveal that: (1) significant amount of damping can be added using a small amount of damping material, (2) the damped plates experienced no failures up to the tested 28, 000 g's and 750, 000 cycles, (3) centrifugal loads caused an increase in bending frequencies and corresponding reductions in bending damping levels that are proportional to the bending stiffness increase, and (4) the centrifugal loads caused a decrease in torsion natural frequency and increase in damping levels of <b>pretwisted</b> composite plates...|$|R

40|$|The optimal {{vibration}} {{control of a}} rotating, composite, pretwisted, single-celled box beam, exhibiting transverse shear flexibility and restrained warping, is analyzed. A higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) enabling satisfaction of traction-free boundary conditions is employed. An orthotropic host with Circumferentially Uniform Stiffness ply angle configuration and transversely isotropic sensors-actuator pairs that are surface embedded along the span are considered. The total output from sensors {{is fed to a}} controller and then uniformly applied to actuators. The extended Galerkin method, along with either instantaneous or classical LQR methods, is used. Instantaneous LQR provides greater response attenuation in case of sustained external forcing. Results are obtained for a linear spanwise variation of <b>pretwist.</b> Compared to the unshearable and first-order shearable (FSDT) models, the HSDT appears most sensitive to <b>pretwist</b> and - when a saturation constraint is considered - it predicts the lowest settling time. The HSDT predicts significant attenuation in response and power required as compared to the FSDT, the differences being especially pronounced for constrained input control. Parametric studies involving the ply angle, <b>pretwist,</b> and patch length are performed. An optimum <b>pretwist</b> that yields lowest response, power, and settling time is obtained. Its value differs when the saturation constraint is used. Tailoring provides greater attenuation at the expense of an increase in settling time. Using constrained input control, an order-of-magnitude reduction in power requirement is possible via tailoring. The results underscore the importance of shear strain variation across the beam wall, and also of synthesizing active control with tailoring, for achieving efficient control...|$|E

Conclusions concerning individual and collective effects of warping, <b>pretwist,</b> tension-torsion coupling and tennis racket effect (twist-rotational coupling) terms on the {{natural frequencies}} are drawn from numerical results obtained by using a finite difference procedure with first order central differences. The relative importance of structural warping, inertial warping, <b>pretwist,</b> tension-torsion and twist-rotational coupling terms is discussed for various rotational speeds.

40|$|A {{new design}} for hybrid axial-torsional {{transducers}} using pretwisted beams requires the resonance frequencies of the torsional and axial vibration modes to be matched. To aid in designing such transducers, {{the effects of}} increasing <b>pretwist</b> and changing the cross-section geometry on the resonance frequencies are investigated analytically. The governing equations and boundary conditions for extension, torsion, and cross-sectional warping are derived using the semi-inverse method and Hamilton&# 039;s principle. A general set of differential equations for the cross-sectional warping of pretwisted beams is derived. Through scaling, the warping function is shown to be locally similar to the Saint-Venant warping function when the beam is slender, low in <b>pretwist,</b> and torsional deformation is dominant. Using this approach, geometric and material limitations {{in the use of}} the Saint-Venant&# 039;s warping function are illustrated, beyond which the simpler form may no longer be used. The simplified equations of motion are solved under the free-free boundary condition for resonance frequencies and mode shapes, and a comparison with finite element analysis illustrates the limitation...|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric {{ultrasonic}} motors {{have the}} potential to enable important applications such as endovasular surgical micro-robots due to their high torque and power density at the 0. 1 - 1 mm diameter range. A type of ultrasonic motor that is suitable for miniaturization is the combined axial-torsional standing-wave (CATS) ultrasonic motor that generates the CATS stator motion via <b>pretwisted</b> beam vibration converters. The operation of the motor involves (1) the generation of an ellipse-like stator tip trajectory when the pretwisted-beam stator is excited to vibrate in a CATS motion by a piezoelectric transducer, and (2) the transfer of frictional torque when the rotor is pressed against the stator tip. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the CATS ultrasonic motor, centimeter-scale prototypes were fabricated and tested to determine the characteristics of the motor design. Theoretical models of the <b>pretwisted</b> beam stator and the torque transfer mechanism were also investigated to help us predict the effects of various design parameters. The axial and torsional resonance frequencies of the pretwisted-beam stator needs to be matched for an effcient generation of the CATS stator motion. To help designers select the right analysis method for the design process, we investigated the validity of common <b>pretwisted</b> beam theories that assume the warping function of a <b>pretwisted</b> beam is locally identical to that of a prismatic beam. Through a scaling analysis of the equations governing the warping function of <b>pretwisted</b> beams [...] derived using semi-inverse method and Hamilton's principle [...] we obtained a set of criteria for checking the validity of the assumption. These criteria allow us to determine at what geometries the use of prismatic warping function will result in poor predictions of the axial resonance frequency and that alternative modelling methods are needed. Existing models of CATS motors ignore the vertical displacement of the rotor, predicting periodic behaviours that are contrary to the apparently random oscillations observed in the motor's steady-state operation. Our incorporation of the rotor's vertical motion results in a bouncing-disk model that explains various behaviours of the motor prototype, including the oscillations in the transient speed-time curve, and the effect of preload on stall torque and steady-state speed. The nonlinear dynamical system formed by the bouncing disk model shows that different stator trajectories and interface properties can give rise to complex phenomena such as period doubling bifurcation, chaos, and extremely long period "chattering orbits". Knowledge of the location and basins of attraction for these orbits gives us detailed understanding of the motor's behaviour that will help designers improve the performance of CATS ultrasonic motor...|$|R

The excited molecule twists by ∼ 90 ° around either the N 2 C 3 bond or the C 4 C 5 bond and relaxes to the ground electronic state through a conical intersection with either a trans or cis outcome. We show that a large initial distortion of several dihedral angles and a specific normal vibrational mode combining pyramidalization and double-bond twisting {{can lead to a}} preferential rotation of atoms around the C 4 C 5 bond. We also show that selective <b>pretwisting</b> of several dihedral angles in the initial ground state thermal ensemble (by analogy to a protein pocket) can significantly increase the fraction of photoreactive (cis → trans) trajectories.

The individual and collective effects of <b>pretwist,</b> precone, setting angle, thickness ratio and Coriolis forces on the natural frequencies and the buckling boundaries are presented.

The <b>pretwisted</b> bars were then sliced longitudinally and tested in pure tension up to fracture. The combination of a torsion-tension test was sufficient to initiate low-strain statie fractures provided that the twisting angle exceeded a strain limit. This exhaustion limit may correspond to an abrupt reduction of the remaining ductility, which {{may result in a}} brittle fracture of a notched member if it is tested in tension. The experimental study revealed important features of the influence of torsional prestrain on the embrittlement for low carbon steels and yielded the mode of exhaustion of ductility with the increase of twisting angle. The elongation at fracture versus twisting strain curve presents a shape of an equilateral hyperbola indicating that the larger part of ductility of the material is reduced rapidly for small amounts of prestrain, while the remaining part necessitates excessive amounts of <b>pretwisting</b> to be exhausted. Comparison of the shear strain-tension elongation curve obtained by a torsion-tension combination with the corresponding equivalent compression strain-tension elongation curve derived from a precompression-tension test showed the effectiveness of the former combination in exhausting the ductility of the material. © 1966...|$|R

Theoretical results are compared to the results on the forced vibration of intact canine radii obtained experimentally by Thompson. Surprisingly, inclusion of fairly large <b>pretwist</b> angles (from - 14 to 12 deg for one specimen) had little affect on the first three frequencies of transverse vibration in either the cranial or lateral directions. Inclusion of shear deformation reduced the third-mode frequency in the stiffest (lateral) direction by about six percent, otherwise shear deformation played a minor role in determining natural frequencies. Similarly. rotatory inertia had negligible influence up to the third natural frequency. The predominant influence on the first three natural frequencies of transverse vibration could be attributed to the variations in mass and flexural stiffness {{along the length of the}} test specimens.
