5|$|The rows of {{the table}} are called periods; the columns are called groups. Six groups have {{generally}} accepted names as well as numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18, the noble gases. The periodic table {{can be used to}} derive relationships between the properties of the elements, and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized. The periodic table <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> framework for analyzing chemical behaviour, and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

Negotiation theory <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> framework for merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of the built environment. Interests, a key construct in negotiation theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of Roger Fisher and William Ury (1981), Getting to yes, advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.|$|E

However, not every transcendental number is a Liouville number. The terms in the continued fraction expansion of every Liouville number are unbounded; using a counting argument, one can then show {{that there must be}} uncountably many transcendental numbers which are not Liouville. Using the explicit continued fraction expansion of e, one can show that e {{is an example of a}} transcendental number that is not Liouville. Mahler proved in 1953 that π is another such example.|$|E

25|$|Goa'uld symbiotes are {{serpentine}} lifeforms {{with four}} jaws and glowing yellow eyes. Originally aquatic, mature Goa'uld symbiotes have extensive fins and are powerful swimmers, {{with the ability}} to launch themselves from the water towards prospective hosts. A Goa'uld can burrow into their host through the back of the mouth or the neck, though they prefer the latter because they wish to avoid remembering the look of horror on the host's face. They then enter the brain, take control of the body, and gain total access to the host's memories; thus, the Goa'uld often use symbiote implantation as a means of interrogation that also <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> future spy.|$|E
25|$|By 1930, quantum {{mechanics}} had been further unified and formalized {{by the work}} of David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann with greater emphasis on measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the 'observer'. It has since permeated many disciplines including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Its speculative modern developments include string theory and quantum gravity theories. It also <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} the appropriate location for injection of local anesthetic, which is typically lateral to (outside) the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and above the clavicle, with the first rib generally considered to represent the limit below which the needle must not be directed (the pleural cavity and uppermost part of the lung are located at this level). Palpation or ultrasound visualization of the subclavian artery just above the clavicle <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> anatomic landmark for locating the brachial plexus, which is lateral to the artery at this level. Proximity to the brachial plexus can be determined using by elicitation of a paresthesia, use of a peripheral nerve stimulator, or ultrasound guidance.|$|E

25|$|Michel Callon's {{concept of}} framing <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> schema: each {{economic}} act or transaction occurs against, incorporates and also re-performs a geographically and cultural specific complex of social histories, institutional arrangements, rules and connections. These network relations are simultaneously bracketed, so that persons and transactions may be disentangled from thick social bonds. The character of calculability is imposed upon agents {{as they come}} to work in markets and are “formatted” as calculative agencies. Market exchanges contain a history of struggle and contestation that produced actors predisposed to exchange under certain sets of rules. Therefore, for Challon, market transactions can never be disembedded from social and geographic relations {{and there is no}} sense to talking of degrees of embeddedness and disembeddeness. An emerging theme is the interrelationship, inter-penetrability and variations of concepts of persons, commodities, and modes of exchange under particular market formations. This is most pronounced in recent movement towards post-structuralist theorizing that draws on Michel Foucault and Actor Network Theory and stress relational aspects of person-hood, and dependence and integration into networks and practical systems. Commodity network approaches further both deconstruct and show alternatives to the market models concept of commodities.|$|E

500|$|The {{aperture}} {{is generally}} large, varying from about two-fifths to one-third {{the height of}} the shell, often within the same population. Usually the lip is at least somewhat expanded, and in forms such as A. reflexilabris Schepman and A. winteri (Pfeiffer) var. inauris Fulton, the lip can only be called flaring. In A. perversus (Linnaeus) and most other thick-shelled species, the lip is internally thickened, forming a [...] "roll" [...] in its expansion, and has a very heavy parietal callus. In thin-shelled species, the lip is usually a simple reflected edge. The umbilical area can be partially open, nearly closed, or sealed. This feature sometimes <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> criterion for specific identification. The angle of the parietal wall varies, but no precise information on this has been compiled.|$|E

500|$|The 18-electron rule is the {{equivalent}} of the octet rule in main group chemistry and <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> guide for predicting the stability of organometallic compounds. It predicts that organometallic species [...] "in which the sum of the metal valence electrons plus the electrons donated by the ligand groups total 18 are likely to be stable." [...] This helps to explain the unusually high stability observed for ferrocene and for the cobalticinium and rhodocenium cations – all three species have analogous geometries and are isoelectronic 18-valence electron structures. The instability of rhodocene and cobaltocene are also understandable in terms of the 18-electron rule, in that both are 19-valence electron structures; this explains early difficulties in isolating rhodocene from rhodocenium solutions. The chemistry of rhodocene is dominated by the drive to attain an 18-electron configuration.|$|E
