5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but {{hundreds}} more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the creation of new selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|Mu'azzam's {{imprisonment}} was not severe, {{and indeed}} he {{was kept in}} the lap of luxury by his captors. This was the custom with regard to high-born and <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> captives, and it was quite normal for captive and captor to become friends and even allies. Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E

5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations {{are more or less}} stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{humidity}} {{are essential for}} optimum fruit body development, and growth is inhibited by either {{too much or too}} little light. Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The pure culture, cell division and the ultrastructure of A.vulgares hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> characters for phylogenetic analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.|$|E
30|$|In {{patients}} {{with prostate cancer}} with biochemical recurrence 68 Ga-PSMA detected more lesions than 11 C-Choline regardless of PSA levels.PET/CT-MRI (3.0  T) system is a feasible imaging modality that <b>potentially</b> adds <b>useful</b> relevant information with increased accuracy of diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|Coverage: a radar {{that covers}} more area can be <b>potentially</b> more <b>useful</b> than a radar that covers a limited sector. Most PSRs cover a 360° area {{and some are}} limited to sectors of 80 to 180° by their design.|$|R

5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E
5|$|Other insects {{commonly}} found on great mullein feed exclusively on Verbascum species in general or V.thapsus in particular. They include mullein thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the mullein moth (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the mullein plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures, like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including the stalk borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|E

5|$|The strongman behind Haakon's monarchy {{had been}} his foster-father Tore Tordsson ("Steigar-Tore"), who refused to {{recognise}} Magnus as king after Haakon's death. With Egil Aslaksson and other noblemen, he had the otherwise-unknown Sweyn Haraldsson set up as a pretender. Although later sagas maintain that Sweyn was Danish, some modern historians have speculated {{that he may have}} been a son of Harald Hardrada. The revolt was based in the Uplands, but also gained support from noblemen elsewhere in the country. After several weeks of fighting, Magnus captured Tore and his supporters and had them hanged on the island of Vambarholm (outside Hamnøy, Lofoten, in northern Norway). Magnus was reportedly furious because he could not pardon Egil, a <b>potentially</b> <b>useful,</b> young and resourceful nobleman. As king, his honour would only allow a pardon if other noblemen pleaded for Egil's life; this did not happen.|$|E

It is often used as the acetate ester prodrug 7-keto-DHEA acetate.|$|R
40|$|A Jacobi matrix with matrix entries is a self-adjoint block tridiagonal matrix with {{invertible}} blocks on the off-diagonals.

25|$|In {{spite of}} Ferrers's {{activities}} against Prince Edward's estates, his {{support in the}} North Midlands was <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> to King Henry, as was his money. Ferrers was released and, on paying 1500 marks, was given a pardon, his inheritance was secured, and mediation arranged in his quarrel with Prince Edward.|$|E
25|$|Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis, {{also known}} as the red-tailed flesh fly, is a fly in the Sarcophagidae family.

It is <b>potentially</b> <b>useful</b> in forensic entomology.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{difference between the}} paleopedological record and the fossil record {{of plants and animals}} is that very few of the soils found are extinct types.

25|$|Outward {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} is a new feature of Chinese globalization, where local Chinese firms seek to make investments in both developing and developed countries.
