5|$|Obesity <b>prevention</b> <b>programs</b> {{have been}} found to reduce the cost of {{treating}} obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of <b>prevention</b> <b>programs.</b> Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{well-known}} relevance of comorbidity, {{few studies have}} examined the impact of comorbid anxiety or externalizing symptoms on the prevention of depressive symptoms in adolescents. To replicate earlier positive effects of a cognitive-behavioral <b>prevention</b> <b>program</b> of depressive symptoms and to test the hypothesis that the <b>prevention</b> <b>program</b> would be less effective in adolescents with comorbid anxiety and externalizing symptoms, a study was conducted involving 301 8 th-grade students, randomly divided into an intervention group and a non-intervention control group. The randomized design included baseline, post-intervention, and 6 -month follow-up. The <b>prevention</b> <b>program</b> included 10 sessions held in a regular school setting. The <b>prevention</b> <b>program</b> showed positive effects on depressive symptoms, independent of comorbid symptoms. These effects were found mainly with girls independent of their depressive symptoms at baseline, and in part with boys with less severe depressive symptoms at baseline. Surprisingly, negative effects of the <b>prevention</b> <b>program</b> on depressive symptoms were found on the depression of boys with more severe depressive symptoms at baseline. The <b>prevention</b> <b>programâ€™s</b> low rate of attrition and high recruitment rate support the generalizability of the results...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} community-level HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>programming</b> for {{men who have sex}} with men. Methods. We used multilevel methods to examine unprotected intercourse by bisexual men (n= 1016) with male and female partners in geographic regions with and without HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>programming.</b> Results. Men living in geographic regions with HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>programming</b> had significantly less frequent unprotected homosexual intercourse with both casual and regular partners. In contrast, no differences were observed for un-protected heterosexual intercourse. Conclusions. This study provides evidence supporting the effectiveness of community-level HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>programming</b> and the need for its broader im-plementation. The study also demonstrates the suitability of multilevel methods for examining the effectiveness of community-level public health programs. (A...|$|R
5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime <b>prevention</b> <b>programs.</b> The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park is {{the site}} of many festivals, concerts, and special occasions. The Tulip Festival held every year since 1949 in Washington Park is {{highlighted}} by the blossoming of 200,000 tulips throughout the park. The African-American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest and since 1998 the Tulip Fest has also included the Mother of the Year award. The Latin Festival and the Columbus Day Parade and Italian Festival are some of the ethnic festivals held every year in the park. The city, the Albany Police Athletic League, and Hannaford supermarkets sponsor the Capital Holiday Lights every winter, with 125 displays through the park. Proceeds benefit juvenile crime <b>prevention</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and <b>prevention</b> <b>programs</b> and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} conducted sought {{to find the}} effect of the implementation of the Olweus Bullying <b>Prevention</b> <b>Program</b> on the academic performance of students in the third through eighth grade. The study examined the relationship between the implementation of the Olweus Bullying <b>Prevention</b> <b>Program</b> and the change in academic performance, as measured by the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessment. The post-test scores of third through fifth grade students from one elementary school which had implemented the <b>prevention</b> <b>program</b> were compared with the post-test scores for the same grade levels at an elementary school that had not implemented a bullying <b>prevention</b> <b>program.</b> The same comparison was made between a middle school that had implemented the Olweus program and a middle school that had not implemented a <b>prevention</b> <b>program.</b> The surveys from the two schools that had implemented the Olweus program demonstrated that both of the schools had experienced a significant decrease in the intensity and frequency of reported bullying behavior {{at the conclusion of the}} first year of the program. The reduction was most significant in the elementary school. A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted and the difference in adjusted means of the post assessment scores between the control and experimental groups was found to be significant. For the students that had not been involved in the bullying <b>prevention</b> <b>program,</b> the adjusted mean score was 215. 64, while those involved in the <b>prevention</b> <b>program</b> had an adjusted mean score of 217. 01...|$|R
