2500|$|When {{playing as}} Frodo, {{there are two}} meters on screen. One {{represents}} his health; the other represents his [...] "purity." [...] As soon as Frodo puts on the One Ring, he begins to draw the gaze of Sauron, and his purity begins to diminish. If the <b>purity</b> <b>meter</b> empties before he takes the Ring off, he will become corrupted, and the game will end. Once he removes the Ring, the meter will begin to fill again. [...] Gandalf also has two meters; health and magic spirit. As he uses magic, his spirit meter will begin to deplete. When it is empty, {{he can no longer}} cast spells. He can refill the meter by drinking miruvor. Aragorn has only one meter; his health bar.|$|E

5000|$|OAM {{multiplexing}} can not {{be implemented}} in the existing long-haul optical fiber systems, since these systems are based on single-mode fibers, which inherently do not support OAM states of light. Instead, few-mode or multi-mode fibers need to be used. Additional problem for OAM multiplexing implementation {{is caused by the}} mode coupling that is present in conventional fibers, which cause changes in the spin angular momentum of modes under normal conditions and changes in orbital angular momentum when fibers are bent or stressed. Because of this mode instability, direct-detection OAM multiplexing has not yet been realized in long-haul communications. In 2012, transmission of OAM states with 97% <b>purity</b> after 20 <b>meters</b> over special fibers was demonstrated by researchers at Boston University. [...] Later experiments have shown stable propagation of these modes over distances of 50 meters, and further improvements of this distance are the subject of ongoing work. Other ongoing research on making OAM multiplexing work over future fibre-optic transmission systems includes the possibility of using similar techniques to those used to compensate mode rotation in optical polarization multiplexing.|$|R
