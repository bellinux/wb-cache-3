5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E
25|$|In May 1951, {{faced with}} {{reports on the}} {{increasingly}} potential capability of, and thus the threat posed by, the growing Soviet strategic bomber fleet and that nation's newly developed atomic weapons, the British Air Ministry proceeded to draft an Operational Requirement, OR 301, which sought a rocket-powered interceptor that could attain an altitude of 60,000ft (18,300 m) in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Many of the <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> laid out by OR 301 {{was due to the}} anticipation of rapid increases in performance by the opposing Soviet aircraft; by the early 1960s, it was suspected that these bombers might well be capable of supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2 with a potential operational altitude as high as 80,000ft. Avro's design team promptly set about designing an suitable interceptor that conformed with the specification's requirements, which would result in the Avro 720 proposal. In addition, various other proposals from a number of companies were received, including Bristol, Blackburn, Shorts and Saunders-Roe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tax {{incentives}} {{offered to}} attract firms engaged in {{foreign direct investment}} are often tied to <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> such as domestic content restrictions. The tax competition literature has repeatedly shown that competition between municipalities for mobile firms tends to drive taxes to low levels. One would expect a comparable result for burdensome <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> Despite this, {{the evidence suggests that}} while taxes have indeed been driven down, <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> are as popular as ever. We explain this seeming conundrum by showing that in the presence of spillovers, binding <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> can act as a coordination device for firms. In equilibrium, municipalities choose <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> which maximize joint surplus from investment. Competition between municipalities then transfers this surplus to firms via tax subsidies...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on ways of {{defining}} the <b>requirements</b> for <b>performance</b> testing software, both in practice (based on survey) {{as well as in}} theory. The aim of this thesis is to analyze ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements,</b> which are actually used on IT projects. In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to define concepts of performance testing, implement and evaluate the survey of the using ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> in practice and then analyze ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> in terms of their applicability to different types of IT projects. The contribution of this thesis is the comprehensive introduction performance testing software issues and mainly insight into ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> used in practice and problems associated with them, through the survey, which was implemented and evaluated by myself. The conclusions resulting from this survey summarize which ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> are applied to specific types of IT projects, which of these ways worked and which problems in certain cases that occur in practice. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part explains the basic concepts associated with performance testing software. In this part, there is also described the methodology of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> according to Tom Gilb. The practical part {{is focused on}} the realization and evaluation of survey of the using ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> in practice and on the analysis ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> with respect to certain types of projects...|$|R
40|$|Underspecified <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> {{can cause}} <b>performance</b> {{issues in a}} {{software}} system. However, a complete, upfront analysis of a software system is difficult, and usually not desirable. We propose an evolutionary model for <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> specifications and corresponding validation testing. The principles of the model can be integrated into agile development methods. Using this approach, the <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> and test cases can be specified incrementally, without big upfront analysis. We also provide a post hoc examination of a development effort at IBM that had a high focus on <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> The examination indicates that our evolutionary model {{can be used to}} specify <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> such that the level of detail is commensurate with the nature of the project. Additionally, the IBM experience indicates that test driven development-type validation testing corresponding to the model can be used to determine if performance objectives have been met...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research that}} extends current {{knowledge in the}} area of business process re-design, with a specific focus on the 'Make Product' process within manufacturing organisations. Current business process re-design approaches offer only limited guidance on the specific changes that can be made to a process when re-designing it to achieve the desired performance improvements and often overlook any strategically derived <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> when re-designing the process. Case experience suggests that practitioners do not consider the <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> of their business processes when re-designing them and that the actions they take to achieve performance improvements are not selected with regard to any strategically derived <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> This exploratory research investigates whether relationships can be established between the changes that can be made to a process when re-designing it and the performance improvements gained by implementing those changes. It then questions whether those relationships can be used to help companies to select the appropriate process changes to implement in order to meet their specific <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements</b> and process changes (Process Improvement Actions) were derived from the relevant literature and included in a questionnaire designed to ascertain the strength of relationships between them. The questionnaire was subject to preliminary and pilot testing to improve validation and reliability prior to being administered to international business process re-design 'experts'. Statistical analysis of the questionnaire data resulted in a ranked list of Process Improvement Actions for each of the <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements.</b> These were presented in a format for inclusion in a process-based change handbook and enable the practitioner to set the agenda for the intervention and select the Process Improvement Actions {{on the basis of the}} <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements.</b> The <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements</b> should be derived from the strategy of the company or change programme so a strategic focus is maintained throughout re-design. It was also found that of the thirteen Process Improvement Actions included in the questionnaire just five are needed to achieve improvements in a majority (80 %) of the <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> This research showed that it is possible to establish links between <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements</b> and Process Improvement Actions and according to successful validation by practitioners, against an accepted model, that these can be used for business process re-design, laying foundations for future research in the area...|$|R
