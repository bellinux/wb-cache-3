50|$|Usually a red dye in dilute {{acetic acid}} is applied first to overstain all components. Then a <b>polyacid</b> {{is applied to}} remove the red dye from {{collagen}} and some other components by displacement. A second acid dye (blue or green) in dilute acetic acid is applied which, in turn, displaces the <b>polyacid,</b> resulting in collagen stained in a contrasting colour to the initial dye used. If erythrocytes are to be stained, a small molecular weight yellow or orange dye is applied before staining with the red dye. It is usually applied from a saturated solution in 80% ethanol and often in conjunction with picric acid (itself a dye) and a <b>polyacid.</b> The methods exploit minor differences in tissue reaction to dyes, density, accessibility and so on.|$|E

These <b>polyacids</b> were synthesized via a chain-transfer polymerization reaction using newly synthe-sized multi-arm chain-transfer agents. The cements formulated with the multi-arm <b>polyacids</b> showed significantly lower viscosities in water as compared to those formulated with the linear <b>polyacids.</b> Due to the lower viscosities, the MW of the <b>polyacids</b> can be significantly increased for enhanced mechanical strengths, while keeping the ease of mixing and handling. The experimental cements showed significantly improved compressive strengths as compared to Fuji II after aged in water for 3 months.

50|$|<b>Polyacids,</b> {{also known}} as anionic {{polymers}}, are polymers that have acidic groups. Examples of acidic functional groups include carboxylic acids (-COOH), sulfonic acids (-SO3H), phosphonic acids, and boronic acids. <b>Polyacids</b> accept protons at low pH values. At higher pH values, they deprotonate and become negatively charged. The negative charges create a repulsion that causes the polymer to swell. This swelling behavior is observed when the pH {{is greater than the}} pKa of the polymer.|$|R
40|$|Organic aerosol (OA) {{components}} are generally {{assumed to be}} liquid-like. Hence, to describe the partitioning of these components, the liquid vapor pressure of these components is desired. <b>Polyacids</b> and functionalized <b>polyacids</b> can be {{a significant part of}} OA. But often, measurements are available only for solid state vapor pressure, which can differ by orders of magnitude from their liquid counterparts. To convert such a sublimation pressure to a subcooled liquid vapor pressure, fusion properties (two out of these three quantities: fusion enthalpy, fusion entropy, fusion temperature) are required. Unfortunately, experimental knowledge of fusion properties is sometimes missing in part or totally, hence an estimation method is required. Several fusion data estimation methods are tested here against experimental data of <b>polyacids.</b> Next, we develop a simple estimation method, specifically for this kind of compounds, reducing significantly the estimation error...|$|R
50|$|Trichrome {{staining}} is a histological staining {{method that}} uses {{two or more}} acid dyes {{in conjunction with a}} <b>polyacid.</b> Staining differentiates tissues by tinting them in contrasting colours. It increases the contrast of microscopic features in cells and tissues, which makes them easier to see when viewed through a microscope.|$|E
50|$|Trichrome {{staining}} techniques employ {{two or more}} {{acid dyes}}. Normally acid dyes would stain the same basic proteins, but by applying them sequentially the staining pattern can be manipulated. A <b>polyacid</b> (such as phosphomolybdic acid or tungstophosphoric acid) is used to remove dye selectively. Polyacids are thought to behave as dyes with a high molecular weight: they displace easily removed dye from collagen.|$|E
5000|$|Trichrome stains {{in which}} dyes and a <b>polyacid</b> are applied {{sequentially}} are called multi-step trichromes. In [...] "one-step" [...] methods, all the dyes—with {{or without a}} polyacid—are combined in a single solution. One of the oldest single-step approaches to trichrome staining is van Gieson's method, which stains muscle and cytoplasm yellow, and collagen red. Another is the Gömöri trichrome stain, which closely mimics Masson's trichrome. In [...] "yellowsolve" [...] methods, a red dye in dilute acetic acid is first applied, then the section is very thoroughly dehydrated {{to ensure that no}} moisture remains. The red dye is then displaced by a yellow dye in a solvent, such as cellosolve (2-ethoxy-ethanol). The name yellowsolve is a blend of the terms yellow and cellosolve. Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine for cell inclusions is one example of a yellowsolve stain.|$|E

We hereby describe a simple, yet versatile, delivery platform based on physically cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) microgels (cross-linked via repetitive freeze/thaw cycling) containing entrapped dexamethasone-loaded poly(lacticco-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres for controlled delivery over a 1 -month period. The incorporation of <b>polyacids,</b> such as humic acids, Nafion, and poly(acrylic acid), was found to be crucial for attaining approximately zeroorder release kinetics, releasing 60 % to 75 % of dexamethasone within 1 month. Microspheres alone entrapped in the PVA hydrogel resulted in negligible drug release during the 1 -month period of investigation. On the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of the structure-property relationships of these hydrogel/microsphere composites, in conjunction with their in vitro release performance, it was concluded that these <b>polyacids</b> segregate on the PLGA microsphere surfaces and thereby result in localized acidity. These surface-associated <b>polyacids</b> appear to cause acid-assisted hydrolysis to occur from the surface inwards. Such systems show potential for a variety of localized controlled drug delivery applications such as coatings for implantable devices...|$|R
