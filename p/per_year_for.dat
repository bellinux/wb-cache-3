40|$|The spatiotemporal {{variability}} of the seasonal {{dynamics of the}} climate and vegetation index was analyzed, {{and the relationship between}} the vegetation index and various climate factors were explored (1982 - 2013) across the Tibetan Plateau. Severe variations in mean temperature, accumulated precipitation, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were observed in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter. It found that the maximum NDVI of the study area increased at rates of 0. 5 % <b>per</b> 10 <b>years</b> <b>for</b> spring (March-May), 0. 4 % <b>per</b> 10 <b>years</b> <b>for</b> summer (June-August), 1. 3 % <b>per</b> 10 <b>years</b> <b>for</b> autumn (September-November), and 0. 3 % <b>per</b> 10 <b>years</b> <b>for</b> winter (December-February). Moreover, the change trends for temperature and precipitation increased as a whole.

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> <b>For</b> other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases <b>per</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> a number of years.

5|$|In 2008, sports channel ESPN won {{the right}} to {{broadcast}} Bowl Championship Series games between 2011 and 2014. In compensation, it agreed to pay the BCS $125million per year, more than a competing bid from Fox ($100million), which had been paying $82.5million <b>per</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the contract that ended in 2010. To balance the higher cost of broadcasting the games, ESPN demanded more money for title sponsorship of each game. Shipping company FedEx, which had become the Orange Bowl's title sponsor in 1990 and was the longest continuous sponsor of any bowl game, balked at ESPN's increased demands—about $20million per year and required advertising outside the Orange Bowl—and ended its sponsorship.|$|E

Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that the mill was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that the bats would still have access after the restoration.|$|E

Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) <b>per</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> {{the first four years}} is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates.

5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2mm <b>per</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on the {{hospital}} would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 <b>per</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near Kilmainham and to build the new hospital, with the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out alms to the poor. By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new Dr Steevens' Hospital was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments. The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.|$|E
