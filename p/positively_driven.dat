60|$|There is {{the review}} {{intended}} {{to sell a}} book,--which comes out immediately after {{the appearance of the}} book, or sometimes before it; the review which gives reputation, but does not affect the sale, and which comes a little later; the review which snuffs a book out quietly; the review which is to raise or lower the author a single peg, or two pegs, as the case may be; the review which is suddenly to make an author, and the review which is to crush him. An exuberant Jones has been known before now to declare aloud that he would crush a man, and a self-confident Jones has been known to declare that he has accomplished the deed. Of all reviews, the crushing review is the most popular, as being the most readable. When the rumour goes abroad that some notable man has been actually crushed,--been <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> over by an entire Juggernaut's car of criticism till his literary body be a mere amorphous mass,--then a real success has been achieved, and the Alf of the day has done a great thing; but even the crushing of a poor Lady Carbury, if it be absolute, is effective. Such a review will not make all the world call for the 'Evening Pulpit', but it will cause those who do take the paper to be satisfied with their bargain. Whenever the circulation of such a paper begins to slacken, the proprietors should, as a matter of course, admonish their Alf to add a little power to the crushing department.|$|E

40|$|A Bayesian model {{averaging}} {{approach to}} the estimation of lag structures is introduced and applied {{to assess the impact}} of (R&D) on agricultural productivity in the United States from 1889 to 1990. Lag and structural break coefficients are estimated using a reversible jump algorithm that traverses the model space. In addition to producing estimates and standard deviations for the coefficients, the probability that a given lag (or break) enters the model is estimated. The approach is extended to select models populated with gamma distributed lags of different frequencies. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that R&D <b>positively</b> <b>drives</b> productivity. Gamma lags are found to retain their usefulness in imposing a plausible structure on lag coefficients, and their role is enhanced through the use of model averaging.

The reason these parts and their arrangement and method of operation are such important and valuable features of the invention is because their action is necessarily exceedingly rapid, and if the intermittingly-feeding mechanism were heavy, so as to have much inertia, or if any considerable portion of the film or either of the reels which support it were stopped and started at each transition from picture to picture there would be such strain brought to bear on the sprocket-holes in the film as would speedily tear it adjacent to such holes, thus ruining it...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are being used}} in many structural applications nowadays. To achieve maximum reliability and safety, {{it is necessary to}} perform fatigue tests that cover load cases from short intense lives up to long lasting lives with low stresses. The latter case leads to a high number of load cycles up to the very-high-cycle-fatigue regime beyond 10 ^ 7 loading cycles. Conservative testing methods use testing frequencies below 10 Hz to avoid specimen heating or strain-rate related effects in the material. This results in long testing times, and together with the needed number of specimens, very long testing campaigns. The only option to shorten this testing time is to raise the testing frequency by a significant factor. However, <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> test machines, like standard servo-hydraulic test rigs, have a limited testing frequency. To avoid this, the testing approach must be shifted from the <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> concept towards a resonantly driven concept. The specimen then becomes a part of the load-generating system and the entire test rig uses its own mass inertia rather than suppressing them. Following this approach, a two-mass-oscillator is presented to show the working principle. This principle is then validated against an analytic model of the oscillator. The control circuit is presented, that tracks the resonant frequency of the oscillator and maintains a constant stress amplitude in the specimen. The working principle of this nested controller is presented along with the ability to measure data over the fatigue-life of the specimen. Finally results of the fatigue test are shown...|$|E

We hypothesise that {{in a world where}} components of wealth are mentally treated as being non-fungible, the preference for high dividend-paying stocks by older investors means that the excess returns of high dividend-yielding stocks, relative to other stocks, should be positively related to demographic clientele variation. In particular, we find that, as consistent with the behavioural life-cycle hypothesis, the long-run returns of dividend-yield investment strategies are <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> by changes in the proportion of the older population. Our results are robust when controlled for the Fama-French factors, inflation rate, consumption growth rate, interest rates, time trend and alternative definitions of both dividend-yield strategies as well as demographic variation. ...|$|E

The major findings obtained by observing US REITs and REOCs from 1995 to 2010 are as follows. In accordance with the existing literature, cash and LOC reveal a substitute relationship. However, the calculus of financial flexibility and our findings suggest that leverage <b>positively</b> <b>drives</b> cash, which is consistent with Gamba and Triantis (2008), and also with the accepted perspective of debt minus cash being net debt (Spotlight A). Consequently, the very robust results indicate that leverage eliminates a significant amount of information.

40|$|Glaucoma {{and other}} optic neuropathies result in optic nerve {{degeneration}} {{and the loss}} of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) through complex signaling pathways. Although the mechanisms that regulate RGC development remain unclear, uncovering novel developmental pathways may support new strategies to regenerate the optic nerve or replace RGCs. Here we review recent studies that provide strong evidence that the Sry-related high-mobility-group C (SoxC) subfamily of transcription factors (TFs) are necessary and sufficient for axon guidance and RGC fate specification. These findings also uncover novel SoxC-dependent mechanisms that serve as master regulators during important steps of RGC development. For example, we review work showing that SoxC TFs regulate RGC axon guidance and direction through the optic chiasm towards their appropriate targets in the brain. We also review work demonstrating that Sox 11 subcellular localization is, in part, controlled through small ubiquitin-like post-translational modifier (SUMO) and suggest compensatory cross-talk between Sox 4 and Sox 11. Furthermore, Sox 4 overexpression is shown to <b>positively</b> <b>drive</b> RGC differentiation in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Finally, we discuss how these findings may contribute to the advancement of regenerative and cell-based therapies to treat glaucoma and other optic nerve neuropathies...|$|R

While earlier research found that the dividend premium is not driven by traditional clienteles derived from market imperfections such as taxes, transaction costs, or institutional investment constraints, we find empirical evidence that demographic clienteles are {{an important source of}} the time-varying demand for dividend payers. In particular, we find that, as consistent with the behavioural life-cycle theory and the marginal opinion theory of stock price, the dividend premium is <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> by demographic clientele variation represented by changes in the proportion of the older population.

This paper asks whether, in the presence of direct democratic institutions, spatial interactions additionally result from voters' direct actions. The proposed mechanism is that the voters' actions in vetoing a decision or inaugurating a preferred policy by a binding initiative in their jurisdiction can potentially have spillover effects on the actions of voters and special interest groups of neighboring jurisdictions. Utilizing data on around 1, 800 voter-petitions across over 12, 000 German municipalities in 2002 - 09, we find that a jurisdiction's probability of hosting a petition is <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> by the neighbors' direct democratic activity. These effects are persistent, and are stronger for more visible instruments of direct democracy. The interactions are also mostly driven by petitions in same or similar policy areas, and are stronger in towns with relatively more per capita newspapers...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the Ghanaian macroeconomy, this paper explores the {{monetary}} factors underlying the changing levels of remittance inflows, and the implications of remittance inflows for monetary aggregates, interest rate, exchange rate, and the domestic price level. The theoretical framework of the study is based on a modified variable-price Mundell-Fleming model. A five-variable Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model is estimated using quarterly data between 1983 (4) and 2005 (4). The estimated static long-run model shows that monetary aggregates, exchange rate, and interest rate positively impact on remittance inflows while domestic price level negatively impact on remittance inflows. Monetary aggregates, exchange rate, interest rate and domestic price level impact on one another while remittances <b>positively</b> <b>drive</b> itself, monetary aggregates, exchange rate and interest rate. The impulse response functions reveal that remittance inflows respond to its own shocks but not to shocks emanating from monetary aggregates, exchange rate, interest rate, and the price level. Variance decompositions show that, during the first quarter, remittances are self-driven. Since remittances are significantly impacted by monetary aggregates, exchange rate, interest rate, and the domestic price level, prudent monetary and exchange rate policies should be specially formulated and selectively conducted to attract international remittances to Ghana.

Corporations engage in naming rights deals in order to increase revenue and exposure for their brand. Naming rights deals are a very lucrative type of sports sponsorship and can reach to the tens of millions annually, largely due to the unparalleled amount of exposure seen by the corporation. Past research has suggested that the prices of naming rights are <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> by the potential target size of the audience, the building of a new facility, and {{that there has been a}} long-term price inflation of naming rights fees up until 2002.

One hundred sports facilities from Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, Minor League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and Division I College were observed. The findings in this thesis suggest that that total attendance has a positive and significant effect on both total and annual fees, facilities home to Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League, and National Hockey League teams have higher premiums than Major League Soccer, Minor League Baseball, and collegiate facilities, and annual long-term price inflation has decreased since 2002...|$|E

However, scarce information is available on how thinning may influence fire severity and vegetation regeneration in case a new fire occurs. We investigated the relationship between thinning and fire severity in P. halepensis thickets, and the effects on the establishment of pine seedlings and resprouting vigour in resprouter species {{the year after the}} fire. Our results show a positive relationship between forest basal area and fire severity, and thus reserved pines in thinned stands suffered less fire damage than those in un‐thinned sites (respectively, 2. 02 ± 0. 13 vs. 2. 93 ± 0. 15 in a scale from 0 to 4). Ultimately, differences in fire severity influenced post‐fire regeneration. Resprouting vigour varied depending on the species and the size of individuals but it was consistently higher in thinned stands. Concerning P. halepensis, the proportion of cones surviving the fire decreased with fire severity. However, this could not compensate the much lower pine density in thinned stands and thus the overall seed crop was higher in un‐thinned areas. Establishment of pine seedlings was negatively affected by the slope and <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> by the number of cones and thus it was higher in un‐thinned than in thinned stands (respectively, 2581 ± 649 vs. 898 ± 325 seedlings∙ha- 1).

40|$|The {{financial}} and banking crises {{around the world}} have prompted the regulators to revise, among others, the capital level of the banks to deal with the excessive risks taken by the banks, both conventional and Islamic. This study is the first attempt to investigate the relationship between risky assets and capital level in a mixed banking system applying the panel VECM and dynamic GMM estimators. The Malaysian mixed banking system is used as a case study taking panel data covering the period from December 2006 to October 2013. Our statistical results based on dynamic OLS (DOLS) tend to indicate that there is a positive relationship between the capital ratio (CAR) and risk weighted asset ratio (RWA) in the long run and also, the causality analysis based on panel VECM and two-step dynamic System GMM tends to indicate unidirectional causality in that the RWA is <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> by CAR. Our results appear to suggest that higher capital buffer (excess capital above regulatory capital requirement) might have opened up more space for bank managers to taking risky positions while assisted by increasing domestic demand for credit facilities under favorable economic condition of Malaysia. In other words, high capital growth and capital buffer provides an extra cushion for Malaysian banks to pursue relatively riskier financing activities. For the full-fledge Islamic banks (IB) and Islamic bank subsidiaries (IBS), the existence of a cointegrating relationship between RWA and CAR suggests that the way the managers of Islamic banks behave towards risky assets follows the conventional practice. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} relationships among buyer‐supplier trust, joint operational activities, and the degree of mass customization as well as the interactions between cultural factors (i. e. long‐term strategic alignment and autonomy) and trust in the context of supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: The model of trust is based on joint operational activities and mass customization using theories of social capital and the resource‐based view of the firm. Also, culture‐related antecedents of trust are identified. Based on 208 responses from suppliers in the USA and China, this study uses structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. Findings: This study empirically supports the notion that trust <b>positively</b> <b>drives</b> manufacturer‐supplier activities in operations. It also supports the claim that joint operational activities contribute to mass customization capabilities in a significant way. Moreover, two culture‐related antecedents are found to be significantly related to trust. Research limitations/implications: The sample is limited to the auto industry in North America and China. As in other supply chain studies, individual respondents may have somewhat limited information about different aspects of their company 2 ̆ 7 s supply chain. Practical implications: In general, it appears that trust is important in determining mass customization capabilities regardless of culture. For practitioners, long‐term strategic alignment is more important for firms to increase trust than autonomy although both can significantly increase the level of trust between buyer and supplier. Originality/value: Long‐term strategic alignment and autonomy are identified as antecedents of trust and empirically supported...|$|R
40|$|The Corporate Governance {{literature}} is highly contradictory {{on the role}} of board composition in determining corporate performance. Three contradictions have emerged: First, larger boards will have greater human capital and so will {{have a positive effect on}} performance due to the skills of the board members; Second larger board size would create coordination and free rider problems that detract from performance; and third, there is an inverted U shaped relationship between board size and performance. These contradictions are due to three key weaknesses. First earlier researchers do not bifurcate between different types of directors and study their independent effects on corporate performance. Second research is rarely longitudinal and rarely considers the number of board meetings conducted during the year. Third there has been lot of literature on the independence function of the non-executives but very little has been said about the role the related non-executives and non-executive chairman might play in particular. The independence role is better suited with the independent directors and the related non-executives often have to play two contradictory, non complementary roles, namely, resource dependency along with independence. This study resolves these three issues and finds that greater number of independent directors coupled with board meetings <b>positively</b> <b>drives</b> performance; related non-executive directors and the non-executive chairman negatively affects performance; and the total board size and executive directors do not bear any relationship with performance. These findings are discussed and several implications are drawn for theory, managers and regulators...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this study is}} that the news media in general strongly influence which topics determine the public agenda by their choice of what is considered newsworthy. The study is based on articles from two major Swedish daily newspapers, Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter.   The aim of our thesis is to establish how the environmental public debate as portrayed in the newspaper corresponds to the environmental discussion within the scientific (subject matter expert) field, that is taught by the academic institutions, or if the two materially differ. The environmental communication discourse at the academic institutions advocates ‘episodic’ formation as the driving force behind transformation of attitudes and behavioral preconceptions. This episodic formation is aimed at incentivizing change by creating intimacy to the incident by linking cause and consequence to the individual citizen instead of to society as a whole. The analysis consists of approximately 50 articles, all published in year 2010, and is based on CDA (Critical Discourse Analysis) where we sought to map out the discourses that frame the representation of environmental topics in these two daily newspapers.   The result shows that the newspapers account of environmental topics only weakly corresponds to the scientific account. The media representation mainly adopts a ‘thematic’ formation in which environmental topics are frequently approached by means of distancing itself or taking a broader and detached stance instead of a specific and attached link to the individual. The result thus shows that the newspapers discourse practice does not <b>positively</b> <b>drive</b> changes to attitudes and behaviors but rather reinforces the prevailing discourse and social posture in society. At the same time the analysis shows that the two newspapers form a forum where many different views and values are being voiced and where many different groups in society are represented in democratic spirit. Both supporting and inhibiting views are presented in this context. If the newspapers overall discourse practice promotes or inhibits transformation of the public’s environmental attitudes and behavior tends towards that ‘status quo’ is upheld at the expense of change. This despite, environmental topics are considered important by the Swedish public in general. ...|$|R
40|$|Cathepsin L proteases {{secreted}} by the helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica have {{functions in}} parasite virulence including tissue invasion and suppression of host immune responses. Using proteomics methods alongside phylogenetic studies we characterized {{the profile of}} cathepsin L proteases secreted by adult F. hepatica and hence identified those involved in host-pathogen interaction. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Fasciola cathepsin L gene family expanded {{by a series of}} gene duplications followed by divergence that gave rise to three clades associated with mature adult worms (Clades 1, 2, and 5) and two clades specific to infective juvenile stages (Clades 3 and 4). Consistent with these observations our proteomics studies identified representatives from Clades 1, 2, and 5 but not from Clades 3 and 4 in adult F. hepatica secretory products. Clades 1 and 2 account for 67. 39 and 27. 63 % of total secreted cathepsin Ls, respectively, suggesting that their expansion was <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> and that these proteases are most critical for parasite survival and adaptation. Sequence comparison studies revealed that the expansion of cathepsin Ls by gene duplication was followed by residue changes in the S 2 pocket of the active site. Our biochemical studies showed that these changes result in alterations in substrate binding and suggested that the divergence of the cathepsin L family produced a repertoire of enzymes with overlapping and complementary substrate specificities that could cleave host macromolecules more efficiently. Although the cathepsin Ls are produced as zymogens containing a prosegment and mature domain, all secreted enzymes identified by MS were processed to mature active enzymes. The prosegment region was highly conserved between the clades except at the boundary of prosegment and mature enzyme. Despite the lack of conservation at this section, sites for exogenous cleavage by asparaginyl endopeptidases and a Leu-Ser ↓ His motif for autocatalytic cleavage by cathepsin Ls were preserved. 13 page(s...|$|E

Pro 8 ̆ 5 t-seeking nancial customers would hold more HRC assets if their returns are expected to increase.

Meanwhile, holding HRC assets is risky because of exchange rate uctuations and higher volatility associated with high-return assets. Everything else equal, when nancial customers become more risk-loving, they would hold more HRC assets, which causes positive order ow toward the HRC and the currency appreciates. Thus, value of the HRC is <b>positively</b> <b>driven</b> by expected returns of HRC assets and investors risk appetite. The entire exchange rate dynamics is thus based directly on the 8 ̆ 5 nancial market structure as opposed to traditional macroeconomic variables.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The broad aim of {{this study}} is to find out if and how the market prices of energy {{commodities}} such as oil, gas, coal and electricity affect U. S. energy companies' corporate financing decisions. More specifically, the strategic and financial transaction types of interest include mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, and seasoned equity offerings. Considering companies whose core business is closely related to commodity-based products, the purpose is to investigate how the companies' financing needs, as well as other factors that could motivate equity issuance, are affected by developments in the commodity market. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The data used in the empirical part of the research comes from many sources, mainly SDC Platinum, Bloomberg Terminal and CRSP. M&A and equity offering data is confined to U. S. acquirers and issuers, and the sample covers a 34 -year time period between the years 1979 and 2012. The methodology for retrieving basic information about the data consists mainly of descriptive statistics and univariate tests, whereas the approach for testing the hypotheses includes methods such as bivariate and multiple OLS and beta regression analysis. Numerous robustness checks are performed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The key finding of this study is that the prices of various energy commodities significantly affect strategic and financial decisions made by energy companies. A strong relationship is found especially between the oil price and acquisitions as well as equity issues made by oil companies. Oil price <b>positively</b> <b>drives</b> M&A volume in the oil industry through its increasing effect on deal sizes. Acquirers are found to earn higher abnormal returns around acquisition announcements when the oil price is high and acquirers' own stock is included in the consideration paid to the targets. Acquirers recognize this opportunity and increase their use of stock payment when the oil price rises. Additionally, a higher oil price is associated with a larger number and value of IPOs by oil companies. Similarly, the volume of oil company SEOs increases when the oil price rises. This can be partly explained by a growing need for external capital required to finance new positive NPV investments, but evidence is more supportive of a dynamic that oil companies time equity issues opportunistically, as suggested by the result that the proportion of equity financing increases when the oil price rises...|$|R
40|$|As a bee forages for pollen and nectar, it acquires {{beneficial}} and pathogenic microbes from flowers. In human-influenced landscapes, {{variation in}} vegetative and floral diversity may therefore influence bee-microbe interactions. This study asks how {{variation in the}} resources available to bees in urban settings influences {{the composition of the}} microbiome and infection by fungal parasites in the Blue Orchard Bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees were installed and collected in 17 urban garden field sites in along the central coast of California. At each garden we measured local vegetation using random sampling in 1 x 1 m plots at the center of each garden. We determined landcover composition with ArcGIS. To determine if bee diversity influences microbiome composition, we measured bee diversity at each site using visual transects. At the time of bee installation, we also reared a subset of bees in sterile petri dishes as controls to determine if the environment is important for microbiome composition. In the lab, we used 16 S amplicon Illumina sequencing an average of 19 bees/garden and 10 control bees. We clustered sequences into OTUs and analyzed alpha and beta diversity using Qiime. We tested each bee for fungal infections by: Crithidia spp., Ascosphaera spp., Aspergillus spp., and Apicystis spp. We found 42, 104 distinct OTUs across all bees. To compare the community of microbes in bees from controls and bees sorted into experimental sites, we used NMDS ordination to plot differences in community composition (p< 0. 001), finding that the environment does confer a unique community of microbes to bees. When we categorized urban gardens into “urban” or “natural” landscapes we found that 40 bacterial OTUs were higher in abundance in bees from sites with urban landscapes (p< 0. 05). Bees from sites with urban landscapes also had a greater range of OTU alpha diversity (200 - 800 OTU) in comparison to bees form sites with predominately natural landscapes (200 - 450 OTU). We also found that urbanization also <b>positively</b> <b>drives</b> bee species richness (p= 0. 051), and that this bee diversity is positively correlated with OTU richness in O. lignia (p= 0. 007), suggesting that urbanization-mediated increases in bee diversity influences increases in microbiome diversity. In understanding the implications of this finding, {{it is important to note}} that while the microbiome is important for bee health, a diversity of microbiomes is not necessarily “better”: some microbes are pathogenic, microbes can compete for resources, and diversity has not been experimentally addressed...|$|R

As a source of media, pro-anorexia websites have detrimental effects similar {{to other forms of}} media (e. g., magazines, TV). In addition, friends may be influencing one another to view these websites, thus increasing the risk of developing a drive for thinness in women and a drive for muscularity in men. Approximately 300 male and female undergraduate psychology students responded to questionnaires assessing: viewership and use of pro-anorexia websites, influence of friends to view pro-anorexia websites, drive for muscularity, and drive for thinness. Results showed viewership of pro-anorexia websites was <b>positively</b> correlated with <b>drive</b> for thinness in women, and negatively correlated with drive for muscularity in men. Pro-anorexia websites were found to be the only predictor of both drive for thinness in women and drive for muscularity in men...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{there are}} more and more {{professionals}} who are or will be transitioning into new geographies, industries, companies, roles and, most importantly, new lives. Some current studies indicate that increasing the number of transitions has a negative correlation with a person’s sense of well-being. But some professionals experience an increase in well-being. Although there is an abundance of literature about coping strategies and adaptation for those in the first, negatively affected group, there is little written about individuals who thrive while transitioning. This paper reports on a qualitative study of the second, <b>positively</b> affected group, <b>driven</b> by motivations beyond seeking earnings maximization and who are not purely capitalist oriented in order to: 1) characterize lived experiences of thriving in multiple transitions; 2), explain mechanisms associated with thriving in an age of flux; and 3) develop a model of cognitive processes displayed by professionals who thrive from experiencing multiple transitions.

40|$|The PDZ {{domains of}} the trimeric DegS {{protease}} bind unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) that accumulate in the Escherichia coli periplasm. This cooperative binding reaction triggers a proteolytic cascade that activates a transcriptional stress response. To dissect {{the mechanism of}} allosteric activation, we generated hybrid DegS trimers with different numbers of PDZ domains and/or protease-domain mutations. By studying the chemical reactivity and enzymatic properties of these hybrids, we show that all subunits experience a strongly coupled energetic landscape. For example, OMP peptide binding to a single PDZ domain stimulates active site chemical modification and proteolytic cleavage in the attached and neighboring protease domains. OMP peptide binding relieves inhibitory PDZ interactions, whereas the interfaces between protease domains in the trimeric DegS core mediate <b>positively</b> cooperative activation <b>driven</b> by both substrate binding and inhibition relief.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Economics) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Using an econometric {{approach}} on panel {{data collected from}} 53 microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Uganda {{over a period of}} six years (annual), this study has identified the determinants of sustainability and outreach of MFIs. In addition, the study has also used survey data from 31 non-Bank of Uganda (BOU) regulated MFIs or Tier 4 MFIs, four BOU-regulated non-bank MFIs, 12 commercial banks and the BOU itself to assess the effects of financial regulation of MFIs on their sustainability and outreach. The results indicate that sustainability is <b>positively</b> and significantly <b>driven</b> by real effective lending rates and age of an MFI, and negatively by the ratio of gross outstanding loan portfolio to total assets, the ratio of average loan size to the national per capita income, the unit cost of loans disbursed, and a group-based delivery mechanism compared to an individual-based delivery mechanism. Outreach is <b>positively</b> and significantly <b>driven</b> by an MFI being a savings and credit co-operative (SACCO) compared to being a private company, effectiveness of governance, the age of an MFI, the ratio of gross outstanding loan portfolio to total assets, and the ratio of salary/wage paid to staff to the national per capita income, and negatively by the ratio of average loan size to the national per capita income and the unit cost of loans disbursed. In the short run, financial regulation negatively influences the outreach of MFIs, but positively affects their sustainability. In the long term, financial regulation positively influences both the sustainability and the outreach of MFIs. The results suggest a number of policy options. First, the MFIs should focus on the real effective lending rate, given its significance in their sustainability. Second, for a real effective lending rate to be relatively low, the rate of inflation should be low. This calls for prudent monetary policy management by the government. Thirdly, {{the cost of doing business}} should be kept low. This calls for prudence in business management by the MFIs and creating a cost-effective business environment by the government. While the results are tentative, in order to expand outreach more SACCOs should be established and the MFIs should commit more funds to lending purposes compared to other investments. Finally, before enacting financial legislation, it is important that its benefits and costs are adequately assessed to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs both in the short and long term...|$|R

Data {{analysis and}} results [...] Chapter 5. Discussion and implications [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion. Identifying leadership and management factors that drive both superior performance and sustainability in firms {{has become an}} important quest for both academics and business practitioners. Scholars frequently affirm the importance of leadership for enhancing superior performance and organisational sustainability. However, empirical {{research in this field}} is currently lacking, particularly in the context of SMEs and in emerging economies. The key purpose of this thesis is to bridge the above 2 gaps in knowledge about predictive relationships between various leadership, management processes and performance outcomes towards organisational sustainability. The theoretical framework is built on Avery and Bergsteiner's (2010, 2011 a) Sustainable Leadership (SL) framework, which identifies a set of 23 'Honeybee' practices underpinning organisational sustainability and superior outcomes for organisational sustainability (SPO) in enterprises. Validated questionnaire data were gathered from over 1, 500 senior executives and employees of more than 360 small and medium-sizrd enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand. The theoretical framework is built on Avery and Bergsteiner‟s (2010, 2011 a) Sustainable Leadership (SL) framework, which identifies a set of 23 „Honeybee‟ practices underpinning organisational sustainability and superior performance outcomes for organisational sustainability (SPO) in enterprises. Validated questionnaire data were gathered from over 1, 500 senior executives and employees of more than 360 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand using a cross-sectional design. Thailand was chosen as the location for the research because organisations in emerging economies often seek to raise their global competitiveness, sustainability and performance. In a translated and slightly adapted version of Avery and Bergsteiner‟s (2010, 2011 a) Sustainable Leadership Questionnaire, multiple item scales assessed organisational leadership practices and the various SPO measures as perceived by senior executives and employees in each organisation. The four research questions are: 1. What are the essential leadership and management factors derived from SL that underlie organisational sustainability in the context of Thai SMEs? 2. Which underlying leadership and management factors derived from SL predict enhanced performance outcomes for organisational sustainability as assessed by Sustainability Performance Outcomes (SPO) ? 3. To what extent do underlying leadership and management factors derived from SL contribute to performance outcomes for organisational sustainability based on SPO in Thai SMEs? 4. Are there any differences in perceptions between senior executives (organisational leaders) and employees about which underlying leadership and management factors derived from SL predict enhanced performance outcomes for organisational sustainability based on SPO in Thai SMEs? If any, what are the differences?Data were analysed using several multivariate techniques, mainly exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multiple regression analysis and t-test statistic. The findings offer several insights including the following. First, this research uncovers 10 valid and reliable factor solutions that are considered essential leadership and management factors underlying organisational sustainability in the Thai SME context. Second, the thesis identifies five statistically significant factors among these leadership and management factors (i. e. valuing people/HRM, long-term perspective, empowerment, high quality and innovation) that positively predict enhanced financial performance outcomes (FPOs) and overall sustainability performance outcomes (SPOs), albeit in varying combinations and to different degrees. Third, the study reveals that senior executives and employees have different perceptions as to which of the essential leadership and management factors identified <b>positively</b> <b>drive</b> superior financial performance and organisational sustainability. Overall, it is evident in this thesis that these five leadership and management factors are the significant key drivers of, and contributors to, enhanced financial performance, long-term corporate success and organisational sustainability, in the context of Thai SMEs. Thus, the thesis answers the research questions it set out to investigate, thereby contributing to new knowledge. Findings and implications from the thesis make significant contributions to the existing literature for both academics and practitioners. Limitations are also acknowledged and directions for future research outlined. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xiii, 289 leaves...|$|R
