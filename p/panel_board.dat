50|$|Thus, in {{the early}} days of <b>panel</b> <b>board</b> systems, alarms were {{regulated}} by both real estate, and cost. In essence, they were limited by the amount of available board space, and the cost of running wiring, and hooking up an annunciator (horn), indicator (light) and switches to flip to acknowledge, and clear a resolved alarm. It was often the case that if you wanted a new alarm, you had to decide which old one to give up.|$|E

50|$|As {{technology}} developed, {{the control}} system and control methods were tasked to continue to advance {{a higher degree of}} plant automation with each passing year. Highly complex material processing called for highly complex control methodologies. Also, global competition pushed manufacturing operations to increase production while using less energy, and producing less waste. In the days of the <b>panel</b> <b>boards,</b> a special kind of engineer was required to understand a combination of the electronic equipment associated with process measurement and control, the control algorithms necessary to control the process (PID basics), and the actual process that was being utilised to make the products. Around the mid 80's, we entered the digital revolution. Distributed control systems (DCS) were a boon to the industry. The engineer could now control the process without having to understand the equipment necessary to perform the control functions. <b>Panel</b> <b>boards</b> were no longer required, because all of the information that once came across analogue instruments could be digitised, stuffed into a computer and manipulated to achieve the same control actions once performed with amplifiers and potentiometers.|$|R

5000|$|Architectural wiring {{diagrams}} show the approximate locations and interconnections of receptacles, lighting, and permanent electrical {{services in a}} building. Interconnecting wire routes may be shown approximately, where particular receptacles or fixtures must be on a common circuit. Wiring diagrams use standard symbols for wiring devices, usually different from those used on schematic diagrams. The electrical symbols not only show where something is to be installed, but also what type of device is being installed. For example, a surface ceiling light is shown by one symbol, a recessed ceiling light has a different symbol, and a surface fluorescent light has another symbol. Each type of switch has a different symbol {{and so do the}} various outlets. There are symbols that show the location of smoke detectors, the doorbell chime, and thermostat. On large projects symbols may be numbered to show, for example, the <b>panel</b> <b>board</b> and circuit to which the device connects, and also to identify which of several types of fixture are to be installed at that location.|$|E

50|$|Quality. Combining {{traditional}} building techniques, quality {{manufacturing and}} third-party agencies who offer random inspections, testing, and certification services for quality control, commercial modular buildings are built in strict accordance with appropriate local, state, and national regulations and codes. Due {{to the need}} to transport modules to the final site, each module must be built to independently withstand travel and installation requirements. Thus the final module-to-module assembly of independently durable components can yield a final product that is more durable than site-built structures. Modular buildings often use Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) in construction, which offer a range of advantages over traditional building materials. SIPs panels are a light yet durable combination of <b>panel</b> <b>board</b> and either closed-cell polyurethane (PU) or expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulating foam. They are air-tight, and as such provide excellent thermal performance. They also offer superior damp and cold resistance when compared to timber and other materials, and are immune to both compression shrinking and cold bridging. Modular units may also be designed to fit in with external aesthetics of any existing building and modular units once assembled can be virtually indistinguishable from a site-built structure.|$|E
50|$|As a side effect, {{that also}} meant that alarms were easy and cheap to {{configure}} and deploy. You simply typed in a location, a value to alarm on and set it to active. The unintended result was that soon people alarmed everything. Initial installers set an alarm at 80% and 20% of the operating range of any variable just as a habit. The integration of programmable logic controllers, safety instrumented systems, and packaged equipment controllers {{has been accompanied by}} an overwhelming increase in associated alarms. One other unfortunate part of the digital revolution was that what once covered several square yards of real estate, now had to be fit into a 17 inch computer monitor. Multiple pages of information was thus employed to replicate the information on the replaced <b>panel</b> <b>board.</b> Alarms were utilised to tell an operator to go look at a page he was not viewing. Alarms were used to tell an operator that a tank was filling. Every mistake made in operations usually resulted in a new alarm. With the implementation of the OSHA 1910 regulations, HAZOPS studies usually requested several new alarms. Alarms were everywhere. Incidents began to accrue as a combination of too much data collided with too little useful information.|$|E
50|$|Alarms {{were added}} to alert the {{operator}} to a condition {{that was about to}} exceed a design limit, or had already exceeded a design limit. Additionally, Emergency Shut Down (ESD) systems were employed to halt a process that was in danger of exceeding either safety, environmental or monetarily acceptable process limits. Alarm were indicated to the operator by annunciator horns, and lights of different colours. (For instance, green lights meant OK, Yellow meant not OK, and Red meant BAD.) Panel boards were usually laid out in a manner that replicated the process flow in the plant. So instrumentation indicating operating units with the plant was grouped together for recognition sake and ease of problem solution. It was a simple matter to look at the entire <b>panel</b> <b>board,</b> and discern whether any section of the plant was running poorly. This was due to both the design of the instruments and the implementation of the alarms associated with the instruments. Instrumentation companies put a lot of effort into the design and individual layout of the instruments they manufactured. To do this they employed behavioural psychology practices which revealed how much information a human being could collect in a quick glance. More complex plants had more complex panel boards, and therefore often more human operators or controllers.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Immunology is a vast, {{complex and}} {{challenging}} subject. To facilitate students ’ understanding, {{the authors have}} created a T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte self-tolerance game.

Students had to associate mechanisms of self-tolerance with the corresponding cardboard pieces. In total, 120 students attended the session. Of these, 95. 8 % considered that the <b>panel</b> <b>board</b> facilitated their understanding; 95 % affirmed they understood how T- and B-lymphocyte self-tolerance worked.

40|$|Purpose: Our {{teaching}} experience {{has shown that}} dealing with the molecular aspects of the immune response regulation poses several difficulties. Therefore, we developed a <b>panel</b> <b>board</b> to verify {{whether or not this}} active-learning exercise could enhance students’ learning and arouse their interest in subjects that are basically theoretical and complex. Methods: Twenty cardboard pieces labeled with the names of major regulators of the immune response and three panel boards with explanations on how major regulators work. Students had to match the cardboard pieces with the corresponding explanation. Results: One hundred forty students participated in this study. The overall response of the students to the game was very positive: 95. 71 % considered the <b>panel</b> <b>board</b> interesting and 95 % said the <b>panel</b> <b>board</b> facilitated the understanding of the subject matter. The students’ grades significantly improved (P< 0. 0001).
