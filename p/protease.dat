5|$|Serpins are a {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} with similar structures that were first identified for their <b>protease</b> inhibition activity and {{are found in}} all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine <b>protease</b> inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target <b>protease</b> by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site. This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for <b>protease</b> inhibitors that bind to and block access to the <b>protease</b> active site.|$|E
5|$|Since the RCL {{is still}} covalently {{attached}} to the <b>protease</b> via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls <b>protease</b> from the top {{to the bottom of}} the serpin and distorts the catalytic triad. The distorted <b>protease</b> can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the <b>protease</b> remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single <b>protease,</b> and can only function once.|$|E
5|$|Some serpins {{are both}} <b>protease</b> inhibitors and perform {{additional}} roles. For example, the nuclear cysteine <b>protease</b> inhibitor MENT, in birds also {{acts as a}} chromatin remodelling molecule in a bird's red blood cells.|$|E

Cell growth and death, blood clotting, and immune defense are all examples of the importance of <b>proteases</b> in maintaining homeostasis. There is growing interest in <b>proteases</b> due to their use for industrial purposes. The search for <b>proteases</b> with specific characteristics is designed to reduce production costs and to find suitable properties for certain industrial sectors, as well as good producing organisms. Ninety percent of commercialized <b>proteases</b> are obtained from microbial sources and <b>proteases</b> from macromycetes have recently gained prominence in the search for new enzymes with specific characteristics. The production of <b>proteases</b> from saprophytic basidiomycetes has led to the identification of various classes of <b>proteases.</b> The genus Pleurotus has been extensively studied because of its ligninolytic enzymes. The characteristics of this genus are easy cultivation techniques, high yield, low nutrient requirements, and excellent adaptation. There are few studies in the literature about <b>proteases</b> of Pleurotus spp. This review gathers together information about <b>proteases,</b> especially those derived from basidiomycetes, and aims at stimulating further research about fungal <b>proteases</b> because of their physiological importance and their application in various industries such as biotechnology and medicine...|$|R

5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} <b>protease</b> {{functions}} in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) {{is used in}} order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine <b>protease</b> caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine <b>protease.</b>|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the <b>protease</b> inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a <b>protease</b> inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV <b>protease,</b> it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University of Idaho has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, Mimulus lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} <b>protease</b> activity, though {{it is unclear whether}} the <b>protease</b> is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited <b>protease</b> activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for nutrient absorption activity. Both of these latter species displayed an ability to digest and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E
50|$|Aspartyl <b>proteases</b> are {{a highly}} {{specific}} family of <b>proteases</b> - {{they tend to}} cleave dipeptide bonds that have hydrophobic residues {{as well as a}} beta-methylene group. Unlike serine or cysteine <b>proteases</b> these <b>proteases</b> do not form a covalent intermediate during cleavage. Proteolysis therefore occurs in a single step.|$|R
50|$|De{{ubiquitin}}ating enzymes (DUBs), {{also known}} as deubiquitinating peptidases, deubiquitinating isopeptidases, deubiquitinases, ubiquitin <b>proteases,</b> ubiquitin hydrolases, ubiquitin isopeptidases, are {{a large group of}} <b>proteases</b> that cleave ubiquitin from proteins and other molecules. Ubiquitin is attached to proteins in order to regulate the degradation of proteins via the proteasome and lysosome; coordinate the cellular localisation of proteins; activate and inactivate proteins; and modulate protein-protein interactions. DUBs can reverse these effects by cleaving the peptide or isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and its substrate protein. In humans there are nearly 100 DUB genes, which can be classified into two main classes: cysteine <b>proteases</b> and metalloproteases. The cysteine <b>proteases</b> comprise ubiquitin-specific <b>proteases</b> (USPs), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), Machado-Josephin domain <b>proteases</b> (MJDs) and ovarian tumour <b>proteases</b> (OTU). The metalloprotease group contains only the Jab1/Mov34/Mpr1 Pad1 N-terminal+ (MPN+) (JAMM) domain <b>proteases.</b>|$|R

In yeast, the USPs are known as ubiquitin-specific-processing <b>proteases</b> (UBPs).|$|R

5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV <b>protease</b> and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine <b>protease</b> triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus <b>protease),</b> whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
50|$|Cysteine <b>proteases,</b> {{also known}} as thiol <b>proteases,</b> are enzymes that degrade proteins. These <b>proteases</b> share a common {{catalytic}} mechanism that involves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad.|$|R
40|$|Cysteine <b>proteases</b> (CPs) are {{responsible}} for many biochemical processes occurring in living organisms {{and they have been}} implicated in the development and progression of several diseases that involve abnormal protein turnover.

The main aim of this review is to discuss the structure–activity relationships of cysteine <b>proteases</b> and cystatins, as well as of some synthetic inhibitors of cysteine <b>proteases</b> structurally based on the binding fragments of cystatins. CYSTEINE PROTEASES (CPs) <b>Proteases</b> are classified according to their catalytic site into four major classes: serine <b>proteases,</b> cysteine <b>proteases,</b> aspartic <b>proteases</b> and metallo-proteases [1, 2].

5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a <b>protease,</b> {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer <b>protease</b> inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|In some rare cases, {{a single}} amino acid {{change in a}} serpin's RCL alters its {{specificity}} to target the wrong <b>protease.</b> For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) causes the α1-antitrypsin serpin to inhibit thrombin, causing a bleeding disorder.|$|E
5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate {{cell signalling}} events. In these cases, a serpin that {{has formed a}} complex with its target <b>protease,</b> is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells {{to the presence of}} <b>protease</b> activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the antigenic variation and relationships of immunoglobulin A 1 (IgA 1) <b>proteases</b> among different species and genera, we examined a comprehensive collection of serine type and metallo-type IgA 1 <b>proteases</b> and corresponding antisera in enzyme neutralization assays. Sharing of neutralizing epitopes of metallo-type IgA 1 <b>proteases</b> from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus oralis and of serine type IgA 1 <b>proteases</b> from Haemophilus and pathogenic Neisseria species was extremely limited. A number of limited to strong cross-reactions in such epitopes were found among serine type IgA 1 <b>proteases</b> released {{by members of}} the genera Haemophilus and Neisseria, reflecting the common origin of their iga gene. However, the relatively limited prevalence of shared "neutralizing" epitopes of IgA 1 <b>proteases</b> from the two genera indicates that they rarely induce immunity to each other. In contrast, extensive sharing of neutralizing epitopes was found between N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae IgA 1 <b>proteases,</b> making them potentially attractive vaccine components.

5|$|Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit {{their target}} proteases by the typical {{competitive}} (lock-and-key) mechanism used by most small <b>protease</b> inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual conformational change, which disrupts {{the structure of}} the <b>protease</b> and prevents it from completing catalysis. The conformational change involves the RCL moving to {{the opposite end of the}} protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra antiparallel β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).|$|E
5|$|Most serpins are <b>protease</b> inhibitors, {{targeting}} extracellular, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases {{possess a}} nucleophilic serine residue in a catalytic triad in their active site. Examples include thrombin, trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease's catalytic mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a <b>protease.</b> Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target <b>protease.</b> Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E

30|$|<b>Proteases</b> {{are present}} in all living forms as they are {{involved}} in various metabolic processes. They are mainly involved in hydrolysis of the peptide bonds (Gupta et al. 2002). <b>Proteases</b> are classified into six types based on the functional groups in their active sites. They are aspartic, cysteine, glutamic, metallo, serine, and threonine <b>proteases.</b> They are also classified as exo-peptidases and endo-peptidases, based on the position of the peptide bond cleavage. <b>Proteases</b> find a wide range of applications in food, pharmaceutical, leather and textile, detergent, diagnostics industries and also in waste management (Rao et al. 1998). Thus, they contribute to almost 40 % of enzyme sales in the industrial market.

5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a <b>protease,</b> it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the <b>protease.</b>|$|E

Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E
5|$|The <b>protease</b> {{targets of}} {{intracellular}} inhibitory serpins {{have been difficult}} to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins may be to protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic granule <b>protease</b> granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.|$|E
