40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimal continuous time dynamic consumption and portfolio choice for pooled annuity funds. A pooled annuity fund constitutes an alternative {{way to protect}} against mortality risk compared to purchasing a life annuity. The crucial difference between the pooled annuity fund and purchase of a life annuity offered by an insurance company is that participants of a pooled annuity fund still have to bear some mortality risk while insured annuitants bear no mortality risk at all. The population of the pool is modeled by employing a Poisson process with time-dependent hazard-rate. It follows that the pool member’s optimization problem has {{to account for the}} stochastic investment horizon and for jumps in wealth which occur if another <b>pool</b> <b>member</b> dies. In case the number of pool members goes to infinity analytical solutions are provided. For finite pool sizes the solution of the optimization problem is reduced to the numerical solution of a set of ODEs. A simulation and welfare analysis show that pooled annuity funds insure very effectively against longevity risk even if their pool size is rather small. Only very risk averse investors or those without access to small pools are more inclined to pay a risk premium to access private life annuity markets in order to lay off mortality risk completely. As even families constitute such small pools the model provides theoretical justification for the low empirical annuity demand...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of urban traffic congestion calls for studying alternative measures for mobility management, {{and one of}} these measures is carpooling. In theory, these systems could lead to great reductions {{in the use of}} private vehicles; however, in practice they have obtained limited success for two main reasons: the psychological barriers associated with riding with strangers and poor schedule flexibility. To overcome some of the limitations of the traditional schemes, we proposed studying a carpooling club model with two main new features: establishing a base trust level for carpoolers to find compatible matches for traditional groups {{and at the same time}} allowing to search for a ride in an alternative group when the <b>pool</b> <b>member</b> has a trip schedule different from the usual one. A web-based survey was developed for the Lisbon Metropolitan Region (Portugal), including a Stated Preference experiment, to test the concept and confirm previous knowledge on these systems' determinants. It was found through a binary logit Discrete Choice Model calibration that carpooling is still attached with lower income strata and that saving money is still an important reason for participating in it. The club itself does not show promise introducing more flexibility in these systems; however, it should provide a way for persons to interact and trust each other at least to the level of working colleagues.

40|$|Uninsurable risks have {{significant}} impact on expenses of private and public sectors of economy. In spite of several commercial insurance products and high quality of insurance services current trend of insurance industry is set to define exceptions of insurance protection. The highest losses caused by realization of uninsurable risks in the Czech Republic are constituted by consequences of floods, deluges and overflows. Recent history of flood occurrence emphasizes insufficiency of prevention, protection and loss solution. Due to these risk factors we have focused our research on issues of uninsurable risks in conditions of the Czech insurance market. The system solution is based on fund approach to ensure commercial insurance protection. Multi-Source System Solution of Uninsurable Risks is purposed {{in the form of}} fund with participation of the state authority. Our solution depends on pool creation and primarily should cover enormous claims development. Assumption of fund profitability encourages insurer motivation to become a <b>pool</b> <b>member.</b> Important part of research represents calculation of gross premium. Assessment of input data and calculation of premium are based on real published data and conform to real market development in the Czech Republic. Calculations are also based on our estimations of risk development. This research highlights the importance of uninsurable risks solution. Effective instrument able to protect lives and property is an innovative commercial insurance product. Our commercial solution is a way to strengthen the role of insurance in a field of uninsurable risks. The system solution is designed to conditions of the Czech insurance market and takes into account special domestic factors. We suppose that our solution is possible to be adopted in conditions of any insurance market in case of relevant data and risk factors using...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} technology-sharing arrangements, {{the incentives}} {{to join them}} {{and the type of}} products that develop when they are anticipated. Particular attention is given to patent <b>pools</b> that admit <b>members</b> with overlapping ownership; that is, patentees with a stake in both complementary pooled inputs and downstream products that do not depend on the pool but compete with products that do. We ask whether this ownership structure under which <b>pool</b> <b>members</b> are vertically and horizontally related, facilitates anticompetitive price collusion. In a Bertrand framework it is shown that if the downstream products inside and outside the pool are strategic complements, then technology-sharing agreements are both privately and socially efficient in making the market more competitive, although prices increase in the degree to which <b>pool</b> <b>members</b> are involved in competing products. For strong substitutes and asymmetric outside ownership, efficient patent pools may not be profitable in which case allowing full coordination in which the pool sets the prices of both inside and outside products owned by its members will encourage the formation of efficient pools and, possibly, the selection of more complementary products. In analyzing the efficiencies of cooperative agreements for sharing technologies, this paper makes a case for incorporating private incentives to cooperate, as well as to innovate and litigate, into the debate on effective systems for encouraging innovation and its diffusion.

40|$|Regulators favor patent pools as {{a remedy}} for {{overlapping}} patent grants and excessive litigation. With patent <b>pools,</b> <b>member</b> firms share patents freely {{with each other and}} offer one-stop licenses to outside firms. Thus patent pools are expected to encourage innovation by reducing litigation between <b>pool</b> <b>members</b> and lowering transaction costs for outside firms. We examine this prediction at the example of the first patent pool in U. S. history, the Sewing Machine Combination (1856 - 1877). Our data confirm that member firms patent more in the years leading up to the pool; they do however, patent less as soon as the pool is established. To examine the pool’s effect on innovation, we construct an objective measure of improvements in the performance of sewing machines. These data show that innovation slowed {{for the duration of the}} pool and only increased again after the pool had expired. Why might pools slow innovation? Our data suggest that the sewing machine pool discouraged innovation by increasing the threat of litigation for outside firms. They also indicate that outside firms shifted towards inferior technologies. We wish to thank the Wisconsin State Historical society for granting access to the Singer Archives, an...|$|R
40|$|In the {{competitive}} {{environment of the}} aviation industry, it is paramount to secure aircraft availability by providing the aircraft fleet with efficient component support. The availability services {{in general and the}} aircraft component support in particular are examined in this study under the topics of demand fragmentation, cost structure of the availability services, benefits of inventory pooling and potential ways to implement inventory pooling. Each topic is discussed in a separate paper. One of the most important factors in the airline operation is the availability of aircraft for their scheduled missions, i. e. the technical dispatch reliability. It is kept at an adequate level by the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) function in the airline. This is accomplished by replacing failed units, i. e. aircraft components, quickly by functional units and repairing the failed ones afterwards. This allows the aircraft to continue operation immediately without waiting for the repair work to be finished. The demand for aircraft component availability services is inherently fragmented. Airlines operate with varied fleets from a multitude of hubs and have a strong interest in keeping the spare units that support their fleets as close as possible. In contrast, the availability services would significantly benefit from demand consolidation, as the demand is caused by a random phenomenon of component failures. While the cost pressures in the airline industry require efficiency improvements in the availability services, they have to be performed without compromising dispatch reliability. The airline fleet structure has {{a significant impact on the}} airline costs and particularly on the demand fragmentation of the component availability services. Numerical methods are presented here for measuring the uniformity of an aircraft fleet and its potential for achieving scale economies. Considering one airline providing the spare components for its operations in-house, the scale of its fleet determines the cost level of the availability service. When several airlines operate in the same region, the scale of their total fleet determines the potential for achieving scale economies by cooperative arrangements between those airlines. This study includes an empirical analysis of the full history of all commercial jet aircraft. The analysis shows that the average uniformity of the airline fleets has been steadily decreasing, while the average fleet scale has been steadily increasing. Decreasing uniformity causes extensive complexity in the airline management but increasing scale allows new levels of efficiency to be achieved. The predominant cost item in the availability services is the ownership cost of the spare units, which directly originates from the valuation and depreciation principles applied. The challenge of valuing repairable components is that, unlike other production assets and disposable spare parts, they repeatedly change between production asset role and spare part role. They require different valuation and depreciation rules in these three cases: in the revenue generating role as common production assets, in the insurance-like role as spare components and while they are changing from one role to the other. According to a basic model of availability, a simple but feasible pooling arrangement can save over 30 % of the availability service costs if the pool members are willing to endure some delivery delays from a remote pool stock. A <b>pool</b> <b>member</b> experiences higher service level with lower cost but needs to wait for the spare units longer compared to an airline providing its spare components in-house. The cost savings achieved by the whole pool are determined by the total fleet scale of the cooperation. The pooling benefits in optimal conditions are generally higher when more demand for one component type is served by one pool. Conflicting interests between the potential cooperating parties may easily result in less efficient pooling arrangements. The primary cause of the conflict is the issue of allocating the costs of the availability service between the pool participants, which is complicated by the fragmentation of the spare component demand. A deeper examination of the different ways to implement pooling is required to measure the potential of each alternative to capture pooling benefits in the availability service of aircraft components against a variety of external condition...|$|E
