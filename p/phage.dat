The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was described in 1983.

40|$|Background: Salmonella enterica {{subspecies}} enterica serovar Typhimurium is a Gram-negative pathogen causing salmonellosis. Salmonella Typhimurium-targeting bacteriophages {{have been}} proposed as an alternative biocontrol agent to antibiotics. To further understand infection and interaction mechanisms between the host strains and the bacteriophages, the receptor diversity of these <b>phages</b> needs to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings: Twenty-five Salmonella <b>phages</b> were isolated and their receptors were identified by screening a Tn 5 random mutant library of S. Typhimurium SL 1344. Among them, three types of receptors were identified flagella (11 <b>phages),</b> vitamin B 12 uptake outer membrane protein, BtuB (7 <b>phages)</b> and lipopolysaccharide-related O-antigen (7 <b>phages).</b> TEM observation revealed that the <b>phages</b> using flagella (group F) or BtuB (group B) as a receptor belong to Siphoviridae family, and the <b>phages</b> using O-antigen of LPS as a receptor (group L) belong to Podoviridae family. Interestingly, while some of group F <b>phages</b> (F-I) target FliC host receptor, others (F-II) target both FliC and FljB receptors, suggesting that two subgroups are present in group F <b>phages.</b> Cross-resistance assay of group B and L revealed that group L <b>phages</b> could not infect group B phage-resistant strains and reversely group B <b>phages</b> could not infect group L SPN 9 TCW-resistant strain.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to induce and characterize verotoxin-encoding <b>phages</b> from a collection of 91 verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O 103 :H 2 strains of human and bovine origins. All the strains carried the vt 1 gene, and two carried the vt 2 gene as well. The <b>phages</b> were induced by UV irradiation and characterized by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), genome size, morphology, and Q and P genes, characteristic of lambdoid <b>phages.</b> A total of 32 vt-positive <b>phages</b> were induced and isolated from 31 VTEC O 103 :H 2 strains. Thirty <b>phages</b> were vt 1 positive, and two were vt 2 positive. Ten of the 30 vt 1 -positive <b>phages</b> (33. 3 %) were from cattle strains, and 20 (66. 6 %) were from human strains. The two vt 2 -positive <b>phages</b> were from human strains. <b>Phages</b> belonged to 21 RFLP profiles, of which 17 were single-phage profiles and 4 were multiple-phage profiles. The estimated genome size of the <b>phages</b> ranged from 34 to 84 kb. Two <b>phages</b> that were examined by electron microscopy possessed hexagonal heads with long tails, and one had an elongated head with a long tail. The Q and P genes were amplified in all 32 <b>phages,</b> and the Q-stxA 1 gene region yielded an amplicon in 19 <b>phages</b> (59. 3 %).

40|$|Leuconostoc (Ln.), Weissella and Oenococcus form a {{group of}} related genera of lactic acid bacteria, which once all shared the name Leuconostoc. They are {{associated}} with plants, fermented vegetable products, raw milk, dairy products, meat and fish. Most of industrially relevant Leuconostoc strains can be classified as either Ln. mesenteroides or Ln. pseudomesenteroides. They are important flavor producers in dairy fermentations and they initiate nearly all vegetable fermentations. Therefore bacteriophages attacking Leuconostoc strains may negatively influence the production process. Bacteriophages attacking Leuconostoc strains were first reported in 1946. Since then, the majority of described Leuconostoc <b>phages</b> was isolated from either dairy products or fermented vegetable products. Both lytic and temperate <b>phages</b> of Leuconostoc were reported. Most of Leuconostoc <b>phages</b> examined using electron microscopy belong to the Siphoviridae family and differ in morphological details. Hybridization and comparative genomic studies of Leuconostoc <b>phages</b> suggest {{that they can be}} divided into several groups, however overall diversity of Leuconostoc <b>phages</b> is much lower as compared to e. g. lactococcal <b>phages.</b> Several fully sequenced genomes of Leuconostoc <b>phages</b> have been deposited in public databases. Lytic <b>phages</b> of Leuconostoc can be divided into two host species-specific groups with similarly organized genomes that shared very low nucleotide similarity. <b>Phages</b> of dairy Leuconostoc have rather limited host-ranges. The receptor binding proteins of two lytic Ln. pseudomesenteroides <b>phages</b> have been identified. Molecular tools for detection of dairy Leuconostoc <b>phages</b> have been developed. The rather limited data on <b>phages</b> of Oenococcus and Weissella show that i) lysogeny seems to be abundant in Oenococcus strains, and ii) several <b>phages</b> infecting Weissella cibaria are also able to productively infect strains of other Weissella species and even strains of the genus Lactobacillus...|$|R
5|$|Nucleases are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against <b>phage</b> infection by digesting the <b>phage</b> DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting {{as part of the}} restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E
5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989.

This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in λ <b>phage,</b> with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature.

(i) As previously shown for cellular genomes, each viral genome has a distinctive signature of short oligonucleotide abundances that pervade the entire genome and distinguish it from other genomes. (ii) The enteric temperate double-stranded (ds) <b>phages,</b> like enterobacteria, exhibit significantly high relative abundances of GpC = GC and significantly low values of TA, but no such extremes exist in ds lytic <b>phages.</b> (iii) The tetranucleotide CTAG is of statistically low relative abundance in most <b>phages.</b> (iv) The DAM methylase site GATC is of statistically low relative abundance in most <b>phages,</b> but not in P 1. This difference may relate to controls on replication (e. g., actions of the host SeqA gene product) and to MutH cleavage potential of the Escherichia coli DAM mismatch repair system. (v) The enteric temperate dsDNA <b>phages</b> form a coherent group: they are relatively close {{to each other and to}} their bacteria] hosts in average differences of dinucleotide relative abundance values. By contrast, the lytic dsDNA <b>phages</b> do not form a coherent group. This difference may come about because the temperate <b>phages</b> acquire more sequence characteristics of the host because they use the host replication and repair machinery, whereas the analyzed lytic <b>phages</b> are replicated by their own machinery. (vi) The nonenteric temperate <b>phages</b> with mycoplasmal and mycobacterial hosts are relatively close to their respective hosts and relatively distant from any of the enteric hosts and from the other <b>phages.</b> (vii) The single-stranded RNA <b>phages</b> have dinucleotide relative abundance values closest to those for random sequences, presumably attributable to the mutation rates of RNA <b>phages</b> being much greater than those of DNA <b>phages...</b>|$|R
