50|$|During the NTSB's investigation, it {{was learned}} that Captain Marvin Falitz had failed three semiannual <b>proficiency</b> <b>checks</b> {{over the last}} five years {{preceding}} the accident. Falitz was said to have a reputation for following company procedures and being meticulous with flight check lists but three first officers accused him of being deliberately rough on the flight controls. A chief pilot described Falitz as competent but intimidating and provocative with colleagues. Falitz was accused of once slapping a co-pilot's headphones in anger.He seemed to therefore have anger management problems.|$|R
5000|$|The Captain was Kenneth McCullers. He was {{described}} by others as an [...] "above average" [...] pilot, who was [...] "comfortable" [...] to fly with because of his excellent judgement and ability to exercise command.

The report also reported that Connors [...] "deviated around thunderstorms even if other flights took more direct routes" [...] and [...] "willingly accepted suggestions from his flightcrew." [...] Since his qualification in 1979, Connors had passed all eight en route inspections he had undergone, and the NTSB report notes that he had received [...] "favorable comments" [...] regarding [...] "cockpit discipline and standardization."

5000|$|The {{probable}} cause suggested was that [...] "the crew {{failed to recognize}} and correct the development of excessive yaw which caused an unintentional rolling manoeuvre at an altitude too low to permit complete recovery." [...] Subsequent to the accident, the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) discontinued the requirement that Boeing 707 aircraft make actual landings with simulated failure of 50 percent of the power units concentrated {{on one side of}} the aircraft during training flights, type ratings, and <b>proficiency</b> <b>checks.</b> These maneuvers may now be simulated at an appropriate higher altitude.On February 5, 1960, Boeing issued a service bulletin for an improved rudder modification which adds boost power to the wider ranges of directional movement, and gives increased control capability at low airspeeds and minimum gross weight.

40|$|The {{realization}} of NextGen capabilities will require rapid deployment of revised airline cockpit procedures and the pre-requisite training and <b>proficiency</b> <b>checks.</b> Traditional approaches {{for the evaluation}} of the re-designed procedures and training, such as expert reviews and human-in-the-loop tests, cannot provide comprehensive analysis, cannot be performed until after the procedures and training are developed, and are cost and time prohibitive.

The tools capture the procedures and tasks to be trained in a formal model that is stored in a data-base. Human performance models are executed to estimate the ease-of-learning, ease-of-use and likelihood of failure of each of the tasks.

40|$|Regulators, {{operators}} and air pilots often express concern that basic manual flying ability is diminishing on highly automated fleets. Although licensed pilots must demonstrate {{their ability to}} operate aircraft manually during recurrent training and <b>proficiency</b> <b>checks</b> about every six months, the opportunities to use these skills in normal operating experience are limited. This paper discusses this problem, and describes three recent aircraft incidents in which manual handling deficiencies were cited as either a contributory or causal factor. These cases provide some evidence that the crew's ability to operate the aircraft manually, even during fairly routine maneuvers, was deteriorated. However, another common factor links these cases. In each of the events, the pilot was about to undergo a proficiency assessment and had deliberately degraded the aircraft's automatics to practice manually handling the aircraft before the evaluation. This suggests {{that there may be}} a need for detailed guidance to encourage pilots to participate in regular manual handling practice and to ensure that this practice is conducted in a suitable environment. One alternative might be to increase the amount of time dedicated to manual handling during simulator training and assessment...|$|R

5000|$|Carl Sargent {{reviewed}} Wilderness Survival Guide for White Dwarf No. 85, {{stating that}} a good wilderness adventure rulebook is hard to write, {{because of the lack}} of sharp discontinuities as opposed to dungeon adventures, although [...] "Mohan has pulled it off brilliantly." [...] Sargent called the weather system [...] "splendid", and felt that the rules on encumbrance and movement rates [...] "make sense and work easily".

40|$|The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, STCW, is the {{international}} convention which prescribes education and training for seafarers, including competence requirements for achieving eligibility as a master mariner. Despite extensive regulations, on how education should be carried out and fulfill the adequate skills, {{there are only a}} few, if any, substantial methods that verifies achieved competence among newly promoted master mariners. In comparison to professional development of Swedish flight captains, where their skills gradually builds up during education and training and are subsequently supported by <b>proficiency</b> <b>checks,</b> a counterpart within shipping is absent. With emphasis on proficiency development in practical maneuvering without automated instrumentation this study aims to investigate how development of competence appears for Swedish master mariners in the tanker segment. In parallel, a corresponding study of proficiency development for Swedish flight captains within the civil aviation is carried out. The research method was influenced by grounded theory and qualitative data were gathered through six semi-structured interviews, which are transcribed, coded by hand and finally analyzed. The respondents were all active officers in the maritime and aviation industry, three master mariners and three flight captains. Through the Oil Companies International Marine Forum, OCIMF, competency requirements concerning practical maneuvering have been adopted and these provides that tanker shipping companies ensures safe ship handling by competent crews. Consequently, a trade organization have identified deficiencies in the structure of proficiency development of master mariners, suggesting that proficiency development is insufficient in education {{as well as in the}} professional role. Through the result of interviews with master mariners in this study, this suggestion is supported.
