5|$|Today, some {{prerogative}} <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> directly {{exercised by}} ministers without {{the approval of}} Parliament, including the powers of declaring war and of making peace, the issue of passports, and the granting of honours. Prerogative <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> exercised nominally by the monarch, but {{on the advice of}} the prime minister (whom the monarch meets weekly) and of the cabinet. Some key functions of the British government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative, but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis.|$|E
5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal decision making.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{differentiation between}} Mann's {{two types of}} state <b>power</b> <b>is</b> that despotic <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>power</b> over society, while infrastructural <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>power</b> through society. Infrastructural power entails a cooperative relationship between citizens and their government, while despotic power requires only that an elite class can impose its will.|$|R

5|$|Since the 18th century, {{a modern}} system of public {{administration}} {{was going to}} be created in Russia, including the formation of bodies whose <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> similar to the powers of the modern Russian Government. In the period from 1726 to 1905 there was no official title for the leader of the government. The chief ministers (principal ministres) of certain Emperor of Russia nonetheless led the government de facto, but de jure the head of government was a monarch.|$|E

The legislative body is headed by an elected Chairperson who is assisted by a Deputy Chairperson.|$|E

5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Brazilian {{football}} clubs, Atlético Mineiro's by-law defines the club as a not-for-profit public utility organization, formed by associates (sócios). The club's administrative <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> the General Assembly, the Deliberative Council, the Board, the Fiscal Council and the Ethics and Discipline Council. The General Assembly, composed of all associates, elects the Deliberative Council among its members every three years, which in turn elects and removes the club's Board, responsible for the executive management of the club. Season ticket-holders and participants of the Galo na Veia affiliation programme, called sócios-torcedores, are not full club associates and cannot vote or be elected.|$|E
5|$|At present, Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} and one municipality (Bucharest); these are assigned as the NUTS-3 geocode statistical subdivision scheme of Romania within the European Union. Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes. The prefect and his administration have executive prerogatives within the county limits, while limited legislative <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> assigned to a County Council elected every four years during local elections. The territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in {{the separation of powers}} on the government.|$|E
5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use. This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. <b>Powers</b> <b>are</b> more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.|$|E

5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> gone, {{so he has}} to fight as a normal human, using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart {{features}} eight playable {{characters from}} the Mario series – Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad. Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad returned {{in all of}} the subsequent Mario Kart games starting with Mario Kart 64. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use. These <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> specific to each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players who hit them to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their <b>powers</b> <b>are</b> exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E

The powers of the Commissioner are those provided by statute and those delegated by the Corporation or the Standing Committee.|$|E
