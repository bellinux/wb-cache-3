5|$|To {{counter the}} power of Saavedra, Moreno sought to modify the {{military}} balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up until that point, the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead. However, {{in the short run}} this measure worked against him, as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> of such rules.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|<b>Precisely</b> <b>because</b> Prince Yelü Bei {{exemplified}} both Chinese and Khitan values, Empress Shulü Ping {{objected to}} Bei assuming {{the role of}} Emperor. The Empress believed that Bei's openness to Chinese culture detracted from his leadership ability as a Khitan, and she instead favored Emperor Taizu's more traditionalist second son, Yelü Deguang. Deguang enjoyed not only {{the support of his}} mother, but also of the Khitan nobility. Realizing that he could not assume the throne, {{and that it would be}} dangerous to try, Bei campaigned in favor of allowing his younger brother to assume the throne, and by the end of 927, formally stated to his mother that Deguang's qualifications were superior to his own, functionally ending his ability to challenge Deguang's ascension to the throne.|$|E

50|$|For {{many species}} of {{invertebrate}} animals, the exact geographic range limits have never been <b>precisely</b> ascertained, <b>because</b> not enough scientific field work has been carried {{in many parts of}} the world to map distribution more precisely, therefore finding a range extension for species, especially marine species, is not an uncommon occurrence.|$|R

50|$|The {{equation}} of state of matter at such high densities is not <b>precisely</b> known <b>because</b> of the theoretical difficulties associated with extrapolating the likely behavior of quantum chromodynamics, superconductivity, and superfluidity of matter in such states along with the empirical difficulties of observing the characteristics of neutron stars that are at least hundreds of parsecs away.|$|R
40|$|Sr-Nd {{isotopes}} {{were applied}} {{for the first time}} to the study of several moss samples from a transect stretching through Romagna from the Apennines to the Adriatic sea coast. The isotopic data suggest that the mosses uptake Sr and Nd via atmospheric depositions from both marine carbonates and old siliceous crustal rocks. Anthropic pollution cannot be <b>precisely</b> evaluated <b>because</b> of the lack of univocal isotopic signature of the sources...|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{aspect of}} the labyrinth was the inclusion within it of depictions of the master masons of the cathedral. In other churches and cathedrals, they are unknown and anonymous. Indeed, the identities of these master masons are <b>precisely</b> known, <b>because</b> {{a survey of the}} labyrinth was drawn in 1640 by Canon Cocquault and in 1779, just before its destruction, by Robin and Havé. These surveys also contained dates and descriptions of the masons' works.|$|R
25|$|During both World War I and World War II, Switzerland {{managed to}} keep a stance of armed neutrality, and was not {{involved}} militarily.

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{aesthetics}} concerning mathematics is mathematicians' views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition {{of this view}} occurs in G.H. Hardy's book A Mathematician's Apology, in which Hardy argues that pure mathematics is superior in beauty to applied mathematics <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> it cannot be used for war and similar ends.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> he fathered {{a healthy}} son with Elizabeth that Henry was {{convinced}} his wife's inability to bear him a son was Catherine's fault.

These facts led Henry to believe {{there was something wrong}} with his marriage to Catherine, and that he needed to annul his marriage.|$|E
25|$|The ISM plays {{a crucial}} role in {{astrophysics}} <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, molecular clouds, and replenish the ISM with matter and energy through planetary nebulae, stellar winds, and supernovae. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation.|$|E
25|$|During the 1916 Easter Rising, several {{jewish women}} from the {{community}} smuggled ammunition from Portobello, Dublin's Jewish quarter, to the then named Sackville Street, where the rebels occupied the General Post Office and other strategic buildings. Most notable of these women was the famous Artist Estella Solomons, she used to hide ammunition under a vegetable patch {{at the back of}} her family home. The Cumann na mBan women worked as agents transferring ammunition, able to avoid detection at that time <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> they were women.|$|E
50|$|Some authors use {{informatics}} as {{a synonym}} for information science. This is especially true when related to the concept developed by A. I. Mikhailov and other Soviet authors in the mid-1960s. The Mikhailov school saw informatics as a discipline related {{to the study of}} scientific information.Informatics is difficult to <b>precisely</b> define <b>because</b> of the rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary nature of the field.

50|$|Detecting and {{predicting}} CAT is {{hard for}} meteorologists because it is at such heights that even when caused by factors that can be measured, intensity and location cannot be determined <b>precisely.</b> However, <b>because</b> this turbulence affects long range aircraft that fly near the tropopause, CAT has been intensely studied. Several factors affect the likelihood of CAT. Often more than one factor is present. 64% of the non-light turbulences (not only CAT) are observed less than 150 nmi km away from {{the core of a}} jet stream.|$|R

A possible origin of these defects is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Before {{the match}} began, many {{commentators}} believed that Carlsen had very strong chances of winning. However, many assumed that Anand {{had learned from}} his mistakes in 2013 and would be a stronger opponent this time around. These commentators were vindicated: Carlsen {{had to make a}} greater effort, winning the match with a ratio of wins to losses of 3:1 versus 3:0 in 2013. Commentators saw the match as more interesting <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> Anand demonstrated himself as a much stronger player than he had done in 2013.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Clayton Christensen (1997) {{took the}} {{position}} that great companies can fail <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> they do everything right since {{the capabilities of the}} organization also define its disabilities. Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with disruptive technology. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies agnostic marketing, i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used without the experience of using it.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not <b>precisely</b> defined <b>because</b> its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity.

25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop's reinvention of the pneumatic bicycle tire in 1888 {{had made for}} a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used on the dirt roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> of the smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension spring assemblies. The pneumatic tire made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|E
25|$|Local {{indigenous}} peoples including the Métis, Haaninin and Siksika {{were accustomed to}} the buffalo hunt, however some Metis had arrived from the Red River valley in the 1840s-60 <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> the hunt was declining in that region, a sign {{of things to come}} further west. When Manitoba was established in 1870, many Metis were disappointed with what they felt was a disenfranchisement of their laws and way of life in the new province and migrated into the Saskatchewan river basin, establishing a settlement there and electing Gabriel Dumont as the first president of the council of St Laurent in 1872, charged with governing the annual buffalo hunts and other local laws.|$|E
25|$|It should however {{be noted}} that the {{disadvantages}} of such terrain could be nullified if surprise was achieved over the enemy by an attack through such terrain. During the Battle of France, the German blitzkrieg-style attack on France went through the Ardennes. There is little doubt that the hilly, heavily wooded Ardennes could have been relatively easily defended by the Allies, even against the bulk of the German armoured units. However, <b>precisely</b> <b>because</b> the French thought the Ardennes unsuitable for massive troop movement, particularly for tanks, they were left with only light defences which were quickly overrun by the Wehrmacht. The Germans quickly advanced through the forest, knocking down the trees the French thought would impede this tactic.|$|E
25|$|In polymer demixing, polymer blends {{experience}} spontaneous phase separation; {{it often}} occurs during {{conditions such as}} spin casting onto silicon wafers. Features that can be created by this method include nanoscale pits, islands, and ribbons, which can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the polymer ratio and concentration to change the feature shape and size, respectively. There is not much control in the horizontal direction, though the vertical direction of the features can be <b>precisely</b> controlled. <b>Because</b> the pattern is very unordered horizontally, this method can only be used to study cell interactions with specific height nanotopographies.|$|R
50|$|Commercial IMC {{instruments}} are often operated as heat conduction (hc) calorimeters in which heat {{produced by the}} specimen (i.e. material in an ampoule) flows to the heat sink, typically an aluminum block contained in a thermostat (e.g. constant temperature bath). As mentioned above, an IMC instrument operating in hc mode is not <b>precisely</b> isothermal <b>because</b> small differences between the set temperature and the specimen temperature necessarily exist—so that there is measurable heat flow. However, small variations in specimen temperature do not significantly affect heat sink temperature because the heat capacity of the heat sink {{is much higher than}} the specimen—usually ca. 100×.|$|R
40|$|Models {{of complex}} {{physical}} systems often cannot be defined <b>precisely,</b> either <b>because</b> {{of lack of}} knowledge or because the system parameters change over time according to unknown phenomena. Such systems can be represented by semi-quantitative models that combine both qualitative and quantitative knowledge. This paper presents Numerical Interval Simulation, a method that can produce tight predictions of systems involving nonmonotonic functions. We present a successful application of NIS to predict {{the behavior of a}} complex process at a Brazilian-Japanese steel company. We claim that such capability of simulating nonmonotonic functions is fundamental in order to handle real-world complex industrial processes. ...|$|R
