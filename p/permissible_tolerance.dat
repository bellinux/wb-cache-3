40|$|Precision {{holes are}} among the most {{critical}} features of a mechanical component. Deviations from <b>permissible</b> <b>tolerances</b> can impede operation and result in unexpected failure. We have developed an automated non-contact eddy current hole diameter and eccentricity measuring system. The operating principle is based on the eddy current lift-off effect, which is the coil impedance {{as a function of the}} distance between the coil and the test object. An absolute eddy current probe rotates in the hole. The impedance of each angular position is acquired and input to the computer for integration and analysis. The eccentricity of the hole is the profile of the impedance as a function of angular position as compared to a straight line, an ideal hole. The diameter of the hole is the sum of the diameter of the probe and twice the distance-calibrated impedance. An eddy current image is generated by integrating angular scans for a plurality of depths between the top and bottom to display the eccentricity profile. This system can also detect and image defects in the hole. The method for non-contact eddy current hole diameter and eccentricity measurement has been granted a patent by the U. S.

The accelerator tube has most important effect on beam tracing in the {{electrostatic accelerator}}s. So precautions most be considered in designing and constructing of this part. In order to finding <b>permissible</b> <b>tolerances</b> in construction and assembling of 200 kV electrostatic accelerator column, first the effects of angle deviation of a part from accelerator axis on beam track in the accelerator tube was simulated with Simion 7. 0 computer program.

40|$|Abstract — Distribution {{system is}} the major link which {{provides}} supply to the consumers from the high voltage transmission system. The load on the distribution system is not constant and it changes with respect to time throughout the working period. The voltage drop and power losses occur in the distribution system mainly depends {{on the nature of}} the load which is applied on the system. The voltage drop and power losses frequently occurs mainly on those systems which are supplying load to the industrial areas, this is mainly because of the existence of more reactive power. To overcome these problems shunt compensation is employed to reduce or suppress those effects to an extent.

A numerical solution was developed to calculate three-dimensional stress distribution in a wound coil built up wrap-by-wrap and subsequent flatness change in the uncoiled product. The model takes into account both nonlinear compressible characteristic of interwrap layer and uneven strip profile, especially ridges, on the stress evolution during the coiling process. The sensitivity of ridge-buckle defects in cold rolled thin strip to ridges in hot rolled coil profile has been investigated in details.

40|$|Abstract − When testing an analog-to-digital {{converter}} (ADC) by {{automatic test equipment}} (ATE), the latter is capable of performing extensive processing of output responses of the ADC. This allows detection of virtually any fault. However, the cost of ATE is quite high. As well, the external bandwidth of ATE is normally lower than the internal bandwidth of the ADC being tested, which {{makes it difficult to}} accomplish at-speed testing. It is important, therefore, to embed test hardware into ADC itself. The methods employed at ATE are complex and inconvenient for built-in realization. More advantageous are the methods exploiting accumulation of output responses. The size of the accumulator depends on the number of responses. In order to achieve greater fault coverage, this number is kept large, complicating the implementation. On the other hand, signature analysis used in digital systems testing is well suited for compaction of “lengthy ” responses, and it is characterized by small hardware overhead and low aliasing probability. In this work, we apply signature analysis principle for compaction of output responses of an ADC. The <b>permissible</b> <b>tolerance</b> bounds for a fault-free ADC are determined and the aliasing rate is estimated. Examples are given...|$|E

40|$|Power {{efficiency}} of residential houses requires {{the application of}} varied thermal insulation systems, including curtain walls. Peculiarities of their design that can produce a substantial impact on their durability and operational reliability {{are discussed in the}} article. A standard curtain wall system represents a structure composed of one layer of thermal insulation made of mineral cotton attached to the bearing wall by dish-shaped dowels, a bearing frame (a subsystem) attached to the wall by anchors, and outer lining materials (panels, boards or sheets) that are mounted in such a manner so that the spacing between the outer lining and the layer of thermal insulation is 0. 4 to 0. 8 m. Evidently, strength analysis of structural and fixture elements (anchors) must be completed {{in the course of the}} building design (new project) or as a supplementary pre-repair stage in the event of extensive repairs, to assure reliable and safe operation of curtain wall systems. Any analysis is to be based on the most complete information about the materials and elements of the curtain wall system, its structural peculiarities, and the whole variety of loads and impacts that the building may be exposed to, including dynamic loads associated with its height. The quality of the analysis depends upon proper identification of the forces that the structure of the wall system is exposed to, and proper selection of design models of elements (namely, with the account for the kinematic analysis) of the structure of the curtain wall system being designed. Evidently, many factors of strength of structural details, elements and joints must be substantiated by tests that may be specified as procedures of identification of structural reliability of a curtain wall system. Besides, the analysis-related section of the design project must be based on a set of tests (of separate elements and joints) performed in the environment close to the natural conditions of the curtain wall maintenance (field tests). The results of laboratory tests (given the adjustments for <b>permissible</b> <b>tolerances)</b> may be regarded as the principal criteria in the assessment of applicability of a curtain wall system in the course of a major building repair project or a new construction to assure the required reliability and durability.

In the process it is observedthat optimisation of infinitesimal cells is only possible when the size of the real cell is first decided, and that the relationship between the conducting oxide transparency and electrical resistance is critical for the optimisation to be effective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to demonstrate surface roughness and chip formation by the machining of Aluminium silicon alloy (AlSic) matrix composite, reinforced with aluminium nitride (AlN), with three types of carbide inserts present. Experiments were conducted at various cutting speeds, feed rates, and depths of cut, according to the Taguchi method, using a standard orthogonal array L 9 (3 4). The effects of cutting speeds, feed rates, depths of cut, and types of tool on surface roughness during the milling operation were evaluated using Taguchi optimization methodology, using the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The surface finish produced is very important in determining whether the quality of the machined part is within specification and <b>permissible</b> <b>tolerance</b> limits.

Part of the conversion involves grouping exposures into higher level structures based on exposure characteristics. Exposures constrained to be at different orientations cannot be grouped together. Because relative orientation requirements cause implicit constraints, orientation constraints have to be propagated. TRANS must also identify any inconsistencies that may exist so they can be corrected. We have designed and implemented an orientation constraint propagator as part of TRANS. The propagator is based on an informal algebra that facilitates the setting up and propagation of the orientation constraints. The constraint propagator generates constraints between directly related exposures, and propagates derived constraints between exposures that are related indirectly. It provides facilities for path-consistency checking, identification of unsatisfiable constraints, and querying of orientation relationships. The system has been successfully operational as part of TRANS for over seven months.

40|$|Many {{countries}} are advancing {{down the road}} of electricity privatization, deregulation, and competition {{as a solution to}} their growing electricity demand and other challenges posed by the monopolistic nature of the existing structure. Presently, Nigeria has a supply deficit of electricity {{as a result of the}} growing demand. This imbalance has negatively affected the economy of the country and the social-economic well-being of the population. Hence, there is an urgent need to reform the power sector for greater efficiency and better performance. The objectives of the reform are to meet the growing power demand by increasing the electric power generation and also by increasing competitiveness through the participation of more private sector entities. The renewable energy integration is one way of increasing the electricity generation in the country in order to cater for the growing demand adequately. Examples of the renewable energy that is available in the country include wind, geothermal, solar and hydro. They are considered to be environmentally friendly, replenishable and do not contribute to the climate change phenomena. The country presently generates the bulk of its electricity from both thermal (85 %) and hydroelectric (15 %) power plants. While electricity generation from the thermal power stations constitutes the largest share of greenhouse emission, this is mostly from burning coal and natural gas. The effect of this high proportion of greenhouse emission causes climate change which is referred to as a variation in the climate system statistical properties over a long period of time. It has been observed that many of the activities of human beings are contributory factors to the release of these greenhouse gases (GHG). But, as the traditional sources of energy continue to threaten the present and future existence on the planet earth, it is, therefore, imperative to increase the integration of the variable renewable energy sources in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner over a long period of time. The variability and the uncertainties of the renewable energy source's output, present a major challenge in the design of an efficient electricity market in a deregulated environment. The system deregulation and the use of renewable sources for the generation of electricity are major changes presently being experienced in power system. In a deregulated power system, the integration of renewable generation and its penetration affects both the physical and the economic operations. The main focus of this research is on the integration of wind energy into Nigerian power systems. Up till now, research on the availability of the wind energy and its economic impacts has been limited in Nigeria. Generally, the previous study of wind energy availability in Nigeria has been limited in scope. The wind energy assessment study has not been detailed enough to be able to ascertain the wind energy potential of the country. To cope with this shortcoming, a detailed statistical wind modeling and forecasting methodology have been used in this thesis to determine the amount of extractable wind energy in six selected locations in Nigeria using historical wind speed data for 30 years. The accuracy test of the statistical models was also carried using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Chi-Square methods to determine the inherent error margin in the modeling and analysis. It is found that the error margin of the evaluations falls within the expected <b>permissible</b> <b>tolerance</b> range. For a more detailed wind assessment study of the Nigeria weather, the seasonal variation of the weather conditions as it affects the wind speed and availability during the two major seasons of dry and rainy was considered. A Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (SADE) was used to solve the economic load dispatch problem that considers the valve-point effects and the transmission losses subject to many constraints. The results obtained were compared with those obtained using the "standard" Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and traditional Gradient Descent method. The results of the SADE obtained when compared with the GA, DE, and Gradient descent show the superiority of SADE over all the other methods. The research work shows that the wind energy is available in commercial quantity for generation of electricity in Nigeria. And, if tapped would help reduce the gap between the demand and supply of electricity in the country. It was also demonstrated that the wind energy integration into the power systems affects the generators total production cost...|$|E

Todas as latas eram envernizadas internamente. O produto estudado foi refrigerante de limão. A vida-de-prateleira do produto nas diversas embalagens foi determinada em teste de estocagem óelo período de seis meses em duas condições de temperatura, 23 ºC e 35 ºC. Os principais parâmetros considerados foram a avaliação visual interna das embalagens, a concentração de ferro e a avaliação organoléptica do produto. Verificou-se que, embora apresentem pequenas diferenças entre si, todos os tipos de latas de folha-de-flandres (soldadas pelo processo convencional e eletricamente) apresentaram um bom desempenho pelos seis meses de estocagem, enquanto a lata em folha cromada soldada eletricamente sofreu um processo de corrosão acentuado, e o produto nela acondicionado atingiu concentrações de ferro acima do admissível (2 ppm aos seis meses de estocagem) entre 90 e 120 dias no armazenamento a 23 ºC e entre 75 e 90 dias no armazenamento a 35 ºC. Para a estocagem a 23 ºC esse foi o tempo estabelecido para a vida-de-prateleira do produto nessa embalagem enquanto para a estocagem a 35 ºC a vida-de-prateleira estabelecida foi entre 62 e 75 dias devido ao sabor metálico percebido na avaliação sensorial. A avaliação sensorial do refrigerante de limão permitiu verificar a ocorrência de deterioração do sabor do produto durante a estocagem, nas duas condições de temperatura, ocorri da no produto acondicionado nos diversas tipos de embalagem metálica e também na garrafa de vidro utilizada como referencia. Em função disso, o fator limitante da vida-de-prateleira do refrigerante de limão nas embalagens em folha-de-flandres foi a alteração organoléptica, sendo o produto considerado inaceitável aos 150 dias de estocagem a 23 ºC e 105 dias de estocagem a 35 ºc. A caracterização das embalagens quanto à porosidade do verniz e proteção da região de soldagem mostrou-se diretamente relacionada as diferenças no desempenho encontradas entre as embalagens. A avaliação de amostras da região de soldagem no tempo zero e aos 180 dias de estocagem a 23 ºC por meio de microscopia eletrônica e difração de raiosX possibilitou a visualização e confirmação da formação de pontos de corrosão e existência de defeitos no sistema de envernizamento das embalagens. The {{performance of}} four kinds of cans, {{two of them}} produced by Soudronic and Conoweld welding technologies, {{and the other two}} by the conventional process (soldered), was evaluated. With the exception of the can produced by the Conoweld process that was manufactured from tin free steel, the packaging material was tinplate. All of the cans were lacquered internally. The product studied was a lemon soft drink. The shelf-life of the product in the several packagings was determined by storage test within a period of six months at two temperature conditions, 23 ºC and 35 ºC. The main parameters considered were the internal visual evaluation of the packaging, the concentration of iron and the sensorial evaluation of the product. It was verified that although the tinplate cans presented some small differences among them selves, all of the types of tinplate cans (welded and soldered) presented a good performance during the six months of storage, while the welded tin free steel can suffered a process of accentuated corrosion and the product packaged in it reached concentrations of iron above the <b>permissible</b> <b>tolerance</b> (2 ppm at six months of storage) between 90 and 120 days in storage at 23 ºC and between 75 and 90 days in storage at 35 ºC. For the storage at 23 °C, that was the period established for the shelf-life of the product in this packaging, while for the storage at 35 °C the shelf-life was between 62 and 75 days in function of the metallic flavor detected in the sensorial evaluation. The sensorial evaluation of the lemon soft drink allowed us to detect the product flavor deterioration during the storage at the two temperature conditions that occured in the product packaged in several types of metalic packaging and also in glass used as reference. In function of that, the limitating factor of the shelf [...] life of the lemon soft drink in tinplate packagings was the sensorial alteration. The product was considered unacceptable at 150 days of storage at 23 ºC and at 105 days of storage at 35 ºC. The caracterization of the packagings as to lacquer porosity and protection of the region of welding proved to be directly related to the differences in performance verified among the packagings. The evaluation of samples of the region of welding at time zero and at 180 days of storage at 23 °C in Scanning Electron Microscope and X-Ray Diffraction enabled the visualization and confirmation of points of corrosion formation and the existence of defects in the system of packaging lacquering...|$|E
