40|$|The {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are inherited neurodegenerative diseases {{characterized by}} massive accumulation of autofluorescent <b>storage</b> <b>bodies</b> in neurons and other cells. A late-onset form of NCL occurs in Tibetan terrier dogs. Gel electrophoretic analyses of isolated <b>storage</b> <b>body</b> proteins from brains of affected dogs {{indicated that a}} protein of approximately 50 kDa was consistently prominent and a 16 kDa component was present in some brain <b>storage</b> <b>body</b> preparations. Mass spectral analysis identified the 50 kDa protein as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), isoform 2. GFAP identification was supported by immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses. Histone H 4 was the major protein in the 16 kDa component. Specific accumulation of GFAP and histone H 4 in <b>storage</b> <b>bodies</b> has not been previously reported {{for any of the}} NCLs. Tibetan terrier NCL may be the canine correlate of one of the human adult-onset NCLs for which the genetic bases and <b>storage</b> <b>body</b> compositions have not yet been determined...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{dispatch}} and investment model {{to study the}} role of <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> and other flexibility options in a greenfield setting with high shares of renewables. The model captures multiple system values of <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> related to arbitrage, dispatchable capacity, and reserves. In a baseline scenario, we find that <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> requirements remain moderate up to a renewable share of around 80 %, as other options on both the supply side and demand side also offer flexibility at low cost. Yet storage {{plays an important role}} in the provision of reserves. If the renewable share increases to 100 %, the required capacities of <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> and other technologies increase strongly. As long-run parameter assumptions are highly uncertain, we carry out a range of sensitivity analyses, for example, with respect to the costs and availabilities of storage and renewables. A common finding of these sensitivities is that - under very high renewable shares - the storage requirement strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly on biomass availability. We conclude that <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> becomes an increasingly important element of a transition towards a fully renewable-based <b>power</b> system. <b>Power</b> <b>storage</b> gains further relevance if other potential sources of flexibility are less developed. Supporting the development of <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> should thus be considered a useful component of policies designed to safeguard the transition towards renewables...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The three-level {{converter}} {{based on}} A-NPC topology can improve waveform {{quality of the}} output voltage, decrease the switch voltage and reduce {{the loss of the}} inductor, thus it has broad application prospects in the electrical <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> domain. This paper built the semi-physical real-time simulation platform of A-NPC three-level battery <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> system by designing the control system and the main circuit of the A-NPC topology converter, and researched the control mechanism of the <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> converter control algorithm with digital simulation platform. The experimental results of the prototype machine show that the A-NPC three-level battery <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> system built in this paper was fine, compared with the most common two-level topology, three-level converter has characteristics of lower output current waveform distortion factor, lower current harmonics and higher efficiency. Three-level converter used in the <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> system is able to gain access to low THD during steady-state operation and fine dynamic characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy of pollen from Lilium longiflorum Thunb. reveals electron-dense inclusions in <b>storage</b> <b>body</b> organelles ubiquitous in the cytosol. In ungerminated pollen, these inclusions are rounded in appearance and appressed {{to the inner}} surface of the smooth membrane of the <b>storage</b> <b>body.</b> During pollen germination, these inclusions become less rounded, smaller, and enclosed in <b>storage</b> <b>bodies</b> that have developed crenated membranes. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis reveals high levels of P, Mg, K, and Ca in the inclusions relative to {{other regions of the}} cytosol in which elemental signals can be obtained. The elemental composition and the degradation of inclusions during germination are offered as evidence for storage of phytin in these structures which are thus analogous to phytin storage globoids of seed tissues...|$|R

40|$|The German energy {{transition}} makes {{it necessary to}} increase flexibility in the electricity system. Different forms of <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> may {{play a part in}} this, yet there is competition with other options on the production or demand side. In the short term, the further expansion of electricity generation from fluctuating renewables will be possible in Germany without additional <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> facilities. In the longer term, however, storage requirements will depend strongly on specific circumstances and are therefore difficult to predict. A model-based analysis shows that requirements for <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> rise sharply when the share of renewable energies is very high, particularly if other potential sources of flexibility are less developed. If options such as flexible generation of electricity from biomass, the enhancement of demand-side flexibility, or crossborder contributions to integrating renewable energies develop less favorably than is frequently assumed today, then additional electricity storage facilities will be required and economically beneficial in the long term. For this reason, supporting the development of <b>power</b> <b>storage</b> will be a useful component of a policy designed to safeguard the {{energy transition}} for the future. Policy-makers should aim for technological progress and cost reduction in <b>power</b> <b>storage,</b> primarily by means of continued and broad-based support for research and development. At the same time, policy should enable a level playing field for competition among the flexibility options in the various areas of application, for example on the control reserve market...|$|R

40|$|The {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs, Batten disease) are fatal inherited neurodegenerative diseases {{characterized by}} gross brain atrophy, blindness, and intracellular accumulation of lysosome-derived <b>storage</b> <b>bodies.</b> A CLN 6 form in sheep is studied {{as a large}} animal model of the human diseases. This study describes neuropathological changes in brains from presymptomatic affected sheep. Activated astrocytes and focal clusters of activated microglia were present in outer layers of occipital and somatosensory cortical regions as early as 12 days of age, together with activated perivascular macrophages. Astrocytic activation and progressive transformation of microglia to brain macrophages preceded neurodegeneration and spread to different cortical areas, most prominently in regions associated with clinical symptoms. In contrast, <b>storage</b> <b>body</b> accumulation was much more evenly spread across regions. These data support suggestions that neurodegeneration and <b>storage</b> <b>body</b> accumulation may be independent manifestations of CLN 6 mutation and indicate that glial cell activation {{may be an important}} mediator in pathogenesis...|$|R
