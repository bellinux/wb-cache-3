500|$|Television and {{newspaper}} reports, particularly local Gujarati-language media, carried graphic {{and at times}} sensationalised images and accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Godhra train fire and Naroda Patiya massacre.

Television news channels identified <b>the</b> community <b>of</b> those involved in the violence, breaking a long-standing practice and setting a precedent. Critical reporting on the Gujarat government's handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation helped bring about the Indian government's intervention in controlling the violence. The Gujarat government banned television news channels that were critical of its response; STAR News, Zee News, Aaj Tak, CNN and local stations were blocked. <b>The</b> Editorial Guild <b>of</b> India rejected <b>the</b> charge that graphic news coverage aggravated the situation, saying that the coverage exposed <b>the</b> horrors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riots and the [...] "supine if not complicit" [...] attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, helping propel remedial action.

50|$|Public servants: the {{government}} wanted to sharply reduce <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> public servants {{and to achieve}} this it created a special mechanism to cut jobs by mutual agreement. Due to the unsustainable and growing expenses with public servant salaries and privileges, the ruling party PSD said it would only hire one worker for each five that leave, a rule which revealed the extremely large number of unnecessary redundant public servants that had been signed in across the decades. Hiring procedures for the public service were changed in order to guarantee an independent process and public servants' wages were taken into account to limit extra payments. On 18 October 2011, <b>the</b> Portuguese Minister <b>of</b> Finance, Vítor Gaspar, said to the Portuguese television RTP 1 that the wage cuts imposed to public servants the previous week in <b>the</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>Budget</b> for 2012 were {{the only way to}} avoid a much more painful and complex policy of public servant mass firing.

The Jack H. Berryman Institute is dependent on Congressionally directed federal funding passed through USDA/ APHIS/Wildlife Services, but that was disrupted by the power shift that occurred in the U.

That crisis forced our 2 units (BI-West at Utah State University and BI-East at Mississippi State University) to effectively shut down until an interim plan could be made. Thankfully, we have strongly supportive colleagues in Wildlife Services who “passed around the hat” within their own agency and whittled from their own budgets to provide us with the baseline funding we need for the bare essentials, such as <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> this issue.
