40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the long-term safety (up to 3 years) of treatment with <b>pegloticase</b> {{in patients with}} refractory chronic gout. METHODS: This open-label extension (OLE) study was conducted at 46 sites in the USA, Canada and Mexico. Patients completing either of two replicate randomised placebo-controlled 6 -month trials received <b>pegloticase</b> 8 mg every 2 weeks (biweekly) or every 4 weeks (monthly). Safety was evaluated as the primary outcome, with special interest in gout flares and infusion-related reactions (IRs). Secondary outcomes included urate-lowering and clinical efficacy. RESULTS: Patients (n= 149) received a mean+/-SD of 28 +/- 18 <b>pegloticase</b> infusions and were followed for a mean of 25 +/- 11 months. Gout flares and IRs were the most frequently reported adverse events; these were least common in patients with a sustained urate-lowering response to treatment and those receiving biweekly treatment.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Two {{replicate}} randomized, placebo-controlled six-month trials (RCTs) and an open-label treatment extension (OLE) {{comprised the}} <b>pegloticase</b> development program {{in patients with}} gout refractory to conventional therapy. In the RCTs, approximately 40 % of patients treated with the approved dose saw complete response (CR) {{of at least one}} tophus. Here we describe the temporal course of tophus resolution, total tophus burden in patients with multiple tophi, tophus size at baseline, and the relationship between tophus response and urate-lowering efficacy. METHODS: Baseline subcutaneous tophi were analyzed quantitatively using computer-assisted digital images in patients receiving <b>pegloticase</b> (8 mg biweekly or monthly) or placebo in the RCTs, and <b>pegloticase</b> in the OLE. Tophus response, a secondary endpoint in the trials, was evaluated two ways. Overall tophus CR was the proportion of patients achieving a best response of CR (without any new/enlarging tophi) and target tophus complete response (TT-CR) was the proportion of all tophi with CR. RESULTS: Among 212 patients randomized in the RCTs, 155 (73 %) had ≥ 1 tophus and 547 visible tophi were recorded at baseline. Overall tophus CR was recorded in 45 % of patients in the biweekly group (P = 0. 002 versus placebo), 26 % in the monthly group, and 8 % in the placebo group after six months of RCT therapy. TT-CR rates at six months were 28 %, 19 %, and 2 % of tophi, respectively. Patients meeting the primary endpoint of sustained urate-lowering response to therapy (responders) were more likely than nonresponders to have an overall tophus CR at six months (54 % vs 20 %, respectively and 8 % with placebo).

40|$|A high plasma urate {{concentration}} (PUA), {{related to}} loss of urate oxidase in evolution, is postulated to protect humans from oxidative injury.

We show that erythrocytes can efficiently eliminate H 2 O 2 derived from urate oxidation to prevent cell injury in vitro; during therapy, disulfide-linked peroxiredoxin 2 dimer did not accumulate in red blood cells, indicating that their peroxidase capacity was not exceeded. To assess oxidative stress, we monitored F 2 -Isoprostanes (F 2 -IsoPs) and protein carbonyls (PC), products of arachidonic acid and protein oxidation, in plasma of 26 refractory gout patients receiving up to five infusions of <b>pegloticase</b> at 3 -wk intervals.

40|$|Abstract: Covalent {{attachment}} of {{polyethylene glycol}} (PEG) to active proteins (PEGylation technology) successfully generated several FDA-approved compounds, including four blockbusters, which are considered non immunogenic. However, PEG antibodies and intolerance to the infusion {{were reported in}} some patients with gout treated with <b>pegloticase,</b> a PEG-uricase recently approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, USA). Therefore, we reviewed the literature concerning immunogenicity of PEG alone or covalently attached to proteins. We consulted databases (Scirus, Pub Med, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct) and the references of selected articles and main journals publishing articles on the subject. Animal studies clearly showed that PEG-uricases and some other PEGylated proteins might elicit antibody formation against PEG. This anti-PEG response can accelerate the clearance of PEGylated proteins. Of major importance is the recent finding of a 22 %- 25 % occurrence of PEG antibodies in healthy blood donors. PEG antibodies may limit therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce tolerance of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and of <b>pegloticase</b> in patients with chronic gout, but apparently do not impair hyposensitization of allergic patients with mPEG-modified ragweed extract and honey bee venom or the response to PEG-interferon in patients with hepatitis C.

The natural course of gout is associated with joint structure changes that may be evaluated by different imaging techniques; comparative advantages and shortcomings of each technique are presented. For almost over 50 years the market has not offered new drugs for the control of HU and gout, while management of such patients was a rather neglected field. Over {{the last five years}} an unpredictable number of prospective clinical studies have been conducted involving the investigation of the efficacy and safety of new drugs to control HU (febuxostat, <b>pegloticase).</b> The return of pharmaceutical industry into the world of gout has considerably changed the picture.

40|$|ABSTRACT Treatment of {{refractory}} gout {{remains a}} challenge on drug development. While <b>pegloticase,</b> a recombinant mammalian uricase modified with monomethoxyl poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) {{is effective in}} treating refractory gout, after continued treatment for 3 months biweekly at a therapeutic dose of 0. 14 mg/kg body weight, it elicits an immune response against mPEG in nearly 20 % of patients. For continued treatment of refractory gout, PEGylated uricases at monthly therapeutic doses below 4 mg/kg body weight have promise. To formulate uricases to achieve monthly therapeutic regimens requires pharmacodynamics simulation and experimentation including molecular engineering of uricases based on rational design and evolution biotechnology in combination to improve their inherent catalytic efficiency, thermostability and selectivity for urate over xanthine and optimization of the number and distribution of accessible reactive amino acid residues in native uricases for site-specific PEGylation with poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives with lower of immunogenicity than mPEG to retain activity, minimize immunogenicity and enhance the pharmacokinetics of the PEGylated uricase.

According to the steadily increasing attention on gout, due to well-established prognostic and epidemiology implications, in the last 5 years, the same change of perspective has been observed also for this disease. In fact, several bio(techno) logical agents have been investigated both for the management of the articular gout symptoms, targeting mainly interleukin- 1 β, as well as urate-lowering therapies such as recombinant uricases. Among the IL- 1 β inhibitors, the majority of studies involve drugs such as anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept, but other compounds are under development. Moreover, other potential targets have been suggested, as, for example, the TNF alpha and IL- 6, even if data obtained are less robust than those of IL- 1 β inhibitors.

40|$|There is an unmet medical {{need in the}} {{treatment}} of gout. This type of inflammatory arthritis can be efficiently alleviated by the enzyme uricase. This enzyme breaks down uric acid, the causative agent of gout, so it can be flushed from the body. In humans and the other great apes, uricase is a pseudogene and as such is inactive. Research on therapeutic uricases has focused on using enzymes from naturally occurring sources; however, these foreign proteins can be very antigenic and present a potentially life-threatening safety risk to patients. We address the challenges of developing a safer uricase therapeutic by exploiting evidence that, while inactive, the human pseudogene is expressed in the human body and may be recognized as self by the immune system. To develop a ﾓhuman-likeﾔ? uricase we apply the hybrid computational and experimental approach of Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction to search functional sequence space of uricase proteins to engineer an enzyme with high sequence identity to the human pseudogene, and possessing therapeutic levels of activity for the breakdown of uric acid.

The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach. Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin- 1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at< 6  mg/dL (360  µmol/L) and < 5  mg/dL (300  µmol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered.

Comprehensive management of gout involves correct identification and addressing all causes of hyperuricemia, treating and preventing attacks of gouty inflammation (using colchicine NSAIDs, and/or steroids), and lowering serum urate (SUA) to an appropriate target level indefinitely. The ideal SUA target is, at a minimum, less than 6 mg/dL (60 mg/L or 360 μmol/L), or even less than 5 mg/dL in patients with tophi. The SUA target should remain at less than 6 mg/dL for long in all gout patients, especially until tophi have resolved. Patient education and adherence to therapy are key point to the optimal management of gout, aspects which are often neglected. Adherence can be monitored in part by continuing, regular assessment of the SUA level. More difficult cases of gout often need a combination of urate lowering therapy (ULT) for both refractory hyperuricemia and chronic tophaceous arthritis. Chronic tophaceous gouty arthropathy which do not respond adequately to optimized oral ULT might benefit from the use of <b>pegloticase,</b> when this is available in, for example, Italy and other European countries. By contrast, in calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition disease (CPPD), as evidenced by pseudo gout attacks or chronic polyarthritis, similar anti-inflammatory strategies have been recommended, but there have as yet been no controlled trials. Of note, there is no treatment for the underlying metabolic disorders able to control the CPPD. Management of crystal-induced arthropathies (CIA) depends not only on clinical expression, namely acute attacks or chronic arthropathy, but also on the underlying metabolic disorder. We will mainly focus on gout as an archetype of CIA...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Numerous {{publications}} identify that gout {{management is}} often sub-optimal, despite detailed {{understanding of the}} pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Barriers to successful gout management include diagnostic inaccuracy, a paucity of guidelines, sub-optimal patient education and patient adherence, co-morbidities and drug-drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout, and limited urate-lowering alternatives. Furthermore, a lack of information exists on the risk-benefit ratios of antihyperuricemic drugs for gout treatment. This thesis studies the clinical pharmacology of antihyperuricemic dugs {{in the treatment of}} gout in clinical practice, with focus on efficacy and tolerability. Studies and reviews of this thesis focus on: management of gout, outcome research with antihyperuricemic drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol, and rasburicase for treatment of gout. Management of gout In chapter 2. 1, we reviewed the literature on management of gout and presented a therapeutic strategy. Limited information on drugs indicated for the treatment of gout is available, making it difficult for physicians to make informed treatment decisions. The current therapeutic strategy is often based on clinical experience. Lifestyle advice is of limited value in the prevention of gout, particularly with regard to restricting alcohol, losing weight in cases of obesity, ensuring adequate diuresis and adhering to a low-purine diet, as most patients are reluctant to make such changes. Therefore, the condition is often treated with pharmacological therapies. Presently, oral colchicine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-choice agents for systemic treatment of acute gout. In the absence of contra-indications, NSAIDs are a convenient and well-accepted option for treatment of acute gout. In case of tophaceous or recurrent gout, the use of urate-lowering drugs is recommended. Allopurinol is currently the first choice drug despite its AE profile at the population level. Many of the currently available treatment options for gout have unwanted side effects highlighting the importance of emerging therapeutics for the treatment of the disease. Benzbromarone (chapter 2. 2) is an old, but very potent urate-lowering drug, and possesses some distinct, recently discovered pharmacological features, which are important for effective and safe use in treatment of gout. Although benzbromarone is on the market for several decades, its place in treatment of gout compared to allopurinol is unclear, because of insufficient trials of good quality. The toxicity of benzbromarone is generally limited, but serious benzbromarone-induced hepatic failure is reported in rare cases. The underlying mechanism has not yet been fully explained, but formation of reactive metabolites by CYP 2 C 9 resulting in mitochondrial toxicity, and CYP 2 C 9 allelic variants might play a role. Important drug-drug interactions may occur with CYP 2 C 9 -substrate drugs, but clinical data are lacking up until now. Outcome research with antihyperuricemic drugs In chapter 3, several studies concerning the efficacy and tolerability of antihyperuricemic drugs in the treatment of gout in clinical rheumatologic practice are presented. In 2003, benzbromarone was withdrawn from the global market. In the Netherlands, suggested alternative treatments were allopurinol (in standard dosage) or probenecid. We studied the market withdrawal of benzbromarone in gout patients in chapter 3. 1, and investigated the efficacy of two alternative treatment strategies: allopurinol (standard dosage) and allopurinol-probenecid combination therapy. A prospective, open study was carried out in 51 patients. Patients were given 200 - 300 mg allopurinol (stage 1); when allopurinol failed to attain the target serum urate concentration, sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l (5. 0 mg/dl), probenecid 1, 000 mg/day was added (stage 2). We found that previous treatment with benzbromarone monotherapy (mean dosage 138 mg/day) resulted in 92 % of patients reaching target levels sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l with a mean sUr decrease of 61 % compared to baseline. In stage 1, 32 patients completed treatment with allopurinol monotherapy (mean dosage 256 mg/day), which resulted in 25 % of patients attaining sUr target levels. Decrease in sUr levels was 36 %, which was significantly less compared to treatment with benzbromarone. In stage 2, 14 patients received allopurinol-probenecid combination therapy, which resulted in 86 % of patients attaining target sUr levels (after failure on allopurinol monotherapy), which was comparable to previous treatment with benzbromarone. Decrease in sUr levels was 53 %, which was a non-significant difference compared to previous treatment with benzbromarone. From the results, it was concluded that benzbromarone is a very effective sUr-lowering drug. Allopurinol in standard dosage was shown to be a less potent alternative for most selected patients to attain target sUr levels. In patients failing on allopurinol monotherapy, the addition of probenecid proves to be an effective treatment strategy for attaining sUr target levels. The results of this study stress the need for effective, evidence-based treatment strategies for lowering of serum urate in gout patients. In The Netherlands, the use of benzbromarone is restricted to gout patients allergic to allopurinol, or otherwise not treatable with this drug. The Dutch general practitioners’ guideline also includes patients who cannot be treated sufficiently with allopurinol. In chapter 3. 2, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of allopurinol (standard dosage) as first-choice antihyperuricemic treatment for gout, and compared the efficacy and tolerability of benzbromarone and probenecid as second-choice treatment. A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was carried out in 96 gout patients with a calculated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min who were prescribed 300 mg allopurinol daily for 2 months (stage 1). In 82 eligible patients, 24 % attained target sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l, and sUr concentrations decreased 36 % from baseline; 11 % stopped allopurinol because of adverse drug reactions. Then, 62 patients failing on allopurinol were randomised to benzbromarone 200 mg/day or probenecid 2, 000 mg/day (stage 2). After 2 months, 22 out of 24 patients (92 %) were treated successfully with benzbromarone, with a sUr decrease of 64 % on average. Treatment success with probenecid was 20 out of 31 patients (65 %), with a sUr decrease of 50 %. This study showed a poor efficacy and tolerability profile of allopurinol 300 mg/day to attain a biochemical predefined target level of sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l after 2 -months treatment. Whether higher doses of allopurinol would increase treatment success, remains subject of further research (chapter 3. 4). In patients failing on allopurinol 300 mg/day, benzbromarone 200 mg/day is significantly more effective and better tolerated than probenecid 2, 000 mg/day. Serum urate is a well-accepted surrogate parameter for short-term evaluation of gout treatment. Furthermore, information on clinical outcomes, such as prevention of recurrent gout attacks and diminishment of tophi, is essential. A lack of long-term, good-quality, prospective data exists addressing the efficacy of serum urate (sUr) lowering treatment to prevent these clinical symptoms. We conducted an observational follow-up study (chapter 3. 3) to assess the rate of recurrent gouty arthritis in 50 patients with a history of recurrent gouty attacks, normal renal function, using antihyperuricemic treatment, and who completed a randomised controlled trial. After 10. 6 months on average, incidence of gout attacks was largely reduced compared to baseline rates: 74 % of patients were free of gouty attacks (100 % reduction), and 18 % of patients had 50 - 99 % reduction of gouty attacks. Serum urate concentrations were 0. 28 [± 0. 08] mmol/l. We found a high reduction in incidence of gout attacks, that was better than obtained in most previous studies. This might be explained by the good control of serum urate in this study. No correlation was found between reduction of gout attacks and sUr or study drug used, due to lack of power. We concluded that antihyperuricemic therapy is highly effective in reducing and preventing gout attacks in gout patients with normal renal function. In chapter 3. 4, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of allopurinol 300 - 600 mg/day versus benzbromarone 100 - 200 mg/day to attain a target sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l. A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was carried out in 65 patients recently diagnosed with gout, who were randomised to allopurinol 300 mg/day or benzbromarone 100 mg/day (stage 1). When the target sUr was not reached, the dosage was doubled. After stage 1 treatment success was 8 out of 31 (26 %) with allopurinol 300 mg/day, and 13 out of 25 (52 %) with benzbromarone 100 mg/day. Overall treatment success with allopurinol 300 - 600 mg/day was 21 out of 27 (78 %), and with benzbromarone 100 - 200 mg/day was 18 out of 23 (78 %), a non-significant difference. In this study, dosage increase of allopurinol and benzbromarone did not affect tolerability. This study showed that efficacy of allopurinol (and to a lesser extent benzbromarone) in gout patients can be markedly increased with increasing dosage. The overall efficacy of allopurinol and benzbromarone was not significantly different. Therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol Chapter 4 concerns the therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol treatment. From previous studies it is known that antihyperuricemic efficacy of allopurinol is related to the serum concentration of oxipurinol, the active metabolite of allopurinol. Reference values of oxipurinol 5 - 15 mg/l (trough) are suggested, but poorly investigated. Given the poor efficacy results of allopurinol in literature and clinical practice, optimisation of allopurinol therapy is warranted. Therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol might be particularly useful in case of patients with renal impairment, oxipurinol-lowering drug-drug interactions, or suspected poor adherence. In chapter 4. 1, a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method with UV-detection (HPLC-UV) to obtain a method for the quantification of allopurinol and oxipurinol in human serum, was validated technically and clinically. The method showed acceptable performance on all major aspects of the validation (linearity, intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy, specificity, and lower/upper limits of quantification). For clinical validation, the serum allopurinol and oxipurinol concentrations in 66 gout patients were determined using this HPLC-UV method. Measured serum allopurinol and oxipurinol concentrations in clinical practice showed large variability with a range of < 0. 5 - 4. 3 mg/l for allopurinol and < 1. 0 - 39. 2 mg/l for oxipurinol, respectively. From these results, we concluded that the proposed method could be employed for the assay of allopurinol and oxipurinol in gout patients. Uricase for gout treatment Recently, a new class of powerful urate-lowering drugs has become available with rasburicase, recombinant uricase. Rasburicase is developed for the treatment and prevention of tumour-lysis syndrome. In chapter 5, the potential role of rasburicase in treatment of severe, treatment-resistant gout was reviewed, and explored in two cases. Future perspectives From the chapters 2. 1, 2. 2, and 3. 1, we conclude that a need for more evidence and education on treatment of gout exists, although the pathogenesis of the disease is well understood and antihyperuricemic therapies are available for decades. Indeed, (only) very recently two important guidelines have been developed: the EULAR recommendations on gout (2006) and the British guideline (2007). The - in some countries temporarily - withdrawal of benzbromarone made clear that this was not in the benefit of gout patients in general, because of scarcity of drugs for antihyperuricemic treatment. The benefit-risk evaluations of alternative drugs might not have been addressed properly, and better efforts might have been done for vigilance and understanding of the hepatotoxicity. Since allopurinol is the only drug currently available worldwide, {{it is very important to}} know how to use this drug safely and effectively. Chapter 3. 2, 3. 4 and 4, show that at least in patients with normal renal function, allopurinol often is inadequately dosed and that target serum urate concentrations can be reached with good tolerability by increase of allopurinol dosage and by optimising serum oxipurinol trough concentrations. In the end, good control of serum urate is associated with good control of gout symptoms (chapter 3. 3). Subject of further research is to what extent these findings can be generalised to patients with renal dysfunction, a large group in gout. This is important, because uricosuric drugs are likely to be less effective in renal dysfunction, and a need for optimisation of allopurinol dosage regimens according to renal function exists. Currently, new antihyperuricemic drugs have been developed for gout treatment: febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and <b>pegloticase,</b> a pegylated form of uricase. New drugs for treatment of gout are welcomed. However, the benefit-risk profiles of these drugs are not undisputed, since febuxostat is associated with liver enzyme elevations, and <b>pegloticase</b> with antibody formation. These new drugs might help management of gout, but more issues require attention to bridge the gap between clinical practice and potential treatment possibilities, such as optimisation of current treatment regimens, evidence of benefit of long-term treatment of gout on clinical outcomes, and patient’s adherence. ...|$|E
