25|$|The {{colony of}} South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern {{boundaries}} set at 132° and 141° East of Greenwich, {{and to the}} north at latitude 26° South. The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 (Nicolas Baudin's priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the <b>parallel</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> 26° South by the British Parliament because that {{was considered to be}} the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of Gulf St Vincent; the South Australian Company had proposed the parallel of 20° South, later reduced to the Tropic of Capricorn (the <b>parallel</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude</b> 23° 37′ South).|$|E

25|$|The {{line between}} the two Korean states was the thirty-eighth <b>parallel</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude.</b> After the Korean War, the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) formed the {{boundary}} between the two. The DMZ is a heavily guarded, 4,000-meter-wide strip of land that runs along the Demarcation line established by the Korean Armistice Agreement, from the east to the west coasts for a distance of 241 kilometers (238 kilometers of that line form the land boundary with North Korea).|$|E

Floyd then asked that all the correspondence relating to the Treaty of Ghent be presented to the House, which was possibly done in an attempt to damage John Quincy Adams' political ambitions by intimating that his negotiation neglected the United States' interests in the West. However, Floyd's bill was unsuccessful, as was possible attempt to discredit Adams. Floyd next capitalized on the fear of Russia's claims of sovereignty in the area and succeeded in having a resolution adopted asking the president to inform the House whether any foreign government had communicated any claims to the territory, but the information was then deemed too sensitive to disclose to the House.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, the Chinese communists and the resuscitated North Korean Army pushed United Nations forces southward from Seoul. They were {{unsupported}} by the Chinese Air Force, which maintained {{air superiority}} in northwestern Korea. On 31 December, the communist ground forces launched an all-out offensive. Unfortunately for them, {{the first five}} days of 1951 offered crystal clear flying weather. On 1 and 2 January, the UN's Tactical Air Control Center handled fighter-bomber flights arriving over the front lines at ten minute intervals; 60% of these flights struck with close air support for UN forces. By 3 January, most tactical sorties were seeking targets of opportunity well behind communist lines. By 5 January, the USAF estimated it had killed nearly 8,000 communist soldiers in five days; 8th Army thought the casualty count was twice that. By 25 January 1951, the UN forces had been pushed back to a line somewhat north of the 37th <b>parallel</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude.</b> At dawn that day, UN troops counterattacked. An 8th Army intelligence report issued the following day estimated communist casualties at 38,000 killed; 18,820 of those dead were credited to tactical air strikes. Without their own air support, the communists had begun their withdrawal to the 38th parallel on 15 January.

2500|$|While Pershing {{was working}} {{to the south}} of Lake Lanao, Major Robert Lee Bullard was working to the north, {{building}} a road from Iligan to Marawi. Although never officially declared one, like Pershing, he was regarded as a Datu by the Moros. Because of the Lake Lanao Moros' very personalistic style of leadership, they had troubles seeing them as two officers in the same army. Instead, they saw them as two powerful chieftains who might become rivals. During Pershing's March Around Lake Lanao, one Moro ran to Bullard, exclaiming that Pershing had gone Juramentado, meaning berserk and that Bullard had better run up the white flag (signaling that they had no quarrel with Pershing's troops). Bullard was unable to explain to the Moro why he was not worried about Pershing's approach. On another occasion, a powerful datu proposed an alliance with Bullard, for the purposes of defeating Pershing and establishing overlordship over the entire Lake Lanao region. On June 1, 1903, the Moro Province was created, which included [...] "all of the territory of the Philippines lying south of the eight <b>parallel</b> <b>of</b> <b>latitude,</b> excepting the island of Palawan and the eastern portion of the northwest peninsula of Mindanao." [...] The province had a civil government, but many civil service positions, including the district governors and their deputies, were held by members of the American military. The governor of the province served as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. This system of combined civil and military administration had several motivations behind it. One was the continued Moro hostilities. Another was the Army's experience during the Indian Wars, when it came into conflict with the civilian Bureau of Indian Affairs. A third was that the Moros, with their feudal, personalistic style of government, would have no respect for a military leader who submitted to the authority of a non-combatant.|$|E
