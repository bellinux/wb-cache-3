40|$|This is {{an exhibit}} {{prepared}} by the Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife for the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission. Washington State had delayed the opening of their 1989 - 90 commercial crab fishery, and this delay disrupted fisheries in other states {{up and down the}} West Coast. The main focus of this report is to develop a plan in case this situation arose again in the future.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out using {{granular}} activated carbon (GAC) adsorption techniques to treat wastewater contaminated with organic compounds caused by diverse human activities. Two techniques were assessed: adsorbent GAC prepared from coconut shell (GACC) and adsorbent GAC from palm shell (GACP). A comparison of these two techniques was undertaken to identify {{ways to improve the}} efficiency of the treatment process. Analysis of the processed wastewater showed that with GACC the removal efficiency of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS) was 65, 60, 82, 82 and 8. 7 %, respectively, while in the case of GACP, the removal efficiency was 55, 60, 81, 91 and 22 %, respectively. It can therefore be concluded that GACC is more effective than GACP for BOD removal, while GACP is better than GACC for TSS and TDS removal. It was also found that for COD and turbidity almost the same results were achieved by the two techniques. In addition, it was observed that both GACC and GACP reduced pH value to 7. 9 after 24 hrs. Moreover, the optimal time <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> of BOD and TDS was 1 hr and 3 hrs, respectively, for both techniques...|$|E

50|$|Wastewater {{enters the}} basin and very fine {{particles}} in the water are separated by means of gravity. The water {{must be in the}} basin long enough for the desired particle size to be removed. Smaller particles require longer <b>periods</b> <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> and thus larger basins. In some basins a flocculant may be added to help smaller particles stick together and form larger particles. Stokes' law can be used to calculate the size of a settling basin needed in order to remove a desired particle size. Stokes' law gives a settling velocity determining an effective settling basin depth; so solids removal depends upon effective settling basin surface area, while the depth component of settling basin volume remains important for storage of settled solids.|$|R

40|$|Multivariate Analysis (MVA), a {{statistical}} design tool {{for dealing with}} very large datasets, was applied to historical data from a Thermo-Mechanical Pulp (TMP) newsprint mill in Eastern Canada. Partial Least Squares (PLS) type MVA models were created to identify significant correlations between operating parameters in the woodchip refining section and variations in pulp quality. Understanding these relationships is of crucial importance to any eventual retrofit design for this process. This paper focusses on pre-selecting and pre-treating the raw process data, including infrequently measured variables, to maximize the realism and usefulness of the MVA black-box models. Key methods explored were ways of selecting low-production <b>periods</b> <b>for</b> <b>removal,</b> techniques <b>for</b> identifying and eliminating major outliers using MVA outputs, and noise filtering. A major conclusion of this work was that the PLS models were significantly improved by pre-treating the data. This paper recommends an overall design approach for applying MVA to industrial operating data, involving stringent removal of dubious periods of operation such as aberrant process behaviour, and an aggressive Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) filtering of all dependent and independent variables...|$|R

Residents of Odessa have recently begun relocating to lower-cost but higher-income Chornomorsk.|$|R
40|$|The {{nitrogen}} removal {{capacity of}} a suspended culture system treating mature landfill leachate was investigated. Leachate containing high ammonium levels of 300 - 900 mg N/L was nitrified in a bench scale sequencing batch reactor. Leachate from four different landfills was treated over a two year <b>period</b> <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of nitrogen. In this time, a highly specific nitrifying culture was attained that delivered exceptionally high rates of ammonia removal. No sludge was wasted from the system to increase the throughput and up to 13 g/L of MLSS was obtained. Settleability of the purely nitrifying biomass was excellent with SVI less than 40 mL/g, even at the high sludge concentrations. Nitrification rates up to 246 mg NI(L h) (5. 91 g N/(L d)) and specific nitrification rates of 36 mg N/(gVSS h) (880 mg N/(gVSS d)) were obtained. The loading to the system at this time allowed complete nitrification of the leachate with a hydraulic retention time of only 5 hours. Following these successful treatability studies, a full-scale plant was designed and built {{at one of the}} landfills investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Field {{experiments}} were conducted during dry and rainy reasons at the Ladoke Akintola of Technology Ogbomoso to understudy {{the effects of}} seasons on okra performance and the critical <b>period</b> <b>for</b> weed <b>removal</b> in Okra on Tithonia diversifolia infested fields. The randomised complete block experiment had ten weeding regimes (treatments) throughout the experimental period. Results of the experiments showed that better growth and yield of Okra occurred {{during the rainy season}} than the dry season. Okra performance was not significantly (P= 0. 05) affected during the rainy seasons when Tithonia weed competition did not exceed 4 WAP. However, during the dry season, okra performance was only comparable to the control when infestation did not exceed 2 weeks after planting (WAP). During the rainy season, weeding beyond the 4 th WAP was luxurious while in the dry season luxurious weeding occurred beyond 2 WAP. Similarly, one single weeding that kepts the crop weed free for the first 2 WAP was as inadequate as not weeding at all during the rainy season while in the dry season delayed weeding beyond 2 WAP led to damages that could not be reversed by subsequent clean weeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of actinides in spent fuel destined for a geologic repository {{such as the}} proposed Yucca Mountain Repository causes a substantial long term heat load, causes the radiotoxicity of the waste to remain high {{for tens of thousands}} of years, and contributes significantly to the long-term dose rate once waste packages begin to fail. Examples, mostly based on the current design of the proposed repository, are considered to illustrate the potential impact of actinide removal on each of these factors. The analyses show that removal of 90 to 99 % of the actinides may significantly increase in the capacity of a repository. In addition, the radiotoxicity of the waste may be reduced to a value less than that of the uranium ore from which the fuel was manufactured within the 10, 000 -year regulatory <b>period.</b> <b>For</b> example, <b>removal</b> of 99. 9 % of the actinides reduces the radiotoxicity to a level less than that of the original ore in less than 400 years. Finally, removal of 99 % of the actinides could reduce the peak long-term dose rate, estimated to occur after about 270, 000 years, by as much as a factor of 60...|$|R

40|$|A {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) -based {{wastewater treatment plant}} in Saudi Arabia was assessed over a nine-month <b>period</b> <b>for</b> virus <b>removal</b> efficiency. Viral diversity was detected using omics-based approaches. Log reduction values (LRV) of Adenoviruses (AdV) and Enteroviruses (EV) were enumerated using digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) and assessed for infectivity using fluorescence-based infection assays. MBR treatment was successful in reducing viral diversity. Plant viruses remained abundant in the treated effluent. Human enteric viruses were present in lower abundance than plant viruses, and were reduced by MBR at varying LRV. AdV copy numbers were reduced by 3. 7 -log. Infectious AdV was not detected in the effluent. EV copy numbers were reduced by 1. 7 -log post MBR and infectious EV decreased {{by an average of}} 2. 0 -log. Infectious EV was detected in the chlorinated effluent, occasionally in concentrations that approximate to its 50 % infectious dose. Overall, results indicated that a MBR-based wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effectively reduces viral diversity, viral load, and infectious capacity by up to 4 -logs. These findings suggest potential concerns associated with plant and human enteric viruses for reuse events in this country. Local guidelines for assessment of treated water quality should take into consideration both infectious viral concentration and LRV...|$|R
40|$|Magister Chirurgiae Dentium - MChDAim: To {{assess the}} change in {{the quality of life of}} {{patients}} while on the third molar surgery waiting list. Introduction: A large number of patients routinely present at the Tygerberg Oral Health Centre <b>for</b> <b>removal</b> of symptomatic impacted third molars. This results in many patients being placed on a surgical waiting list. In addition, many patients who have been placed on this waiting list return for adjunctive interventions, indicating a possible decrease in Quality of Life (QoL) over the waiting period. Numerous studies document post-surgery changes in QoL in patients that have had third molars removed. Many other studies detail QoL changes in patients awaiting orthopaedic and general surgery procedures. However, no study could be found that dealt with changes in QoL while awaiting third molar surgery. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective questionnaire-based study. It compares QoL at the beginning and the end of the waiting <b>period</b> <b>for</b> the <b>removal</b> of impacted third molars in order to determine whether a change in QoL occurs during the waiting period. The study sample was made up of 48 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Results: The present study shows that patients presenting with symptomatic impacted third molars have a decreased QoL at baseline, which further deteriorates over the waiting period. Although the overall change is negative, it is not statistically significant. This suggests that the null hypothesis cannot be excluded, and that it is therefore acceptable for patients to be managed on a waiting list. Conclusion: Third molar surgery results in a greater decrease in mental than physical wellbeing. The results in this study regarding a negative change in QoL was found not to be statistically significant. Only three out of 48 patients required emergency intervention. It can thus be concluded that placing patients on a waiting list for third molar surgery is acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The {{diameter}} of droplets in electric arc wire spraying {{is critical in}} determining the microstructure, porosity and oxide content of the resulting sprayed coatings. Droplet diameter controls dynamic and thermal behaviour in the spray, and the splashing and spreading behaviour of droplets at deposition. In electric arc wire spraying, the droplet diameter is determined {{by a combination of}} the melting behaviour of the feedstock wires in a direct current arc, combined with primary and secondary atomisation processes under the action of a high velocity atomising gas. The high frequency arc voltage variations during electric arc spraying of Fe- 0 · 8 C have been investigated and arc voltage fluctuations related to atomisation events occurring at the wire tips during spraying. A simple analytical model has been proposed which allows the {{diameter of}} primary droplets produced by atomisation to be calculated from the wire feedrate and the average time <b>period</b> <b>for</b> material <b>removal,</b> which was obtained from the voltage traces. Primary droplets were then assumed to undergo secondary atomisation according to correlations from the literature, and resulting droplet diameters were compared with diameters measured by experiment. Despite uncertainties in some of the thermophysical data and dynamic conditions during atomisation, predicted droplet diameters were in good agreement with experimental mass mean droplet diameters obtained under a range of atomising gas pressures, arc voltages and wire feedrates...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study (1) which {{appeared}} in this JOURNAL, it was shown that when ethyl alcohol was given to dogs in large intoxi-cating doses, the animals developed an acute liver injury char-acterized by an acute edema of the liver cells with an infiltration of lipoid material which commenced at {{the periphery of the}} lobules and extended inward towards the central vein. The extent of such changes in the lobule depended upon the amount of the intoxicant administered and the duration of the semianes-thetized or comatose state which ensued. Following such periods a certain number of the animals recovered. A study of biopsy material removed from the livers of such animals indicated the ability of this organ to repair cell changes of a certain order the seat of extensive edema without the formation of new cells and without inducing an invasion into such damaged tissue of wan-dering phagocytic cells. During such periods of liver degeneration and recuperation functional studies were undertaken of the liver by the use of phenoltetrachlorphthalein according to the later technique devised by Rosenthal (2) and of the kidney by the use of phenol-sulphonephthalein. The urine was examined by the usual quali-tative methods. The observations on liver function with the above mentioned dye indicated during the period of liver degen-eration a higher initial plasma concentration and a more pro-longed <b>period</b> <b>for</b> its <b>removal</b> from the plasma than was the cas...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{stormwater}} runoff is recognised as {{a substantial}} source of heavy metal contamination, which adversely impacts on water quality of regional receiving waterways. Conventional treatment of urban runoff mostly involves a filtration system using sand to retain particulate matters. Sand provides limited sorption of dissolved metals and {{the inclusion of}} commercial sorbents to these treatment systems is not cost effective due to the concentration of dissolved metals in the runoff. Recycled organic materials are by-products or waste from industrial or agricultural operations, and could be alternative low cost sorbents for stormwater treatment systems. The use of recycled sorbents also provides added value to the waste materials and reduces landfill disposal. The research explores the application of compost, zeolite, ash, and recyclable waste in urban runoff treatment, especially <b>for</b> dissolved metal <b>removal.</b> The research combines the two aspects of experimental studies and management analysis to develop a holistic approach to heavy metal control in urban stormwater systems. Experimental results of batch sorption test show that compost is suitable for removing dissolve copper in stormwater treatment. The comparison of the different mixing ratios between compost and glass beads in column test evaluates the optimum mixing sorbent and performance over a long <b>period</b> <b>for</b> copper <b>removal.</b> Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) of copper has been performed in the Upper Parramatta River Catchment, Sydney to identify the sources of copper associated with runoff, effect of using waste material such as compost in urban stormwater treatment and the copper load in urban stormwater runoff. This case study shows the relationship between copper input, copper stock, sorbent type and urban stormwater quality control in the system boundary of the catchment. Different scenarios of source control are evaluated to control copper load from the different sources. Source control focusing on roads and vehicles {{is the most effective}} copper control strategy. The combination of source control and stormwater treatment reduces copper in stormwater and receiving water. The thesis applies the analysis from SFA and experimental results to derive both a regional system-wide solution with source control, and an improved design of stormwater treatment <b>for</b> heavy metal <b>removal</b> using recycled organics...|$|R
