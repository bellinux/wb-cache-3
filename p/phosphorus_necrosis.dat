50|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the manufacture of}} the new phosphorus matches were afflicted with phossy jaw and other bone disorders, and there was enough white phosphorus in one pack to kill a person. Deaths and suicides from eating the heads of matches became frequent. The earliest report of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>necrosis</b> was made in 1845 by Lorinser in Vienna, and a New York surgeon published a pamphlet with notes on nine cases.|$|E
50|$|Phossy jaw, {{formally}} <b>phosphorus</b> <b>necrosis</b> of the jaw, is {{an occupational}} disease of {{those who work with}} white phosphorus, also known as yellow phosphorus, without proper safeguards. It was most commonly seen in workers in the match-stick industry in the 19th and early 20th century. Modern occupational hygiene practices have eliminated the working conditions which caused this disease. This disease is caused by the vapour of white phosphorus, which destroys the bones of the jaw.|$|E

Thiersch's findings were thus agreed upon by research done by Wilhelm von Waldeyer-Hartz (1836-1921) at the University of Breslau. He is also credited with modifying Joseph Lister's technique of antiseptic sterilization by substituting salicylic acid for carbolic acid. In addition, he made contributions involving wound healing treatment and in research of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>necrosis</b> of the jaw.|$|E

A first-floor tenant's attempted suicide by <b>phosphorus</b> <b>necrosis</b> is met with indifference, {{as is the}} fate of Hanka, her maid, whom she 'effectively prostitutes' to her son {{in an attempt to}} contain and control his philandering ways. Mela and Hesia, her daughters, are ignorant to the facts of life which she refuses to impart to them, instead insisting that they practice for their music lessons. Mr. Dulski, battered after years of his ruthless and over-bearing wife, remains neutrally bland.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The osteopathology of {{the jaws}} {{associated}} with bone resorption inhibitors is a current topic that engages {{a variety of}} clinical specialists. This has increased after the approval of denosumab for treatment of osteoporosis and skeletal-related events in patients with solid malignancy. Early after the first publications, there is a possible connection between phosphorous necrosis of the jaws, a dreadful industrial disease mentioned, and bisphosphonate-induced pathology. The nineteenth century was the prime time for <b>phosphorus</b> <b>necrosis</b> of match factory workers. RESULTS: This occurrence provides an interesting insight into the medical and surgical profession in the nineteenth century. There are striking parallels and repetition of current and old ideas in the approach to this "new disease. " There are similar examples in case descriptions when compared with today's patients of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ). DISCUSSION: <b>Phosphorus</b> <b>necrosis</b> was first described in Austria. Soon after this, surgeons in German-speaking countries including well-known clinicians Wegner (1872) and von Schulthess-Rechberg (1879) pioneered the analysis, preventative measures, and treatment of this disease. The tendency at this time was to approach BRONJ as a "special kind of osteomyelitis" in pretreated and metabolically different bone. Not only the treatment strategy to wait until sequestrum formation with subsequent removal and preventative measures but also the idea of focusing on the periosteum as the triggering anatomical structure may have been adopted from specialists in the nineteenth century. Therefore, phosphorous necrosis of the jaw {{is an excellent example}} of "learning from the past. ...|$|E
