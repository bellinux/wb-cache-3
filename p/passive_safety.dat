For example, sensors may detect when a vehicle is following too closely and {{slow down the}} vehicle, straighten up seat backs, and tighten seat belts, avoiding and/or preparing for a crash.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{water has}} very low neutron absorption, so heavy water {{reactors}} {{tend to have}} a positive void coefficient, though the CANDU reactor design mitigates this issue by using unenriched, natural uranium; these reactors are also designed with a number of <b>passive</b> <b>safety</b> systems not found in the original RBMK design.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{numerous}} types of action, where action {{refers to the}} mechanism (the trigger, hammer, and safeties considered as a unit) or to the logic of how it is built {{and how it is}} used. They are categorized according to which functions the trigger is to perform. In addition to releasing the hammer or the striker, a trigger may cock the hammer or striker, rotate a revolver's cylinder, deactivate <b>passive</b> <b>safeties,</b> select between semi-automatic and full-automatic fire such as the Steyr AUG (see progressive trigger), or pre-set a [...] "set trigger".

5000|$|Many jurisdictions {{such as the}} State of California {{require some}} form of [...] "drop safety" [...] on all new firearms, which are usually <b>passive</b> <b>safeties</b> {{designed}} to reduce {{the chance of a}} firearm accidentally discharging when dropped or roughly handled. Such safeties generally provide an obstacle to operation of the firing mechanism that is only removed when the trigger is pulled, so that the firearm cannot otherwise discharge. Drop tests were introduced with the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 for imported guns.|$|R
25|$|One {{innovation}} was {{the attention}} paid to <b>passive</b> <b>safety.</b> The car featured a robust chassis providing above average side impact protection, an unusually short steering column with the steering gear set well back {{from the front of}} the car, and a fuel tank placed in a carefully protected location above the rear axle in order to minimize fire risk in the event of an accident.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nuclear}} power industry, water {{can also be used}} as a neutron moderator. In most nuclear reactors, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This {{provides}} something of a <b>passive</b> <b>safety</b> measure, as removing the water from the reactor also slows the nuclear reaction down. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.|$|E
25|$|If {{nuclear power}} use is to expand significantly, nuclear {{facilities}} {{will have to}} be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community. New reactor designs have features of <b>passive</b> <b>safety,</b> such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators. But these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents, not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group.

2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} {{has moved to}} improve engineering design. Generation IV reactors are now in late stage design and development to improve safety, sustainability, efficiency, and cost. Key to the latest designs {{is the concept of}} <b>passive</b> nuclear <b>safety.</b> [...] <b>Passive</b> nuclear <b>safety</b> does not require operator actions or electronic feedback in order to shut down safely {{in the event of a}} particular type of emergency (usually overheating resulting from a loss of coolant or loss of coolant flow). This is in contrast to older-yet-common reactor designs, where the natural tendency for the reaction was to accelerate rapidly from increased temperatures. [...] In such a case, cooling systems must be operative to prevent meltdown. [...] Past design mistakes like Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. New reactors with <b>passive</b> nuclear <b>safety</b> eliminate this failure mode.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} navigating a mobile robot with a limited field-of-view in a unknown dynamic environment. In such a situation, absolute motion safety, i. e. such that no collision will ever take place whatever happens, is impossible to guarantee. It is therefore settled for a weaker level of motion <b>safety</b> dubbed <b>passive</b> motion safety: it guarantees that, if a collision takes place, the robot will be at rest. <b>Passive</b> motion <b>safety</b> is tackled using {{a variant of the}} Inevitable Collision State (ICS) concept called Braking ICS, i. e. states such that, whatever the future braking trajectory of the robot, a collision occurs before it is at rest. <b>Passive</b> motion <b>safety</b> is readily obtained by avoiding Braking ICS at all times. Building upon an existing Braking ICS-Checker, i. e. an algorithm that checks if a given state is a Braking ICS or not, this paper presents a reactive collision avoidance scheme called PASSAVOID. The main contribution of this paper is the formal proof of PASSAVOID’s <b>passive</b> motion <b>safety.</b> Experiments in simulation demonstrates how PASSAVOID operates...|$|R

25|$|The United States generates about 18% of its {{electricity}} from nuclear power plants. Nuclear engineers {{in this field}} generally work, directly or indirectly, in the nuclear power industry or for national laboratories. Current research in the industry is directed at producing economical, proliferation-resistant reactor designs with <b>passive</b> <b>safety</b> features. Some government labs research the same areas as industry, they also study a myriad of other issues such as nuclear fuels and nuclear fuel cycles, advanced reactor designs, and nuclear weapon design and maintenance. A principal pipeline for trained personnel for US reactor facilities is the Navy Nuclear Power Program. The job outlook for nuclear engineering from the year 2012 to the year 2022 is predicted to grow 9% due to many elder nuclear engineers retiring, safety systems needing to be updated in power plants, and the advancements made in nuclear medicine.|$|E

40|$|Accidental {{discharges}} {{can pose}} a specific risk to users who carry concealed handguns for self-defense {{due to the}} consequences of a snag. The efficacy of a <b>passive</b> grip <b>safety</b> was evaluated in the present study to determine if its presence would lower the incidence of accidental discharges in forced snag situations. One-hundred and eight right-handed participants were asked to draw and fire from a concealed holster using a handgun simulator. Their proclivity to snag on the cover garment as well as accidental discharge rate was observed; participants were also subject to a forced 1 in. or 10 in. snag to test the effectiveness of the <b>passive</b> grip <b>safety.</b> The results suggest that a <b>passive</b> grip <b>safety</b> is not an effective means of mitigating accidental discharges as measured by the experimental conditions and apparatus used in this study. Additionally, self-reported handgun expertise was not shown to predict handgun-related errors. Conversely, higher video game expertise was shown {{to increase the number of}} handgun errors resulting in higher accidental discharge and snag rates. However, more research is needed to determine whether the obtained results generalize to actual handguns...|$|R

2500|$|Faced {{with public}} antipathy, the nuclear {{industry}} has [...] "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of [...] numerous [...] "fact sheets" [...] that discuss issues of public concern.

These designs include those that [...] incorporate <b>passive</b> <b>safety</b> and Small Modular Reactors. While these reactor designs [...] "are intended to inspire trust, they may have an unintended effect: creating distrust of older reactors that lack the touted safety features".|$|E
2500|$|The upgrade also {{included}} electronic stability control VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) with an emergency brake assist device and slip control ASR (Anti Slip Regulation) came as standard.

2500|$|Gladwell {{also noted}} that SUV {{popularity}} is also a sign that people began to shift automobile safety focus from active to passive, {{to the point that}} in the US potential SUV buyers will give up an extra [...] of braking distance because they believe they are helpless to avoid a tractor-trailer hit on any vehicle. The four-wheel drive option available to SUVs reinforced the <b>passive</b> <b>safety</b> notion. To support Gladwell's argument, he mentioned that automotive engineer David Champion noted that in his previous driving experience with Range Rover, his vehicle slid across a four-lane road because he did not perceive the slipping that others had experienced. Gladwell concluded that when a driver feels unsafe when driving a vehicle, it makes the vehicle safer. When a driver feels safe when driving, the vehicle becomes less safe.|$|E
2500|$|The flight {{performance}} of the DA42 is largely favourable, having been designed to incorporate not only high levels of performance but the greatest possible degrees of <b>passive</b> <b>safety</b> in operation, alongside [...] excellent fuel economy and assisted by the implementation of various modern technologies. The flight controls themselves are proportionally responsive for performing even small manoeuvers and light motions. Both pilots are equipped with their own fighter-style central sticks, which are attached to an otherwise unobstructed cockpit floor. In a similar manner, a single combined power lever is used to regulate both the engine and propeller settings; the power levers are convenient and can be operated in a relatively easy manner. In comparison with other twin-engined aircraft in its category, the centre console of the DA42 is uncluttered, which {{is a result of}} the clean design of the controls.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to most other battery electric vehicles including the Roadster, the battery pack of the Model S forms {{the floor of}} the vehicle between the axles, providing the vehicle with several advantages. Most notably, since the battery pack is the heaviest component of the vehicle, the Model S has a center of gravity height of only [...] (about the same as a Lotus Elise), helping it to achieve a lateral acceleration of 0.9g and good protection against rollover. Secondly, the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the mass to be centralized between the axles, lowering rotational inertia allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight. Thirdly, the placement of the battery pack increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment, improving the <b>passive</b> <b>safety</b> of the vehicle. Fourth, placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds, either for maintenance or for Tesla's Battery Swap service.|$|E
