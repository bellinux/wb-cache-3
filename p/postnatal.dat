5|$|ApoER2 plays a {{critical}} role as a receptor in the reelin signalling pathway, which is important for brain development and <b>postnatal</b> function of the brain. This pathway specifically affects cortical migration and long-term potentiation.|$|E
5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early <b>postnatal</b> period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (<b>postnatal</b> day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their <b>postnatal</b> needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} mineral, including to prenatal and <b>postnatal</b> development. Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people {{in the developing world}} and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Piglets {{that were}} fed with a formula {{containing}} milk phospholipids and gangliosides to mimic levels in human milk made choices more rapidly and with fewer errors in a spatial T-maze cognitive test compared to controls, implying improved spatial learning. Similarly, Vickers et al. (2009) demonstrated that administration of complex milk lipids to rats from <b>postnatal</b> day 10 through adulthood (day 80) led to {{significant improvements in}} learning and memory tasks compared to control animals. Conversely, a study of complex milk lipid supplementation to pregnant mice {{did not have an}} effect on cognitive tasks in their offspring.|$|E
25|$|Exposure of fetuses to {{cortisol}} during gestation {{can have}} a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and <b>postnatal</b> growth patterns. In marmosets, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, <b>postnatal</b> growth rates in these high-cortisol infants was more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in <b>postnatal</b> periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre- and <b>postnatal</b> growth in primates.|$|E
25|$|Chlordiazepoxide {{taken during}} {{pregnancy}} {{can cause a}} <b>postnatal</b> benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.|$|E
25|$|KCC2a levels remain {{relatively}} constant during pre- and <b>postnatal</b> development.|$|E
25|$|<b>Postnatal</b> care is care {{provided}} to the mother following parturition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Postnatal</b> {{maternity}} leave is now six months {{instead of the}} previous three.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{kangaroo}} care {{helps to}} reduce morbidity and mortality, improves parent satisfaction, provides opportunities for teaching during <b>postnatal</b> follow-up visits, and decreases hospital-associated costs.|$|E
25|$|A 60-bed <b>postnatal</b> {{maternal}} {{care center}} was built with $10 million {{in state and}} federal grants. Mothers can recuperate there for two weeks away from their large families.|$|E
25|$|The sex-specific {{transcription}} of somatostatin gene {{coincides with}} the establishment of sex differences in SDN-POA. It is observed that somatostatin mRNA appears in the SDN-POA of both males and females. On <b>postnatal</b> day 8 through <b>postnatal</b> day 35, the area of somatostatin mRNA-positive cells was significantly larger in males than in females, with males attain the maximum size of that area on day15 before decrease whereas females show no changes. Eventually the expression of somatostatin mRNA shows no difference between sexes. It is possible that somatostatin is related to the estrogen-dependent organization of SDN-POA.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone {{effects can}} also be {{classified}} {{by the age of}} usual occurrence. For <b>postnatal</b> effects in both males and females, these are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptom of}} {{prenatal}} growth retardation {{is the most}} common finding and can be moderate to severe. <b>Postnatal</b> growth retardation can also be moderate to severe and correlates with the degree of severity of limb and craniofacial malformations.|$|E
25|$|Once {{structural}} {{diversity is}} established anatomically, a second selective process occurs during <b>postnatal</b> behavioral experience through epigenetic modifications in {{the strength of}} synaptic connections between neuronal groups. This creates a diverse secondary repertoire by differential amplification.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroos have large, {{powerful}} hind legs, large feet {{adapted for}} leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, {{and a small}} head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete <b>postnatal</b> development.|$|E
25|$|The <b>postnatal</b> period, also {{referred}} to as the puerperium, begins immediately after delivery and extends for about six weeks. During this period, the mother's body begins the return to pre-pregnancy conditions that includes changes in hormone levels and uterus size.|$|E
25|$|In many {{infants with}} {{inguinal}} testes, further descent of the testes into the scrotum {{occurs in the}} first 6 months of life. This is attributed to the <b>postnatal</b> surge of gonadotropins and testosterone that normally occurs {{between the first and}} fourth months of life.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be a}} {{somewhat}} higher incidence of <b>postnatal</b> depression in the first weeks after childbirth for women who have caesarean sections, but this difference does not persist. Some {{women who have had}} caesarean sections, especially emergency caesareans, experience post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|This {{maturation}} {{of electrical}} properties is seen across species. Xenopus sodium and potassium currents increase drastically after a neuron goes through its {{final phase of}} mitosis. The sodium current density of rat cortical neurons increases by 600% within the first two <b>postnatal</b> weeks.|$|E
25|$|The Kleihauer–Betke test or {{flow cytometry}} on a <b>postnatal</b> {{maternal}} blood sample can confirm that fetal blood has {{passed into the}} maternal circulation and {{can also be used}} to estimate the amount of fetal blood that has passed into the maternal circulation.|$|E
25|$|Cajal–Retzius cells (CR cells) (also {{known as}} Horizontal cell of Cajal) are a {{heterogeneous}} population of morphologically and molecularly distinct reelin-producing cell {{types in the}} marginal zone/layer I of the developmental cerebral cortex and in the immature hippocampus of different species and at different times during embryogenesis and <b>postnatal</b> life.|$|E
25|$|T3 has {{profound}} effect upon the developing embryo and infants. It affects the lungs and influences the <b>postnatal</b> {{growth of the}} central nervous system. It stimulates the production of myelin, the production of neurotransmitters, {{and the growth of}} axons. It is also important in the linear growth of bones.|$|E
25|$|Adequate supply, but not excess vitamin A, is {{especially}} important for pregnant and breastfeeding women for normal fetal development and in breastmilk. Deficiencies cannot be compensated by <b>postnatal</b> supplementation. Excess vitamin A, which is most common with high dose vitamin supplements, can cause birth defects and therefore should not exceed recommended daily values.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all mammals display sex-dimorphic {{reproductive}} {{and sexual}} behavior (e.g., lordosis and mounting in rodents). Much research {{has made it}} clear that prenatal and early <b>postnatal</b> androgens play a role in the differentiation of most mammalian brains. Experimental manipulation of androgen levels in utero or shortly after birth can alter adult reproductive behavior.|$|E
25|$|KCC2b, on {{the other}} hand, is {{scarcely}} present during prenatal development and is strongly upregulated during <b>postnatal</b> development. The upregulation of KCC2b expression {{is thought to be}} responsible for the “developmental shift” observed in mammals from depolarizing postsynaptic effects of inhibitory synapses in early neural networks to hyperpolarizing effects in mature neural networks.|$|E
25|$|A {{woman in}} the Western world who is {{delivering}} in a hospital may leave the hospital {{as soon as she}} is medically stable and chooses to leave, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) is 1–2 days, and the average caesarean section <b>postnatal</b> stay is 3–4 days.|$|E
25|$|Mothers can {{experience}} increased incidence of <b>postnatal</b> depression, and {{can experience}} significant psychological trauma and ongoing birth-related {{post-traumatic stress disorder}} after obstetric intervention during the birthing process. Factors like pain in first stage of labor, feelings of powerlessness, intrusive emergency obstetric intervention are important in the subsequent development of psychological issues related to labour and delivery.|$|E
25|$|This is {{from mother}} to child (more rarely father to child), often in utero, during {{childbirth}} (also {{referred to as}} perinatal infection) or during <b>postnatal</b> physical contact between parents and offspring. In mammals, including humans, it occurs also via breast milk. Infectious diseases that can be transmitted in this way include: HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. Many mutualistic organisms are transmitted vertically.|$|E
25|$|Mary Help of the Sick Mission Hospital now has 121 beds, and {{provides}} affordable prenatal and <b>postnatal</b> care, nutritional education, child immunization, and family planning. The hospital gives prenatal care, including lab work, blood tests, and examinations for 200 women each day. The facility {{also has a}} special-care nursery for newborn babies. The hospital serves to educate nurses and midwives. Over 66 students are trained each year.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{excellent}} <b>postnatal</b> prognosis, 99% of Turner-syndrome conceptions {{are thought to}} end in miscarriage or stillbirth, {{and as many as}} 15% of all spontaneous abortions have the 45,X karyotype. Among cases that are detected by routine amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, one study found that the prevalence of Turner syndrome among tested pregnancies was 5.58 and 13.3 times higher, respectively, than among live neonates in a similar population.|$|E
25|$|For {{women who}} have a {{hospital}} birth, the minimum hospital stay is six hours. Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full <b>postnatal</b> assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A <b>postnatal</b> assessment includes the woman's observations, general well being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she {{has not had a}} caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing doesn't need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her lochia, ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.|$|E
25|$|WR is {{associated}} with abnormalities in bone maturation, and lipids and hormone metabolism. Affected individuals exhibit intrauterine and <b>postnatal</b> growth retardation, leading to short stature and an aged appearance from birth. They have physical abnormalities including a large head (macrocephaly), sparse hair, prominent scalp veins, inward-folded eyelids, widened anterior fontanelles, hollow cheeks (malar hypoplasia), general loss of fat tissues under the skin, delayed tooth eruption, abnormal hair pattern, beaked noses, mild to severe mental retardation and dysmorphism.|$|E
25|$|When {{structural}} impairments are not observable {{or do not}} exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In {{the context}} of FASD, neurological impairments are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the autonomic nervous system. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a <b>postnatal</b> insult, such as a high fever, concussion, traumatic brain injury, etc.|$|E
25|$|Early {{regulation}} {{and training of}} midwives had begun in the early 1900s. In 1911, New York City opened the first municipally sponsored American midwifery school called the Bellevue Hospital School for Midwives. Sara Josephine Baker played {{a prominent role in}} establishing the school. The school mostly enrolled Italian, German, Polish, and Hungarian immigrants and provided them with eight months of training in prenatal care, <b>postnatal</b> care, and deliveries. Additionally, the deliveries attended by midwives trained by Bellevue had lower maternal and infant mortality rates than citywide statistics.|$|E
