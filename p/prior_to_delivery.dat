25|$|Despite the {{aircraft}}'s many faults, {{only two}} {{were lost in}} accidents. The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt {{which was part of}} the test flight profile. Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the rudder had locked. Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to come to a stop before bailing out. Because of the tandem seating, it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda down hard in a farmer's field, and walked away unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped.|$|E
