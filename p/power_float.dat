50|$|A {{houseboat}} (different from boathouse, {{which is}} a shed for storing boats) is a boat that has been designed or modified to be used primarily as a home. Some houseboats are not motorized, because they are usually moored, kept stationary at a fixed point and often tethered to land to provide utilities. However, many are capable of operation under their own <b>power.</b> <b>Float</b> house is a Canadian and American term for a house on a float (raft), a rough house may be called a shanty boat. In Western countries, houseboats tend to be either owned privately or rented out to holiday-goers, and on some canals in Europe, people dwell in houseboats all year round. Examples of this include, {{but are not limited}} to, Amsterdam, London, and Paris.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{architecture}} for a combinational {{floating point}} multiplier and squarer is described {{for the purpose}} of producing a low <b>power</b> <b>floating</b> point square with small area requirements. The floating-point multiplier and squarer architecture are compared to demonstrate the power advantage of the squarer. The multiplier and squarer are combined into one circuit in order {{to take advantage of the}} squarer power improvements with a minimal increase in area. Shared circuitry among the units provides justification for inclusion of a dedicated squarer since a small amount of additional circuitry is required and the power savings for squaring computations is significant as compared to the use of a general-purpose multiplier to generate a squared value...|$|R

6000|$|The {{mate and}} men rushed on deck {{in time to}} see a large ship pass close to the bow of the Gull.

The rush of the tide past a ship at anchor confers upon it at all times, except during [...] "slack water" [...] (i.e., when the tide is on the turn), the power of steering, so that she can be made to sheer swiftly to port or starboard, as may be required. But for this <b>power,</b> <b>floating</b> lights would undoubtedly be run into more frequently than they are.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} low <b>power</b> {{probabilistic}} <b>floating</b> point multiplier. Probabilistic computation {{has been shown}} to be a technique for achieving energy efficient designs. As best known to the authors, this is the first attempt to use probabilistic digital logic to attain low <b>power</b> in a <b>floating</b> point multiplier. To validate the approach, probabilistic multiplications are introduced in a ray tracing algorithm used in computer graphics applications. It is then shown that energy savings of around 31 % can be achieved in a ray tracing algorithm’s floating point multipliers with negligible degradation in the perceptual quality of the generated image.
