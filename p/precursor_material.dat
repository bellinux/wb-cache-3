40|$|The {{extensive}} {{amount of}} platinum required {{in order to}} facilitate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occuring at the cathode of low temperature fuel cells provides cost limitations to the sustainable commercialization of this technology. The development of electrocatalyst materials with either reduced or eliminated platinum dependency is an urgent necessity. The present work investigates the application of nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and their composites as electrocatalyst materials for the ORR. First, N-CNTs are investigated as platinum support materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. They were found to result in improved ORR activity in comparison with undoped CNT supported platinum, due to the enhanced catalyst-support interactions and electronic properties induced by nitrogen heteroatoms incorporated into the graphitic structure of CNTs. Second, N-CNTs synthesized from a variety of different <b>precursor</b> <b>materials</b> were investigated as ORR electrocatalysts in alkaline conditions. The influence of the <b>precursor</b> <b>materials</b> was illustrated with improved ORR activity and nitrogen concentration observed for N-CNTs synthesized with <b>precursor</b> <b>materials</b> containing higher nitrogen to carbon contents.

His focus is Oelwein, a once thriving small town that started to suffer economically {{by the end of}} the century. He analyzes the causes of the rural economic decline: in the context of deregulation and globalization agricultural conglomerates have taken over local businesses. As a result jobs have disappeared, towns became depopulated, and tax revenue shrunk. Use of meth proliferated in response in the depressed areas. In Iowa, in 2004 it was mostly produced locally using cold medicine as the drug precursor. That year Iowa law enforcement closed 1,370 meth labs (page 29). When, after a long delay, cold medicine became more restricted as a <b>precursor</b> <b>material,</b> Mexican operatives moved in. With superlabs in Mexico, drug lords used illegal immigrants hired as cheap labor by agricultural conglomerates as distributors for their networks.
