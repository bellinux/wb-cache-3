40|$|Abstract Background A {{large part}} of our {{knowledge}} on the world's species is recorded in the corpus of biodiversity literature with well over hundred million pages, and is represented in natural history collections estimated at 2 – 3 billion specimens. But this body of knowledge is almost entirely in <b>paper-print</b> form and is not directly accessible through the Internet. For the digitization of this literature, new territories have to be chartered {{in the fields of}} technical, legal and social issues that presently impede its advance. The taxonomic literature seems especially destined for such a transformation. Discussion Plazi was founded as an association with the primary goal of transforming both the printed and, more recently, "born-digital" taxonomic literature into semantically enabled, enhanced documents. This includes the creation of a test body of literature, an XML schema modeling its logic content (TaxonX), the development of a mark-up editor (GoldenGATE) allowing also the enhancement of documents with links to external resources via Life Science Identifiers (LSID), a repository for publications and issuance of bibliographic identifiers, a dedicated server to serve the marked up content (the Plazi Search and Retrieval Server, SRS) and semantic tools to mine information. Plazi's workflow is designed to respect copyright protection and achieves extraction by observing exceptions and limitations existent in international copyright law. Conclusion The information found in Plazi's databases – taxonomic treatments as well as the metadata of the publications – are in the public domain and can therefore be used for further scientific research without any restriction, whether or not contained in copyrighted publications. </p...|$|E

5|$|For printing, {{the mass}} {{production}} of paper for writing was already well established in China. The papermaking process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121) in 105, {{and was in}} widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue <b>paper-printed</b> money—the banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, paper bags for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had done a great service were rewarded by the court with gifts of <b>paper-printed</b> money wrapped in paper envelopes. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed {{to meet the needs}} of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.|$|R

40|$|Background Identification {{keys are}} {{decision}} trees which require {{the observation of}} one or more morphological characters of an organism at each step of the process. While modern digital keys can overcome several constraints of classical <b>paper-printed</b> keys, their performance is not error-free. Moreover, identification cannot be always achieved when a specimen lacks some morphological features (i. e. because of season, incomplete development or miss-collecting). DNA barcoding was proven to have great potential in plant identification, while it can be ineffective with some closely related taxa, in which the relatively brief evolutionary distance did not produce differences in the core-barcode sequences. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we investigated how the DNA barcoding can support the modern digital approaches to the identification of organisms, using as a case study a local flora, that of Mt. Valerio, a small hill near the centre of Trieste (NE Italy). The core barcode markers (plastidial rbcL and matK), plus the additional trnH-psbA region, were used to identify vascular plants specimens. The usefulness of DNA barcoding data in enhancing the performance of a digital identification key was tested on three independent simulated scenarios.

40|$|Driven by a {{digitization}} of society, {{the academic}} publishing industry has undergone {{major changes in}} the past two decades, with online articles replacing <b>paper-printed</b> articles as the main example. Furthermore, in November 2013 the Dutch government formulated the aim to reach a system of full open access to publications (OAP) by 2024 and in May 2016 the Competitiveness Council of the EU took important decisions to achieve immediate OAP by 2020. Clearly, a transition towards OAP has been initiated, reflected by the establishment of a remarkable number of open access (OA) -journals. Nevertheless, publishers of OA-journals face major challenges. To overcome these challenges and establish a successful introduction to the market, the innovation of OAP has to fulfil customer’s needs and be superior to alternatives. Therefore, an understanding of potential customers and the factors influencing their decision to adopt the innovation, is important. This research focuses on the scientist as the customer of OAP, because a scientist decides where to submit his/her paper and therefore whether or not to publish in OA. Previous research has explored the challenges posed to OAP by examining the awareness of, experience with and attitude among scientists towards OAP and has aimed to uncover factors influencing a scientist’s decision whether or not to adopt OAP. However, the factors identified remain limited. This research identified the factors scientists employed by Dutch universities perceive as incentive or barrier in their adoption-decision process for OAP. In doing so, this research complemented the range of factors influencing a scientist’s decision whether or not to adopt OAP. In order to identify these factors, interviews with librarians and scientists were conducted and an online survey was sent out to Dutch scientists. Fifteen interviews with librarians were conducted to provide a general overview of the OA-policy of the VSNU universities. The subsequent four interviews with scientists provided a first insight into the factors they perceive as barrier or incentive during their adoption-decision process regarding OAP. Finally, the online survey tested for these factors on a large scale. Eventually, six incentives and four barriers were identified. Personal and societal perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use of OAP, peer usage, valuation of OAP in the scientific discipline and the presence of OA-information sessions were identified as incentives in the adoption-decision with regard to OAP. The scientist’s age, a scientist’s career position, a large percentage of non-OA publications compared to OA-publications in the research output of a scientist and a mono-disciplinary nature of the discipline were identified as barriers in forming a positive attitude towards OAP. Information sessions at the universities {{turned out to be a}} great way to disseminate information to scientists and will therefore contribute to the creation of awareness of OAP. In conclusion, services to stimulate OAP should at first focus on younger and/or lower-positioned scientists from multi-disciplinary fields. In order to increase the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of OAP such services should be organized in a way that provides as much clarity and information as possible about the process of OA-publishing...|$|R
40|$|In zoological nomenclature, to be {{potentially}} valid, nomenclatural novelties (i. e., new nomina and nomenclatural acts) need {{first to}} be made available, that is, published in works qualifying as publications {{as defined by the}} International Code of zoological Nomenclature (“the Code ”). In September 2012, the Code was amended in order to allow the recognition of works electronically published online after 2011 as publications available for the purpose of zoological nomenclature, provided they meet several conditions, notably a preregistration of the work in ZooBank. Despite these new Rules, several of the long-discussed problems concerning the electronic publication of new nomina and nomenclatural acts have not been resolved. The publication of this amendment provides an opportunity to discuss some of these in detail. It is important to note that: (1) all works published only online before 2012 are nomenclaturally unavailable; (2) printed copies of the PDFs of works which do not have their own ISSN or ISBN, and which are not obtainable free of charge or by purchase, do not qualify as publications but must be seen as facsimiles of unavailable works and are unable to provide nomenclatural availability to any nomenclatural novelties they may contain; (3) prepublications online of later released online publications are unavailable, i. e., they do not advance the date of publication; (4) the publication dates of works for which online prepublications had been released are not those of these prepublications and it is critical that the real release date of such works appear on the actual final electronic publication, but this is not currently the case in electronic periodicals that distribute such online prepublications and which still indicate on their websites and PDFs the date of release of prepublication as that of publication of the work; (5) supplementary online materials and subsequent formal corrections of either paper or electronic publications distributed only online are nomenclaturally unavailable; (6) nomenclatural information provided on online websites that do not have a fixed content and format, with ISSN or ISBN, is unavailable. We give precise examples of many of these nomenclatural problems. Several of them, when they arise, are {{due to the fact that}} the availability of nomenclatural novelties now depends on information that will have to be sought not from the work itself but from extrinsic evidence. As shown by several examples discussed here, an electronic document can be modified while keeping the same DOI and publication date, which is not compatible with the requirements of zoological nomenclature. Therefore, another system of registration of electronic documents as permanent and inalterable will have to be devised. ZooBank also clearly needs to be improved in several respects. Mention in a work of its registration number (LSID) in ZooBank would seem to be possible only if this registration has occurred previously, but some works that have purportedly been registered in ZooBank are in fact missing on this web application. In conclusion, we offer recommendations to authors, referees, editors, publishers, libraries and the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, in the hope that such problems can be limited along with the potential chaos in zoological nomenclature that could result, if careful attention is not paid to the problems we highlight here, from a somewhat misplaced, and perhaps now widespread, understanding that electronic publication of nomenclatural novelties is now allowed and straightforward. We suggest that, as long as the problematic points linked to the new amendment and to electronic publication as a whole are not resolved, nomenclatural novelties continue to be published in <b>paper-printed</b> journals that have so far shown editorial competence regarding taxonomy and nomenclature, which is not the case of several recent electronic-only published journals...|$|R
