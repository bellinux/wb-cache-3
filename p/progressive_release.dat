40|$|Abstract. Sea urchin egg {{activation}} at fertilization is progressive, {{beginning at}} the point of sperm entry and moving across the egg with a velocity of 5 ~tm/s. This activation wave (Kacser, H., 1955, J. Exp. Biol., 32 : 451 - 467) has been suggested {{to be the result of}} a <b>progressive</b> <b>release</b> of calcium from a store within the egg cytoplasm (Jaffe, L. E, 1983, Dev. Biol., 99 : 265 - 276). The <b>progressive</b> <b>release</b> of calcium may be due to the production of inositol trisphosphate (InsP 3), a second messenger. We show here that (a) a wave of calcium release crosses the Lytechinus pictus egg; the peak of the wave travels with a velocity of 5 ~tm/s; (b) microinjection of InsP 3 causes the release of calcium within the egg; (c) calcium release (as judged by fertilization envelope elevation) is abolished b...|$|E

This activation wave (Kacser, H., 1955, J. Exp.

We show here that a wave of calcium release crosses the Lytechinus pictus egg; the peak of the wave travels with a velocity of 5 microns/s; microinjection of InsP 3 causes the release of calcium within the egg; calcium release (as judged by fertilization envelope elevation) is abolished by prior injection of the calcium chelator EGTA; neomycin, an inhibitor of InsP 3 production, does not prevent the release of calcium in response to InsP 3 but does abolish the wave of calcium release; the egg cytoplasm rapidly buffers microinjected calcium; the calcium concentration required to cause fertilization membrane elevation when microinjected is very similar to that required to stimulate the production of InsP 3 in vitro; and the progressive fertilization membrane elevation seen after microinjection of calcium buffers appears to be due to diffusion of the buffer across the egg cytoplasm rather than to the induction of the activation wave. We conclude that InsP 3 diffuses through the egg cytoplasm much more readily than calcium ions and that calcium-stimulated production of InsP 3 and InsP 3 -induced calcium release from an internal store can account for the <b>progressive</b> <b>release</b> of calcium at fertilization...|$|E

30|$|Second {{and more}} important, after {{factoring}} out {{the effect of}} shot number on Whittle values, the effect of release year remained a reliable but modest effect (t(291)[*]=[*]−[*] 2.35, p[*]=[*] 0.02).

30|$|ROS is {{a natural}} {{by-product}} of the metabolism of respiring organisms [76]. Induction of ROS synthesis leads {{to the formation of}} highly reactive radicals that destroy the cells. The possible mechanisms of H. pylori and H. felis cell death are due to membrane damage by AgNPs which relates to metal depletion, that is, the formation of pits in the outer membrane and change in membrane permeability by the <b>progressive</b> <b>release</b> of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules and membrane proteins [90]. Previous studies proposed that the sites of interaction for AgNPs and membrane cells might be due to sulfur-containing proteins present in the bacterial membrane proteins [91 - 95].

40|$|Starting {{with fewer}} {{degrees of freedom}} {{has been shown to}} enable a more {{efficient}} exploration of the sensorimotor space. While not necessarily leading to optimal task performance, it results in a smaller number of directions of stability, which guide the coordination of additional degrees of freedom. The developmental release of additional degrees of freedom is then expected to allow for optimal task performance and more tolerance and adaptation to environmental interaction. In this paper, we test this assumption with a small-sized humanoid robot that learns to swing under environmental perturbations. Our experiments show that a <b>progressive</b> <b>release</b> of degrees of freedom alone is not sufficient to cope with environmental perturbations. Instead, alternate freezing and freeing of the degrees of freedom is required. Such finding is consistent with observations made during transitional periods in acquisition of skills in infants...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present {{project is}} focused on the plasma-deposition of thin films (~ 150 nm) {{containing}} silver nanoparticles embedded in a polymeric matrix, to prevent microbial adhesion to stainless steel. The process originality relies on a dual strategy associating silver target sputtering and plasma polymerization in argon-hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) plasma, using an asymmetrical RF discharge (13. 56 MHz). The physico-chemical properties of the obtained films were investigated by transmission FTIR and XPS. To determine the anti-adhesive efficiency, detachment experiments were performed in a shear stress flow chamber with silver-containing and silver-free deposits. The maximal detachment efficiency was achieved with the polymeric matrix alone. Silver antimicrobial effect is assumed to be related to Ag+ ion <b>progressive</b> <b>release</b> from the embedded particles into the surrounding medium. This release was confirmed by ICP-MS measurements. Furthermore, film biocide activity was observed for silver-containing film...|$|E
