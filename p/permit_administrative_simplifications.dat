40|$|Regulatory {{complexity}} and bureaucracy inefficiencies increase {{the time needed}} {{and the cost of}} starting a business and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a country. Since the early 1990 s Italy, {{in the same way as}} other developed countries, has been trying to introduce some reforms to boost the efficiency of general government and reduce bureaucracy. This has only been partially successful results. In 2010 two new reforms were introduced. The first allows an entrepreneur to start a business by electronically filing a form (named SCIA, Segnalazione Certificata di Inizio AttivitÃ ) declaring that the firm complies with all the legal requirements. The SCIA replaces ex ante with ex post public administration controls. The second reform improves the local one-stop-shops regulation (the SUAP, Sportello Unico per le AttivitÃ  Produttive). This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the two reforms. The time required and the cost of starting a business can be effectively reduced only if the <b>administrative</b> <b>simplification</b> tools are coupled with other reforms that eliminate unnecessary regulatory barriers, rationalize regulation, and reorganize the public administration. time and costs for starting a business, regulation entry, public administration control, <b>administrative</b> <b>simplification...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{economic}} crisis has developed new challenges for public {{institutions in the}} EU member states. These institutions experience a notable economic pressure on their decisional process. The EU has been boosting the member states to reduce the ‘administrative burden’ of public institutions by promoting measures of institutional and legislative adaptation to the challenges set by the crisis, measures appropriate to the techniques of adaptive public management. The goal {{of this article is}} to analyze the <b>administrative</b> <b>simplification</b> processes undertaken as a result of the implementation of adaptive public management in the Romanian pubic administration. The targeted fields of reform analyzed relate to public investments, public expenditure, public procurement, the fiscal policy, the level of beaurocratisation, and the support for business development. Methods of research refer to the analysis of official documents regarding the ‘administrative burden’ and possible solutions for reducing it, as indicated by the EU or member states that succeeded in doing so, as well as the method of data analysis regarding the indicators of improvement of the targeted fields and the results of <b>administrative</b> <b>simplification.</b> The conclusions underline the level of implementation in the Romanian public administration of the action courses promoted by the EU in the direction of reducing the “administrative burden”...|$|R
