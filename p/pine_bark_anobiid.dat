In urban areas, plants are subjected to energy balance characteristics {{of a variety of}} surfaces. We investigated energy balance properties of six urban surfaces: asphalt, gravel rock mulch, lava rock mulch, concrete, <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> mulch, and turf. Each summer over a 3 -year period, incoming global shortwave radiation, surface temperature, surface reflectivity (albedo), soil temperature below each surface, and soil heat flux were measured for each surface, and total incoming radiation, thermal conductivity, and longwave radiation emitted by each surface were calculated. Differences in surface properties were analyzed by regression analysis. Albedo was greatest for concrete and least for lava rock mulch, while thermal conductivity was greatest for asphalt and least for lava rock and <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> mulches. Under maximum incoming total radiation, regression analysis indicated: soil heat flux was greatest under asphalt and concrete and least under lava rock and <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> mulches; soil temperature below each surface was greatest for asphalt and concrete and least for <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> mulch; surface temperature was greatest for <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> mulch and least for turf; and longwave radiation flux of each surface was greatest for <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> mulch and least for turf. This research revealed that more energy was conducted into the soil below asphalt and concrete, and that a greater portion of incoming radiation was prevented from entering the soil below <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> and lava rock mulches than below other surfaces. Due to these effects, and the lack of evaporative cooling, surface temperatures were greater, and more longwave radiation was emitted from non-vegetative surfaces than from turf.

Studies of <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> have shown that this is a material that may be used as an alternative to conventional filter materials, such as activated carbon. However, the study of <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> has shown that a leakage of phenolic compounds may occur when using the material for water purification. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to investigate the release of phenols from <b>pine</b> <b>bark,</b> in order to evaluate the use of <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> as a filter material. Another assignment is to investigate the amount of metals adsorbed by the filter material. The studies were carried out through three leaching experiments. As leachates, double deionised water and storm water were used. The phenol concentration in the leachate was determined for both double deionised water and storm water. The degree of metal sorption was measured only for the storm water. The measured phenol concentration in the double deionised water was 4. 40 mg/L and in the storm water 4. 81 mg/L. These concentrations exceed the Canadian guideline value, of 4. 0 μg/L, more than a 1000 times. No metal sorption occurred as the metal content of the storm water was too low. Instead a release of metals from the <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> into the eluate of the storm water occurred. The leaching attempts also resulted in a decline of the pH-values of the two different waters. The pH-values for the double deionised water and the storm water decreased from 7. 0 to 4. 3 and from 6. 0 to 4. 2 respectively. A release of phenols was ascertained with a significant difference in concentrations between double deionised water and storm water. Therefore it is not advisable to use <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> filters for purification of water with low concentrations of metals, as the filter material may release metals into the water under such conditions.

40|$|In {{the process}} of demilitarization of explosives, army {{ammunition}} plants generate a waste stream known as pink water. The principal component of the wastewater is the nitro-aromatic compound 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT). Although the persistence of TNT when dissolved in surface water is very limited due to its susceptibility to photo- and biotransformation, discharge of pink water to the environment has been prohibited in Sweden, the U. S. and many other countries for decades because of the toxicity of the compound and its metabolites to various ecological receptors. The most frequently used method for treatment of pink water in Sweden today is adsorption on activated carbon, which {{as well as being}} costly, creates a sludge that must be incinerated off site. In many countries, the timber industry residue <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> is discarded and has no high value application. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the potential of <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> for the removal of TNT from contaminated water such as pink water. Several batch studies and a column experiment were conducted. Acetonitrile extraction of <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> and 16 S rRNA sequencing for analysis of the indigenous bacterial community of <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> were used to investigate its performance in the treatment of pink water. The results show that <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> has great potential as an adsorbent medium for TNT from contaminated pink water. Simultaneous use of biotransformation and adsorption methods was shown to be an improvement over adsorption alone for the removal of TNT from contaminated water bodies. <b>Pine</b> <b>bark</b> showed higher affinity towards the amino metabolites of TNT than for TNT itself.

The microbio-logical populations of total aerobic bacteria, total fungi, actinomycetes, nitrifying bacteria, cellulolitic bac-teria and fungi were also evaluated. At {{the end of the process}} physico- chemical characterisation of com-posts was also performed. Results showed that in general the highest microbiological populations as well as for enzymatic activities occurred during the thermophilic phase (> 40 ºC) of process. According to the physico-chemical characteristics of composts <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> seems to be the one that can be used more success-fully in the formulation of substrates to produce plants in containers...|$|R

50|$|An extract of {{maritime}} <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> called Pycnogenol bears 65-75 percent proanthocyanidins (procyanidins). Thus a 100 mg serving {{would contain}} 65 to 75 mg of proanthocyanidins (procyanidins).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to ascertain changes in the total contents, as well as water-soluble forms of iron, manganese, zinc and copper {{during the process of}} composting of <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> with plant material (PM), with or without the addition of effective microorganisms (EM). Experiments were carried out at a forest nursery area and comprised the following treatments: pile 1. <b>pine</b> <b>bark,</b> pile 2. <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> + PM, pile 3. <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> + PM + EM. Compost piles were formed from <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> (4 m 3) and as described above, 2 Mg of plant material were added to pile 2 and to pile 3 – plant material and effective microorganisms in the amount of 3 dm 3 ·m- 3 bark. All compost files were also supplemented with 0. 3 kg P 2 O 5 ·m- 3 (in the form of superphosphate 20 % P 2 O 5) and 0, 1 kg K 2 O·m- 3 (in the form of potassium salt 60 %). The plant material comprised a mixture of buckwheat, field pea, serradella and vetch harvested before flowering. Piles were mixed and formed with the tractor aerator. At defined dates, using the method of atomic spectrophotometry, total contents of iron, manganese, zinc and copper, as well as their water-soluble forms were determined. It was found that all the examined elements underwent changes, albeit with different dynamics. This was particularly apparent in the case of water-soluble forms. This solubility was, in general, high during the initial days of the process and declined with the passage of time. No significant impact of effective microorganisms on the solubility of the examined chemical elements was determined, especially in mature composts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} the laboratory research {{results on the}} interaction of smoldering <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> particles with <b>pine</b> wood. Fire retardant treatment "FUKAM" was studied to estimate {{its effect on the}} probability of wood ignition. The wind speed and the number and geometric sizes of particles were varied in the experiments. The results have shown that the increase in the wind speed leads to the increase in the probability of wood ignition by the particles of the same size, and fire-retardant treatment significantly increases the protective properties of wood exposed to smoldering <b>pine</b> <b>bark</b> particles...|$|R
40|$|Sugars were {{intended}} to be extracted from coniferous barks and used for growth of yeasts. As water extracts usually contain both sugars and tannin, 30 yeasts were investigated on growing in medium cotaining phenols (tannin). It was shown that 4 yeasts aerobically and 11 yeasts anaerobically grew well in the media containing sugi bark extracts, respectively. Several conditions were examined to dissolve more fermentative sugars from sugi and <b>pines</b> <b>barks.</b> The best ones were found for the extraction from sugi inner and outer, and <b>pines</b> <b>barks,</b> separately. 針葉樹々皮抽出物に含まれる糖を酵母の生育に使うのを意図した。水抽出物は糖のほかに常にタンニンを含み，そのため酵母は生育を阻害される。そこで先ずタンニンに耐性のある株を 30 株について追究し，好気條件で 4 株が，嫌気條件で 11 株が良好な生育をスギ抽出物培地で行うのを究明した。温水抽出より多くの 酵可能な糖をうる抽出方法について数種を検討し，スギ内，外皮，マツ樹皮夫々に適したものを見出した...|$|R
