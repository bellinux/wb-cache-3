40|$|Widespread {{defoliation}} {{of forests}} caused by insects or fungi cause economic losses throughout the world. Successful outbreak management involves cost/benefit estimation and requires knowledge of potential yield losses. Currently, such knowledge is scarce. This thesis evaluates {{the significance of}} single-year defoliation by the <b>pine</b> <b>looper</b> moth (Bupalus piniaria L.) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) and secondary attack by the pine shoot beetle (Tomicus piniperda L.) (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) for yield losses in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). In a seven-year study, tree mortality and growth losses were quantified after a B. piniaria outbreak with a subsequent T. piniperda infestation at Hökensås in 1996. Secondary attack by T. piniperda was also studied in a Scots pine stand at Fredriksberg, infested by Gremmeniella abietina (Lagerberg) Morelet. in 2001. Tree mortality at Hökensås mainly occurred in areas with an average defoliation intensity of 90 - 100 %. Tree mortality averaged 25 %, and the “defoliation threshold” for tree survival {{was found to be}} 90 % defoliation. Tree mortality peaked two years after the defoliation event, which coincided with high levels of pine shoot beetles. Involvement of T. piniperda in tree mortality increased with time since defoliation, and tree susceptibility to beetle attack increased with increasing defoliation intensity and decreasing dominance status of trees. As foliage of trees recovered, fewer trees were susceptible to beetle attack, and ultimately, beetle attacks ended as breeding substrate was depleted. Tree susceptibility to beetle attack was a function of tree vigour and beetle density. Growth losses at the Hökensås site were a combined effect of <b>pine</b> <b>looper</b> defoliation and shoot pruning by T. piniperda. Radial, height and volume growth losses were proportional to defoliation intensity. Whereas radial growth was little affected by beetle-induced shoot pruning, height growth was severely affected by beetle-induced damage to leading shoots. Growth losses alone, excluding tree mortality, were large enough to economically justify control of the <b>pine</b> <b>looper</b> outbreak had the outbreak been prevented in 1996. At Fredriksberg, T. piniperda colonised trees that would have survived the damage caused by G. abietina. However, trees with 90 - 100 % foliage losses died because of the damage caused by G. abietina alone, and tree survival seemed to require that trees retained at least 20 % of full foliage...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{proposed}} particle MCMC methods {{provide a}} flexible way of performing Bayesian inference for parameters in (nonlinear) state space models. Each iteration of the scheme re-quires {{an estimate of}} marginal likelihood calculated from the output of a sequential Monte Carlo scheme (also known as a particle filter). Consequently, the method can be extremely computationally intensive. We therefore aim to negate the expensive likelihood calculation through use of a fast approximation, or ‘emulator’. We propose a simple adaptive emulation procedure and find that it performs well in several scenarios. We illustrate the method by considering two applications, namely, inference for parameters governing a nonlinear multi-variate diffusion process and inference for a nonlinear state space model of pupal densities of the <b>pine</b> <b>looper</b> moth (Bupalis pineria) ...|$|E
40|$|In current publication, a non­traditional {{approach}} to estimation of parameters of ecological models is considered. Within {{the framework of}} this approach {{it is not necessary}} to construct loss­function or likelihood function. The basic idea of method is as follows: first of all, basic requirements to model and to deviate between theoretical (model) and empirical datasets must be formulated. After that, respective statistical criteria must be selected, and with the help of these statistical criteria, a feasible set in space of model parameters must be determined (where all statistical criterions demonstrate required results). Within the limits of this feasible set must be found elements with strongest properties. These elements can be used as estimations of model parameters. Constructions of feasible sets for Moran – Ricker model with and without time lag and ELP­model were demonstrated on examples of larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) and <b>pine</b> <b>looper</b> moth (Bupalus piniarius L.) time series. Results of approximation are discussed. For a time series of population dynamics of larch budworm it was found that feasible sets are not empty for the model Moran – Ricker without delay and with delay of one year. At the same time, the analysis of properties of elements of admissible sets showed that among them there are no properties that match the prevailing biological understanding of the dynamics of the Zeiraphera diniana Gn. The resulting estimation allowed taking into account the delay of one year to receive treatment with a cycle length of 18 with two maxima. However, almost all statistical tests gave negative results. These results indicate that the delay in the self­regulation mechanisms of action of more than one year.

Within the framework of every used model the influence of self-regulative mechanisms onto population size changing in time were took into account (and every used model had minimum number of unknown parameters). Estimations of model parameters were obtained at minimization of squared differences between theoretical (model) trajectories and empirical datasets (global fitting) for first ten values. Tails of samples (four or five points) were used for checking prognostic properties of models. Sets of deviations between theoretical and empirical trajectories were checked on Normality with zero average (Kolmogorov - Smirnov and Shapiro - Wilk tests), and were tested on absence/existence of serial correlation (Durbin - Watson criteria). Provided analysis showed that modified logistic model can only give sufficient approximation of empirical datasets.

40|$|The {{forest insect}} pest Bupalus piniarius (<b>pine</b> <b>looper</b> moth) {{is a classic}} example of a natural {{population}} cycle. As is typical for Populations that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles; but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence: (1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation); (2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids), and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each model to three long-term Population time series in Britain that exhibit some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field. In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations. Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location), the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidenc...|$|E
