40|$|Background: The caspase-associated {{recruitment}} domain-containing protein (CARP) {{is expressed}} in almost all tissues. Recently, the tumor-suppressive function <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> was discovered and attracted increasing attention. This study aimed to investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> in the carcinogenesis of human gastric carcinoma. Methodology/Principal Findings: Compared with normal gastric tissue, the downregulation <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> expression was observed in gastric carcinoma tissue by cDNA array and tissue microarray assay. In vitro, the gastric carcinoma cell line (BGC- 823) was stably transfected with pcDNA 3. 1 B-CARP or plus CARP siRNA, and we used MTT, flow cytometry, cell migration on type I collagen, cell-matrix adhesion assay and western blot analysis to investigate the potential anti-tumor effects <b>of</b> <b>CARP.</b> The data showed that overexpressing CARP suppressed the malignancy of gastric carcinoma BGC- 823 cell line, including significant increases in apoptosis, as well as obvious decreases in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion ability, and tumor growth. The tumor-suppressive effects <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> were almost restored by siRNA-directed CARP silence. In addition, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> induced G 1 arrest, decreased the expressions of cyclin E and CDK 2, and increased the expressions of p 27, p 53 and p 21. In vivo, the tumor-suppressive effect <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> was also verified.

40|$|Background and Aims: Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) occur abundantly {{in nature}} and are found in many organisms which {{participate}} in many biologically important processes. Among the -CA gene family, there are three homologues that have no catalytic CA activity {{due to lack of}} functionally important histidine residues and are named as carbonic anhydrase related proteins (CARPs). In the present study I analyzed and evaluated the distribution <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> genes in different taxonomic classes using bioinformatic methods and studied the expression profile <b>of</b> <b>CARPs</b> and their mRNAs using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR in different tissues of mice. Results: I analyzed 84 sequences for the study, of which 21 sequences were novel and previously unannotated. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> VIII and CARP X genes was seemingly universal in the vertebrates and invertebrates whereas, CARP XI was found only in mammals and frog. Many fish species showed independent duplication <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> X. Immunohistochemistry showed very strong expression <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> VIII in the cerebellum, cerebrum, and moderate expression in the lung, liver, salivary gland and stomach, and low expression in the colon and kidney, whereas CARP X was expressed in the lung and a weak expression was observed in the kidney and low levels <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> XI expression was seen in the cerebellum stomach, kidney, cerebrum, liver and small intestine and weak staining was seen in the colon. RT-q PCR analysis confirms the results of immunohistochemical staining, showing wide distribution of Car 8 and Car 11 mRNAs in different tissues analyzed in the study, whereas the expression of Car 10 mRNA was restricted to the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, cerebellum, midbrain and eye. Conclusions: CARPs are widely distributed with a very high sequence similarity among the organisms analyzed in the study. Molecular analysis <b>of</b> <b>CARPs</b> and Car mRNAs suggests a very important {{role in the development of}} cerebellar cortex and motor coordination function in the cerebellum and important physiological role in other tissues.

We report that doxorubicin treatment in cardiomyocytes resulted in inhibition <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> transcription, depletion <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> protein levels, inhibition of myofilament gene transcription, and marked sarcomere disarray. Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>CARP</b> with small interfering RNA (siRNA) similarly inhibited myofilament gene transcription and disrupted cardiomyocyte sarcomere structure.

40|$|Asian carp is notorious {{as one of}} {{the most}} severe aquatic {{invasive}} species (AIS) threats to the waters of the Mississippi River Region. The devastating effect <b>of</b> Asian <b>carp</b> calls for desperate measures to decrease the spread <b>of</b> Asian <b>carp</b> and prevent possible invasion into the Great Lake. This work presents an agent-based mathematical model to simulate the aggregation <b>of</b> Asian <b>carp</b> which would provide valuable help in fish removal or control. The referred mathematical model is derived from the following assumptions: (1) the aggregation results from a completely random and spontaneous physical behavior <b>of</b> numerous independent <b>carp</b> rather than consensus among every carp involved in the aggregation; (2) carp aggregation is a collective effect of inter-carp and carp-environment interaction; (3) aggregation happens when two carp or two schools <b>of</b> <b>carp</b> approach each other within a perceptible distance. As a variant of the molecular dynamics method, the proposed mathematical model is based on an empirical inter-carp force field which is featured with repulsion, parallel orientation and attraction zone. Besides, due to the physical limitation <b>of</b> <b>carp,</b> we also considered out-of-perception zone and a blind zone. By employing an inter-carp force field, the aggregation behavior <b>of</b> <b>carp</b> is investigated.
