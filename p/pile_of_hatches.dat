50|$|Limonada is a Lemon variant {{that uses}} similar game play, yet with Uno cards.The setup for Limonada differs because an Uno deck {{contains}} 108 cards. <b>Piles</b> <b>of</b> four cards are distributed to each player such that each has {{an equal number}} <b>of</b> <b>piles.</b> The remaining cards are placed face up in the middle.

50|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the 75 tiles are divided into three <b>piles,</b> one each <b>of</b> 30, 25, and 20 tiles—players {{initially}} draw from the <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> 30, and then the <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> 25 and 20, the latter two of which the city walls are introduced. There are also 12 towers, which are split equally among the players.|$|R
5000|$|Consider two players: Alice and Bob. Alice moves first. At {{the start}} of the game, Alice has two <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> coins in front <b>of</b> her: one <b>pile</b> {{contains}} 4 coins and the other pile contains 1 coin. Each player has two moves available: either [...] "take" [...] the larger <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> coins and give the smaller pile to the other player or [...] "push" [...] both piles across the table to the other player. Each time the <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> coins pass across the table, the quantity of coins in each pile doubles. For example, assume that Alice chooses to [...] "push" [...] the piles on her first move, handing the <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> 1 and 4 coins over to Bob, doubling them to 2 and 8. Bob could now use his first move to either [...] "take" [...] the <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> 8 coins and give 2 coins to Alice, or he can [...] "push" [...] the two piles back across the table again to Alice, again increasing the size <b>of</b> the <b>piles</b> to 4 and 16 coins. The game continues for a fixed number of rounds or until a player decides to end the game by pocketing a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> coins.|$|R
