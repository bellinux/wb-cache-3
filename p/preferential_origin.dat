40|$|This study surveys <b>preferential</b> {{rules of}} <b>origin</b> applied by 192 {{regional}} trade agreements (RTAs) covering {{trade in goods}} notified to the GATT/WTO up to 1 November 2010. It {{takes into account the}} <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> that were notified to the WTO; whenever known and available, modifications to the original rules of origin have been updated. This study contains two basic features: a description of some key elements of <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> in RTAs, followed by an attempt to provide a reality-check of how these rules affect actual trade. That is done by an ex-post examination of data on the use of RTAs' preferences and, in their absence, of their margins of preference (MOPs). While the raison d' of <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> is the avoidance of trade deflection, the practice in RTAs has diluted this objective and it would seem that <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> are increasingly becoming an economic, political and trade instrument. In its descriptive part, the study identifies {{what seems to be a}} tendency to design stricter rules of origin, while detecting concomitantly the inclusion in modern <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> of flexibilities that provide, through the rules of origin themselves, a preference beyond the lower tariff rate resulting from the preferential treatment and mechanisms that allow the integration of third-parties into <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> regimes. The reality-check part of the study points to the fact that much beyond the coverage of RTAs, it is their effective implementation that poses a challenge to economic operators. Though data on the use of preferences is either not disclosed or inexistent, they are nevertheless available for some economies. On the basis of existing data of preference utilization, the analysis of the effects of rules of <b>origin</b> on <b>preferential</b> trade flows appears to give rise to a dual reality - namely a relatively high use of preferences in certain instances coexisting with preferences failing to attain their potential in other cases. As regards RTAs for which utilization rate is not available, the paper analysis <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> from a MOPS perspective, assuming that MOPs of at least 5 percentage points would offset compliance costs and thus provide a stimulus to comply with rules of origin in order to benefit from preferences. The analysis, made for 68 out of 192 RTAs, do not allow any conclusion regarding that generally presented hypothesis. Finally, the paper briefly outlines some suggestions for further action, including the launching in the WTO of exploratory work on <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> within an open regionalism scenario...|$|R

40|$|The {{customs tariff}} for import {{is the main}} {{instrument}} for regulating the external commercial trade, {{according to the national}} economic benefits of the states. This practice in the international trade was ruled in Art. XI of the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which also establishes that the contract parties in this agreement will not set up and support other restrictions for import exept the customs tariffs. Consequently, the customs fees for import are determined based on the customs tariff for import. The common customs tariff in the EU implies, besides applying the customs fees, a preference for third countries, on which the EU agrees. The wrong determining of the origin of products can affect the state budget, the local budget or even the fiscal features and the budget of the company. As the determining of the origin raises important problems in the practice of the customs authorities, in order to diminish the fiscal-budgetary impact, we would like to suggest to people who are interested in this a model, a possible unitary procedure for interpreting the complex provisions of the rules concerning the origin of products. preferences; non-preference origin; mandatory information regarding the origin; <b>preferential</b> <b>origin...</b>|$|E

By the {{equilibrium}} {{phases of the}} steels with temperature, the causation of being carbide network of CrWMn steel frequently in the manufacture was analyzed, and an alloy design for avoiding carbide network of CrWMn steel was researched.

40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) provide countries with many benefits. The {{multilateral trading system}} also receives these benefits, as successive and overlapping RTAs are the building blocks for the most viable and realistic path to global free trade. Nonetheless, the spread of criss-crossing RTAs {{in the world has}} generated serious problems, including rising transaction costs. While pursuing the long-term goal of harmonizing preferential rules of origin (ROOs), countries need to actively implement the diagonal or full accumulation system on a sectoral basis, starting from the sectors in which identical product-specific rules among participating countries have been introduced. The adoption of coequality in the change in tariff classification and regional value content (VC) rules also give trading firms more flexibility. If WTO members are able to set up model ROOs, the degree of each RTA's deviation from this benchmark may be calculated and certain modalities for its reduction could be negotiated multilaterally. In the longer term, other systemic rules on top of ROOs need to be converged or harmonized across RTAs on a regional or global basis. The effort to defragment fragmented RTAs should continue even beyond the time when most favoured nation (MFN) tariff rates go down to zero worldwide. Even if all <b>preferential</b> <b>origin</b> regimes shall have become irrelevant by then, various other rules and procedures will still have to be converged and harmonized across RTAs.

40|$|Excitatory {{effects of}} {{adenosine}} and ATP on carotid body (CB) chemoreception have been previously described. Our {{hypothesis is that}} both ATP and adenosine are the key neurotransmitters responsible for the hypoxic chemotransmission in the CB sensory synapse, their relative contribution depending on the intensity of hypoxic challenge. To test this hypothesis we measured carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity in response to moderate and intense hypoxic stimuli (7 and 0 % O(2)) in the absence and {{in the presence of}} adenosine and ATP receptor antagonists. Additionally, we quantified the release of adenosine and ATP in normoxia (21 % O(2)) and in response to hypoxias of different intensities (10, 5, and 2 % O(2)) to study the release pathways. We found that ZM 241385, an A(2) antagonist, decreased the CSN discharges evoked by 0 and 7 % O(2) by 30. 8 and 72. 5 %, respectively. Suramin, a P(2) X antagonist, decreased the CSN discharges evoked by 0 and 7 % O(2) by 64. 3 and 17. 1 %, respectively. Simultaneous application of both antagonists strongly inhibited CSN discharges elicited by both hypoxic intensities. ATP release by CB increased in parallel to hypoxia intensity while adenosine release increased preferably in response to mild hypoxia. We have also found that the lower the O(2) levels are, the higher is the percentage of adenosine produced from extracellular catabolism of ATP. Our results demonstrate that ATP and adenosine are key neurotransmitters involved in hypoxic CB chemotransduction, with a more relevant contribution of adenosine during mild hypoxia, while vesicular ATP release constitutes the <b>preferential</b> <b>origin</b> of extracellular adenosine in high-intensity hypoxia.

Volume 2 : AnnexesDefence date: 4 June 2013 The {{analysis}} of rationales for <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> {{presented in the}} thesis brings forward the assumptions that, contrary {{to what has been}} written in the literature, it still seems legitimate to maintain <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> as distinct from non-preferential rules of origin. However, multiplication of rules of origin regimes causes systemic problems and fairness concerns. The thesis aims therefore at analysing diversification and harmonisation patterns and their interaction with the systemic problems identified. The final objective of the thesis is to analyse the possible methods for regulating rules of origin in light of these systemic issues. The thesis employs an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand rationales for and systemic problems derived from <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin.</b> The methodology, adopted to understand patterns of diversification and harmonisation, combines instead comparative analysis and case study approach with the {{analysis of}} WCO and WTO law. While it is impossible to find a solution that could solve all the systemic problems (beside the complete abolition of the rules), this thesis argues that the first objective of the WTO should be to achieve a greater level of correspondence between rules of origin and MFN concessions and address fairness concerns. This should allow the enforcement of rules of origin in line with article XXIV GATT, while recognising the particular role of <b>preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> in guaranteeing that the partner only benefits from the preferential liberalisation. Contrary to the current literature, the thesis hints that this can be addressed effectively without resorting to international substantial harmonisation and without leaving regulation simply to partial regional harmonisation processes, which are respectively either politically difficult to achieve or ineffective means for properly addressing systemic issues related to rules of origin...|$|R

We report that treatment of male mice with melphalan (MLP), a bifunctional alkylating agent widely used in chemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during male mouse meiosis that persist unrepaired as germ cells progress through DNA repair-competent phases of spermatogenic development.

The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain whether South Africa’s rules of origin are sufficiently aligned with those of more developed economies to improve the economy, thereby increasing trade growth and tax revenue. This study compared the South African rules of origin with rules of origin that are applied in another developing country, namely Brazil, as well as to those applied in two developed countries, namely the United Kingdom and the United States. To illustrate the application of the rules of origin, this study focused specifically on rules of origin applicable to individual quick frozen poultry. This comparative study identified similarities and differences between the countries, and noted possible improvements to South African customs and excise tax legislation for this industry. It was found that the rules of origin applied in South Africa are similar in some respects to those used in the UK. An improvement that South Africa could make is to minimise the number of rules in effect by negotiating better preferential rates of duty across more than one country. South Africa could also ensure that it can comply with all obligatory conditions of trade agreements entered into to avoid under-utilisation of the benefits of a trade agreement. By adopting or adapting some of the advantages of the rules of origin in the countries chosen for comparison, South Africa can grow its international trade and generate increased tax revenue to support the government’s revenue income demand.

The empirical analysis of the effectiveness of preferentialism on intra-regional trade flows focuses on the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), with the aim of providing a rough estimate of the costs of requesting preferences. The results suggest that preferential tariffs favorably affect intra-regional imports only at very high margins (around 25 percentage points).
