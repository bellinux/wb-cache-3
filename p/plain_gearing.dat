50|$|In {{industrial}} applications, {{owing to}} its low friction, PTFE {{is used for}} <b>plain</b> bearings, <b>gears,</b> slide plates, and more applications with sliding action of parts, where it outperforms acetal and nylon. Its extremely high bulk resistivity makes it an ideal material for fabricating long-life electrets, the electrostatic analogues of magnets.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{fatigue tests}} were {{conducted}} on two groups of AISI 9310 spur gears. Both groups were manufactured with standard ground tooth surfaces, with the second group subjected to an additional shot peening process on the gear tooth flanks. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm (3. 5 in.). Test conditions were a gear temperature of 350 K (170 F), a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 billion N/sq m (248, 000 psi), and a speed of 10, 000 rpm. The shot peened gears exhibited pitting fatigue lives 1. 6 times the life of standard gears without shot peening. Residual stress measurements and analysis indicate that the longer fatigue life {{is the result of}} the higher compressive stress produced by the shot peening. The life for the shot peened gear was calculated to be 1. 5 times that for the <b>plain</b> <b>gear</b> by using the measured residual stress difference for the standard and shot peened gears. The measured residual stress for the shot peened gears was much higher than that for the standard gears...|$|R
40|$|Gear {{surface fatigue}} {{endurance}} {{tests were conducted}} on two groups of 10 gears each of carburized and hardened AISI 9310 spur gears manufactured from the same heat of material. Both groups were manufactured with standard ground tooth surfaces. The second group was subjected to an additional shot-peening process on the gear tooth surfaces and root radius to produce a residual surface compressive stress. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm (3. 5 in.). Test conditions were a gear temperature of 350 K (170 " F), a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 x 109 N/m 2 (248 000 psi), and a speed of 10 000 rpm.

25|$|The drive {{within the}} casing is {{provided}} by a train of spur gears. Accessories are arranged {{on both sides of}} the driveshaft entry, in reducing order of their speed. The <b>gears</b> are usually <b>plain</b> spur <b>gears,</b> running in roller bearings. Idler gears are commonly used between them, to increase the spacing between accessories. Helical gears are sometimes used for the high-torque drives, typically the starter, as these give smoother running. However helical gears also generate an end-thrust, which then requires a more complicated thrust bearing to support them.|$|R
25|$|Nylons {{still remain}} {{important}} plastics, {{and not just}} for use in fabrics. In its bulk form it is very wear resistant, particularly if oil-impregnated, and so is used to build <b>gears,</b> <b>plain</b> bearings, valve seats, seals and because of good heat-resistance, increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars, and other mechanical parts.|$|R
5000|$|A gearbox {{designed}} using a worm and worm-wheel {{is considerably}} smaller than one made from <b>plain</b> spur <b>gears,</b> and has its drive axes at 90° to each other.With a single start worm, for each 360° {{turn of the}} worm, the worm-gear advances only one tooth of the gear. Therefore, regardless of the worm's size (sensible engineering limits notwithstanding), the gear ratio is the [...] "size of the worm gear - to - 1".Given a single start worm, a 20 tooth worm gear reduces the speed by the ratio of 20:1. With spur gears, a gear of 12 teeth must match with a 240 tooth gear {{to achieve the same}} 20:1 ratio. Therefore, if the diametrical pitch (DP) of each gear is the same, then, in terms of the physical size of the 240 tooth gear to that of the 20 tooth gear, the worm arrangement is considerably smaller in volume.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the most}} lucid and {{detailed}} examination of {{the political economy of}} the Southern Plains. At the center of that economy roamed the buffalo; but once Europeans arrived, horses, cattle, firearms, captives, and manufactured goods helped power it. Bonds of kinship and reciprocity drew all peoples in and around the Southern Plains into it, including Pueblos and Spaniards in New Mexico; Spaniards and Mexicans in Texas; Jumanos, Apaches, Wichitas, and Comanches on the Plains; and Caddos and the French in Louisiana. Still, the Plains could be a hard environment, with long droughts and epidemics of European diseases, both of which decimated populations. For any single people to meet these challenges and dominate the economy would require it to change its society, its culture, and itself as well. Between 1580 and 1830, several peoples rose up to command the economy only to falter or be pushed aside. The Jumanos, an agricultural people of South Texas, controlled it initially but were absorbed by the Apaches, who first learned to use the horse to their advantage. The Nortefios (Wichitas and Caddos) drove the Apaches from the Plains. On their heels came the Comanches, who developed a high mobility and other societal changes, allowing them to dominate until 1830. And therein lay the paradox: to control the Southern Plains 2 ̆ 7 s political economy meant being altered by it. Horses, guns, and manufactured goods- 2 ̆ 2 status goods 2 ̆ 2 -not only changed peoples 2 ̆ 7 physical culture, but brought about an increasingly stratified social structure. Seniors controlled 2 ̆ 2 status goods 2 ̆ 2 and only sparingly doled them out to juniors. Some Comanches possessed hundreds of horses, others none. The need for forage brought smaller bands. Men took more wives to tan more hides to acquire more status goods. The people themselves also changed through what Anderson terms 2 ̆ 2 ethnogenesis. 2 ̆ 2 Control required a large population, and to achieve this and replenish those killed by disease and drought Southern Plains peoples, particularly the Comanches, captured then assimilated a variety of other peoples. This political economy unraveled about 1830 as Americans and removed Indians entered the <b>Plains.</b> These people, <b>geared</b> toward agricultural capitalism, were unwilling to make kinship or uphold reciprocal obligations. Once again, Southern Plains Indians would have to remake themselves. Anderson has done strong, innovative work here, employing previously unused primary sources from France, Spain, and Mexico to bring new insights to the Indian Southern Plains. His volume sets the bar for future Plains histories...|$|R
