5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected <b>pitches.</b> <b>In</b> these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Freidig was {{established}} in 1918 as a local team for Briskebyen {{in what was then}} the municipality of Vang. At the time there was a severe lack of <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> Hamar, so the club was forced to sneak into unused venues and play until they were chased by the groundskeeper. The club was accepted {{as a member of the}} Football Association of Norway (NFF) in 1927, changing its name to Briskebyen FL. This forced it to formalize its pitch renting so it would have a single home venue for each season. In 1928 and 1929, it played at Vangsbanen, from 1930 through 1933 at Ottestad bane, and from 1934 at Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|Maddux {{made the}} most putouts in a season (39) three times in his career (1990, 1991, and 1993). The American League leader is Frank Lary, who made 32 putouts for the Detroit Tigers in 1961. Kaat is the leader in assists; he made 72 with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. The National League leader, Maddux, trails him by one (71 assists in 1996). Many {{pitchers}} have posted errorless seasons and 1.000 fielding percentages in their winning seasons; Mussina is the leader with four perfect seasons in the field. Guidry (19821984) and Mussina (19961998) both accomplished the feat in three consecutive seasons. The most double plays turned by a winning pitcher is nine, accomplished by Maddux in 2006. Four pitchers have also thrown no wild <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> a winning season: Maddux (1997, 2006), Kaat (1975), Shantz (1961, 1962), and Rogers (2005). In contrast, the most wild <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> a winning season is 18, by the knuckleballing Niekro. The fewest balks in a winning season is zero, achieved many times, but Maddux accomplished the feat the most time in his wins (12 balk-free seasons in 18 years). The most balks in a winning season is five, by Mike Norris in 1981 and Orel Hershiser in 1988. Langston picked off the most runners from the pitcher's mound in a winning season, with 10 in 1993; four pitchers are tied for the National League lead with 5 pickoffs. Rogers posted both the highest (100% in 2002) and lowest (0% in 2005) caught stealing percentage in a winning season. Shantz' 1961 season tied Rogers' 0% mark for lowest percentage caught, and three pitchers are tied for the National League lead (67% caught).|$|E

5|$|This {{would have}} also {{marked the first}} perfect game in the Tigers' 110-year history. The 83 pitches thrown before the blown call {{would have been the}} fewest <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> a perfect game since 1908. Galarraga's near-perfect game was the first such game since Mike Mussina's bid for a perfect game on September 2, 2001, which was broken up by 27th batter Carl Everett. It was also the third time for a Tigers pitcher to come so close to a perfect game, as Milt Wilcox also missed getting the 27th {{straight}} batter out on April 15, 1983, and Tommy Bridges missed the 27th batter on August 5, 1932.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Chance endured {{surgeries}} {{to correct}} blood clots {{in his brain}} that were caused by being hit by <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> his head. Meanwhile, Chance argued with Murphy, who had been releasing expensive players from the Cubs {{in an effort to}} save the team money. The New York Yankees negotiated for Chance's release from the Cubs after the 1912 season. The Cubs released Chance while he was hospitalized, and in January 1913, Chance signed a three-year contract with the Yankees, worth $120,000 ($ in current dollar terms), to serve as the Yankees' manager. He also played first base for the Yankees and served as field captain, though he played in no more than 12 games in a season. The Yankees sat in last place on the next-to-last day of the 1913 season, but won their final game to finish in seventh place. In 1914, Chance named Roger Peckinpaugh the Yankees' new captain.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes's most {{successful}} seasons {{in terms of}} wickets were the three seasons from 1900 to 1902. In these years, Rhodes took 725 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.07, taking five or more wickets in an innings 68 times and taking ten or more wickets in a match 21 times, assisting Yorkshire to three consecutive County Championships. In 1900, Rhodes took 261 wickets as bad weather made pitches helpful to his bowling. In 1901, the weather was much better, leading to pitches that were good for batting, but Rhodes took 251 wickets, an achievement described by Wisden as astonishing. Against MCC that year, Rhodes scored his maiden first-class century, batting at number nine. In the 1902 season, Rhodes took 213 wickets, fewer than 1901 despite a greater number of favourable <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> a wet summer. This attracted unfavourable comment from some critics who had expected more.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{made his}} next start, after five days rest, against the Cincinnati Reds, {{who would later}} finish the NL West season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to Pete Rose {{in the first inning}} and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five batters but walked six. Richard {{struggled}} in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place Atlanta Braves, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two wild <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four batters.|$|E
5|$|Following the Invincibles tour, Lindwall {{found the}} <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> South Africa in 1949–50 less to his liking and was dropped {{for the final}} Test. He {{returned}} in the following season against England, regularly taking wickets in another series win. The following year, he played a major part in stopping the much vaunted West Indian batsmen, but he was criticised for his prolific use of short-pitched bowling. In 1952, Lindwall played in the Lancashire League in England, where he developed his inswinger. He returned to 1953 with an aging national team in decline and despite {{the loss of the}} Ashes, commentators felt that Lindwall was at his zenith in terms of his bowling craft. Upon returning to Australia, Lindwall moved north to Queensland due to work commitments and then suffered a season of injury and illness in 1954–55 which saw him perform poorly as England retained the Ashes easily. After a strong performance in the Caribbean, Lindwall missed half of the 1956 English tour with injury and was otherwise ineffective as Australia lost its third consecutive Ashes series. During the return trip to Australia, Lindwall captained Australia for the only time in a Test match against India in Mumbai, after injuries forced out regular captain Ian Johnson. Following the repeated defeats to England, the Australian selectors instituted generational change and gambled on a radical youth policy which saw Lindwall dropped for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa. Lindwall forced his way back into the Test team at 37 years of age in the following season, breaking Clarrie Grimmett's Australian Test record of 216 wickets. He retired from Test cricket after the tour of the Indian subcontinent in the following season, with a total of 228 Test wickets. In retirement, Lindwall mentored Test world-record holder Dennis Lillee and also served as a national selector.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} {{game of the}} 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for {{throwing}} six wild <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished {{the game with a}} 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory. He won his first four decisions that season but those victories were followed by four losses. He continued to accumulate strikeouts and finally began to walk fewer batters on average, exhibiting greater control over his pitching. Richard evened out his record at seven wins and seven losses by pitching a complete game three-hit shutout against the Padres on June 30. By the All-Star break, Richard had 7wins, 10losses, a 3.52 earned run average and 158strikeouts in just a bit over 157innings of work. By July 25, his record stood at eight wins and 11 losses, but after he pitched nine straight complete games (including two-hit and three-hit shutouts on August 27 and September 6, respectively) through September 6 and worked 86 consecutive innings without the need of a relief pitcher, which set an Astros club record, {{it was clear that he}} was on a winning streak. On September 21, in a game against the Reds, he pitched 11innings and matched a career high of 15strikeouts, which he also reached earlier in the season on August 3 in a game against the Braves. He closed out the season against the Dodgers by winning his 11th straight game against the team, with his last loss coming on June 23, 1976. He was honored as the National League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 4–1 with a 1.24ERA, four complete games, two shutouts and 69strikeouts in 53innings pitched during the stretch.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pitches</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan have {{historically}} supported spin bowling rather than seam or swing. However, {{the conditions in}} most grounds of Pakistan, like Rawalpindi, Lahore and Peshwar have also seen support for the reverse swing capabilities of the local bowlers in past times like Imran Khan, Sarfraz Nawaz , Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. The dry and windy conditions usually lend good support to the faster bowlers as well. Such pitches had virtually no grass, afforded little assistance for pace, bounce, or lateral air movement, but created good turn. In decades past, legendary offspinners such as Saqlain Mushtaq credited for the doosra, and legspinners such as Abdul Qadir and Mushtaq Ahmed, routinely toyed with visiting teams to plot dramatic victories for Pakistan in home test matches, particularly on turning <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> hot, humid conditions at Arbab Niaz Stadium and Gaddafi Stadium. <b>Pitches</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan are flat and considered batting paradises for batsmen in winter; they suit spinners in summers.|$|E
