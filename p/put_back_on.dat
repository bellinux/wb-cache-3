5|$|Returning to Belgium, Tintin {{discovers that}} Balthazar's brother has {{produced}} a range of replicas of the fetish, which he had discovered among his deceased brother's belongings, and learns that the original has been purchased by a wealthy American, Mr. Goldbarr; now aboard a ship to the United States.

5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made a long run as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the clock after the referees determined Yeldon had stepped out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards deep in his own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players in his path (the field goal unit was made up almost entirely of offensive linemen), sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E

25|$|Henry IV {{began to}} enforce the law against {{usurpation}} of titles of nobility, and in 1666–1674 Louis XIV mandated a massive program of verification of hereditary titles.

The baby sits or lies in the resulting pocket. Once a sling is threaded, it can be taken off and <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> without rethreading. A threaded sling forms a loop of cloth. The wearer can put one arm and the head through the loop of cloth to put the sling back on.|$|E
