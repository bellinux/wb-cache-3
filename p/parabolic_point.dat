40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the affine {{geometric}} {{structure of the}} graph of a polynomial f ∈R [x,y]. We provide certain criteria to determine when the parabolic curve is compact and when the unbounded component of its complement is hyperbolic or elliptic. We analyse the extension to the real projective plane of both fields of asymptotic lines and the Poincaré index of its singular points when the surface is generic. Thus, we exhibit an index formula for the field of asymptotic lines involving the number of connected components of the projective Hessian curve of f {{and the number of}} the special <b>parabolic</b> <b>points.</b> As an application of this investigation, we obtain upper bounds, respectively, for the number of special <b>parabolic</b> <b>points</b> having an interior tangency and when they have an exterior tangency.

40|$|The Douady-Hubbard landing theorem for {{periodic}} external rays {{is one of}} the cornerstones of {{the study}} of polynomial dynamics. It states that, for a complex polynomial with bounded postcritical set, every periodic external ray lands at a repelling or parabolic periodic point, and conversely every repelling or <b>parabolic</b> <b>point</b> is the landing point of at least one periodic external ray. We prove an analogue of this theorem for an entire function with bounded postsingular set: every periodic dreadlock lands at a repelling or parabolic periodic point, and conversely every repelling or periodic <b>parabolic</b> <b>point</b> is the landing point of at least one periodic dreadlock. (Here, "dreadlocks" are certain connected subsets of the escaping set). If, in addition, the function in question has finite order of growth, then the dreadlocks are in fact hairs (curves to infinity). More generally, we prove that every point of a hyperbolic set is the landing point of a dreadlock. Comment: 53 pages, 3 figures. V 2 : Minor corrections throughou...|$|E

Together with results from elsewhere, one deduces that if Γ is a relatively hyperbolic group such that each maximal parabolic subgroup is one-or-two ended, finitely presented, and contains no infinite torsion subgroup, then the boundary of Γ is locally connected if it is connected. As a corollary, we see that the limit set of a geometrically finite group acting on a complete simply connected manifold of pinched negative curvature must be locally connected if it is connected...|$|E

In the first one we show that a relatively hyperbolic group $G$ splits as a star graph of groups whose central vertex group is finitely generated and the other vertex groups are maximal parabolic subgroups.

The second part essentially uses the methods of topological entourages developed in the first part. Using also Floyd metrics we obtain finer properties of finitely generated relatively hyperbolic groups. We show that there is a system of "tight" curves satisfying the property of horospherical quasiconvexity. We then prove that the Floyd quasigeodesics are tight and so the parabolic subgroups of $G$ are quasiconvex with respect to the Floyd metrics.
