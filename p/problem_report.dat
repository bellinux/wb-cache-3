In this paper, we focus on bug triaging and provide visual means to explore the effort estimation quality and the bug life-cycle of reported problems. Our approach follows the Micro/Macro reading technique and uses a combination of graphical views to investigate details of individual problem reports while maintaining the context provided by the surrounding data population. This enables the detection and detailed analysis of hidden pat- terns and facilitates the analysis of <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> outliers. In an industrial study, we use our approach in various <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> analysis scenarios and answer questions related to effort estimation and resource planning...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to update an {{existing}} interface to a software <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> database. The existing character-based interface is difficult to use and not intuitive to learn. The solution is to replace the interface with a graphical user interface and use a standard HTML client that interfaces to a J 2 EE Application Server containing Java beans capable of sharing methods between applications. This was done using an Open Source MySQL database as a repository for software <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> information. JBoss, a Java Application Server, provided the functionality for creating and modifying the reports.

40|$|Nowadays, {{a lot of}} {{development}} of Web applications use prototyping approach such as throw-away prototyping and evolutionary prototyping. In order to fulfill the users' requirements, developers need {{to communicate with the}} users, therefore prototyping is widely used in software development to assist these developers. As we develop Web application and release them as a number of versions or releases of prototype, it constantly requires changes to evolve and meet users' specific requirements. Thus, prototyping approach may cause more maintenance cost to be incurred due to scope creep during software development. In addition, it provides the challenges to a maintenance team who is mostly not the actual development team, to manage and track maintenance process of such Web applications. This paper proposes a user-centered technique for managing and tracking modification requests in a Web application. We anticipate that the proposed technique can assist maintainers to manage and track modification of a Web application in more effective and efficient manner by capturing, classifying and validating the enhancement requests, <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> and modification requests directly from the users during the prototyping process itself. This in turn will avoid unexpected modification requests once we release the Web application and to allow the tracing of both enhancement and <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> during prototyping and modification requests and <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> during maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is an {{intelligent}} systems methodology that enables information managers {{to increase efficiency}} and reduce cost by substantially automating processes (i. e., diagnosis, scheduling, or design). By identifying and ranking the relevance between a new case and previously encountered cases (i. e., stored in the case base), CBR systems can capture and share all of an organization's related knowledge capital for future use, and knowledge recycling can optimize resources spent on research and development. Unfamiliar cases are solved and documented by retrieving and adapting solutions from similar stored cases. Sample applications include a proposed knowledge system designed to enhance the NASAKSC Shuttle Processing Out-of-Family Disposition process, which addresses any operation or performance outside expected range or one that has not previously been experienced. CBR technology can yield productive results by transforming <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> and interim <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> relat [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} key attributes of projects {{in which the}} number of <b>problem</b> <b>reports</b> after release is remarkable in the communication software. After several interviews to software project managers, we derived candidate attributes of importance to the projects. To find out the most influential attributes of the projects, we conducted statistical analysis using a set of metrics data related to the candidate attributes {{and the number of}} <b>problem</b> <b>reports</b> after release. As a result, we successfully found that two metrics concerning the origin’s quality and the changes in specification are useful to estimate the field quality. 1 Objective and Approach The quality of communication software is usually measured by the <b>problem</b> <b>reports</b> after release in the field.

40|$|Gaining {{higher level}} {{evolutionary}} information about large software systems {{is a key}} in validating past and adjusting future development processes. In this paper, we analyze the proximity of software features based on modifi-cation and <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> data that capture the system’s evolution history. Features are instrumented and tracked, the relationships of modification and problem reports to these features are established, and the tracked fea-tures are visualized to illustrate their otherwise hidden dependencies. Our approach uncovers these hidden relationships between features via <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> analysis and presents them in easy-to-evaluate visual form. Particu-lar feature dependencies then can be selected to assess the feature evolution by zooming in into an arbitrary level of detail. Such visualization of inter-woven features, therefore, can indicate locations of design erosion in the architectural evolution of a software system. Our approach has been val-idated using the large open source software project of Mozilla and its bug reporting system Bugzilla...|$|E

40|$|The {{expectation}} that Chinese people present distress somatically {{is a central}} prediction of cultural psychopathology and {{has been the subject}} of considerable theoretical speculation. At the same time, empirical studies have been infrequent and have yielded mixed results. The authors examined symptom presentation in Chinese (n � 175) and Euro-Canadian (n � 107) outpatients, using spontaneous <b>problem</b> <b>report,</b> structured clinical interview, and symptom questionnaire methods. All 3 methods yielded cross-culturally equivalent somatic and psychological symptom subscales. Chinese outpatients reported more somatic symptoms on spontaneous <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> and structured clinical interview compared with Euro-Canadians, who in turn reported more psychological symptoms on all 3 methods. The relation between culture and somatic symptom presentation was mediated by a tendency toward externally oriented thinking. Difficulties with identifying emotions or describing them to others did not differ significantly across cultures, supporting a nonpathological interpretation of observed differences. Psychological symptom effects were larger and more consistent than somatic symptom effects; because other studies have confirmed the ubiquity of somatic presentations worldwide, these results suggest that Western psychologization may be more culturally specific than is Chinese somatization...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the impact on}} analyst performance of an extended <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> format. Previous {{studies have shown that}} Heuristic Evaluation can only find a high proportion of actual problems (thoroughness) if multiple analysts are used. However, adding analysts can result in a high proportion of false positives (low validity). We report surprising interim results from a large study that is exploring the DARe model for evaluation method effectiveness. The DARe model relates the effectiveness of an evaluation method to evaluators’ command of discovery and analysis resources. Previous work has shown that Heuristic Evaluation poorly supports problem discovery and analysis: heuristics tend to be inappropriately applied to problem predictions. We developed an extended <b>problem</b> <b>report</b> format to let us study analyst decision making during usability inspection. Our focus was on the quality of insights into analyst behaviour delivered by this extended report format. However, our first use of this format revealed unexpected improvements in validity (false positive reduction) and appropriate heuristic application. We argue that the format has unexpectedly led to more care and caution in problem discovery and elimination, and in heuristic application. Evaluation performance can thus be improved by indirectly ‘fixing the analyst’ via generic fixes to inspection methods. In addition, we provide the first direct evidence of how evaluators use separate discovery and analysis resources during usability inspection...|$|E
