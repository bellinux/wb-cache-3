Instead of viewing IP-ATM multicast address resolution and QoS support separately, the approach in this memo is to consider such issues in an integrated manner. In particular, the MIS architecture defines how a layer- 3 setup protocol as RSVP can be mapped to and integrated with a layer- 2 multicast address resolution protocol as EARTH - EAsy Multicast Routing THrough ATM clouds. With the use of EARTH, several ATM point-to-multipoint connections with different QoS parameters can be associated to a single IP multicast address.

We need to understand more about levers and barriers to their implementation and identify G/TIs likely to be successfully implemented in practice. OBJECTIVE: To report a mapping process used to identify G/TIs and to prospectively appraise their implementability, using Normalization Process Theory (NPT). METHODS: RESTORE is a 4 -year EU FP- 7 project. We used purposeful and network sampling to identify experts in statutory and non-statutory agencies across Austria, England, Greece, Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands who recommended G/TI data from the grey literature. In addition, a peer review of literature was conducted in each country. Resulting data were collated using a standardized <b>Protocol</b> <b>Mapping</b> Document. G/TIs were identified for inclusion by (i) initial elimination of incomplete G/TI material; (ii) application of filtering criteria; and (iii) application of NPT. RESULTS: 20 G/TIs met selection criteria: 8 guidelines and 12 training initiatives. Most G/TIs were identified in the Netherlands (n = 7), followed by Ireland (n = 6) and England (n = 5). Fewer were identified in Scotland (n = 2), and none in Greece or Austria. The majority (n = 13) were generated without the inclusion of migrant service users. All 20 were prospectively appraised for potential implementability by applying NPT. CONCLUSIONS: NPT is useful {{as a means of}} prospectively testing G/TIs for implementability. Results indicate a need to initiate meaningful engagement of migrants in the development of G/TIs.

40|$|In {{the era of}} Industry 4. 0, the {{connection}} between information and communication technology and the production environment in the industry is highly in demand in order to acquire production data. Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) communication enables the wireless and wired communication systems to provide the connectivity between embedded devices. It also enables the new industrial production adaptable applications development to increase productivity through efficient and reliable data access interfaces and services. The machines communicate and transmit the data to and from other machines via M 2 M communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, OPC UA, HTTP and XMPP over network. There are certain services and interfaces {{are available in the}} market for the M 2 M communication, but with the proprietary specification and modular access. The modular access to the machine will be complex when user wants to access production data from different machines, which are communicating with the different protocol at the same time. The user has to use the different client tools for different protocol access. The middleware application interface is necessary which can manage the machine access. This system will provide user a choice of client protocol to initiate the communication. The M 2 M <b>protocol</b> <b>mapping</b> and address translation application will provide the multi-modal, event based, structured and unambiguous hierarchical addressing scheme to communicate with end systems. This will provide the non-transparent access to the user and preserves the security layer between user and the client system. Tasks of the address translation and mapping system are to accept the request from clients and process it to the end system and return desired result to the client. The system feature includes different addressing schemes for client and end system i. e. machine and mapping between M 2 M protocols in order to accomplish multi-modal architecture...|$|E

As part of the Data Informed Practice Improvement Project’s (DIPIP) attempt to de-fetishise accountability assessment, teachers were tasked to investigate the alignment of a large-scale assessment with the South African mathematics curriculum. About 50 mathematics teachers from Grade 3 – 9 worked in groups together with subject facilitators from the Gauteng Department of Education and a university postgraduate student or lecturer who acted as group leader. The first project activity, curriculum mapping, provided a professional development opportunity in which groups mapped mathematical assessment items to the assessment standards of the curriculum. The items were taken from three sources: the 2006 and 2007 International Competitions and Assessments for Schools tests and from ‘own tests’ developed by the groups in the last term of the project. Groups were required to analyse the knowledge base underlying test items and to reflect on what they teach in relation to what the curriculum intends them to teach. They used a <b>protocol</b> (<b>mapping</b> template) to record their responses. This article deals {{with the question of}} how to transform data collected from large- scale learner assessments into structured learning opportunities for teachers. The findings were that through the curriculum mapping activity, groups became more aware of what is intended by the curriculum and how this differs from what is enacted in their classes. The findings were also that the capacity of groups to align content was better when they worked with leaders and that with more experience they gained confidence in mapping test items against the curriculum and made better judgments in relation to curriculum alignment. Involving teachers in the interpretation of both public assessment data and data from their own classroom activities can build their own understanding of the knowledge base of test items and of the curriculum...|$|E

Though wide-spread and used by many Anglo-American museums {{in one way or}} another (as reference in full or in part) a need has been felt for an integra-tion of the rule sets and for their application in the broader community, as a cooperative product and on a network basis. Therefore, Cataloguing Cultural Objects: A Guide to Describing Cultural Works and their Images (CCO) has been in development since 2001 : Part 1 (General Guidelines); Part II (Elements); and Part III (Authorities) ([URL] It is a manual for describing, documenting, and cataloguing cultural works and images of them, their visual surrogates, and consists of 9 chapters. The CCO project team consisted, i. e. of members of the Visual Resources Association (VRA) and the Getty Research Institute, with an Advisory board of experts from the museum, library, and archives communities.

40|$|I hereby {{declare that}} the {{following}} work was au-tonomously created by me {{without the use of}} any unauthorized resource, or resource other than those denoted in the bibliography section. Karlsruhe, August 23, 2010 Nowadays research projects can produce a multitude of various structured measurement data. This ranges up from a few but huge files (several GB up to TB) to a large amount of small files with only several MB size. To fulfill the requirements of high–performance file access and long term stor-age of data sets, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology currently develops the Large Scale Data Facility (LSDF). It will offer a variety of file systems and an initial storage space of 6 PB. For the access to different parts it is necessary use various access protocols with different authentication methods. A project which wants to access multiple parts of the LSDF therefore has to cope with all needed access protocols. To overcome this problem and to increase the acceptance of the LSDF an abstract API which encapsulates the different access protocols is needed. Within this thesis ten different network file systems and nine access technolo-gies are analyzed in detail. The ADALAPI, encapsulating different access protocols has been developed. This API provides an easy-to-use Java class including several methods for comfortable file access. To access files it is just needed to input a URL. The mapping to the corresponding access protocol is done automatically. The API is highly extensible by using Java reflection techniques. Adding a new protocol implementation can be easily done by editing a single properties file. An evaluation ensures a high–performance file access instead of its complex <b>protocol</b> <b>mapping.</b> It has been analyzed the dilemma between the possibil-ities of an easy-to-use API trying to hide everything from the user and a highly optimized API with lots of adjustment options.

40|$|The Latham (1994) and Egan (1998) reports {{identified}} fragmentation, poor co-ordination {{and communication}} as major {{weaknesses in the}} UK construction industry. The Generic Design and Construction Process Protocol has been developed to address these problems and help the industry to improve their business. The need for an IT solution to combat the obstacles and problems in implementing the Process Protocol in the industry has emerged. This PhD research focuses on developing an IT solution to support and help {{the implementation of the}} Generic Design and Construction Process Protocol to enable the fundamental change in the construction industry. The IT solution, named The Process Protocol Toolkit, aims to assist the creation of the process model and to manage the information of the project based on the Process Protocol framework. The Process Protocol Toolkit is composed of a Process <b>Protocol</b> <b>Map</b> Creation Tool and a Process Information Management Tool. The first tool will automate the process map creation process by using the Process Protocol as a framework and allow users to create and customise their specific project process map, and the second aims to manage and develop project information based on the project process. It will enable the construction managers to understand the construction process and facilitate the management of the construction process. The prototype of the Process <b>Protocol</b> <b>Map</b> Creation Tool is developed incorporating this research. Literature Reviews are used to understand the Process Protocol, process modelling and construction IT development. A questionnaire is employed to establish the IT usage and awareness within the industry. Information associated with the Process Protocol framework is modelled by a data modelling technique and transferred into a relational database. Subsequently, the data model is used {{in the development of the}} prototype of the Process Map Creation Tool to automate the process map production. A series of web based project information management systems are reviewed to identify the requirements of the project management system. The solution for knowledge integration with the Process Information Management tool is proposed for future development. The main contribution of this research is the establishment of the data model of the Process Protocol framework and the development of the Process <b>Protocol</b> <b>map</b> creation tool. It demonstrates how the Process Protocol framework can be customised and integrated into the project information system. The secondary contribution is the IT framework for knowledge based construction project information system. The framework of the system is demonstrated and validated through workshops and questionnaire.
