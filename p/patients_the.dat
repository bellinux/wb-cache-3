5|$|A fungal {{infection}} explains the symptoms observed in AD <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> slow progression of AD fits with the chronic nature of some systemic {{fungal infection}}s, {{which can be}} asymptomatic and thus, unnoticed and untreated.|$|E
5|$|In most <b>patients,</b> <b>the</b> {{direct cause}} for the {{cerebral}} sinus thrombosis is not readily apparent. Identifying a source of infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E
5|$|A quasi-sequel, called Dr. Caligari, was {{released}} in 1989, directed by Stephen Sayadian and starring Madeleine Reynal as the granddaughter of the original Dr. Caligari, now running an asylum and performing bizarre hormonal experiments on its <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> sex-driven story ultimately had {{little in common with}} the original film.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, cough was {{observed}} in 60.8 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> of <b>the</b> treatment group and in 59.7 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> from <b>the</b> control. At {{the time of the}} visit 2 (Day 5) cough was recorded in 37.4 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> of <b>the</b> treatment group and in 43.2 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> from <b>the</b> control but these were not statistically significant.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>patient</b> wears red-green glasses, and two lights (one red, one green) are used, so that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> thus sees each {{light with}} a {{different}} eye. One light is held by the clinician, the other by <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> <b>The</b> clinician points the light to a screen, requesting <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> to bring <b>the</b> second light to align on top of it. <b>The</b> <b>patient's</b> eye positions are measured while <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> performs <b>the</b> test.|$|R

5|$|After {{approximately}} three weeks, the expedition arrived in Lambaréné {{and met with}} Albert Schweitzer. Klevan later described the meeting with Schweitzer as the greatest moment of the entire expedition. Later, the hospital received 500kg of Norwegian klippfisk (dried and salted cod), a particular favourite with the hospital's <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> medicines were handed over, and the container was opened. Even though the drainage had been monitored throughout the expedition, there was still great excitement associated with seeing the result firsthand. The block of ice {{turned out to be}} almost entirely intact.|$|E
5|$|Another medical {{study as}} part of the MetaHit (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract) project {{consisted}} of 124 individuals from Denmark and Spain consisting of healthy, overweight, and irritable bowel disease <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria. Using Illumina GA sequence data and SOAPdenovo, a de Bruijn graph-based tool specifically designed for assembly short reads, they were able to generate 6.58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total contig length of 10.3 Gb and a N50 length of 2.2 kb.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male <b>patients</b> <b>the</b> immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS, during the 1980s and 1990s he treated many hundreds of HIV-positive people. During the height of the AIDS crisis, Sonnabend helped create several AIDS organisations, including the AIDS Medical Foundation (now amfAR), the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (now ACRIA), which pioneered community-based research, and the PWA Health Group, the first and largest formally recognised buyers' club.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{approaches}} {{the problem of}} <b>the</b> obese <b>patient</b> from <b>the</b> standpoint of dynamics between <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and his inner self, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and society, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and <b>the</b> doctor, and the doctor and his inner self. Dr. Sommers defines obesity, explores factors that bring <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> to <b>the</b> physician, and <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> expectations from that encounter. He elaborates {{on the use of}} hypnosis in treating obesity, and considers the need to deal with success or failure of therapy...|$|R

5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that they lacked the resources to deal with large increases {{in the number of}} <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|By 1844 {{there were}} 60 private <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> {{building}} was refronted and a chapel added in 1851. The {{design of the}} buildings and the therapeutic regime were seen as models to be followed elsewhere, including at the General Lunatic Asylum of Nottingham at Sneinton, and the drafting of the 1808 County Asylums Act and Lunacy Act 1845.|$|E
5|$|Chapters on {{methodology}} {{comprise a}} third of the book's core. Identical and fraternal twins were classified using fingerprints and blood groups. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their <b>patients</b> (<b>the</b> probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{analysis}} {{patterns that}} describe {{some aspects of}} recording information in a medical system for <b>patient</b> treatment. <b>The</b> <b>Patient</b> Treatment Records pattern includes two simpler patterns that describe the creation and maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> record and <b>the</b> assignment of the hospital assets for use by <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Patient</b> Record pattern models the hierarchical structure of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> information, medical history and treatment instance. The Asset Structure and Assignment pattern describes the assets assigned for each unique treatment instance. Together, these patterns represent the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> <b>the</b> medical history, the treatment instance, and the hospital assets. When a <b>patient</b> enters <b>the</b> hospital a treatment instance is created and added to <b>the</b> <b>Patient</b> Record pattern. <b>The</b> Asset Structure and Assignment pattern denotes the location, doctors, and nurses assigned to <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> These component patterns have value on their own right...|$|R

5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the {{jurisdictional}} requirement of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that flow through the organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{ten people}} were {{admitted}} to hospital with radiation sickness: the four scrap collectors, the two scrapyard employees, the scrapyard owner, her husband, her mother, and her maid. Of these, four people (those {{working at the}} scrapyard) were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 gray (Gy). All patients were ultimately referred to Rajavithi Hospital, where they received inpatient care. All {{but one of the}} patients developed agranulocytosis or bicytopenia (depletion of white blood cells and/or platelets). Several also developed burns, and one (the first scrap collector) had to have his finger amputated. Three <b>patients</b> (<b>the</b> two scrapyard workers and the owner's husband) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and sepsis, all within two months of exposure.|$|E
5|$|Sonnabend {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male <b>patients</b> <b>the</b> immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS. His background in microbiology, virology, infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, independently of government agencies that were slow to react and often at his own expense, and in 1983 he was founding editor one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend was fired from the journal).|$|E
50|$|Hostility is a {{negative}} attitude directed at <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> because <b>the</b> family feels that the disorder is controllable and that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is choosing not to get better. Problems in the family are often blamed on <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> has trouble problem solving in the family. The family believes {{that the cause of}} many of the family’s problems is <b>the</b> <b>patient’s</b> mental illness, whether they are or not.|$|R
5000|$|TEE {{requires}} a fasting <b>patient.</b> <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> must follow <b>the</b> ASA NPO guidelines (i.e. usually not eat anything {{for eight hours}} and not drink anything for two hours prior to the procedure.) ...|$|R
5000|$|During psychoanalytic sessions, which {{typically}} last 50 minutes and ideally take place 4-5 times a week, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "analysand") may lie on a couch, with the analyst often sitting just behind {{and out of}} sight. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> symptoms and character problems. Through the analysis of these conflicts, which includes interpreting the transference and countertransference (the analyst's feelings for <b>the</b> <b>patient),</b> <b>the</b> analyst confronts <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> pathological defenses to help <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> gain insight.|$|R
5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first line of treatment.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} limited reparenting {{involves}} welcoming and encouraging <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> dependency on <b>the</b> therapist (the minimal amount of dependency {{necessary to keep}} <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> in therapy). <b>The</b> therapist's responses to <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> affect becomes internalized by <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and supports <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> Healthy Adult mode. This Healthy Adult mode becomes a strong foundation {{for the establishment of}} autonomy. In this way limited reparenting is based upon trust of <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> dependency needs and a belief that is more effective to meet them than fight them.|$|R
