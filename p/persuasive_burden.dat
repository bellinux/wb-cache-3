40|$|In jurisdictions that {{subscribe}} to adversarial mode of litigation, burdens and standards of proof have significant {{roles in the}} adjudication and determination of criminal cases. The operation {{of the principle of}} presumption of innocence in such jurisdictions determines issues of who bears what burden and the extent thereof. The Ethiopian criminal procedure system predominantly exhibits adversarial features, and there is the need for the comprehension and enforcement of the respective burdens and standards of proof borne by litigants. The constraints in clarity are more pronounced in those criminal law provisions that embrace some form of presumptions such as provisions on corruption offences. This note highlights how issues of burden and standard of proof are allocated as between prosecuting authorities and accused persons. Apart from explaining the nexus between the principle of presumption of innocence, burdens of proof and standards of proof, it indicates the implications of the operation of the principle of presumption of innocence upon the allocation of evidential and <b>persuasive</b> <b>burdens</b> of proof as {{between the state and the}} accused. It further outlines the effects of the various forms of presumptions upon the different kinds of burdens of proof...|$|R
40|$|I discuss two {{questions}} about the meaning and implications of the Presumption of Innocence. First, is it consistent with laying either an evidential or a <b>persuasive</b> <b>burden</b> on the defendant at trial? I argue {{that it can be}} consistent with laying an evidential burden, once the prosecution proves the commission of what can properly be counted as a presumptive wrong. Second, should we understand ‘innocence’ in this context in purely legal terms, as innocence of what the law defines as an offense; or in more moralised terms? I argue for a strict formal reading of ‘innocence. ...|$|E
40|$|Many American {{cases have}} {{discussed}} {{the circumstances under which}} a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement, ie a person who is not ex-facie a party to the agreement, can be compelled to submit to arbitration or can compel another party to submit to arbitration instead of litigating in the courts. In contrast, the number of cases that discuss the conditions necessary fir a foreign award to be enforced against a non-signatory are relatively few. The number and complexity of cross border transactions have increased because of ti ie pace of globalisation, and many of these transactions envisage arbitration as the method of dispute settlement. When a foreign arbitral tribunal makes an award against a non-signatory, the court before which enforcement of that award is sought must determine whether the award is a New York Convention award. More than 140 countries are parties to this Convention, and while the local conflicts of law rules in many of these countries permit courts to ignore the judgments of the most respected courts in the world, the Convention requires enforcement of awards from any duly constituted foreign arbitral panel. A decision of the High Court of Singapore allowing the enforcement of a foreign award against a non- signatory affords an opportunity to examine the law and policy on the issue and their significance for Asian courts. The argument of the article is that foreign awards against non-signatories should be carefully scrutinised. The enforcing court must satisfy itself that the non-signatory should be treated as a party to the arbitration agreement and the <b>persuasive</b> <b>burden</b> of proof should be on the enforcing party...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} the Human Rights Act 1998, {{courts are}} {{expected}} to check that a prima facie limitation of qualified rights passes the four-stage proportionality test, i. e. it is 1. in pursuit of a legitimate aim, 2. rationally connected to the aim, 3. no more than necessary for achieving the aim, and 4. overall balanced. The adoption of proportionality as a standard of review has led to concerns that courts, in applying this inherently intrusive standard, would interfere with questions that they lack the expertise or legitimacy to decide, or otherwise inappropriately intrude into the state’s policy-making spheres. To allay these concerns, courts have relaxed their intensity of review in various ways, including bypassing certain stages of the proportionality test or merging all stages of the enquiry into a general question of whether the measure is reasonable or permissible. I have elsewhere argued that such dilution of the standard of review in human rights cases is not justified. This paper focuses on evaluating one particular way in which courts have relaxed their intensity of review, namely, shifting the burden of proof. The HRA itself does not stipulate where the burden of proof lies. The orthodox position is that the litigant bears the burden to show a prima facie limitation of right, but once he can do so, the onus falls on the public authority to demonstrate that the limitation passes the four-stage proportionality test. In practice, however, courts have sometimes required the litigant to demonstrate disproportionality of the rights limitation. There is some support of this shift in onus in academia. For example, in a recent paper, Julian Rivers explains the practical difficulties faced by the state in establishing that a measure passes the final two stages of the proportionality analysis, and proposes that in some contexts, once the public authority can demonstrate a legitimate aim and rationality, the burden should shift to the litigant to establish that the measure is more than necessary or overall imbalanced. This article seeks to defend the position that the state should always bear the burden of proving that a prima facie limitation of right passes all stages of the proportionality enquiry. Although this position is widely assumed, there has been little discussion of the rationale underlying it. This article will expound such rationale and argue that the practical concerns driving the transferral of a <b>persuasive</b> <b>burden</b> can be accommodated by placing an evidential burden on the litigant. preprin...|$|E
40|$|When a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{adopts a}} measure which it {{considers}} {{is necessary to}} protect against a health risk, but which constitutes a barrier to international trade in goods, there is a conflict of interests. If the measure is removed, the health protection interest is affected negatively. If the measure is kept in place, the trade liberalisation interest is affected negatively. Both interests are considered important within the WTO regulatory framework, and must therefore be balanced. One part of this balancing act occurs when panels answer burden of proof questions in WTO disputes concerning health protection measures. The core questions are: What facts must be proved by the parties under the relevant provisions (what are the ‘legal facts’) ? What party shall carry the heaviest burden of persuading the panel about these facts (what party shall carry the ‘persuasive burden’) ? And to what extent must the party persuade the panel about the facts (what ‘standard of proof’ shall be applied) ? In WTO law, {{there are a number}} of provisions specifically regulating the adoption of health protection measures. The most important are: Article XX(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the GATT 1994), and Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement). The aim of this study is to analyse these provisions from a burden of proof perspective. The analysis is carried out in Chapters 2 - 5 of the study. Chapter 2 contains an analysis of the general burden of proof concept. The main conclusions reached are that a court cannot normally avoid allocating the <b>persuasive</b> <b>burden</b> to one of the parties, and applying a certain standard of proof. When deciding how the burden should be allocated, and what standard to apply, the court should primarily rely on arguments related to the desire to reduce the risk of an erroneous outcome. Chapter 3 contains a general analysis of how the burden of proof has been handled in WTO dispute settlement. The main conclusions from this Chapter are that, even though the adjudicating bodies have often addressed the burden of proof in their reports, they have not discussed why the burden should be allocated to a certain party, or why a certain standard should be applied. General burden of proof principles have been applied with very little discussion. Moreover, they have also relied on the ‘prima facie case’ concept when allocating the burden. This concept seems to have little practical relevance, and it is argued that the adjudicating bodies should not continue to rely on it in future cases. Chapter 4 contains an analysis of how the legal facts in Article XX(b) of the GATT 1994 (and the chapeau of Article XX) have been interpreted, and how the burden of proof has been handled under the provision. The main conclusions here are that the adjudicating bodies have not provided much guidance in respect of how the existence of a health risk, and the relationship between the measure and the risk, should be demonstrated under the provision. The provision has consistently been treated as an exception for burden of proof purposes, and the burden has been allocated to the defendant. This entails that the trade interest has been favoured, and the health interest disfavoured. Chapter 5 contains an analysis of how the legal facts in the relevant paragraphs of Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the SPS Agreement have been interpreted, and how the burden of proof has been handled under the provisions. The main conclusions reached are that, even though the provisions contain detailed requirements, and even though the adjudicating bodies have provided rather detailed interpretations in different disputes, many of the most important legal facts are still unclear. It is for example not clear when the scientific evidence should be considered sufficient to perform a risk assessment within the meaning of Article 5. 1, and what is required from such an assessment. This makes it difficult for the parties to know what to prove. More or less all provisions in the SPS Agreement have been treated as general rules for burden of proof purposes, and the burden has been allocated to the claimant. This entails that the health interest has been favoured, and the trade interest disfavoured. The conclusions of the study are summarised in Chapter 6. The most important general conclusion is that the WTO adjudicating bodies should not apply general burden of proof principles. Instead, they should examine how the burden of proof should be handled under individual provisions, in light of arguments related to the desire to reduce the risk of errors. It is proposed that the default option under the above provisions should be to allocate the burden to the claimant, and to apply the balance of probability standard...|$|E
