5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} in evolutionary biology which <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little evolutionary change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion. This theory <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> the Celticisation of Ireland may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between Ireland, Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|A third alternative, {{noting that}} Edward in 978 {{was very close}} to ruling on his own, <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> Ealdorman Ælfhere was behind the killing so as to {{preserve}} his own influence and to prevent Edward taking revenge for Ælfhere's actions earlier in the reign. John notes this and interprets Ælfhere's part in Edward's reburial as being a penance for the assassination.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> D. aborensis reproduces asexually during the summer, while sexually from autumn. However, no sexual mature {{specimens}} have been found.

5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|RNA thermometers, {{along with}} riboswitches, {{are used as}} {{examples}} {{in support of the}} RNA world hypothesis. This theory <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> RNA was once the sole nucleic acid present in cells, and was replaced by the current DNA → RNA → protein system.|$|E

50|$|Steinberg <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> when cells form {{distinct}} tissues, specific {{cell-cell adhesion}} between {{cells from the}} same tissue can drive the separation.

40|$|It is <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> {{using both}} self-non-self and danger {{theories}} give {{a better understanding}} of how the immune system works. It is <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> comparing immune system to police force is useful in this case since police responds both to danger or damage signals and to foreign or suspicious behavior even if no danger signals existed. We also <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> due to low zone tolerance immunotherapy needs to be combined with another treatment method for cancer e. g. chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy to get a sufficient eradication of tumors. Finally we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> fractional order differential equations are more suitable than the familiar integer order differential equations. A fractional order example of two immune effectors attacking an antigen is given. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
5|$|Scholar John Lindow <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.|$|E

5|$|The RNA world {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} RNA was once both the carrier of hereditary information and enzymatically active, with different sequences acting as biocatalysts, regulators and sensors. The hypothesis then <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> modern DNA, RNA and protein-based life evolved and selection replaced {{the majority of}} RNA's roles with other biomolecules.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> {{cognition}} is {{more than}} a collection of independent processes operating in a modular cognitive system. Instead, we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> cognition emerges from dependencies between all of the basic systems in the brain, including goal management, perception, action, memory, reward, affect, and learning. Furthermore, human cognition reflects its social evolution and context, as well as contributions from a developmental process. After presenting these themes, we illustrate their application to the process of anticipation. Specifically, we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> anticipations occur extensively across domains (i. e., goal management, perception, action, reward, affect, and learning) in coordinated manners. We also <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> anticipation is central to situated action and to social interaction, and that many of its key features reflect the process of development...|$|R

5|$|When animals choose mates, traits such as {{signalling}} {{are subject}} to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses a mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male senders, {{in a similar way}} to the hidden preference hypothesis which <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> successful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female. Signallers have sometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait preferences.|$|E

5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E

50|$|Together with Alfred Mirsky, Anson was {{the first}} to <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> {{conformational}} protein folding was a reversible process.

He also{{was the first}} to note that the energy barrier typical of folding(5 kcal/mol) was small compared to the absolute magnitudes of the energies and entropies involved (~100 kcal/mol) and, hence, <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> energy and entropy were continuously traded offduring the folding process.|$|R
