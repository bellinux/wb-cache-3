40|$|A Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) is a {{mechanical}} pump used {{to assist the}} weakened left ventricle to pump blood to the entire body. One method of controlling <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> is using a closed-loop controller that changes the <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> based on the patient's level of activity and demand for cardiac output. An {{important aspect of the}} development of a closed-loop controller is the selection of the desired <b>pump</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>Pump</b> <b>speed</b> must be chosen such that the patient receives adequate cardiac output for his/her level of activity. The pump must also operate in a safe physiological operating region, placing constraints on other hemodynamic parameters. This work presents the <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> selection problem as a multiobjective optimization problem, considering constraints on cardiac output, left atrial pressure, and arterial pressure. A penalty function is assigned to each hemodynamic variable and a mathematical model of the LVAD and cardiovascular system is used to map the penalty functions as functions of the hemodynamic parameters to penalty functions as functions of <b>pump</b> <b>speed.</b> The penalties for the different variables are combined by forming a weighted sum, and the best set of <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> is determined by minimizing the combined penalty functions using different sets of weights. The resulting set of best <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> forms the noninferior set (Zadeh, IEEE Trans. On Auto. Control, 1967). It was discovered that the noninferior set contains discontinuities, so the concept of a modified noninferior set known as the Clinician's noninferior set is introduced. A decision support system (DSS) is presented that allows clinicians to determine a single <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> from the noninferior set by investigating the effects of different speeds on the hemodynamic variables.

40|$|The {{degradation}} {{in efficiency}} of auxiliary components in heating/cooling systems when operating {{at part load}} is frequently reported. Through the use of variable speed components, the supplied capacity {{can be reduced to}} match the required load and hence reduce unnecessary energy consumption. However, for fan coil units, difficulties can arise when optimizing fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> at part load. Practically locating optimal water and air flow rates from readily available information and for varying supplied capacities is necessary, {{in order to reduce the}} fan coil power consumption. This research attempts to identify whether optimal fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> exist for a fan coil unit and how they can be implemented, in a practical manner, in a system control applications. Using an empirical fan coil and pump model, the total power consumption (fan and pump) for different combinations of fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> over a range of capacities was calculated. It was observed that, for a given capacity, an optimal combination of fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> exists and there was a significant change in power consumption for different combinations of fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> supplying the same capacity. A control strategy is described that utilizes a simple fan coil capacity estimation model, coupled with air and water flow rates, along with nominal design data. The <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> is optimized using PID control to maintain the space temperature at the chosen set-point, which matches the supplied capacity to the required capacity. At set-time intervals, the capacity estimation model is utilized to optimize the water and air flow rates for the required capacity.

First, the current wellbore pressure has to be calculated using the methodology introduced in Section “Methodologies”. Then, the methodology described in Section “Methodologies” should be used to predict the oil production and the increase in oil viscosity, respectively, at a certain increase in the wellbore pressure. Based on the knowledge of the anticipated production rate, the fluid level at any combination of the <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> and casing pressure can be estimated using Eq.  26.

50|$|A {{decrease}} in pump pressure or increase in <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> can happen {{as a result}} of a {{decrease in}} hydrostatic pressure of the annulus as the formation fluids enters the wellbore.

30|$|The {{function}} of BPR {{installed on the}} casing is to control the casing pressure, which in turn gives control over the wellbore pressure as the BPR restricts the flow of gas through the casing-tubing annulus. Without the BPR, the wellbore pressure is only controlled by the <b>speed</b> of the <b>pump,</b> as a higher speed lowers the wellbore pressure. From the producing perspective, higher <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> or lower wellbore pressure is always preferred since it yields a higher production rate. However, {{in the case of}} ‘trouble’ wells such as such as the well under consideration, increasing the <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> may result in the need for another well service, since the lower wellbore pressure results in a higher sand inflow. This shows that for this well, well optimization is not easily accomplished when the wellbore pressure is only a {{function of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>speed.</b> The foremost advantage of installing BPR on the casing is having control over the wellbore pressure. This advantage implies that the pump can be operated at a higher speed without lowering the wellbore pressure, which can now be controlled by BPR. A disadvantage of BPR installation is the decrease in the range of <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> at which the pump can be operated without encountering the dry condition.|$|R

50|$|At reduced {{pressure}} levels for VLSI manufacturing, polysilicon deposition rate below 575 °C is {{too slow to}} be practical.

Pressure can be varied inside a low-pressure reactor either by changing the <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> or changing the inlet gas flow into the reactor. If the inlet gas is composed of both silane and nitrogen, the inlet gas flow, and hence the reactor pressure, may be varied either by changing the nitrogen flow at constant silane flow, or changing both the nitrogen and silane flow to change the total gas flow while keeping the gas ratio constant. Recent investigations have shown that e-beam evaporation, followed by SPC (if needed) can be a cost effective and faster alternative for producing solar grade poly-Si thin films.

MethodsTwenty-two LVAD recipients underwent ramp cardiopulmonary exercise tests at fixed and increasing <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> (+ 1. 5 % of baseline speed/ 10 W workload increase), echocardiography and NT-proBNP dosage. Peak systemic perfusion was peak VO 2 /estimated peak arterio-venous O 2 difference, and LVBF was systemic perfusion minus PBF provided by LVAD controller. A change of peak percentage of predicted VO 2 max (Δpeak%VO 2) ≥ 3 in increasing- vs. fixed-speed test was considered significant. ResultsTricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and NT-proBNP were significantly lower and higher, respectively, in Δpeak%VO 2 13 mm as a predictor of Δpeak%VO 2 ≥ 3. ConclusionsA significant LVBF contribution to peak systemic perfusion and <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> increase-induced peak VO 2 improvement was detectable only in patients with a more preserved right ventricular systolic function and stable hemodynamic picture.
