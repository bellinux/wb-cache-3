40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{is an important}} process in many different industrial processes including oil refming and energy generation. A shell and tube heat exchanger {{is one of the}} most common types of heat exchanger used to achieve effective heat transfer between two fluid streams. In order to improve such systems passive heat transfer enhancement techniques such as pipe inserts can be of use, especially at laminar or transitional fluid flow conditions. This project uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate one type of <b>pipe</b> <b>insert.</b> Previous experimental investigations of the insert found that it greatly increases heat transfer over a plain empty pipe. However the mechanisms of how and why the insert increases heat transfer are poorly understood. The aim of the project is to use CFD to investigate the mechanisms that occur inside a pipe with this type of insert, which lead to increased heat transfer. The CFD and experimental data show good agreement, with the outlet temperature of the cases simulated being all within 3. 5...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} {{in the design of}} ultra high grade (X 100) gas pipelines is the identification of a reliable crack propagation strategy. Recent research results have shown that the newly developed high strength and large diameter gas pipelines, when operated at severe conditions, {{may not be able to}} arrest a running ductile crack through pipe material properties. Hence, the use of crack arrestors is required in the design of safe and reliable pipeline systems. A conventional crack arrestor can be a high toughness <b>pipe</b> <b>insert,</b> or a local joint with higher wall thickness. According to experimental results of full-scale burst tests, composite crack arrestors are one of the most promising technologies. Such crack arrestors are made of fibre reinforced plastics which provide the pipe with an additional hoop constraint. In this paper, numerical tools to simulate crack initiation, propagation and arrest in composite crack arrestors are introduced. First, the in-use behaviour of composite crack arrestors is evaluated by means of large scale tensile tests and four point bending experiments. The ability of different stress based orthotropic failure measures to predict the onset of material degradation is compared. Then, computational fracture mechanics is applied to simulate ductile crack propagation in high pressure gas pipelines, and the corresponding crack growth in the composite arrestor. The combination of numerical simulation and experimental research allows deriving design guidelines for composite crack arrestors...|$|E

40|$|This {{final report}} {{highlights}} significant achievements in the Enhanced Practical Photosynthetic CO{sub 2 } Mitigation Project {{during the period}} from 10 / 1 / 2001 through 01 / 02 / 2006. As indicated in the list of accomplishments below, our efforts during this project were focused on the selection of candidate organisms and growth surfaces and initiating long-term tests in the bench-scale and pilot-scale bioreactor test systems. Specific results and accomplishments for the program include: (1) CRF- 2 test system: (a) Sampling test results have shown that the initial mass of algae loaded into the Carbon Recycling Facility Version 2 (CRF- 2) system can be estimated with about 3 % uncertainty using a statistical sampling procedure. (b) The pressure shim header <b>pipe</b> <b>insert</b> design was shown to have better flow for harvesting than the drilled-hole design. (c) The CRF- 2 test system has undergone major improvements to produce the high flow rates needed for harvesting (as determined by previous experiments). The main changes to the system are new stainless steel header/frame units, with increased flow capacity and a modified pipe-end-sealing method to improve flow uniformity, and installation and plumbing for a new high flow harvesting pump. Qualitative system tests showed that the harvesting system performed wonderfully, cleaning the growth surfaces within a matter of seconds. (d) Qualitative tests have shown that organisms can be repopulated on a harvested section of a bioreactor screen, demonstrating that continuous bioreactor operation is feasible, with continuous cycles of harvesting and repopulating screens. (e) Final preparations are underway for quantitative, long-term tests in the CRF- 2 with weekly harvesting. (2) Pilot-scale test system: (a) The construction of the pilot-scale bioreactor was completed, including the solar collector and light distribution system. Over the course of the project, the solar collector used in the light delivery system showed some degradation, but performed well overall. (b) Testing confirmed that algae can be grown in a sustainable fashion in the pilot bioreactor, even with intermittent availability of sunlight. (c) The pilot-scale tests indicated that algal growth rate followed photon delivery during productivity testing. (3) Organisms and Growth Surfaces: (a) The aeration of growth media with 5 % CO{sub 2 } in air stimulates cyanobacterial growth 10 - 20 times over that with air alone. It is possible that the rate of the stimulation of cyanobacterial growth in the CRF will be higher because cyanobacteria will be grown as a biofilm. We plan to increase the concentration to 15 % CO{sub 2 } in air. (b) Tests have shown a doubling time of the cyanobacterial culture of about 7. 5 hours with illumination of about 170 {micro}mol m{sup - 2 } sec{sup - 1 }. All lower levels of illumination led to a decrease in the cyanobacterial growth rate. (c) Macroscopical and microscopical observations suggest that the culture of this isolate undergoes significant morphological changes after 60 - 70 hours of incubation in the batch culture mode. First of all, the culture begins to clump. This clumping could lead to the decrease of effective illumination of culture and may reflect a medium alkalinization. (d) Organization of our collection of the thermophilic cyanobacteria isolated from Yellowstone National Park has resulted in 13 unialgal cultures of thermophilic cyanobacteria. (e) A new species (even probably a new genus) of cyanobacteria, 5. 2 s. c. 1, isolated from LaDuke Spring in Great Yellowstone Basin, demonstrates an elevated resistance to some compounds of iron. This might be very important for our project, because plant gases may have elevated amount of iron. Our study of the effect of different concentration of FeCl{sub 3 }* 6 H{sub 2 }O on the growth of the 5. 2 s. c. 1 isolate showed that iron additions stimulated rather then inhibited the growth of the isolate. Because of this we would recommend this isolate for further experiments. (f) The shape of the Chlorogloeopsis siderophila cells (cyanobacteria) was found to be affected by environmental pH, which may be useful in culture quality control. Besides, the further investigation of this phenomenon suggested that the rate of cell adhesion to a glass surface decreases upon medium alkalinization. Thus, harvesting effectiveness may be improved by increasing medium pH up to 9 before harvesting of cyanobacteria from a substratum.

Several different configurations of two low-conductivity baffles (arranged symmetrically {{with respect to}} the vertical plane through the centre-lines of the <b>pipes),</b> <b>inserted</b> across the cavity and extending its whole length, were tested. With the horizontal inner pipe located at a vertical eccentricity of - 0 Â· 65 (i. e. in the lower region of the outer pipe), the optimal inclination of the two baffles, corresponding to the least rate of convective heat exchange, was achieved at Â± 140 Â° from the vertically downwards radius vector emanating from the centre of the inner pipe. This enabled a reduction of ~ 6 % in the steady-state convective heat leak to be achieved compared with that for the plain eccentric annulus under similar temperature differences between the pipes. However, by using a vertical baffle (i. e. at an angle of 0 Â°), an increase of ~ 14 % in the convective heat leak through the air occurred. The results agree qualitatively with those expected on the basis of previous studies for the inverse case (of a concentric annulus) with the heat flowing outwards. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{well-known}} Hvorslev (1951) formula {{was developed}} to estimate soil permeability using single-well slug tests and has been widely applied to determine riverbed hydraulic conductivity using in situ standpipe permeameter tests. Here, we further develop a general solution of the Hvorslev (1951) formula that accounts for flow in a bounded medium and assumes that {{the bottom of the}} river is a prescribed head boundary. The superposition of real and imaginary disk sources is used to obtain a semi-analytical expression of the total hydraulic resistance of the flow {{in and out of the}} pipe. As a result, we obtained a simple semi-analytical expression for the resistance, which represents a generalization of the Hvorslev (1951). The obtained expression is benchmarked against a finite-element numerical model of 2 -D flow (in r-z coordinates) in an anisotropic medium. The results exhibit good agreement between the simulated and estimated riverbed hydraulic conductivity values. Furthermore, a set of simulations for layered, stochastically heterogeneous riverbed sediments was conducted and processed using the proposed expression to demonstrate the potential associated with measuring vertical heterogeneity in bottom sediments using a series of standpipe permeameter tests with different lengths of <b>pipe</b> <b>inserted</b> into the riverbed sediments.
