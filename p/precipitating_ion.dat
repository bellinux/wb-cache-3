30|$|The {{observed}} {{coincidence of}} the maximum of the <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> energy flux and the westward auroral electrojet is a natural consequence of the processes leading to ring current formation during magnetic storms. The shift of the auroral oval toward lower latitudes leads to the shift of its equatorial boundary and hence of the equatorial boundary of the westward electrojet. At the same time, due to dipolarizations related to the substorm activity, both ions and electrons are accelerated, leading {{to an increase in}} particle fluxes. Hence, the observed increase in ion fluxes and the ion pressure occurs in the same place where the seed population of electrons emerges. The seed electrons later get accelerated to relativistic energies. That is why in spite of intense radial diffusion, the L-position {{of the maximum}} of phase space density of relativistic electrons coincides with the position of the maximum of the <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> energy flux (ion pressure) and the equatorial boundary of the region of the substorm dipolarizations.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMAVEN {{observations}} {{show that}} the global spatial distribution of ions precipitating toward the Martian upper atmosphere has a highly asymmetric pattern relative to the upstream solar wind electric field. MAVEN observations indicate that precipitating planetary heavy ion fluxes measured in the downward solar wind electric field (−E) hemisphere are generally larger than those measured in the upward electric field (+E) hemisphere, as expected from modeling. The −E(+E) hemispheres are defined by the direction of solar wind electric field pointing towards (or away from) the planet. On the other hand, such an asymmetric precipitating pattern relative to the solar wind electric field is less clear around the terminator. Strong precipitating fluxes are sometimes found even in the +E field hemisphere under either strong upstream solar wind dynamic pressure or strong interplanetary magnetic field periods. The results imply that those intense <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> fluxes are observed when the gyro radii of pickup ions {{are estimated to be}} relatively small compared with the planetary scale.

40|$|Recent global hybrid {{simulations}} {{investigated the}} formation of flux transfer events (FTEs) and their convection and interaction with the cusp. Based on these simulations, we have analyzed several Polar cusp crossings in the Northern Hemisphere {{to search for the}} signature of such FTEs in the energy distribution of downward precipitating ions: <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> beams at different energies parallel to the ambient magnetic field and overlapping in time. Overlapping ion distributions in the cusp are usually attributed to a combination of variable ion acceleration during the magnetopause crossing together with the time-of-flight effect from the entry point to the observing satellite. Most "step up" ion cusp structures (steps in the ion energy dispersions) only overlap for the populations with large pitch angles and not for the parallel streaming populations. Such cusp structures are the signatures predicted by the pulsed reconnection model, where the reconnection rate at the magnetopause decreased to zero, physically separating convecting flux tubes and their parallel streaming ions. However, several Polar cusp events discussed in this study also show an energy overlap for parallel-streaming precipitating ions. This condition might be caused by reopening an already reconnected field line, forming a magnetic island (flux rope) at the magnetopause similar to that reported in global MHD and Hybrid simulation...|$|E
30|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the precipitating electrons {{are affected by the}} ions that are injected with them, rather than simply reflecting the spatial change in the magnetosheath. Burch (1985) suggested that the cusp electrons follow the ions to maintain charge neutrality. If this behavior is operative in the flux tube of the moving cusp aurora and the mechanisms for maintaining the behavior do not change significantly with increasing distance from the origin of the flux tube, a fixed relationship may be seen between the features of the precipitating electrons and those of the <b>precipitating</b> <b>ions,</b> irrespective of the distance from the origin of the open flux tube.|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of precipitating keV ions in the Earth's cusp originating at the magnetosheath provide unique means to test {{our understanding of}} particle acceleration and parallel electric fields in the lower altitude acceleration region. On numerous occasions, the FAST (The Fast Auroral Snapshot) spacecraft has encountered the Earth's cusp regions near its apogee of 4175 km which are characterized by their signatures of dispersed keV ion injections. The FAST instruments also reveal a complex microphysics inherent to many, but not all, of the cusp regions encountered by the spacecraft, that include upgoing ion beams and conics, inverted-V electrons, upgoing electron beams, and spikey DC-coupled electric fields and plasma waves. Detailed inspection of the FAST data often show clear modulation of the precipitating magnetosheath ions that indicate that they are affected by local electric potentials. For example, the magnetosheath ion precipitation is sometimes abruptly shut off precisely in regions where downgoing localized inverted-V electrons are observed. Such observations support the {{existence of}} a localized process, such as parallel electric fields, above the spacecraft which accelerate the electrons downward and consequently impede the <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> precipitation. Other acceleration events in the cusp are sometimes organized with an apparent cellular structure that suggests Alfven waves or other large-scale phenomena are controlling the localized potentials.

40|$|We present {{predictions}} of the signatures of magnetosheath particle precipitation (in the regions classified as open low-latitude boundary layer, cusp, mantle and polar cap) for periods when the interplanetary magnetic field has a southward component. These are made using the “pulsating cusp” model {{of the effects of}} time-varying magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause. Predictions are made for both low-altitude satellites in the topside ionosphere and for midaltitude spacecraft in the magnetosphere. Low-altitude cusp signatures, which show a continuous ion dispersion signature, reveal "quasi-steady reconnection" (one limit of the pulsating cusp model), which persists for a period of at least 10 min. We estimate that “quasi-steady” in this context corresponds to fluctuations in the reconnection rate of a factor of 2 or less. The other limit of the pulsating cusp model explains the instantaneous jumps in the <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> spectrum that have been observed at low altitudes. Such jumps are produced by isolated pulses of reconnection: that is, they are separated by intervals when the reconnection rate is zero.

Predictions of the corresponding ion precipitation signatures seen by midaltitude spacecraft are presented.

A simple field line resonance model of the wave has been created and scaled using the wave's spatial and temporal characteristics inferred from SuperDARN and IMAGE magnetometer data.

This comparison reveals the small-scale structuring and energies of the current carriers in {{a large-scale}} Alfvén wave, a topic, which at present, is of considerable theoretical interest. When FAST traverses a region of the wave involving low upward field-aligned current densities, the current appears to be carried by unstructured downgoing electrons of energies less than 30 eV. A downward current region appears to be carried partially by upgoing electrons below the FAST energy detection threshold, but also consists of a mixture of hotter downgoing magnetospheric electrons and upgoing ionospheric electrons of energies < 30 eV, with the hotter upgoing electrons presumably representing those upgoing electrons which have been accelerated by the wave field above the low energy detection threshold of FAST.

The part of the spectrum due to oxygen peaks around 650 eV, which indicates a high fraction of fully-stripped oxygen in the <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> flux. A combination of the OVIII emission lines at 653 eV and 774 eV, as well as the OVII emission lines at 561 eV and 666 eV, are evident in the measure auroral spectrum. There is also line emission at lower energies in the spectral region extending from 250 to 350 eV, which could be from sulfur and/or carbon. The Jovian auroral X- ray spectra are significantly different from the X-ray spectra of comets. The charge state distribution of the oxygen ions implied by the measured auroral X-ray spectra strongly suggests that, independent of the source of the energetic ions - magnetospheric or solar wind - the ions have undergone additional acceleration. This spectral evidence for ion acceleration is also consistent with the relatively high intensities of the X-rays compared to the available phase space density of the (unaccelerated) source populations of solar wind or magnetospheric ions at Jupiter, which are orders of magnitude too small to explain the observed emissions. The Chandra X-ray observations were executed simultaneously with observations at ultraviolet wavelengths by the Hubble Space Telescope and at radio wavelengths by the Ulysses spacecraft. These additional data sets suggest that the source of the X-rays is magnetospheric in origin, and that the precipitating particles are accelerated by strong field-aligned electric fields, which simultaneously create both the several-MeV energetic ion population and the relativistic electrons observed in situ by Ulysses that are correlated with approximately 40 minute quasi-periodic radio outbursts...|$|E

Previous research (Barge et al, 2012) has explored various morphologies evidenced when the metal salt FeCl 2 • 4 H 20 is incorporated into sodium silicate and potassium phosphate solutions. While inorganic compounds were included in previous research, organic compounds have yet to be introduced. The current project seeks to build upon previous work by introducing organics to inorganic chemical garden precipitate systems, to determine if/how the organics can affect self-assembling morphologies or crystal growth. Thus far we have observed that amino acids affect chemical garden morphology, density and growth. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) imaging of the tubules and structures show that they appear quite robust with varied gradients across their membranes. This work also has applications for life detection: Though chemical gardens are not alive, the structures themselves appear quite biological in SEM images. Chemical garden experiments containing amino acids produce membranes as thin as 0. 5 microns, thinner than most chemical garden inorganic membranes reported in the literature. These results show that inorganic precipitation systems analogous to geological environments can produce self-assembling membranes that might have relevance to prebiotic processes at hydrothermal vents on early Earth and other worlds, and that organics can interact with minerals and affect their growth...|$|E

40|$|We have {{compared}} the AUREOL 3 (A 3) observations of auroral ion precipitation, particularly ion beams, {{with the results}} from the global kinetic model of magnetotail plasma of Ashour-Abdalla et al. (1993). We have identified 101 energetic keV H(+) velocity dispersed <b>precipitating</b> <b>ion</b> structures (VDIS) with fluxes above 10 (exp - 3) ergs. /sq cm. /s in the A 3 record between the end of 1981 and mid- 1984. These beams display a systematic increase in energy with increasing latitude and were observed in a narrow region within less than 1 deg in latitude of the polar cap boundary. The VDIS are the most distinctive feature in the auroral zone of the plasma sheet boundary layer. We report first on a statistical analysis of the possible ralationships between magnetic activity or substorm phase and the VDIS properties. Our particle simulations of the precipitating ions have been extended by using a series of modified versions of the Tsyganenko (1989) magnetic field model and by varying the cross-magnetosphere electric field. In the simulations, plasma from a mantle source is subject to strong nonlinear acceleration, forming beams which flow along the PSBL. Only 3 to 4 % of these beams precipitate into the ionosphere to form the VDIS while the majority return to the equatorial plane after mirroring and form the thermalized central plasma sheet. The final energy and the dispersion of the beams in the model depend on the amplitude of the cross-tail electric field. Two unsual observations of low-energy (less than 5 keV) O(+) VDIS, shifted by 4 deg 5 deg in invariant latitude equatorward of H(+) VDIS are analyzed in detail. The sparsity of such O(+) events and the absence of the changes in the flux and frequency of occurrence indicate a solar wind origin for the plasma. Finally, large-scale kinetic modeling, even with its simplifications and assumptions (e. g., static magnetic field, solar wind source), reproduces low-altitude auroral ion features fairly well; it may therefore be presented as an appropriate framework into which data on energization and transport of the hot plasma, obtained in the equatorial plane, could be inserted in the near future...|$|E

The movement of auroral zone activity to high latitudes followed the substorm sequence, at which time the inferred interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was strongly northward. Electron energy spectra indicative of a field-aligned potential drop, {{and the absence of}} supporting <b>precipitating</b> <b>ions,</b> are found at latitudes greater than 80 deg. The north-south symmetry of these observations suggests that the events are on closed field lines. It is noted the very strong northward IMF connected to the sunward tilted geomagnetic dipole field plays a role in the driving of strong Birkeland and ionospheric current systems in the northern polar regions, while eliminating them from the southern polar regions...|$|R

In general, nutrient solutions are {{looked at as}} static aqueous solutions of inorganic ions. The ions {{are supposed to be}} present as free ions. This assumption {{does not take into account}} the dissociation, complexation and precipitation reactions occurring in nutrient solutions and their dynamic equilibrium. All these reactions take place at the same time and interact with each other, affecting elemental speciation and bioavailability. In this research only speciation calculations are carried out. For a standard nutrient solution, containing Fe(HEDTA) as iron chelate, elemental speciation is calculated for a pH range from 2 to 9. For all anions present in the nutrient solutions, the formation of <b>precipitates,</b> <b>ion</b> pairs and soluble complexes as a function of pH are graphically represented...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} in XMM-Newton X-ray data of X-ray emission above 2 keV from Jupiter's aurorae has {{led us to}} reexamine the Chandra ACIS-S observations taken in Feb 2003. Chandra's superior spatial resolution has revealed that the auroral X-rays with E > 2 keV are emitted from {{the periphery of the}} region emitting those with E < 1 keV. We are presently exploring the relationship of this morphology to that of the FUV emission from the main auroral oval and the polar cap. The low energy emission has previously been established as due to charge exchange between energetic <b>precipitating</b> <b>ions</b> of oxygen and either sulfur or carbon. It seems likely to us that the higher energy emission is due to precipitation of energetic electrons, possibly the same population of electrons responsible for the FUV emission. We discuss our analysis and interpretation...|$|R
