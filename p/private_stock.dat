40|$|Using a {{differential}} game, we analyze {{a multiple}} agent economy {{in which there}} are common and <b>private</b> capital <b>stocks.</b> Each interest group can access the common capital and its own <b>private</b> capital <b>stocks</b> but not anyone else's <b>private</b> capital <b>stocks.</b> Considering the situation in which each interest group can observe and has interest in the opponents' <b>private</b> capital <b>stocks,</b> we show the following.

25|$|Prohibition {{developed}} as an unstoppable reform during the war, but Wilson played a minor role in its passage. A {{combination of the}} temperance movement, hatred of everything German (including beer and saloons), and activism by churches and women led to ratification of an amendment to achieve Prohibition in the United States. A Constitutional amendment passed both houses in December 1917 by 2/3 votes. By January 16, 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment had been ratified by 36 of the 48 states it needed. On October 28, 1919, Congress passed enabling legislation, the National Prohibition Act (informally known as the Volstead Act), to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment. Wilson felt Prohibition was unenforceable, but his veto of the Volstead Act was overridden by Congress. Prohibition began on January 16, 1920 (one year after ratification of the amendment); the manufacture, importation, sale, and transport of alcohol were prohibited, except for limited cases such as religious purposes (as with sacramental wine). But, the consumption of alcohol was never prohibited, and individuals could maintain a <b>private</b> <b>stock</b> that existed before Prohibition went into effect. Wilson moved his private supply of alcoholic beverages to the wine cellar of his Washington residence after his term of office ended.|$|E

No Kentucky senator had been re-elected {{to his seat}} in over forty years (though senators had been popularly elected only since 1914). His opposition to prohibition cost him the support of pro-temperance voters and Democratic governor William J. Fields. He was also opposed by the Ku Klux Klan, then a powerful organization in the state, because of his opposition to bigotry and secret organizations. His Republican opponent Frederic M. Sackett secured {{the support of the}} Beckham wing of the Democratic Party. Despite having his own <b>private</b> <b>stock</b> of liquor, Sackett took a pro-temperance position in the campaign and was endorsed by the Anti-Saloon League. Louisville Courier-Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham added his endorsement, calling Sackett [...] "one of the best men I know". In the general election, Stanley lost his seat by almost 25,000 votes. Sackett's victory meant Kentucky would have two Republican senators {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|E

30|$|For {{desirable}} and undesirable outputs, I used the real GRP (billion JPY) {{and the amount}} of CO 2 emissions associated with final energy consumption (thousand t-CO 2) consisting of the manufacturing, non-manufacturing, residential, and transportation sectors for the 46 prefectures, respectively. In economic theory, labor and <b>private</b> capital <b>stock</b> are important input factors for production activities. In addition, both buildings and roads emit CO 2 —the former as commercial buildings and factories in which production activities take place, and the latter via motor vehicle transportation activity—thereby impacting environmental efficiency. For the data on the accumulated quantity of buildings and roads, I make use of the estimates from Tanikawa et al. (2015). For the data on <b>private</b> capital <b>stock,</b> total number of workers, and real GRP, I use the R-JIP Database 2014 (Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry 2014). Real GRP and <b>private</b> capital <b>stock</b> are based on 2000 prices. Finally, data on CO 2 emissions associated with final energy consumption are obtained from data on the Energy Consumption Statistics (Agency for Natural Resources and Energy 2016). The study period covers the 17  years from 1992 to 2008. Monetary-base <b>private</b> capital <b>stock</b> data also include buildings such as factories and office buildings owned by companies. As such, it is possible that these will be double-counted in physical-base building data. However, data for facilities owned by private companies are included only in <b>private</b> capital <b>stock</b> data, and data for public facilities are included only in building-related accumulated resource stock data. Accordingly, {{it is not possible to}} analyze the environmental efficiency of urban production activities by taking only <b>private</b> capital <b>stock</b> into account. Given the difficulty in differentiating these factors, in this study, I treat the monetary-base <b>private</b> capital <b>stock</b> data and building-related physical-base accumulated resource stock data as separate items. Furthermore, to be able to analyze the environmental efficiency of production activities at the city but not the prefectural level, it is necessary to have more detailed production, CO 2 emission, and <b>private</b> capital <b>stock</b> data at the city level. Thus, I did not perform city-level analysis in this study because of the problems with data availability. These are limitations of the present study as well as challenges for future research.|$|R

40|$|Fluctuating {{prices for}} raw jute {{have been viewed}} as {{contributing}} to economic problems in the jute subsector. Price fluctuations were thought to reduce the jute farmers'welfare {{and there has been}} concern about the costs of parastatals'stocking operations in attempts to stabilize jute prices and incomes. The authors examine these fluctuations and analyze policies that might reduce them. They find that price fluctuations for raw jute reduce farmers'welfare only slightly because farmers'activities are typically diversified and jute's share in total income is small. Although stocking operations by the parastatals contribute to stability in prices and real income, they have been extremely costly and have crowded out <b>private</b> <b>stocking.</b> The authors contend that if the parastatals had refrained from ad hoc stocking and if the <b>private</b> sector had <b>stocked</b> efficiently, jute prices and incomes would have been just as stable - and at no cost. They argue that the Bangladeshi jute market should be free of government intervention and that a a market-based credit system that allows efficient stockholding behavior by the private sector should be established. They also found that improving the flow of market information to farmers and greater price responsiveness by jute mills to raw jute purchases would significantly improve the stability of raw jute prices and incomes. Having more information available would also make <b>private</b> <b>stocking</b> operations more efficient.
