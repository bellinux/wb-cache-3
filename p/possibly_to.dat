5|$|After Molly's father died, {{her family}} {{returned}} to Canajoharie. On September 9, 1753, Molly's mother married Brant Kanagaradunkwa, a Mohawk sachem of the Turtle clan. <b>Possibly</b> <b>to</b> reinforce their connection to Brant Kanagaradunkwa, {{who was a}} prominent leader, Molly and Joseph took their stepfather's name as a surname, which was unusual for that time.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's {{exterior}} {{became increasingly}} dilapidated; among those {{concerned about the}} church's deterioration was Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, {{who lived in a}} house across the street. In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. These projects were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, William {{continued}} his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, {{the charge is}} unknown.

5|$|The {{black stork}} breeds between April and May in the Northern Hemisphere, with eggs usually laid in late April. In {{southern}} Africa, breeding {{takes place in}} the months between September and March, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of abundant water prey rendered easier to catch as the rivers dry up and recede—from April and May in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa, and as late as July further south.|$|E
5|$|Though clearly {{related to}} the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the {{humpback}} is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the humpback is {{more closely related to}} certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to other rorquals such as the minke whales.|$|E

5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conjecture}} is {{that the}} breed is descended from the 89horses brought to the islands in 1526 by Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. His attempted colonization of San Miguel de Gualdape (near the Santee River in South Carolina) failed, forcing the colonists to move, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> North Carolina. Vázquez de Ayllón and about 450 of the original 600colonists subsequently {{died as a result}} of desertion, disease, and an early frost. Lacking effective leadership, the new settlement lasted for only two months; the survivors abandoned the colony and fled to Hispaniola, leaving their horses behind.|$|E

5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|As {{the oldest}} parts of Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of the mound, it is {{difficult}} to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman whose name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which {{is typical of the}} East Saxon dynasty. It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> protect the Wuffingas bloodline.|$|E

5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Ljotić's {{body was}} removed from the tomb in which it was buried. Two {{theories}} exist about what happened to it. One claims it was removed by Ljotić's followers and taken to an unknown location following the creation of the Free Territory of Trieste in 1947. The other theory holds that Ljotić was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici until the signing of the Treaty of Osimo in 1977, when his followers removed his body from the tomb in which it was buried and took it to an unknown location outside Yugoslavia, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> Italy.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{refusal to}} give the Dutch access to plans {{detailing}} {{the design of the}} Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a major problem. Inexperienced in designing an underwater protection scheme for a ship of this size, the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance, which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940. Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing technical drawings or the battleship , then under construction, <b>possibly</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret, they were allowed to visit , toured several shipyards, interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy, and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts, the ItaliansGermany's allyknowing some details of the ships.|$|E
