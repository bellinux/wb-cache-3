40|$|Using first-principles {{electronic}} structure calculations we identify the anion vacancies in II-VI and chalcopyrite Cu-III-VI 2 semiconductors {{as a class}} of intrinsic defects that can exhibit metastable behavior. Specifically, we predict <b>persistent</b> electron <b>photoconductivity</b> (n-type PPC) caused by the oxygen vacancy VO in n-ZnO, and <b>persistent</b> hole <b>photoconductivity</b> (p-type PPC) caused by the Se vacancy VSe in p-CuInSe 2 and p-CuGaSe 2. We find that VSe in the chalcopyrite materials is amphoteric having two "negative-U" like transitions, i. e. a double-donor transition e(2 +/ 0) close to the valence band and a double-acceptor transition e(0 / 2 -) closer to the conduction band. We introduce a classification scheme that distinguishes two types of defects (e. g., donors) : type-alpha, which have a defect-localized-state (DLS) in the gap, and type-beta, which have a resonant DLS within the host bands (e. g., conduction band). In the latter case, the introduced carriers (e. g., electrons) relax to the band edge where they can occupy a perturbed-host-state (PHS). Type alpha is non-conducting, whereas type beta is conducting. We identify the neutral anion vacancy as type-alpha and the doubly positively charged vacancy as type-beta. We suggest that illumination changes the charge state of the anion vacancy and leads to a crossover between alpha- and beta-type behavior, resulting in metastability and PPC. In CuInSe 2, the metastable behavior of VSe is carried over to the (VSe-VCu) complex, which we identify as the physical origin of PPC observed experimentally. We explain previous puzzling experimental results in ZnO and CuInSe 2 {{in the light of}} this model. Comment: submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{experimental}} evidence supporting that persistent {{behavior in the}} electronic and optical properties of bulk GaAs and AlGaAs can have different origins as: the metastability of a defect, the persistent charge transfer from a defect to another defect, and the transfer from a defect to the conduction band. In particular, we show three different cases in which defects are {{either directly or indirectly}} related to persistent changes of the optical absorption, the magnetic circular dichroism of the absorption (MCDA) and the photoconductivity (PC). The three cases are as follows: the transfer of EL 2 to the metastable state EL 2 (0 *) in semi-insulating (SI) GaAs causing persistent quenching of the absorption and <b>photoconductivity</b> (PPCQ); the <b>persistent</b> transfer of electrons from stable EL 2 (0) to arsenic vacancies in lightly n-type GaAs; and the correlated appearance of <b>persistent</b> MCDA and <b>photoconductivity</b> in AlGaAs due to the photoionization of DX-centers...|$|R

40|$|Aluminum {{antimony}} (AlSb) is {{an indirect}} band gap semiconductor with Eg of about 1. 62 eV at 300 K and about 1. 75 eV at 77 K. This material, {{is extremely difficult}} to obtain in single crystal form because of the very high reactivity of aluminum with oxygen, and the high volatility of antimony. Moreover, molten AlSb reacts with nearly all crucible materials available. Since Welker`s first attempts in 1952, only very few different experimental approaches have been used to grow single crystals of AlSb, e. g. by Bridgman, Czochralski and MBE. All experimental results, however, indicate that many of the properties of AlSb, e. g. carrier concentration, electron-hole mobility and carrier life-time, differ significantly from the theoretically predicted values. The main objective of this research period has been to develop a method leading to improved crystallographic and electronic quality of AlSb crystals, making them more suitable for device applications. The research program was aimed along the following two directions: (1) study the growth of AlSb via Bridgman, Czochralski and THM techniques; (2) comprehensive characterization of grown material, related to the use of compounds for high energy gamma detectors. Variables in the growth study were growth temperature, equilibrium pressure, growth rate, doping, crucible material, seeding and encapsulation.
