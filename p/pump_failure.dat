5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost <b>pump</b> <b>failure,</b> and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water <b>pump</b> <b>failure</b> and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced <b>pump</b> <b>failure</b> and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E

The second part of qualifying lasts for 15minutes and eliminates cars that finished in positions 11 to 16. The final part of qualifying determines the positions from first to tenth, and decides who starts the Grand Prix in pole position. Hamilton clinched his seventh career pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 1:26.714 in the third session.

In contrast to Massa's fourth place, his teammate, Räikkönen finished qualifying in 16th place. His Ferrari car suffered a fuel pump problem at the end of part one, with the Ferrari team unable to fix the problem before the second session. Räikkönen was not the only driver to suffer problems. Webber in the Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel in the Toro Rosso also suffered problems, with Webber spinning off in session two due to brake failure, leaving him down in 15th. Vettel was scheduled to be in the third session, but his Toro Rosso suffered oil <b>pump</b> <b>failure,</b> preventing him from setting a time in the session. Heidfeld, Trulli, Rosberg and Coulthard completed the top eight positions. Timo Glock in a Toyota finished qualifying in ninth position, however, he was demoted to 19th after being given two five-place grid penalties.

50|$|First, {{the late}} {{changes to the}} engine gave rise to design {{features}} that were questionable from an engineering perspective. For example, the water pump was set above the engine. If the engine became hot in traffic, coolant escaped from system via the expansion bottle and the overall fluid level then fell {{below the level of}} the pump. As well as preventing coolant from circulating, this also caused rapid <b>failure</b> of the <b>pump.</b> Even when the system was topped up again, the failed water pump would not circulate coolant and further overheating ensued. Water <b>pump</b> <b>failures</b> also occurred due to poorly hardened drive gears, which wore out prematurely and stopped the water pump.|$|R

50|$|The Jupiter, Thor, and Atlas {{missiles}} {{all used}} {{a variant of}} the Rocketdyne LR-79 engine and all three suffered launch failures due to a marginal turbopump design. There were two separate problems with the pumps. The first was the discovery during testing at Huntsville that the lubricant oil tended to foam at high altitude as the air pressure decreased. The other was that pump shaft vibration from the nearly 10,000 RPM operating speed would cause the bearings to come out of their sockets, resulting in the pump abruptly seizing up.
