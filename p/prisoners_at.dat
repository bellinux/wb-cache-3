5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of Louis XVI {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to the plan, and instead housed the <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able {{to escape from the}} makeshift prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E

5|$|German doctors {{performed}} {{a wide variety}} of experiments on <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.|$|E

He had {{received}} serious wounds following a booby-trap bomb detonating under his van on Hillsborough Drive, East Belfast 11 days earlier. The wounds he received from the bombing were directly responsible for the heart attack that killed him. The 'New' IRA claimed responsibility and said it was a response to the alleged mistreatment of republican <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> Maghaberry Prison. It added that the officer was targeted because he trained prison officers at Maghaberry.|$|E

5|$|After {{being forced}} out of his Yildirim Army Group {{headquarters}} at Nazareth {{on the morning of}} 20 September, Liman von Sanders drove via Tiberias to Samakh to organise the establishment of a strong rearguard at Samakh. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was ordered to move to Beisan from Afulah at 08:30 on 24 September and was subsequently ordered at 13:45 to advance to capture Samakh. This town was strategically important to both sides as it controlled a direct road to Damascus. On 25 September, the 11th Light Horse Regiment supported by part of the 12th Light Horse Regiment charged in the pre-dawn while the German and Australian machine–gunners conducted a firefight. After an hour-long battle the light horse forced the garrison to surrender, capturing 350 <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> the station and in the town, suffering 14 killed and 29 wounded.|$|E

Meanwhile, the bulk of Yilderim Army Group's records were being burned at the Monastery of Casa Nuova. The commander of 13th Cavalry Brigade requested {{the assistance of the}} 14th Cavalry Brigade through 5th Cavalry Division's headquarters at 06:50. He reported the 13th Cavalry Brigade had captured many prisoners and material but that Liman von Sanders had left the evening before. The 14th Cavalry Brigade (5th Cavalry Division) was unable to assist the attack on Nazareth.

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Turkish forces had been pushed out of the Sinai, and in January 1917, orders were given for the {{division}} to attack Rafa on the Egyptian–Palestine border. By dawn on 9 January, the regiment and division had reached the border, and the brigade manoeuvred to attack Rafa from the north-east. The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was moving around to the north of village, when the Turkish defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block the Turkish withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main Turkish defences.|$|E
5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{successful}} campaign in Extremadura, on 27 January 1811 Soult began his investment of Badajoz. Almost immediately the Spanish Army of Extremadura {{arrived in the}} vicinity with some 15,000 troops {{under the command of}} Gen. Mendizabal. Soult's army, too small to surround Badajoz, was unable to prevent 3,000 of Mendizabal's men from reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying the heights of San Cristóbal. This posed a major threat to the French, so Soult moved at once to engage. In the ensuing Battle of the Gebora the French inflicted 1,000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4,000 <b>prisoners,</b> <b>at</b> a cost to themselves of only 400 casualties. The remnants of Mendizabal's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal.|$|E

5|$|In 1760, British {{relations}} with the Cherokee, which had been moderately friendly for several decades, grew sour after several Cherokee chiefs were imprisoned and killed in South Carolina. In early 1760, the Cherokee laid siege to Fort Loudoun, a remote outpost {{in what is now}} Tennessee. The garrison held out until August of that year, but was forced to surrender due to lack of provisions. A relief column under Archibald Montgomerie failed to reach the fort after burning the Cherokee Lower Towns and being stopped at the Battle of Echoee. In spite of the garrison leaving the fort under a flag of truce, the Cherokee killed 22 of its members on their march home in retaliation for the colonists' earlier killing of 22 Cherokee held as <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> Fort Prince George (South Carolina).|$|E
5|$|Prison Break {{revolves}} around two brothers: {{one who has}} been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape, and the second season follows a massive manhunt chasing the group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to help each other. They struggle to escape from the police while avoiding a secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.|$|E
5|$|The Bastille {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a prison and a royal fortress under both Henry IV and his son, Louis XIII. When Henry clamped down on a Spanish-backed plot among the senior French nobility in 1602, for example, he detained the ringleader Charles Gontaut, the Duke of Biron, in the Bastille, and had him executed in the courtyard. Louis XIII's chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, is credited with beginning the modern transformation of the Bastille into a more formal organ of the French state, further increasing its structured use as a state prison. Richelieu broke with Henry IV's tradition of the Bastille's captain being a member of the French aristocracy, typically a Marshal of France such as François de Bassompierre, Charles d'Albert or Nicolas de L'Hospital, and instead appointed Père Joseph's brother to run the facility. The first surviving documentary records of <b>prisoners</b> <b>at</b> the Bastille also date from this period.|$|E
