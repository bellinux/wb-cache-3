Right hand and pen, now a common {{feathered}} quill, entirely repainted, but dexterously and with feeling. The hand was once slightly different in position, and held, most probably, a reed.|$|R
5000|$|Graduation : Although {{all members}} of the Ashley Hall family are invited, the faculty, staff, and all {{students}} in grades 9-12 are required to participate in graduation activities. Students must wear <b>pure</b> white <b>dresses</b> and shoes to the baccalaureate service and to graduation. Baccalaureate services are held in a local church, with graduation exercises on the terrace of the campus. Seniors also wear <b>pure</b> white <b>dresses.</b> In addition to her diploma, the school presents each senior a bouquet of red roses and pin that represents the past and future of each girl.|$|R
60|$|When Dolores came in {{next morning}} to say good-by, she found her mother's body cold and stiff upon the bed, in a <b>pure</b> white <b>dress,</b> with two crushed white roses just peeping from her bodice.|$|R

50|$|Mary {{allegedly}} {{appeared in}} luminous robes, in a <b>pure</b> white <b>dress</b> and a royal blue belt, with a crown on her head. Critics {{have pointed out}} that this colour pattern perfectly matches the colour pattern of the lights on top of and inside the tower behind the church's domes, i.e. a golden illuminated cross on top of the tower and blueish-white and yellowish-white electric light sources inside the tower.|$|R
2500|$|White is the {{traditional}} color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a [...] "sorceress" [...] in later books), wears a <b>pure</b> white <b>dress.</b> Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.|$|R
60|$|The shaded light showed Miss Keeldar's form but imperfectly; yet it {{revealed}} her in elegant attire. There {{was a party}} assembled below, including Sir Philip Nunnely; the ladies were now in the drawing-room, and their hostess had stolen from them to visit Henry's tutor. Her <b>pure</b> white <b>dress,</b> her fair arms and neck, the trembling chainlet of gold circling her throat and quivering on her breast, glistened strangely amid the obscurity of the sickroom. Her mien was chastened and pensive. She spoke gently.|$|R
50|$|Since the mid-1970s, only {{a handful}} of films with private detectives have been produced. These include I, the Jury, Angel Heart, Hollywood Harry, The Two Jakes, Devil in a Blue <b>Dress,</b> <b>Pure</b> Luck, Under Suspicion, Twilight with Paul Newman, and Ben Affleck's Gone Baby Gone.|$|R
5000|$|In the books, Glinda is {{depicted}} as {{a beautiful young woman}} with long, rich red hair and blue eyes, wearing a <b>pure</b> white <b>dress.</b> She is much older than her appearance would suggest, but [...] "knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived" [...] - a fact that is established in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, by the Soldier With Green Whiskers. She has ruled the Quadling Country ever since she overthrew the Wicked Witch of the South during the period when Ozma's grandfather was king of Oz.|$|R
60|$|There {{was present}} a younger {{sister of the}} bride, who had not only a tendency, but had already {{attained}} in an unusual degree, to the possession of embonpoint and was appropriately named Fatma. She wore the salma, a dazzling little golden cap, in token of being still unmarried. She seemed much captivated with little Agnes. No wonder, for, in the simplicity of a <b>pure</b> white <b>dress,</b> and with her fair curls streaming down her cheeks, unadorned save by one little blush rose, she looked like an ethereal spirit dropped into {{the midst of the}} garish party.|$|R
60|$|The clock struck nine {{as a girl}} just {{entering}} womanhood {{stopped on}} the corner waiting for the approaching car. She was hurrying as if homeward from employment or delay. Her eyes were clear and <b>pure,</b> she was <b>dressed</b> in simple white, she looked eagerly for the car and neither to the right nor the left.|$|R

5000|$|One {{of the big}} controversies in 2005 was the Fremont Arts Council {{excluding}} People Undergoing Real Experiences (PURE) (now {{known as}} <b>Pure</b> cirkus) from <b>dressing</b> [...] "up as pirates with two people suspended on a pirate ship float from hooks in their skin" [...] as they go through the parade. Much of the media noted that while the naked cyclists are tolerated and widely popular, this has become the new controversial area for the council.|$|R

30|$|Working {{in another}} area of sexual violence, Schult and Schneider (1991) {{conducted}} an experiment that varied victim rape history, sexual provocativeness (combining dress with context), and observer sex in perceptions of blame for sexual assault. In the low provocativeness condition, a woman wore sneakers, jeans, and a shirt and the rape occurred {{as she left the}} library. In the moderate provocativeness condition, the rape occurred as she left a bar, where she had been drinking, and she was dressed in a low cut dress. In the high provocativeness condition she had been dancing on a stage in a topless club, wore a g-string, high heels, and fishnet stockings, and the rape occurred as she left the club. Participants shifted blame from assailant to victim as sexual provocativeness increased. Here dress was confounded with victim behavior (dancing, drinking, studying at the library), so it is impossible to determine the <b>pure</b> effect of <b>dress.</b>|$|R
40|$|Luminescence {{properties}} of colloidal quantum dots have found applications in imaging, light-sources, and displays. Despite wide interest, several experimental observations from these quantum dots, {{such as the}} short lifetime {{on the scale of}} microseconds and a zero-longitudinal optical phonon line in low-temperature photoluminescence spectrum, remain unexplained by existing models. Here we propose a model including the effect of solid-state environment on luminescence by capturing coherent and incoherent interactions of band-edge exciton with phonon modes. Our model predicts the formation of dressed states by coupling of the exciton with a confined acoustic phonon mode, and explains the short lifetime and the presence of the zero-longitudinal optical phonon line in the spectrum. Accounting for the interaction of the exciton with bulk phonon modes, the model also explains the experimentally observed temperature-dependence of the photoluminescence decay dynamics and temperature-dependence of the photoluminescence spectrum.

5000|$|A {{new name}} {{called for a}} new style, and Leroux {{went back to the}} body, {{developing}} a new concept of made-to-measure jersey dresses created by hand in his own atelier. Utilizing the craft of traditional couture, the <b>pure</b> and graphic <b>dresses</b> are made infinitely modern with a unique construction that, despite being highly labor-intensive, effortlessly convey an air of sensual, inneffably chic and glamorous, body-conscious modernity. He is understandably dismissive of inexperienced designers labeling themselves as couturiers. “Remember that people {{need to learn how to}} sew before they can do anything,” he commented in an interview. Making women look beautiful, highlighting their features and diminishing their flaws, the brand boasts a large and primarily international private client base that's drawn to the subtlety of the work, “his ultra feminine, glamorous, inimitable style” and his transformative mastery of technique. His initial urge to be a sculptor eventually found its expression not in marble but in fabric, and an [...] "instinctive understanding of the female form". As Tim Blanks noted in Vogue, “Credit is due his mastery of the purest form. Balenciaga used to tell his clients that they didn't need a good body, because he could give them one. Leroux could make the same claim.” ...|$|R

In {{order to}} determine, whether medium affect the x-ray by aqueous-alcoholic resin {{solution}} and furthermore colloidal solutions of S, gold and platinum prepared {{and the behavior}} of the x-rays when passing these liquids compared to their behavior when passing a equivalent thick layer of pure water and in order to leave the opacity of the clouding substance unconsidered actually, the termination coil which contained the <b>pure</b> water, was <b>dressed</b> in compact substance {{in the way that the}} quantity latter the same was in colloidal condition in the applied liquid. The experiments ran in as much quite negatively as the applied cloudy medium that let the x-rays happen exactly just as easily as the water in compound with the membrane of compact substance; only the resin solution showed a small, but possibly coincidental difference in the permeability, but so, as if the cloudy medium would have been more transparent. One does not have to conclude from experiments that the x-rays do not change with the passage by cloudy medium, anyhow is weakened their effect on the photographic plate.

60|$|As Janet {{ran along}} the dark {{pavements}} {{the sound of the}} shot and of the woman's shriek continued to ring in her ears. At last she {{stopped in front of the}} warehouse beyond Mr. Tiernan's shop, staring at the darkened windows of the flat--of the front room in which her mother now slept alone. For a minute she stood looking at these windows, as though hypnotized by some message they conveyed--the answer to a question suggested by the incident that had aroused and terrified her. They drew her, as in a trance, across the street, she opened the glass-panelled door, remembering mechanically the trick it had of not quite closing, turned and pushed it to and climbed the stairs. In the diningroom the metal lamp, brightly polished, was burning as usual, its light falling on the chequered red table-cloth, on her father's empty chair, on that somewhat battered heirloom, the horsehair sofa. All was so familiar, and yet so amazingly unfamiliar, so silent! At this time Edward should be reading the Banner, her mother bustling in and out, setting the table for supper. But not a dish was set. The ticking of the ancient clock only served to intensify the silence. Janet entered, almost on tiptoe, made her way to the kitchen door, and looked in. The stove was polished, the pans bright upon the wall, and Hannah was seated in a corner, her hands folded across a spotless apron. Her scant hair was now <b>pure</b> white, her <b>dress</b> seemed to have fallen away from her wasted neck, which was like a trefoil column.|$|R
