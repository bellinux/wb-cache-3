The structure of the shield machine trains is analyzed and the 3 -D solid model of the carrier is built with Pro/E.

The results via ANSYS show that the max stress and strain on the carriers are increasing as the increasing load on it. The max stress is lying on the joint point of the carrier and planetary gear shaft because of the bending deformation of the shaft.

Compared to the former structure, {{new kind of}} structure has many advantages over that of the old structure. The hydraulic driving system in the traditional derrick car is: hydraulic motor drives a reducer, and then the reducer in turn drives a capstan. Another hydraulic driving system is: an axial piston motor and an internal cycloid pinwheel drive are applied, so that the reducer and the capstan are combined into one so that simplified the transmission system. In the third version, a hydraulic motor is applied, which can be considered as the combination of hydraulic motor with axial piston and the planetary reducer and then drives the capstan, so that simplified the transmission system as well.

40|$|AbstractA major {{drawback}} {{with the}} popular differential drive wheeled mobile robot (WMR) when autonomously navigating on smooth indoor surfaces is its inability to continuously maintain straight-line trajectories. The inherent weakness of its kinematic design leads to this severe dead reckoning error that inevitably accumulates over the distance traveled.

This paper proposes an innovative and robust drive train mechanical design called dual <b>planetary</b> <b>drive</b> (DPD) that will both drive a non-holonomic wheeled robot in straight lines effectively and more importantly, minimize systematic odometry error {{without the need for}} complex electronic feedback control systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this study, amagnetic {{planetary}} gear drive is proposed and its operating principle is introduced. The equationsof the geometrics andkinematics for thedrive are given. The equations {{of the magnetic}} induction intensity for the magnetic gear teeth are deduced. The equations of the torques between the {{planetary gear}}s and sun gear or crown gear are developed. The available parameters of the magnetic <b>planetary</b> <b>drive</b> are presented and the magnetic flux density distri-butions of the magnetic gear teeth are investigated. The torques between the planetary gears and sun gear or crown gear are analysed. When the relative rotating angle between the gears is increased, the magnetic torque grows, gets to a maximum value, and then drops. The maximum torque represents extreme load-carrying ability of the drive system. The pole pair number, the tooth thickness and the tooth width of the magnetic gears, and the speed ratio of the drive have obvious influence on the output torques. To obtain a large magnetic torque, a large tooth width of the gear, a proper pole pair number, a proper radial thickness of the tooth, a large planetary gear number, and a large speed ratio should be chosen...|$|E

Generally the gears with addenda modifications play a principal role in <b>planetary</b> gear <b>drive</b> of minor teeth difference to avoid teeth interference during the mesh, and this transmission implies cumbersome parameters calculations and brings up higher angle of engagement to affect the load capacity because of life weakening on carrier bearings involved. In fact, provided some certain promise, zero addenda modification (viz.

From investigating the relationships amongst the total teeth number of internal gear, difference of tooth number between internal and external gear, addendum coefficient and teeth profile interference criterion, the unique design characteristic about X–zero gear drive with minor teeth difference are outlined...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} analyze the static and dynamic loads in a {{planetary}} gear train was developed. A variable-variable mesh stiffness (VVMS) model was used to simulate the external and internal spur gear mesh behavior, and an equivalent conventional gear train concept was adapted for the dynamic studies. The analysis can be applied either involute or noninvolute spur gearing. By utilizing the equivalent gear train concept, the developed method may be extended for use {{for all types of}} epicyclic gearing. The method is incorporated into a computer program so that the static and dynamic behavior of individual components can be examined. Items considered in the analysis are: (1) static and dynamic load sharing among the planets; (2) floating or fixed Sun gear; (3) actual tooth geometry, including errors and modifications; (4) positioning errors of the planet gears; (5) torque variations due to noninvolute gear action. A mathematical model comprised of power source, load, and planetary transmission is used to determine the instantaneous loads to which the components are subjected. It considers fluctuating output torque, elastic behavior in the system, and loss of contact between gear teeth. The dynamic model has nine degrees of freedom resulting in a set of simultaneous second order differential equations with time varying coefficients, which are solved numerically. The computer program was used to determine the effect of manufacturing errors, damping and component stiffness, and transmitted load on dynamic behavior.
