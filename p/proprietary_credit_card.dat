40|$|Before {{introducing}} cash discounting {{in retail}} gasoline markets, major oil companies offered <b>proprietary</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> as an unpriced service to their customers. This paper analyzes {{the origins of}} cash discounting {{in order to determine}} why oil companies introduced explicit pricing of the credit service in 1982 only to begin discouraging it {{by the end of the}} decade. Sharp increases in nominal interest rates and in the real price of gasoline between 1978 - 1982 spurred a rapid rise in the cost of financing accounts receivable. This increasing cost in part drove the initial decision to discount. By 1990 the discounting trend reversed as the costs of processing credit transactions and of the float associated with non-revolving accounts receivable fell.

The expected improvement in performance has to come primarily from increasing sales revenue with the retailers' own private-label credit cards, from interest income and from reducing the amount of credit card receivables and the cost of financing them. We test the differences in corporate performance, primarily measured by the Economic Value Added (EVA), and the efficiency of the accounts receivable management, between firms with and without CCBs. We find no significant improvement in their performance. In addition, we document that retailers with CCBs have longer average collection periods and relatively more receivables than those without CCBs, and that there is no difference in the revenue growth rate between the two groups of retailers. accounts receivable; corporate performance; credit card banks; EVA; revenue management; economic value added; retailers; financial performance. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{have become}} a {{noticeable}} feature on most American households’ financial landscape. Data from the Bank for International Settlements indicate {{that the number of}} <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in circulation increased 34 percent between 1988 and 1994, and the number of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 55 percent. The data also show that the value of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 98 percent during the same period. The higher number of cards and their use increased the size of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, so that total consumer revolving credit outstanding grew from $ 175 billion to $ 339 billion. Unfortunately, aggregate data like those above fail to provide information about the composition of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth. So it is impossible to tell whether the increased debt arose from a general {{increase in the number of}} households or from a larger proportion of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Aggregate data also do not reveal who holds <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> balances—upper- or lower-income households—nor do they indicate which factor contributed more to the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt—an increase in the number of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> or an increase in average <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> indebtedness. Such detailed information about the components of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth is important because each component has different implications for the viability of the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt.
