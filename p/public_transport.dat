5|$|Along {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the light rail service, the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in Bergen underwent other changes. Skyss was established in 2007 to administer the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> system, manage routes and market <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> which would be operated by private companies based on public service obligations. At the same time, a new electronic ticketing system was introduced.|$|E
5|$|A report {{published}} by the city in 2007 declared the line a success and stated that all goals for the line had been exceeded. A {{survey conducted by the}} city in 2003 and 2007 showed that the Ring Line {{had a significant impact on}} the use of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in the area. Total <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> usage increased from 28 to 45%; use for commuting increased from 35 to 61%. At the Norwegian School of Management (BI), 85% of the students used <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> The Ring Line reduced the estimated number of daily car trips by 10,000, and generated 11,000 more daily <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> trips. In 2007, daily passenger numbers at the stations were 8420 for Nydalen, 3630 for Storo and 2300 at Sinsen. The line allowed travel time from the Nydalen and Storo to the city centre to be halved, and travel time from Nydalen to the city center is faster by metro than by taxi.|$|E

He added that the <b>Public</b> <b>Transport</b> Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> journeys.

5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> as they have failed to produce efficient <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> systems in Bergen.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{researches}} {{have proved}} {{the existence of}} a causal relationship between the concentration of jobs in a city and the income of inhabitants. Other researchers have studied the close and even nearly causal relationship between those variables and the degree of accessibility or of infrastructures like highways on different zones of a city. Nevertheless, no one research has taken into account the degree to which each area of a city benefits from the latest improvements of <b>public</b> <b>transports.</b> The aim of this research is to analyze the relationship between the size of labor market, the income and the employment concentration on different zones of a city with respect to the degree of improvements of <b>public</b> <b>transports</b> (Transmilenio) in a city of a developing country like Bogota. The degree of enhancements of <b>public</b> <b>transports</b> in a zone is suspected to be endogenous to those three variables. Through the use of OLS estimations and then 2 SLS estimations for each dependent variable (3), the validation of endogeneity gives enough tools to infer a positive or a negative causality of improvements of <b>public</b> <b>transports.</b> The size of companies defined by the number of jobs they offer plays a role of instrumental variable to explain the degree of improvement of <b>public</b> <b>transports</b> on each zone. It suggests three different scenarios that depend on the size of companies established on each zone. In essence, the number of jobs, the size of the labor market and the income are largely defined by the level of improvements of urban <b>public</b> <b>transports</b> on each zone {{of the city and the}} causality relationship changes depending on the size of companies established on each zone. Results of this empirical research give some robust evidences. In the case of Bogot 1, <b>public</b> <b>transports</b> improvements have a causality relationship on the income of inhabitants on each zone and on the number of jobs and it change with respect to the size of enterprises. In contrast, the size of labor market, defined as the number of reachable jobs on a specific time, is not a cause of the degree of the presence of <b>public</b> <b>transports?</b> enhancements...|$|R

5|$|On 1 July 2003, Oslo Sporveier was reorganized {{with the}} {{operation}} of the trams transferred to Oslo Sporvognsdrift ("Oslo Tram Operations") and {{the operation of}} the Metro to Oslo T-banedrift ("Oslo Metro Operations"). Another reorganization was made on 1 July 2006, when Oslo Sporveier was demerged into two companies. The Oslo <b>Public</b> <b>Transport</b> Administration, which kept the Oslo Sporveier brand name, was made responsible for purchasing and the marketing of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> system. The ownership and maintenance of the tracks and stations was transferred to Kollektivtransportproduksjon ("Public Transport Production"). The latter also became the parent of the operating companies, who retained the actual running of the trams and metro trains. The brand name Oslo Sporveier was discontinued on 1 January 2008, when Ruter was created as a merger between the Oslo <b>Public</b> <b>Transport</b> Administration and Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk ("Greater Oslo Local Traffic")—which had been responsible for <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in Akershus.|$|E

5|$|<b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> {{services}} in Greater Manchester are co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), a public body with powers between {{those of a}} passenger transport executive and Transport for London, established as SELNEC PTE in 1969 {{in accordance with the}} Transport Act 1968. The original SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive was renamed as the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) when taken over by the Greater Manchester County Council on 1 April 1974 to co-ordinate <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> modes within the new county. The council had overall responsibility for strategic planning and all policy decisions covering <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> (such as bus and rail services) and highways. GMPTE's purpose was to secure the provision of a completely integrated and efficient system of passenger transport for Greater Manchester on behalf of the county council. In 1977, it was noted as the largest authority for <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in the United Kingdom after London Transport. GMPTE was renamed as Transport for Greater Manchester in April 2011 when it became a functional body of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and obtained powers additional to those of a regular passenger transport executive from central government.|$|E

5|$|The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act.

In addition, the Act creates VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the State's rail network.
