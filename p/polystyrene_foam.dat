40|$|<b>Polystyrene</b> <b>foams</b> with closed {{cells were}} {{prepared}} using supercritical CO 2 as the blowing agent. On the other hand, <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foams</b> with open cells were prepared via temperature induced phase separation, namely by the spinodal decomposition. In both cases, we systematically studied {{the influence of}} the foaming conditions (focusing especially on nucleation and coalescence) on the final foam morphology. The influence of solvent residua on foaming was discussed in. By carefully optimizing the foaming conditions we prepared foams with an average cell size below 1 μm. Furthermore, we studied the heat insulation properties of the prepared foams and compared them with the results of heat transport simulation in foams...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{innovative}} materials as energy absorbers for motorbike helmets {{might have a}} significant impact in the safety of motorbike riders, currently among the most vulnerable road users. In this regard, the effect of the interaction between aluminium honeycombs and polymeric foams in the design {{of innovative}} liners is investigated by studying their behaviour under compressive loading conditions. Quasi-static and impact compressive loadings were applied to samples of twolayered structures made of aluminium honeycombs and expanded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foams,</b> in order to observe their deformation modes, determine their energy absorption properties and the influence of the loading speed in their mechanical response. The same tests were performed on the expanded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foams</b> and on the honeycomb layers separately. The results were compared and it was shown that although aluminium honeycombs alone offer the highest energy absorption levels, their coupling with EPS foams is preferred {{for the protection of the}} head...|$|R

25|$|Restricting {{the use of}} <b>foamed</b> <b>polystyrene</b> takeout food {{packaging}} is a priority of many solid waste environmental organisations.

25|$|Evaporative-pattern casting {{is a type}} {{of casting}} process that uses a pattern made from a {{material}} that will evaporate when the molten metal is poured into the molding cavity. The most common evaporative-pattern material used is <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam.</b>|$|E

25|$|Full-mold casting is an evaporative-pattern {{casting process}} {{which is a}} {{combination}} of sand casting and lost-foam casting. It uses an expanded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> pattern which is then surrounded by sand, much like sand casting. The metal is then poured directly into the mold, which vaporizes the foam upon contact.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polystyrene</b> <b>foams</b> are {{produced}} using blowing agents that form bubbles {{and expand the}} <b>foam.</b> In expanded <b>polystyrene,</b> these are usually hydrocarbons such as pentane, which may pose a flammability hazard in manufacturing or storage of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact.

25|$|In 1987, Berkeley, California banned CFC food containers. The {{following}} year, Suffolk County, New York {{became the}} first U.S. locality to ban polystyrene. However, legal challenges by the Society of the Plastics Industry kept it from going into effect until at last it was delayed when the Republican and Conservative parties became {{a majority of the}} county legislature. In the meantime, Berkeley {{became the first}} city to ban all foam food containers. As of 2006, about one hundred localities in the United States including Portland, Oregon and San Francisco currently have some sort of ban on <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> in restaurants. For instance, in 2007 Oakland, California required restaurants to switch to disposable food containers that will biodegrade if added to food compost. In 2013, San Jose became reportedly the largest city in the country to ban <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> food containers. Some communities have implemented wide polystyrene bans, such as Freeport, Maine, which did so in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet light {{irradiation}} (UV, from a germicidal lamp) {{is useful for}} sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to visible light absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of biological safety cabinets between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, {{so that it is}} very difficult to remove). It also damages some plastics, such as <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> if exposed for prolonged periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene foams {{are good}} thermal {{insulators}} {{and are therefore}} often used as building insulation materials, such as in insulating concrete forms and structural insulated panel building systems. Grey <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam,</b> incorporating graphite has superior insulation properties. They are also used for non-weight-bearing architectural structures (such as ornamental pillars). PS foams also exhibit good damping properties, therefore it is used widely in packaging. The trademark Styrofoam by Dow Chemical Company is informally used (mainly US & Canada) for all foamed polystyrene products, although strictly it should only be used for 'extruded closed-cell' polystyrene foams made by Dow Chemicals.|$|E

25|$|Since 2001, {{expanded}} polypropylene (EPP) foams {{have been}} gaining in popularity and in application as a structural material in hobbyist radio control model aircraft. Unlike expanded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> (EPS) which is friable and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam {{is able to}} absorb kinetic impacts very well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in {{a short amount of}} time. In consequence, a radio-control model whose wings and fuselage are constructed from EPP foam is extremely resilient, and able to absorb impacts that would result in complete destruction of models made from lighter traditional materials, such as balsa or even EPS foams.|$|E
25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam,</b> which {{can be done by}} many {{different}} ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|E
25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam,</b> it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. Currently, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK.|$|E

500|$|A {{radiative}} air well {{is designed}} to cool a substrate by radiating heat to the night sky. The substrate has a low mass so that it cannot hold onto heat, and it is thermally isolated from any mass, including the ground. A typical radiative collector presents a condensing surface at an angle of 30° from the horizontal. The condensing surface is backed by {{a thick layer of}} insulating material such as <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> and supported [...] above ground level. Such condensers may be conveniently installed on the ridge roofs of low buildings or supported by a simple frame. Although other heights do not typically work quite so well, it may be less expensive or more convenient to mount a collector near to ground level or on a two-story building.|$|E
