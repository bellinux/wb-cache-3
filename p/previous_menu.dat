The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on <b>previous</b> <b>menu</b> items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. Pétrus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.|$|E

5000|$|The hotel's regulars {{were not}} happy with the {{restaurant}} upon opening. In Ramsay's autobiography Playing with Fire, he attributed this to the restaurant being fully booked and the former clientele were unable to simply arrive at the restaurant and expect to be seated as well as improvements to the <b>previous</b> <b>menu.</b> Restaurant critics who attended the restaurant shortly after opening gave it mixed reviews.

[...] His most important innovation, however, was adding stock quotations, women's pages, and sports coverage to the <b>previous</b> <b>menu</b> of political, national and foreign news, creating a prototype of a modern, family newspaper.

The c200 GUI is nearly identical {{to that of the}} Sansa e200 series, and uses most of the same icons. The control layout of the c200 is made up of a keypad {{on the right side of}} the player, a volume rocker on top, and record and hold switches on the bottom. The up and down buttons on the keypad allow the user to scroll through menus as one might expect, the square button in the center of the keypad is used to select menu items and the left button returns to the <b>previous</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In late 2008, Romano's Macaroni Grill was {{suffering}} declines in sales, profits, and {{market share of}} the casual dining industry, and hired Blum as its CEO. He oversaw a turnaround in the same-restaurant sales from an annual loss of 11% to a 3% profit. Macaroni Grill's change in fortunes was partially based on a complete revamp the chain's menu, reorienting its cooking style on a more Mediterranean method of preparing and cooking food. In the first fifteen months, the changes to the menu not only improved {{the quality of the}} chain's products but also lowered its production costs. The caloric content of the products was reduced by 49% from the <b>previous</b> <b>menu,</b> along with a 59% reduction in fat and a 46% reduction in sodium. Blum's name for the change was called [...] "Quality up, Costs down." [...] As a result of these menu improvements, customer satisfaction rate for the chain grew. In May 2010, Nation's Restaurant News named Blum the Menu Master's Innovator of the Year in the restaurant industry for his accomplishments at Macaroni Grill.|$|E

5000|$|Burger King's menu has {{expanded}} from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes {{to a larger}} and more diverse set of products. In 1957, the [...] "Whopper" [...] became the first major addition to the menu, {{and it has become}} Burger King's signature product since. Conversely, BK has introduced many products, which failed to catch hold in the marketplace. Some of these failures in the United States have seen success in foreign markets, where BK has also tailored its menu for regional tastes. From 2002 to 2010, Burger King aggressively targeted the 18-34 male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. This tactic would eventually damage the company's financial underpinnings, and cast a negative pall on its earnings. Beginning in 2011, the company began to move away from its <b>previous</b> male-oriented <b>menu</b> and introduce new menu items, product reformulations and packaging, as part of its current owner 3G Capital's restructuring plans of the company.|$|R

In this paper, we examine this discrepancy {{through the use of}} a computational model of information navigation that simulates users navigating through a Web site. By varying the quality of the link labels in our simulations, we find that the optimal structure depends on the quality of the labels and are thus able to account for the results in the previous studies. We present additional empirical results to further validate the model and corroborate our findings. Finally we discuss our findings' implications for the information architecture of Web sites...|$|R

40|$|Menu {{systems have}} been key {{components}} in modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs), {{and there has been}} a lot of research about menu design. Review of <b>previous</b> <b>menu</b> design studies for human-computer interaction suggests that menu design guidelines for computers and mobile phones need to be reappraised, especially with regard to the use of 3 D interfaces in cell phones. ^ The main objective of this dissertation is to propose an overall framework for 3 D menu interfaces in cell phones. The second objective is to propose guidelines for 3 D menu design in cell phones. Four main factors that influence the performance of menu retrieval tasks in cell phones are included in the proposed model: presentation type, number of items, task complexity, and menu type. For these purposes, three experiments were conducted to determine which of three types of 3 D menus is best, which of two types of 2 D menu is better than the other, and conditions under which the best 3 D menu is better than a 2 D menu. ^ Experiment 1 used a nested factorial design with an iPhone simulator to investigate which of three 3 D menus (collapsible cylindrical trees, carousel, or revolving stage) are most applicable for small displays. Performance was best with the revolving stage menu, and there was a non-significant tendency for it to be rated as preferred by the participants. ^ In Experiment 2, an iPhone was used to determine which of two types of 2 D menu is better and a nested factorial design was used as well. Even though the differences were not significant, an overview menu tended to show better performance and preference scores than a text menu that required scrolling. The overview menu was chosen for Experiment 3 as the control alternative for comparison with the 3 D menu because it provides alphabetical icons as 3 D menus do. ^ Lastly, Experiment 3 used a nested factorial design with an iPhone to investigate when the revolving stage menu is better than the overview menu. The 3 D menu was preferred by users at high breadth levels, and the 2 D menu showed better performance than the 3 D menu with low task complexity. ^ From the experimental outcomes, a theoretically based link among the four components of cell phone menu design was identified. Furthermore, theoretically and practically based guidelines for the design of menus for small displays were developed. ...|$|E

40|$|A marking menu is {{designed}} to allow a user to perform a menu selection by either popping-up a radial (or pie) menu, or by making a straight mark {{in the direction of}} the desired menu item without popping-up the <b>menu.</b> <b>Previous</b> evaluations in laboratory settings have shown the potential of marking menus. This paper reports on a case study of user behavior with marking menus in a real work situation. The study demonstrates the following: First, marking menus are used as designed. When users become expert with the menus, marks are used extensively. However, the transition to using marks is not one way. Expert users still switch back to menus to refresh their memory of menu layout. Second, marking is an extremely efficient interaction technique. Using a mark on average was 3. 5 times faster than selection using the menu. Finally, design principles can be followed that make menu item/mark associations easier to learn, and interaction efficient...|$|R

However, after some time the promotional style changed to a box style, where the 'Parliament' name was shown below a BBC logo and contained inside a box of a deep red colour to match BBC News 24 at the time. This box would remain present throughout the promotion in the bottom left corner of the screen. Programme menus were frequently used and originally consisted with the same styling as <b>previous,</b> with the <b>menu</b> moved towards {{the centre of the}} screen. However, this was later changed so that the programme names were located in a shaded box and that the date was made smaller and located in a red bar running across the upper screen. Often, pictures representing the titles of the programmes were used as inserts against the spiral background as 'Next' graphics. The channel font was originally Gill Sans, as used previously, however some elements of the channel began to use different fonts, such as Arial - mainly for aston graphics and menus; the logo and promotion font remained Gill Sans.|$|R
