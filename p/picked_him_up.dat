5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep.

5|$|Due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Anderson went to Europe to play hockey. He {{played with}} the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany and the Lukko Rauma of the SM-liiga in Finland, {{as well as the}} Canadian National Team. After the {{lock-out}} was resolved, Anderson {{signed as a free agent}} with the St. Louis Blues and played 42 regular season and playoff games combined. At the end of the season, Anderson did not re-sign with the Blues. After playing part of the next season with Augsburger and the National Team again, Anderson signed with the Canucks as a free agent. His reasons for joining the team were because of former Oiler teammate Esa Tikkanen already playing there, and a desire to finish his career in his hometown. However, Anderson never played for the Canucks as the Oilers <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> on re-entry waivers. Anderson expressed his disappointment at these turn of events, as he wanted to play in Vancouver instead. He spent 17 games with the Oilers, before being put on waivers that same season. The Blues claimed him, and he spent his last days in the NHL with them. The 1996–97 season saw Anderson return to Europe and play with HC La Chaux-de-Fonds of the National League A in Switzerland and with Bolzano HC of the Alpenliga in Italy.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{was drafted}} by the Minnesota Vikings {{in the third round}} of the 1993 NFL Draft (79th overall pick), but was waived during the final roster cutdowns on August 30, 1993 in his first {{training}} camp due to his weight. He was listed at 315 in college, but showed up to Vikings camp at a hefty 355. But the Packers, desperate then for defensive linemen, <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> on August 31. Brown played in just two games that season while he worked off some of his weight in practice. In 1994, he played but his season was cut short with a torn Anterior cruciate ligament.

25|$|Born in Grimsby, England to {{a family}} of fishermen, Hills grew up sailing the bleak and {{turbulent}} North Sea. In 1940 he enrolled as a cadet in nautical school and joined the British Merchant Navy during World War II. At sea, Hills had several life and death experiences that formed his views on karma, divinity and destiny. On one occasion a rogue wave swept him off the deck hundreds of yards (metres) away from the vessel, but another wave <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and threw him back onto the ship, cutting open his forehead but saving him from freezing to death. As German U-boats sank 2,828 merchant ships, he watched tanker crew colleagues incinerated in the flaming oil-slicked Atlantic.

25|$|Clayton Kershaw had a rare poor {{performance}} in the opener of a road series against the Colorado Rockies. He allowed 5 runs and a career-high 11 hits, but the Dodger offense <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and the team continued winning, 10-8. Ricky Nolasco won his sixth straight decision, 7-4, on September 3 as Nick Punto had four hits and Carl Crawford had three hits and two RBI. The Dodgers dropped the series finale to the Rockies, 7-5, thanks to a poor first Dodger start by Edison Volquez, who allowed four runs in four innings of work. The Dodgers next traveled to Great American Ball Park to begin a weekend series with the Cincinnati Reds. Chris Capuano left {{the game in the}} second inning with a groin strain and the Reds won 3-2. A walk-off single by Todd Frazier in the 10th inning gave the Reds a 4-3 victory on September 7, sending the Dodgers to their first three-game losing streak since June 8–10. The Reds completed the sweep, 3-2, thanks to two home runs by Jay Bruce and a walk-off double by Ryan Hanigan.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1799, Racoon recaptured the West Indiaman Benjamin and Elizabeth, {{which had}} been sailing from Grenada to London, and which two French {{privateer}}s had just captured. Benjamin and Elizabeth was about four leagues off Dungeness during a foggy night, when two French privateer luggers came up and boarded her. The captain, mate, and two seaman resisted but were overwhelmed. The privateers threw the captain overboard, though he was already severely wounded. One lugger <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> The privateers also shot the mate and one seaman at point-blank range after they were already wounded and had surrendered (both were expected to survive). Racoon, {{which had been}} escorting the West India convoy, heard the shooting and came up after the privateer vessels had left. She was able to recapture Benjamin and Elizabeth within minutes. Shortly afterwards the fog cleared slightly and Racoon saw the privateers, {{one of which was}} about 3-400 yards away. Racoon immediately fired a broadside, and when the smoke cleared, the lugger had disappeared completely, apparently sunk. The second privateer disappeared as the fog came back in.|$|E

Shortly before noon on 24 May 1962, Carpenter splashed down in Aurora 7 several hundred miles from Intrepid. Minutes after he was located by land-based search aircraft, two helicopters from Intrepid, carrying NASA officials, medical experts, Navy frogmen, and photographers, were airborne and headed to the rescue. One of the choppers <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> over an hour later and flew him to the carrier which safely returned him to the United States. Intrepid spent the summer of 1962 training midshipmen at sea, and received a thorough overhaul at Norfolk in the fall.|$|E
25|$|But the Hollywood {{informant}} {{network was}} in shambles, mainly due to Howard Rushmore's courtroom revelations. Characteristically of Harrison, he bore no ill will toward Rushmore, who by 1957 {{was reduced to}} writing occasional articles on hunting for outdoors magazines. In December 1957, Rushmore chased his wife Frances and teenaged step-daughter Lynn out of their Manhattan home with a shotgun. While Frances was under psychiatric care since the East River incident, Howard himself was now under psychiatric care. On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, the Rushmores met in a final attempt at a reconciliation inside the lobby of their apartment building. An argument broke out between the couple and Frances left and hailed a taxi. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, the cab raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th. Suddenly, three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot {{his wife in the}} right side of the head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself. Harrison himself heard about the murder-suicide when a taxicab <b>picked</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> at Idlewild Airport. The driver told Harrison that the publisher of Confidential just killed himself and his wife, momentarily confusing the unmarried Harrison. Later Harrison refused to believe the suicide narrative and thought Howard Rushmore was murdered. He remained loyal to Rushmore even after the California trial and the Rushmores' scandalous deaths.|$|E
