5|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{alternative}} rock remained mainly {{an underground}} phenomenon. While on occasion a song {{would become a}} commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, fanzines, and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In {{the case of the}} United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes {{in various parts of the}} country. Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success. By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> featuring New Order, Public Image Limited and The Sugarcubes toured the United States arena circuit.|$|E

Tourism and Hospitality ManagementThe {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} tourists' preferences of the content of <b>packaged</b> <b>tours</b> in the Mahikeng area. <b>Packaged</b> <b>tours</b> are designed without really knowing whether such tours will be purchased. The preferences of tourists differ in terms of all the components of tourism incorporated into <b>packaged</b> <b>tours.</b> Preferences can be influenced by the reasons of travelling. Tour operators play a significant role in designing and selling tourism packages. It is therefore crucial for them to recognise the preferences of current and potential customers.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify important selection factors for all-inclusive <b>package</b> <b>tours</b> as perceived by outbound tourists-residents normally in Hong Kong. A total of 30 selection criteria were identified in this study, with the safety of the tour being viewed as the most important item for <b>package</b> <b>tours</b> selection, followed by the possibility of departing successfully and the service quality offered by the travel agency. By using factor analysis, eight dimensions for <b>package</b> <b>tours</b> selection were derived, namely, tour arrangement and service quality, attractions, hotels and airlines, TV promotions and customer care, routing, personal interests, word-of-mouth, and time. Results of independent sample t -test and one-way ANOVA revealed that travel-related behaviors were significantly related to the choice of all-inclusive <b>package</b> <b>tours.</b> Recommendations for travel agencies, included safety and 'guarantees' of departure, training for escorts and tour-guides, and customer care services, will, it is argued, enhance the attractiveness of <b>package</b> <b>tours</b> and their competitiveness.

25|$|Ultimately, BIA's {{inability}} {{to become part}} of a bigger, financially stronger organisation, the deep recession in the UK during the early 1990s, as well as the escalating jet fuel price and the collapse of the <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> market {{in the run-up to the}} first Gulf War during the summer of 1990 resulted in a 38% reduction in its passenger traffic (compared with the same period the year before) and were the main factors that forced the reconstituted BIA to cease all operations on 9 February 1991.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to supplying various <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> operators, including Thomas Cook, International Leisure Group (ILG) and Owners Abroad, with whole-plane charter seats, the reconstituted airline was also contracted by other airlines {{to provide the}} aircraft to operate part of their multi-leg scheduled services, including Air Florida during the early 1980s and Virgin Atlantic during the mid-80s.

25|$|During late-1988 and early-1989 intense {{negotiations}} exploring BIA's sale to ILG {{were held}} over several weeks. At that time ILG sought {{to take control}} of BIA because of the airline's slots at an increasingly congested Gatwick as well as {{the fact that it was}} a major supplier of ILG's charter capacity. BIA's Gatwick slots were required to enable fellow Gatwick-based Air Europe, ILG's rapidly expanding airline subsidiary, to build a major scheduled presence at that airport. Furthermore, ILG's ownership of BIA would have given the ILG-owned <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> operators, notably Intasun, a greater degree of control over their charter airline seat inventory. In addition, BIA's scheduled route licences to serve Sicily and other niche market destinations in Southern Italy from Gatwick could have potentially aided Air Europe's efforts to further expand the reach of its scheduled route network. However, both parties were unable to reach a firm deal that would have resulted in ILG's acquisition of BIA.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2013, Target Field {{has hosted}} every summer the Skyline Music Festival, named so because its seating, {{with only the}} seats around third base in an Amphitheatre-like manner, allows for {{extensive}} views of the Minneapolis skyline. The inaugural edition was held on July 26, 2013, featuring three of four bands in a <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> – Soul Asylum, Matthew Sweet and Big Head Todd and the Monsters, each of whom played one of their past albums in their entirety – along with Minnesota band Gear Daddies. The 6,752 tickets allowed by the section were sold out. The following edition was extended to two nights. August 8 featured an indie rock night sponsored by KCMP, featuring Andrew Bird, The New Pornographers, Thao and the Get Down Stay Down, S. Carey and Dosh. The following night was headlined by Melissa Etheridge, accompanied by the returning Gear Daddies, along with The Honeydogs, O.A.R. and The Rembrandts.

Osbourne then made public the bet with Bruce about Insane Clown Posse's next album, also stating that the duo would be subsequently dropped from their distributor. In Osbourne's words, [...] "You're dead. Your career is over." [...] Bruce predicted that the group's next album would sell at least 500,000 copies; however, the bet officially stood at 200,000 copies as agreed by both Bruce and Osbourne backstage.|$|E

500|$|Now a band {{in their}} own right, the Nice {{expanded}} their gear, recruiting roadies Bazz Ward and Lemmy, the latter of whom provided Emerson with a Hitler Youth ceremonial dagger to stick into the keys on his Hammond organ. They spent the end of 1967 on a <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> with Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Move and Amen Corner. Pink Floyd's then leader, Syd Barrett, missed several gigs and O'List had to stand in for him. The group's first album was recorded throughout the autumn of 1967, and in October of that year they recorded their first session for John Peel's radio show Top Gear. The album included classical and jazz influences including extracts from Leoš Janáček's Sinfonietta and a rearrangement of Dave Brubeck's [...] "Blue Rondo a la Turk" [...] renamed as [...] "Rondo", changing the time signature from the original 9/8 to 4/4 in the process. The group clashed with producer Oldham in the studio over {{the length of the}} track, but eventually won the argument; the full eight-minute piece was included on the album. After the album was released, the group realised that Oldham had a conflict of interest as manager and record company owner, so they recruited sports journalist Tony Stratton-Smith to take over management duties.|$|E

500|$|By 1966, Ready Steady Go! had ended, the mod {{movement}} was becoming unfashionable, and the Who {{found themselves in}} competition on the London circuit with groups including Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and arranged a deal with promoter Frank Barsalona for a short <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> in New York. The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received, and led to their first major US appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the hippie movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand {{in sharp contrast to}} the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act, and the pair argued about who should go on stage first, with the Who winning the argument. The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full Marshall stack. According to biographer Tony Fletcher, Hendrix sounded [...] "so much better than the Who it was embarrassing". The Who's appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and [...] "Happy Jack" [...] reached the top 30.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long <b>package</b> <b>tour</b> for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E
