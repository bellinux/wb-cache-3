2500|$|In {{semiconductor}} detectors, {{an electric}} field {{is applied to}} the detector volume. An electron in the semiconductor is fixed in its valence band in the crystal until a gamma ray interaction provides the electron enough energy to move to the conduction band. [...] Electrons in the conduction band can respond to the electric field in the detector, and therefore move to the <b>positive</b> <b>contact</b> that is creating the electrical field. The gap created by the moving electron is called a [...] "hole," [...] and is filled by an adjacent electron. This shuffling of holes effectively moves a positive charge to the negative contact. The arrival of the electron at the <b>positive</b> <b>contact</b> and the hole at the negative contact produces the electrical signal that is sent to the preamplifier, the MCA, and on through the system for analysis. The movement of electrons and holes in a solid-state detector is very similar to the movement of ions within the sensitive volume of gas-filled detectors such as ionization chambers.|$|E
2500|$|To achieve {{launching}} and {{recovery from the}} airship in flight, a 'skyhook' system was developed. The Sparrowhawk had a hook mounted above its top wing that attached to the cross-bar of a trapeze mounted on the carrier airship. For launching, the biplane's hook was engaged on the trapeze inside the airship's (internal) hangar, the trapeze was lowered clear of the hull into the (moving) airship's slipstream and, engine running, the Sparrowhawk would then disengage its hook and fall away from the airship. For recovery, the biplane would fly underneath its mother ship, until beneath the trapeze, climb up from below, and hook onto the cross-bar. The width of the trapeze cross-bar allowed a certain lateral lee-way in approach, the biplane's hook mounting had a guide rail to provide protection for the turning propeller (see photo), and engagement of the hook was automatic on <b>positive</b> <b>contact</b> between hook and trapeze. More than one attempt {{might have to be}} made before a successful engagement was achieved, for example in gusty conditions. Once the Sparrowhawk was securely caught, it could then be hoisted by the trapeze back within the airship's hull, the engine being cut as it passed the hangar door. Although seemingly a tricky maneuver, pilots soon learned the technique and it was described as being much easier than landing on a moving, pitching and rolling aircraft carrier. Almost inevitably, the pilots soon acquired the epithet [...] "The men on the Flying Trapeze" [...] and their aircraft were decorated with appropriate unit emblems.|$|E

60|$|The reader may perhaps {{choose to}} assign an actual {{locality}} to the imaginary events of this narrative. If permitted by the historical connection,--which, though slight, {{was essential to}} his plan,--the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature. Not to speak of other objections, it exposes the romance to an inflexible and exceedingly dangerous species of criticism, by bringing his fancy-pictures almost into <b>positive</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the realities of}} the moment. It has been no part of his object, however, to describe local manners, nor in any way to meddle with the characteristics of a community for whom he cherishes a proper respect and a natural regard. He trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending by laying out a street that infringes upon nobody's private rights, and appropriating a lot of land which had no visible owner, and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air. The personages of the tale--though they give themselves out to be of ancient stability and considerable prominence--are really of the author's own making, or at all events, of his own mixing; their virtues can shed no lustre, nor their defects redound, in the remotest degree, to the discredit of the venerable town of which they profess to be inhabitants. He would be glad, therefore, if-especially in the quarter to which he alludes-the book may be read strictly as a Romance, having a great deal {{more to do with the}} clouds overhead than with any portion of the actual soil of the County of Essex.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} anxiety one feels {{in such an}} {{instance}} is hypothesized to vary according {{to a variety of}} personal factors. Negative prior relations between groups predict more intergroup anxiety, and one's own experiences with individual members of the outgroup can affect anxiety about interaction with others from the group (often more salient if they are negative). Negative evaluations of outgroups often incorrectly stem from personal interactions due to a generalization from interpersonal contact to intergroup contact. The subsequent lack of <b>positive</b> <b>contact</b> results in negative expectancies of upcoming intergroup contact, leading to anxiety, heightened hostility, and a desire to avoid this contact.

40|$|This work {{consists}} of two collaborative research projects between INRA (France) and MTT (Finland) that examine the influence of group management on young cattle. The first work investigated whether pair versus individual housing of calves reduces their chronic stress reactions and whether <b>positive</b> <b>contacts</b> with humans could partly compensate {{for a lack of}} contact with conspecifics. In the second work, pair-housed heifers were either repeatedly regrouped or kept with their familiar peer. The consequences of repeated regrouping on heifers' social behaviour, emotional reactivity, physiology and production were analysed. Calves housed in pairs seem less stressed than calves housed individually, and regular <b>positive</b> <b>contacts</b> with a stockperson can not compensate for the lack of social partners. Pair-housed calves are less ready than their individually housed counterparts to approach humans. However, <b>positive</b> <b>contacts</b> with the stockperson make calves less fearful of people and improve handling both in the individual and pair-housing. Heifers housed in pairs and repeatedly regrouped are more aggressive between each other than heifers kept with the same penmate. However, repeated regrouping lowers heifers' behavioural reactivity in comparison with rearing heifers in stable pairs. Therefore, diversity in the social environment rather than stability appears to be more advantageous for heifers. In conclusion, group housing is beneficial for the welfare of calves and a variety of social experiences with conspecifics offers advantages for heifers. Cattle of different ages seem to have different social needs that must be fulfilled to ensure their welfare...|$|R

The isolated Chinese hamster CI- 4 cells which expressed the mec&# 8722; phenotype most stringently showed the following characteristics: 1. 1. In standard culture medium no cell-cell coupling was detected among CI- 4 cells when assayed by injections of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow or by electrical measurements. Between 73 and 100 % of the mec+ parental cells were coupled under these conditions. Up to 14 % <b>positive</b> <b>contacts</b> were found between CI- 4 cells and Chinese hamster Don cells (mec+). Confluent CI- 4 cells grown in the presence of 1 mM db-cAMP showed 9 % coupled cells. 2. 2. No gap junction plaques were found on electron micrographs of freeze-fractured, confluent CI- 4 cells. The mec+ parental cells showed small gap junction plaques (0. 013 % of the total cell surface analyzed). 3. 3. CI- 4 cells exhibited 16 % <b>positive</b> <b>contacts</b> and the parental Wg 3 -h-o cells showed 92 % <b>positive</b> <b>contacts</b> in autoradiographic measurements of metabolic cooperation with DON cells.
