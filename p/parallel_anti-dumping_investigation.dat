50|$|Generally speaking, an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigation</b> usually {{develops}} {{along the}} following steps: domestic producer(s) make(s) {{a request to}} the relevant authority to initiate an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigation.</b> Then investigation to the foreign producer is conducted {{to determine if the}} allegation is valid. It uses questionnaires completed by the interested parties to compare the foreign producer's (or producers') export price to the normal value (the price in the exporter’s domestic market, the price charged by the exporter in another country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporter’s production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins). If the foreign producer's export price is lower than the normal price and the investigating body proves a causal link between the alleged dumping and the injury suffered by the domestic industry, it comes to a conclusion that the foreign producer is dumping its products. According to Article VI of GATT, dumping investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded within one year, and in no case more than 18 months after initiation. Anti-dumping measures must expire five years after the date of imposition, unless a review shows that ending the measure would lead to injury.|$|R
50|$|Given {{that there}} are {{concerns}} in Indonesia {{on the impact of}} EU's environmental regulations there is a strong dialogue on the issue.

The report's arguments are based on the recent <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigation</b> – and imposition of anti-dumping measures – on imports of ceramic tiles from China, but the observations and conclusions from the analysis are valid for most EU <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations.</b> The report observes that price dumping is evaluated differently depending on whether the product is manufactured in the EU or imported from third countries. What is considered to be price dumping when imported is considered normal competition for a product manufactured in the EU. This is due to the fact that spatial price differentiation within the EU is covered by competition rules, and that competition rules have higher requirements for market share and price undercutting than the anti-dumping legislation. The report, accordingly, advocates that the criteria for imposing anti-dumping duties should be harmonized to the EU competition rules in order to ensure fair competition on the EU market. In the absence of a reformed anti-dumping regulation, the anti-dumping measures will most likely only contribute to a distorted competition where the complaining EU manufacturing industry will be protected to the detriment of the consumers. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the use of anti-dumping measures {{in order to make}} economic sense of what seems to amount to cheating on an international agreement. There are numerous loopholes in the Anti-dumping Agreement which allow anti-dumping measures {{to be used as a}} form of protection by import-competing industries against fair trade. Some of these loopholes are of a purely legal nature, while others are more practical. During an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigation,</b> a dumping margin is calculated in order to establish whether or not an accused exporter is dumping. This calculation is known as the determination of dumping. In this thesis, the various ways in which the dumping margin can be manipulated or ”captured” are investigated. It is shown that there are numerous ways in which the determination of dumping result can be manipulated in order to ensure a positive dumping result. And economists are concerned about this abuse of anti-dumping as it could have a chilling effect on international trade. However, it is shown in this thesis that <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations</b> are concentrated in certain sectors. In other words, anti-dumping measures (and other non-tariff remedies) are being used as a strategy to protect certain industries. Adam Smith, the ”father” of economics, pointed out that certain sensitive or strategic industries may need to be protected, even if such protection is at the cost of economic welfare. So, it seems that the economic issue is not really about dumping, but about whether or not certain strategic industries should be protected. And it is the protection of these strategic industries, for example the iron and steel industry, that needs further research. EconomicsD. Comm. (Economics...|$|R

40|$|EU and China are {{important}} trade partners to each other; trade relationship {{is one of}} their crucial bilateral relationships. Within EU-China trade relationship, the dumping and anti-dumping issues play an important role. When EU commission initiates <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigation,</b> Chinese producers always have different responses. This study mainly focuses on the reasons behind Chinese producers’ various responses facing EU <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations.</b> By digging out the real reasons behind Chinese producers’ various responses, this study is expected to make some contribution to the dumping and anti-dumping discussion between China and EU in academic level and to make some contribution to the policy adjusting of both sides in political lever. Some hypotheses drawing from a Chinese lawyer Tao Jingzhou’s claim in an interview are tested in this study. These hypotheses listed some possible factors affecting Chinese producers’ responses. There are many anti-dumping cases between China and EU, CFL-i (Integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps) case initiated in April 2000 was chosen as a research object for case study in this research. When it comes to theory, Hirschman’s theory of exit and voice is used as the basic theory structure of this study. His followers especially Barry and Birch refined Hirschman’s model into exit-voice-silence. This model is implemented in this study as a theory approach. By interviewing some key people in the Chinese producers involving in CFL-i case and comparing the interview results with hypotheses, come conclusions are coming out: First, in the case study level, Chinese producers’ choice of options is in a dynamic process. With the change of situation, a certain producer can choose different option in different period of time. While this study verified the variables influencing the choice of Chinese producers mentioned by Tao Jingzhou in the hypotheses such as degree of depending on EU market, sufficient of funds, supports from local government, financial system, ownership of the company and the diversity of products, it found several other variables which also affect the decision making of Chinese producers such as nationalism, previous success experience. Second, when it comes to political level, for Chinese side, Chinese government especially local government should be more supportive when their enterprises are facing <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigation</b> from EU. In EU’s part, according to what has been discussed in the case study, currently it is not the time for EU to take China as a market economy treatment. However, its harsh criteria for applying for MET and individual treatment would get continuous severe critical from Chinese producers and government, which will negatively affect its trade relationship with China. For both sides, bilateral negotiations on anti-dumping duty or undertakings {{would be good for the}} long-run interests of both sides...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is based on}} an assessment {{of the effects of the}} recent financial crisis on the international trade and the way states and international organizations acted in this context. The importance of this research topic consists in identifying the way the international trade liberalization process has been affected by the financial crisis and the way anti-crisis measures deviated from the basic rules agreed under the aegis of WTO/GATT. The intended purpose of the paper is to conduct a substantive assessment of undertaken actions by the various states aimed to mitigate crisis impact on <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations</b> and measures. Precisely, it was assayed whether the international financial crisis has been an opportunity for WTO member states to plainly intervene in the economy and give up the commitments they made in the context of multilateral commercial negotiations. Considering the international, regional and national effects of the crisis the topic has been copiously elaborated on by economics literature. A number of anti-crisis measures were presented encouraging massive intervention in the economy, as well as actions, particularly of International Organizations according to which measures could be taken without deviating from globally agreed mechanisms and principles. In order to be able to find out which of these two options prevailed in actions undertaken by the states the types of international, regional or national anti-crisis measures were selected. Positions voiced by the World Trade Organization, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), European Union are rendered. To answer the question about the way it has been responded in order to mitigate crisis effects, adopted anti-crisis measures were inventoried and their deviation from international rules was assessed. One of the indicators used in the assessment of anti-crisis measures is the progress of the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations</b> and measures notified to WTO in the past 9 years for which data were available (2003 - 2009). The relevance of this period lies in the fact that it includes 5 pre-crisis years and 2 years when it was strongly evident. It was found that the number of anti-crisis investigations and measures has not seen significant increases during the crisis period. Moreover, it has been found that states have shown a certain amount of flexibility in construing application of certain international principles rather than relinquishing them. It is thereby demonstrated that the international trade liberalization process continues without major disruptions by the financial crisis. This gives confidence to states and business environment with respect to predictability of international trade developments. The paper has significant added value brought about by both literature processing and interpretation and the author's experience in international trade negotiations. The very election of the indicator pertaining to <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations</b> and measures was based on the fact that changing trade defence mechanisms into protectionist mechanisms often stands for prevailing immediate crisis resolution. financial crisis, antidumping investigations and measures, trade liberalization, state aid, preferential trade systems...|$|R

40|$|China has {{traditionally}} been treated as a non-market economy for purposes of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations.</b> The result was that countries determined whether dumping was taking place by comparing the export price from China with the normal value established in a third country. The European Union (EU) also determined the export price from China {{on the basis of}} the average export price from that country unless an exporter met specific requirements set for the EU's 'individual treatment' standard. China challenged these practices both in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and in European courts, while the South African International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) appealed a decision from the High Court on how it had to treat imports from China. The Appellate Body of the WTO ruled that China's accession agreement to the WTO did not provide for the determination of export prices on any basis other than each individual exporter's own prices, unless the investigating authority made a specific finding that two or more parties are related, in which case those parties could be treated as a single entity. Before the European Court of Justice (ECJ), in an appeal lodged by the Council of the European Union, the ECJ found that the Council could not equate 'government control' in a company with 'government interference', and that the Council had to make a specific finding as regards interference before it could find that a company was not operating under market conditions. In South Africa, the Supreme Court of Appeal found that there was no duty on ITAC to consider any information submitted by parties to show that exporters in China were operating under non-market conditions, thus paving the way for ITAC always to treat cooperating exporters as operating under market conditions in disregard of the provisions of the applicable legislation. The verdicts in these three fora have significantly altered the way in which future <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations</b> will be conducted against Chinese exporters, and will allow those exporters greater access to the EU and South African markets. It is submitted that while the decisions in the WTO and the ECJ are correct, the Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa delivered an incorrect decision in the ITAC appeal, and in so doing rendered parts of the law redundant.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how {{anti-dumping}} legislation was implemented in Canada {{and in the}} European Communities. This comparison of Canadian and EC anti-dumping law aims at examining how the Anti-Dumping Code was transposed and applied in each jurisdiction by looking at each step of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigation,</b> starting with the initiation of an investigation, the calculation of the normal value and of the export price, {{the determination of the}} dumping margin, the finding of injury, and ending with other related matters such as anti-absorption and anti-circumvention rules.

It looks specifically at the EC and the NAFTA examples.

40|$|Using a {{significantly}} larger panel of countries than previous studies, we find strong confirmation that macroeconomic factors (real GDP growth {{and changes in}} the real effective exchange rate) affect the frequency of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations.</b> A reduction in real GDP growth or a depreciation of the real effective exchange rate leads to increased use of anti-dumping. Most previous studies of “traditional users” and “new users” of anti-dumping tend to associate real exchange rate appreciation with more anti-dumping activities. Because of the possible endogeneity of trade liberalization and anti-dumping actions, we caution against the inclusion of contemporaneous measures of trade openness in the explanatory variables. Even if this advice is ignored, no convincing evidence exists that greater trade openness or reductions in most favored nation (MFN) tariffs by developing countries increase the number of their anti-dumping filings.

The aggrieved member raises the specific issues it wants the panel to consider and specifies the relevant provisions of the relevant Agreement. 2 Strictly speaking, these rulings only apply to the parties to the dispute and although stare decisis does not apply, these rulings provide insight into whether a future panel would uphold or strike down a member’s procedures.

In this context, this paper shall serve, first, as a reminder that the European Union will violate its WTO obligations under the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) if the Union’s institutions continue - after December 11, 2016 - to adopt anti-dumping measures against China that are based on ‘non-market economy’ (NME) treatment of Chinese exports in <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations.</b> Moreover, the 2009 EU Anti-Dumping Regulation will be vulnerable to legal challenge in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism “as such” if it is not brought into compliance with the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement by that date.

The post- 2016 legality of already existing EU anti-dumping measures that are “not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices or costs in China” is particularly relevant in context of the rising amount of new EU AD measures and investigations against Chinese producers of steel and solar panels that the EU has imposed and initiated in the last 2 years.

In the context of Anti-dumping measures, the second Ad Note to Article VI: 1 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (GATT 1947) already stipulated that in the context of <b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations</b> concerning imports originating in such ‘Non-Market Economies’ (NMEs), it might not ‘be appropriate’ to rely on a strict comparison with domestic prices. The integration of NMEs into the multilateral trading system continues to raise interpretative questions for WTO panels and the Appellate Body (AB). This paper proceeds in two parts. First, it examines the way in which the incumbent membership of the GATT, and subsequently the World Trade Organization (WTO), has historically dealt with the accession of NMEs. How has the (liberal) economic theory that underpins the multilateral trading system influenced the way in which it has sought to integrate economies that arguably do not fit within this theory? The WTO Accession Protocols of NMEs such as China, Vietnam and Tajikistan for example explicitly stipulate that, for a limited period of time, special dumping methodologies may be used by the incumbent membership. This first part outlines the prevalence of ‘WTO-Plus’ commitments in the field of Anti-dumping. In the second part of this paper the practical implications of this approach will be assessed by taking a closer look at the use of the NME-methodology in the recent Anti-dumping practice of the European Union (EU) and the United States.

We offer empirical support for this claim using data on leader support changes and temporary trade barriers. ∗We thank Ashley Leeds and Michaela Mattes for sharing their data. 1 At its core, politics is the exchange of support for policy. A leader must offer policy, benefits and privileges to a coalition of interests in return for their politica...|$|R
40|$|Export cartels are {{exempted}} from the competition laws of most countries. While some scholars and several WTO members have recently condemned such cartels, others {{have argued that}} they allow efficiency gains that actually promote competition and trade. This paper examines the various issues involved, with special reference to developing countries and to recent discussions on trade and competition policy. After summarising the contending views on export cartels, and also the scanty theoretical literature on the subject, it reviews the treatment of such cartels in various jurisdictions and the limited empirical evidence that is available on their prevalence, efficiency justifications, and effects on international trade. Insights from economic theory are then applied to the arguments for and against export cartels, suggesting criteria that could help to determine their validity and an importing country’s best response. The paper concludes that while importing countries should evaluate foreign export cartels under a “rule of reason”, {{most of them will}} be constrained by a lack of technical expertise and limited enforcement capacity. It suggests a novel approach, based on <b>parallels</b> with <b>anti-dumping</b> procedures, which would strengthen their hands. antitrust, competition policy, trade negotiations, WTO. ...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Congress has {{comprehensively}} {{dealt with}} the legal effect of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and dispute settlement results in the United States in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), P. L. 103 - 465. The act provides that domestic law prevails over conflicting provisions of WTO agreements and prohibits private remedies based on alleged violations of these agreements. As a result, provisions of WTO agreements and WTO panel and Appellate Body reports adopted by the WTO Members that are in conflict with federal law do not have domestic legal effect unless and until Congress or the executive branch, {{as the case may}} be, takes action to modify or remove the conflicting statute, regulation, or regulatory action. Violative state laws may be withdrawn by the state or, in rare circumstances, invalidated through legal action by the federal government. The URAA also contains requirements for agencies to follow where a change in a regulation or the issuance of a new agency determination in a trade remedy proceeding is needed to comply with a WTO decision and existing law may be sufficient to carry out the action. While the URAA prohibits private rights of action based on Uruguay Round agreements, plaintiffs, in cases brought under other statutes, have argued that the agency actions they are challenging in court are inconsistent with a WTO agreement or a WTO decision and should conform with U. S. WTO obligations. Although courts have deemed WTO decisions to be persuasive, they have also held that they are not binding on the United States, U. S. agencies, or the judiciary, leaving the issue of whether and how the United States complies in a particular WTO proceeding to the executive branch. Legislation introduced in recent Congresses generally reflected congressional concerns that the WTO Appellate Body had interpreted WTO agreements in an overly broad manner {{to the detriment of the}} United States and that the executive branch had in some cases too readily used existing statutory authorities to comply with these decisions, particularly where U. S. trade remedies were involved. Legislation particularly focused on WTO decisions finding the U. S. use of “zeroing” in antidumping proceedings to be in violation of the WTO Antidumping Agreement and an administrative modification instituted by the Department of Commerce in original <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations</b> in response to one of the earliest of these decisions. Under the practice, the department calculates dumping margins by taking into account only sales below fair market value—generally the price in the exporting country—and assigns a zero value to sales at or above this price. While it is argued that zeroing improperly creates or inflates dumping margins, U. S. courts have consistently upheld the department’s use of the practice as valid under U. S. antidumping law...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence suggest that governments might usefully intervene in high-technology competition in two ways: First, they could {{act as a}} neutral agent that creates the necessary credibility, commitment and mutual trust among private companies so as to facilitate cooperation in high-risk, high-volume R&D. Second, if — {{in view of the}} externalities involved — an element of subsidization is to be added, this could be done in a nondiscriminatory fashion. A favourable tax treatment of R&D expenditures may be the most appropriate tool to achieve this task. In practice, governments do engage in targeted industrial and technology policies, whether justified on economic grounds or not. As a consequence, the string of trade conflicts in hightech industries that began in the 1980 s is unlikely to end in the near future, unless substantial reforms are undertaken in some crucial areas of the international trade order. Above all, appropriate reform steps should be made with a view to the regulations on (i) subsidies, (ii) structural impediments, and (iii) dumping and anti-dumping. To mitigate the frictions that arise from a subsidization of domestic firms, a new set of rules should be established. The rules should provide that all plans to grant or to alter existing subsidies are to be notified to and approved by the WTO. Moreover, all subsidies should be ranked according to their potential distortional effects on competition and trade. For each category, quantitative limits that constrain the provision of subsidies to a certain fraction of the subsidy base should be set. To facilitate further liberalization steps, a country should be allowed to exceed these limits, if a national subsidy program offers an open access to firms located in third markets. Besides restrictive business practices of private firms, government regulations and technical standards are the most important structural impediments to trade. Existing GATT Articles already offer a multilateral route to conflict resolution in cases of structural impediments. However, this route has not been used by complainants up to now. The so-called "non-violation" clause of Article 23 GATT provides access to a multilateral dispute settlement even if the defending country has not explicitly violated GATT rules. This route should be tested and, if necessary, improved. To reduce the potential for a protectionist abuse of existing anti-dumping regulations, explicit reference to the state of competition in the relevant exporting and importing country markets should be made in <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>investigations.</b> To meet specific anti-trust concerns in hightech competition — notably with respect to network externalities, systems leverage, standardization, and innovation cartels — one might consider adopting the Draft International Antitrust Code (DIAC) that has recently been proposed by an international group of legal experts.
