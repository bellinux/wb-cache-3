25|$|The Roadmap for the Integration of ASEAN in Finance is {{the latest}} {{regional}} initiative, which aims to strengthen regional self-help and support mechanisms. The implementation of the roadmap {{will contribute to the}} realisation of the ASEAN Economic Community that was launched by the ASEAN leaders in October 2003 in Bali. The AEC is the end-goal of economic integration as outlined in the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the Bali Concord II to establish a single market and production base, characterised by the free movement of goods, services, investment, and a freer flow of capital. The AEC will also facilitate the movement of business professionals, skilled labour, and talent within the region. As in the EU, adoption of an ASEAN common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the ASEAN Economic Community. Under the roadmap, approaches and milestones have been identified in areas deemed crucial to financial and monetary integration, namely: (a) capital market development, (b) capital account liberalisation, (c) financial services liberalisation, and (d) ASEAN currency co-operation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity, including the legal and regulatory framework, as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets in the region. Orderly capital account liberalisation will be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a <b>positive</b> <b>list</b> modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency co-operation would involve exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.|$|E

50|$|In the 20th century, the {{improvement}} of chemical analysis {{and the development of}} trials to identify the toxic features of substances added to foods led to the replacement of the negative lists by lists of substances allowed to be used for the production and {{the improvement}} of foods. This principle is called a <b>positive</b> <b>listing,</b> and almost all recent legislations are based on it. <b>Positive</b> <b>listing</b> implies that substances meant for human consumption have been tested for their safety, and that they have to meet specified purity criteria prior to their approval by the corresponding authorities. In 1962, the first EU directive (62/2645/EEC) approved 36 colorants, of which 20 were naturally derived and 16 were synthetic. This directive did not list which food products the colorants could or could not be used in. At that time, each member state could designate where certain colors could and could not be used. In Germany, for example, quinoline yellow was allowed in puddings and desserts, but tartrazine was not. The reverse was true in France. This was updated in 1989 with 89/107/EEC, which concerned food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs.|$|R

5000|$|By design, CITES regulates and {{monitors}} {{trade in the}} manner of a [...] "negative list" [...] such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated unless the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained. Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review. For example, recently several bird classified as threatened with extinction appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status. If a [...] "positive list" [...] approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the <b>positive</b> <b>list</b> would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.|$|E

Step 5 (Reinvent) is a larger reevaluation of the purposes for which the <b>positive</b> <b>list</b> was created. To explain what they mean by “reinvent,” McDonough and Braungart suggest that instead of working to design cars that meet low emissions standards, industrial designers could alternatively “design a new transportation infrastructure” altogether (p. 179). To apply this step to the selection of clothing and textiles for green burial, to reinvent in this case would be to reevaluate green burial and sustainability in funeral practices as a whole: from pre-burial practices to post-burial use of the land.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the efficiency of two regulatory options in the context of a global commitment to gradually phase-out the use of mercury-added products. In the first case no mercury-added products would be allowed unless they are listed in an annex (the negative list), while in the second case all mercury-added products would be allowed unless they are listed in an annex (the <b>positive</b> <b>list).</b> In both cases countries may have time to make the transition away from these products through the use of exemptions. The paper provides first a conceptual discussion of bans as regulatory instruments and of the use of technology-forcing standards to attain deep reductions in the use of hazardous substances, and we outline a simple theoretical framework within which the above regulatory options for mercury-added products can be analyzed. This framework is employed to analyze some important pros and cons of the negative and the <b>positive</b> <b>list</b> approaches. Specifically, we address a number of factors that may differ across the two options, such as: (a) the potential presence of different types of information inefficiencies; (b) the flexibility in compliance measures granted by the two approaches; (c) the significance of administration costs as well as other relevant policy implementation issues. The analysis indicates that the negative list approach could facilitate a more cost-effective phase-out of mercury, in part since in this case an individual country seeking exemption would bear the burden of identifying the need for the exemption. With the <b>positive</b> <b>list</b> approach it would be more difficult to induce mercury users to reveal their true costs of substituting to other substances.

Every human genome contains a number of potentially disease-causing alterations that may be detected during comprehensive genetic analyses to investigate a specific condition.

In this Opinion, we argue that the reason for the low level of incidental findings is that the filtering techniques and methods that are applied during the routine handling of genomic data remove these alterations. As incidental {{findings are}} systematically filtered out, it is now time to evaluate whether the ethical debate is focused on the right issues.
