25|$|The {{foundation}} of any construction project {{is rooted in}} the concept and design stages. The concept stage, in fact, {{is one of the major}} steps in a <b>project</b> <b>life</b> cycle, as it has the largest impact on cost and performance. In designing environmentally optimal buildings, the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project. However, building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process, and varies from one building to the other, never repeating itself identically. In addition, buildings are much more complex products, composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage. A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building's relevant life-cycle stages.|$|E

30|$|The Mortality Surface {{approach}} is relatively complex and involves {{a number of}} steps. In this study, it was implemented with a VBA subroutine, though {{it is possible to}} set out the calculations in a spreadsheet in a number of steps without any code. First, the national mortality surface was created using past and <b>projected</b> <b>life</b> table nLx values. Then, base period scaling factors of regional to national life expectancy at birth values by sex were calculated. Regional life expectancy forecasts were created by multiplying national life expectancy forecasts by the scaling factors. Appropriate nLx values were then picked out of the mortality surface corresponding to each <b>projected</b> <b>life</b> expectancy at birth value. This is the most complex part because Excel formulas must be created to select nLx values which correspond with each <b>projected</b> <b>life</b> expectancy at birth assumption. Period-cohort death rates can then be obtained from the interpolated nLx values.|$|R
