50|$|A common {{feature of}} glassy rocks is the {{presence}} of rounded bodies (spherulites), consisting of fine divergent fibres radiating from a center; they consist of imperfect crystals of feldspar, mixed with quartz or tridymite; similar bodies are often produced artificially in glasses that are allowed to cool slowly. Rarely these spherulites are hollow or consist of concentric shells with spaces between (lithophysae). <b>Perlitic</b> structure, also common in glasses, consists of the presence of concentric rounded cracks owing to contraction on cooling.|$|E

50|$|Easter Island lies {{atop the}} Rano Kau Ridge, and {{consists}} of three shield volcanoes with parallel geologic histories. Poike and Rano Kau exist on the east and south slopes of Terevaka, respectively. Rano Kau developed between 0.78 and 0.46 Ma from tholeiitic to alkalic basalts. This volcano possesses a clearly defined summit caldera. Benmoreitic lavas extruded about the rim from 0.35 to 0.34 Ma. Finally, between 0.24 and 0.11 Ma, a 6.5 km fissure developed along a NE-SW trend, forming monogenetic vents and rhyolitic intrusions. These include the cryptodome islets of Motu Nui and Motu Iti, the islet of Motu Kao Kao, the sheet intrusion of Te Kari Kari, the <b>perlitic</b> obsidian Te Manavai dome and the Maunga Orito dome.|$|E
50|$|Two main types may be {{recognized}} {{by means of the}} microscope; the felsitic and the microcrystalline. In the former the ingredients are so fine-grained that in the thinnest slices they cannot be determined by means of the microscope. Some of these rocks show <b>perlitic</b> or spherulitic structure, and such rocks were probably originally glassy (obsidians or pitchstones), but by lapse of time and processes of alteration have slowly passed into very finely crystal-line state. This change is called devitrification; it is common in glasses, as these are essentially unstable. A large number of the finer quartz-porphyries are also in some degree silicified of impregnated by quartz, chalcedony and opal, derived from the silica set free by decomposition (kaolinization) of the original feldspar. This re-deposited silica forms veins and patches of indefinite shape or may bodily replace a considerable area of the rock by metasomatic substitution. The opal is amorphous, the chalcedony finely crystalline and often arranged in spherulitic growths that yield an excellent black cross in polarized light. The microcrystalline ground-masses are those that can be resolved into their component minerals in thin slices by use of the microscope. They prove to consist essentially of quartz and feldspars, which are often in grains of quite irregular shape (microgranitic).|$|E
50|$|A third mode of {{occurrence}} of tachylite is as the margins and thin offshoots of dikes or sills of basalt and diabase. They are sometimes {{only a fraction}} of an inch in thickness, resembling a thin layer of pitch or tar {{on the edge of a}} crystalline diabase dike, but veins several inches thick are sometimes found. In these situations tachylite is rarely vesicular, but it often shows very pronounced fluxion banding accentuated by the presence of rows of spherulites that are visible as dark brown rounded spots. The spherulites have a distinct radiate structure and sometimes exhibit zones of varying color. The non-spherulitic glassy portion is sometimes <b>perlitic,</b> and these rocks are always brittle. Common crystals are olivine, augite and feldspar, with swarms of minute dusty black grains of magnetite. At the extreme edges the glass is often perfectly free from crystalline products, but it merges rapidly into the ordinary crystalline diabase, which in a very short distance may contain no vitreous base whatever. The spherulites may form the greater part of the mass, they may be a quarter of an inch in diameter and are occasionally much larger than this. These coarsely spherulitic rocks pass over into the variolites by increasing coarseness in the fibers of their spherulites, which soon become recognizable as needles of feldspar or feathery growths of augite. The ultimate product of decomposition in this case also is a red palagonitic substance, but owing to the absence of steam cavities the tachylite selvages of dikes are more often found in a fresh state than the basic lapilli in ash-beds. Many occurrences of basaltic pitchstones have been reported from Skye, Mull, and the western part of Scotland; they are found also in connection with the intrusive diabase sills in the north of England and the center of Scotland. In the Saar district of Germany similar rocks occur, some of which have been described as weisselbergites (from Weisselberg).|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} Greek perlite deposits crop {{out on the}} islands of Milos (Provatas and Trachilas areas), Kimolos, and Kos, Aegean Sea, which are currently under exploitation. More than 200 specimens of raw perlite were collected from these perlite deposits and were subjected to physical, chemical, petrographic and expansion tests. The perlite deposits have been formed by a phreatomagmatic eruption, which is the last event of volcanic activity on the islands. Most of the deposits comprise the sand, ash, and <b>perlitic</b> fragments' formation, the <b>perlitic</b> lahar, the perlite beds, and the <b>perlitic</b> dome. The first formation is the precursor of the eruption, and {{is followed by the}} <b>perlitic</b> lahar, which is result of lava fragmentation, and the perlite beds, which are slow-cooled lavas. The <b>perlitic</b> dome penetrates into the <b>perlitic</b> succession. Vesiculation has taken place in the perlite beds, producing the pumiceous textures of perlite. Dacite fragments are found in the <b>perlitic</b> lahar, as well. Perlite consists of more than 70 % of high silica and alkalies glass. Phenocrysts of quartz, feldspar (mainly plagioclase of oligoclase composition), biotite, opaque minerals (magnetite, ilmenite) and apatite are also present. Various types of perlite, rich in quartz, feldspar, tridimite, and cristobalite, were identified. Two main modes of water are found in perlite. Differences in chemical composition of perlites indicate four individual parent magma sources. The main chemical variation is present in alkalis and Ba, Sr, Rb, and the R. E. E. The Eu anomaly is a common characteristic for the studied perlites. The relationship between glass and perlite composition is given. The specific gravity of Greek perlites ranges between 1. 50 and 3. 00 gr/cm 3, the p. H. between 6. 5 and 8. 5, the surface area is around 3. 00 m 2 /gr. All the studied perlites indicate good expansibility, obtaining low loose bulk density values (20 - 240 kgr/m 3), low percent of nonexpansibles (1 - 7 %), large particle size, low compaction resistance, high water (15 - 35 %) and oil (400 - 2200 cc/ 100 gr) absorption, and surface area values (6 - 13 m 2 /gr). The expanded perlite is chemical inert. A new phase rich in Cr and Fe, a pyroxene, and cristobalite are determined in the expanded product. Four different stages in the expansion process are determined by the scanning electron microscope. The phenocryst proportion and grain size contribute to the expansion results. On the other hand, the chemical and the mineral composition does not affect the expansibility of perlite, perhaps because the range of composition is small. The studied perlite is of good quality and is therefore suitable for filter aid, concrete and plaster aggregate, loose fill insulation, cryogenic, horticulture, animal feed, fire protection, and thermal insulation purposes...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a detailed investigation of volatiles within subglacially erupted rhyolites from Torfajokull and Krafla, Iceland. Thermogravimetric, FTIR and XRD analyses have been combined with field observations and thin section obser- vations {{to investigate the}} coupling between fracturing and hydration resulting {{in the formation of}} perlite. The dominant volatiles in perlites are shown to be water. Perlites are enriched in water with respect to obsidians and total volatile contents vary between litho- facies. More-perlitised obsidians are found to be enriched in water compared to less-perlitised obsidians. Water is shown to decrease with distance inwards from the margin of lava lobes and the assumed external water source present during formation. Water also decreases inwards from the edges of <b>perlitic</b> beads (away from the <b>perlitic</b> fracture). The variations in water content are shown to be due to changes in water species indicative of external hydration. An inverse relationship exists between total volatile content and the temperature of maximum degassing. Hydration is shown to be stronger when grainsizes are smaller due to a greater surface area to volume ratio. Fracturing and volatile contents are strongly coupled with the extent of hydration related to the locations of fractures. The distance of water enrichment either side of major and <b>perlitic</b> fractures corre- lates well with theoretical diffusion distances of water at < 400 °C suggesting that perlitisation occurs once the obsidian is below the glass transition temperature and responds to stress in a brittle fashion. The extensive perlitisation seen in Iceland is dependent on initial planar (major) fracture formation through cooling contraction. Water exploits these fractures and diffuses into the matrix glass via the major fracture-glass interface. <b>Perlitic</b> fracture formation can occur via stress relief and/or stress corrosion. Once perlite has formed the fractures are shown to facilitate further hydration/alteration which is likely to proceed until a soil is formed.

40|$|<b>Perlitic</b> {{fractures}} form {{due to the}} hydration of glassy, rhyolitic lavas. Perlitised lavas {{are also}} an important industrial commodity yet {{there has been little}} study on the mechanisms of outcrop perlitisation. Here the fracture populations, perlitisation and volatile concentrations of subglacial rhyolitic glassy facies have been studied adding a quantitative dimension to previous qualitative studies. Samples include hyaloclastite, perlitised and non-perlitised obsidian and microcrystalline rhyolite, which are all present in lava lobes at Torfajökull, Iceland. Fractures formed through cooling increase in spacing with increased distance inwards from the margins of lobes. The size distribution of <b>perlitic</b> beads is shown to follow a log-normal distribution. The degree of perlitisation and the total volatile content (measured using thermogravimetric analysis, TGA) of samples are shown to decrease with distance inwards from lobe margins. In general, increased perlitisation is accompanied by increased hydration although complexity exists within single outcrops. The elevated total volatile content of perlite is shown to be due to hydration by environmental water with the structural location of the water changing as total volatile content increases...|$|E

Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) investigations revealed that the felsic volcanic glass transformed to nm-thick smectitic flakes of the montmorillonite-beidellite series via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism. The process of smectite formation did not proceed through X-ray amorphous or poorly crystalline transitional phases. Alteration of the glass was found to be most pronounced adjacent to <b>perlitic</b> cracks and vesicles that form an interconnected network focusing fluid flow. Glass dissolution adjacent to these fluid pathways resulted in a characteristic alteration texture at the nm scale; the intensely altered groundmass contains round cavities that are partially coated or filled by smectitic flakes.

A succession of ash/pumice flow, surge and fall deposits separated by horizons of eolian dust and paleosoil in total thickness > 15 m forms the lower unit. It represents distal facies deposits of subplinian/plinian/phreatoplinian type eruptions at unidentified centers. The second unit rests upon the lower one with unconformity marking a period of erosion. It consists of coarse phreatic/phreatomagmatic pyroclastic rocks with fragments of basement rocks and glassy dacite/ rhyodacite. They represent proximal facies of a phreatomagmatic pyroclastic ring.

40|$|Abstraet [...] Pedite, {{which occurs}} at the {{contacts}} between dacite and lacustrine tufts of Miocene age in the Guryongpo area, Korea, has undergone more sluggish and incomplete diagenetic alteration than the surrounding zeolitic tufts. Alkali-clinoptilolite, mordenite, smectite, K-rich gel-like glass, low-cristobalite, and K-feldspar are characteristic diagenetic phases in the altered perlite. Hydration of the glass to form perlite resulted in the expulsion of cations, mainly Na, from the glass into the pore fluid and in the relative nrichment ofK in the perlite. Hydration of the glass also resulted in increased alkalinity of the pore fluid, which, in turn, affected the nature and behavior of subsequent glass dissolution.

Allanite phenocrysts and co-existing lass {{from the}} <b>perlitic</b> {{obsidian}} of Sandy Braes have been analysed for nine rare earths (RE), uranium, and thorium by instrumental {{neutron activation analysis}} and for the major elements by electron microprobe. The chondrite-normalized RE plot for the allanite shows a steep slope with a negative Eu anomaly. Allanite/glass partition coefficients show a smooth variation with ionic radius (except for Eu), the variation spanning two orders of magnitude. The partitioning behaviour, which is distinct from that shown by the RE in sphene, apatite, and zircon, {{can be explained by}} the allanite structure. The pro-nounced affinity of the light RE for allanite makes this an important mineral in considerations ofRE concentra-tions during the evolution of granitic liquids. T n E geochemical behaviour of the rare earths (RE) has proved to be very suitable for the mathematical testing of petrogenetic models for a variety of igneous rocks including granitic ones. In some cases, accessory minerals uch as zircon and apatite (Hanson, 1978) could play a significant role in the fractionation of RE by virtue of their high RE contents. Therefore it has become important o establish the partition of RE in such minerals o that the models may be more truly representative of the petrogenetic process. Allanite usually crystal-lizes early from granitic melts and so may have to be considered in calculations of petrogenetic modelling.

With a Nd:YAG laser source treatments oil reserves holes are formed, which respect {{the function of the}} initial bore surface texture. The material, cast iron, is heterogeneous: <b>perlitic</b> matrix and carbon lamellae. The laser treatment will make use of this heterogeneity: as under a cw laser beam, using graphite, with its good insulating material properties, carbon lamellae, which are near the surface, are revealed. Also a high density of lamellae in a hollow against the surface are obtained. In order to improve these new surfaces, friction tests were conducted on a friction bench using samples from engine components as test pieces. In order to know bore roughness evolution, 3 D surface topography measurements were made before and after as well as friction tests on surfaces without laser treatment and with laser treatment. The results indicate that these holes can improve oil lubrication time...|$|E
40|$|Within the BMBF project 'Unround Wheels', the unroundness, the {{mechanical}} properties and the microstructure of several wheel sets {{of different types}} have been analysed. The unroundness of rubber cushioned wheels is mainly influenced by the well-known threefold polygons which remain constant in shape and location during service-caused wear. No changes of {{the mechanical}} and microstructural properties of the tyres of the wheels in circumferencial direction have been found. Single wheels developed a more pronounced unroundness during service compared to rubber cushioned ones. The analyses of the single wheels showed a modification of the microstructure at the positions of several radius minima. It {{has been found that}} this modified structure differs only slightly from the surrounding <b>perlitic</b> matrix and is moreover strongly confined to the regions close to the running surface. This structure can therefore not be detected by the test methods used for quality control according to the UIC requirements. The state of service-caused hardening below the running surface of the tyres and single wheels revealed no relations to the measured unroundnesses. (orig.)

40|$|Big {{cast iron}} {{components}} made of spheroidal cast iron allow constructing big {{structures such as}} stone mills, engine blocks or wind mills with acceptable expenses. Thus, in economically optimized cast processes pores cannot be always prevented in thick walled cast iron components and these components are often rejected because of safety reasons. On the one hand the fatigue performance of high loadable spheroidal cast iron components is reduced significantly {{by the presence of}} local porosities which has been pointed out in the past. On the other hand concepts for the fatigue estimation based on fracture mechanics which take the size and localization of the defect into account can lead to erroneous estimations because the defect is modelled as a crack. The challenge of an estimation method is to derive a fatigue life without the necessity to perform component tests. In the contribution an estimation method is presented which is able to determine the fatigue strength of a material volume taking the pores into account. The method can be applied based on data from computer tomographic X-ray (CT) or Sampling Phased Array (SPA) ultrasonic analyses. The method is presented for three spheroidal cast iron types: ferritic GJS- 400 - 18, ferritic GJS- 450 - 15 with high silicon content and <b>perlitic</b> GJS- 700 - 3...|$|E

30|$|Investigations {{of modern}} {{volcanic}} eruptions {{have demonstrated that}} ancient volcanic eruptions widely involved water, which was thus named as hydrovolcanic eruptions. Hydrovolcanisms are distinctive in many aspects, such as dynamics, eruptive pattern, texture and structure of rock, and vesicularity. First, normal sediments covered directly by volcanic rocks are the indicators of eruption environments. In addition, microfeatures, special structures, lithofacies or facies associations, and geochemical index of volcanic rocks can also provide significant evidences. Moreover, <b>perlitic</b> texture, quenching fragmentation, surface feature, cementation type, vesicularity, and pillow structure, parallel bedding, large-scale low-angle cross-bedding, antidune cross-bedding of pyroclast are keys to indicating hydrovolcanisms. Clearly, these marks are not equally reliable for identifying eruption environments, {{and most of them}} are effective and convincible in limited applications only. For explosive eruptions, the most dependable identification marks include quenching textures, vesicularity in pyroclasts and special large-scale cross-bedding. However, for effusive eruptions, useful indicators mainly include pillow structure, peperite and facies associations. Condensation rate of magma, exsolution of volatile affected by eruptive settings and magma−water interaction, and quenching in hydrovolcanisms have an influence on formation and scale of primary pores, fractures and their evolution during diagenetic stage. Therefore, this review provides systematic identification marks for ancient hydrovolcanisms, and promotes understanding of the influence of eruptive environments on hydrocarbon reservoirs of volcanic rocks in oil−gas bearing sedimentary basins.|$|E
40|$|Lacustrine limestones were {{formerly}} {{identified by}} their faunistic (limnea, planorbis) and floristic (Charophytes) content. For 30 years, indications of pedogenesis {{have been found}} in many lacustrine deposits, and consequently the concept of palustrine limestone was defined. Lacustrine fabrics are not that numerous: varved, laminated, homogeneous, peloidal, brecciated, gravelly, bioturbated (burrows), bioclastic, algal, and stromatolitic. Detrital beds are sometimes present and are interpreted as bottomset deposits. Palustrine fabrics result from exposure and pedogenesis of lacustrine mud. The main processes involved in this evolution are: cracking, with planar, curved, craze and skew planes, colonization by plants resulting in root traces, marmorization (redistribution of iron due to water table fluctuation), and redistribution of carbonates (needles, subspherical or cylindrical vertical nodules, carbonate coatings, early and late diagenetic crystals, Microcodium). Carbonate palustrine features can be associated with other minerals: palygorskite, gypsum, or silica. Alternation of lacustrine sedimentation and exposure/pedogenesis leads to the pseudo-microkarst facies resulting from enlargement of the complex network of root traces and horizontal cracks. The voids in the pseudo-microkarst facies are infilled with a polyphased internal sediment composed of carbonate and vadose silt and phreatic and vadose cements. Traces of exposure and pedogenesis are less in evidence in lacustrine bioclastic sands and algal-stromatolitic limestones. Finally, under certain conditions, the surficial laminar horizon and its associated <b>perlitic</b> crust (ooids) develops on palustrine muds and form a desert stromatolite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Louvicourt Au-Ag-Cu-Zn-Pb sulfide deposit is {{hosted by}} a Middle Ordovician calc-alkaline {{sequence}} of aphyric rhyolite flows and associated fragmental {{rocks at the}} top of the Flat Landing Brook Formation. The Zr/TiO 2 (average = 0. 110) and Y/TiO 2 (average = 0. 021) ratios in the footwall felsic volcanic rocks are consistent with known values for the Reids Brook member. The deposit consists of two concordant lenses of semi-massive to massive sulfides, approximately 150 m long and up to 9 m thick, which represent a fold repetition of a single exhalative horizon. The deposit contains a geologic resource of 136 000 tonnes grading 1. 2 % Pb, 1. 0 % Zn, 0. 4 % Cu, 90. 9 g/t Ag, and 0. 96 g/t Au; the deposit locally contains elevated Au (2. 9 ppm) and Ag (320 ppm) contents. A laterally continuous iron formation that contains barite caps the deposit, and is gradational vertically and laterally into laminated siltstone. The exhalite confirms the stratiform nature of this deposit, but a large percentage of sulfides occur as late replacements of altered felsic fragmental rocks in the footwall. Abundant examples of colloform pyrite and <b>perlitic</b> and spherulitic textures in volcanic clasts are well preserved. The base- and precious-metal content of the Louvicourt deposit is atypical of the Bathurst Mining Camp (BMC). Reported assay data (n = 27) indicate an average Pb/Zn ratio of 2. 6, the highest in the BMC (average = 0. 39). Lead exhibits a strong Spearman Rank correlation (r ' = 0. 92) with base metal...|$|E
40|$|The {{variety of}} {{requirements}} for friction pairs requires {{the development of}} different technologies {{for the production of}} tribological materials with reference to the operation modes. Composite materials obtained by the casting technology have been successfully applied for the normalization of the thermomechanical state of the steam turbines. These composites consist of the matrix based on copper alloys reinforced with cast iron granules. Because the structure and properties of cast iron are determined by the conditions of their production studies have been conducted on determination of preparation conditions on grain structure and properties of the synthesized composite material. Using an upgraded unit for production of granules technological regimes were determined providing narrow fractional composition. It has been found that granules formed are characterized with typical microstructure of white cast iron containing perlite and ledeburite. Microhardness of pilot cast iron granules is characterized by high values (from 7450 up to 9450 MPa) and depends {{on the size of the}} fraction. Composite materials obtained using experimental granules had a microhardness of the reinforcing cast iron granules about 3500 MPa, and a bronze matrix – 1220 MPa, which is higher than the hardness of the composite material obtained by using the annealed DCL- 1 granules (2250 MPa). Metal base of experimental granules in the composite material has the structure of <b>perlitic</b> ductile iron with inclusions of ferrite not exceeding 10 – 15 % and set around a flocculent graphite. As a result, the increase of physical-mechanical properties of finished products made of composite material is observed.  </p...|$|E
