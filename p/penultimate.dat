5|$|In 1956–57, his <b>penultimate</b> {{season for}} Victoria, Loxton—aged nearly 36—scored 134 and took 2/30 to orchestrate an innings victory over South Australia {{in the second}} match of the summer. In the <b>penultimate</b> match of the season, which {{effectively}} determined {{the fate of the}} Sheffield Shield, the Victorian all-rounder took 4/44 to help dismiss New South Wales for 149 and take a 292-run first innings lead. However, the defending champions hung on for a draw to ensure the retention of their title. Loxton then surpassed his previous career best by taking 6/49 against Western Australia to set up a nine-wicket win in the last match of the season.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>penultimate</b> {{novel of}} the series, You Only Live Twice, Bond suffers from amnesia and has a {{relationship}} with an Ama diving girl, Kissy Suzuki.

5|$|The {{relative}} chronological {{position of}} Djedkare Isesi as the eighth and <b>penultimate</b> {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty, succeeding Menkauhor Kaiu and preceding Unas on the throne, is well established by historical sources and confirmed by archaeological evidence.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{change to}} the vocal cast is the {{inclusion}} of actor Tony Todd {{as the voice of}} the Vortigaunts. He replaces Louis Gossett, Jr. in the role. Actor Adam Baldwin voices several of the civilian and rebel NPCs, most notably the character who informs the player of the Striders' locations in the <b>penultimate</b> chapter.|$|E
5|$|After a near two-year absence, Primus made a {{comeback}} to the Portsmouth first team on 18 May 2009, the <b>penultimate</b> {{game of the}} 2008–09 season, as a late substitute appearance against Sunderland at Fratton Park.

5|$|Burgmeier is a Liechtenstein {{international}} {{who made}} his debut in a 2002 World Cup qualifier against Spain on 5 September 2001. It was the <b>penultimate</b> game of the side's qualifying campaign, in which they lost all eight games without scoring a goal.

Burgmeier featured in seven of the qualification matches.|$|E
5|$|Catherine of Bosnia (/Катарина Косача; 1424/1425 – 25 October 1478) was Queen of Bosnia as {{the wife}} of King Stephen Thomas, the <b>penultimate</b> Bosnian sovereign. She was born into the {{powerful}} House of Kosača, staunch supporters of the Bosnian Church. Her marriage in 1446 was arranged to bring peace between the King and her father, Stjepan Vukčić. The queenship of Catherine, who at that point embraced Roman Catholicism, was marked with an energetic construction of churches throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Completed between September and October 1941, Soeara Berbisa {{featured}} keroncong {{music and}} was shot partly in western Java. It was released {{to coincide with}} the Eid al-Fitr holiday, and rated for all ages. Advertisements emphasised the film's appeal to both Native and Dutch audiences, and a review in De Indische Courant was positive. Although the film– Union's <b>penultimate</b> production– was screened as late as 1949, it is now likely lost.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare Isesi (known in Greek as Tancherês) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, {{the eighth}} and <b>penultimate</b> {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty in the late 25th century to mid-24th century BC, during the Old Kingdom period.

His {{relations}} to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare's son, owing to the smooth transition between the two.|$|E
5|$|Gavaskar {{made his}} One Day International (ODI) debut against England at Headingley in 1974. Unlike his Test career, his ODI career was less illustrious scoring 3,092 runs {{at an average}} of 35.13. Gavaskar's solitary century in ODIs came in the <b>penultimate</b> innings of his career—against New Zealand—during the 1987 Cricket World Cup where he scored 103 runs in 88 balls; the {{performance}} ensured India's victory, which earned him a man of the match award.|$|E
5|$|Gunslinger was {{featured}} in a fifth-season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, a comedy television series. The show features a human and his robot creations watching bad films while providing a running commentary which mocks it. Gunslinger was the eleventh episode of the fifth season, which was broadcast on Comedy Central on October 9, 1993. Gunslinger was the <b>penultimate</b> episode for series creator and host Joel Hodgson, who left the show {{at the end of}} the next episode, Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 is a 2010 British-American fantasy film {{directed}} by David Yates and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It {{is the first}} of two cinematic parts based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling and features an ensemble cast. The film, which is the seventh and <b>penultimate</b> installment in the Harry Potter film series, was written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron, and Rowling.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>penultimate</b> {{panel of}} the book, as Tintin, Haddock and Calculus's flight back home departs from the newly named Alcazaropolis, it flies over a slum that was seen earlier when they flew into the country. In a stroke of {{political}} commentary, the upheaval of the government has caused virtually no change to the slum or the lives of its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The {{addition}} of the Côte de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered {{much more likely than}} in previous years that a group of riders could break away from the peloton on the <b>penultimate</b> climb and hold an advantage to the finish line. No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5|$|Rindt was commemorated in many ways. The {{early season}} BARC 200 Formula Two race was renamed the Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy {{for as long}} as the series existed. In 2000, on the 30th anniversary of his death, the city of Graz {{unveiled}} a bronze plaque in remembrance of Rindt, with wife Nina and daughter Natasha present. The <b>penultimate</b> corner at the Red Bull Ring in Austria is named after Rindt.|$|E
5|$|Romualdo Braschi-Onesti, cardinal-nephew of Pius VI (1775–1799), was the <b>penultimate</b> cardinal-nephew. Despite Pius VI's lineage to a noble Cesena family, {{his only}} sister {{had married a}} man from the poor Onesti family. Therefore, he {{commissioned}} a genealogist to discover (and inflate) some trace of nobility in the Onesti lineage, an endeavor which yielded only a circuitous connection to Saint Romualdo.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Stegall later {{noted that}} the <b>penultimate</b> scene, which {{features}} federal agents raiding the religious compound and finding that everyone inside has committed suicide, bears similarities to the Waco siege. Stegall even {{points out that the}} real name of the church leader in the episode, Vernon Warren, also resembles the name of the compound leader during the Waco siege: Vernon Wayne.|$|E
5|$|Several planned filming {{locations}} {{were abandoned}} due to budget constraints. For thematic reasons, the film's <b>penultimate</b> fight scene between JTRO and L Dubba E was originally set at Dawn's Liquor Marta key {{location in the}} film. The store's owners refused permission for filming and the location was changed to a long-abandoned gas station. Bryan Goddard, who portrays Sugga Nigga, acquired permission for the crew to film on the property.|$|E
5|$|The 0–14 {{record was}} {{matched by the}} 1980 New Orleans Saints, who won their <b>penultimate</b> game to end the season 1–15. The 1981 Baltimore Colts then won their opener and closer, but lost every game in between to equal the Buccaneers’ and Saints’ 14-game single-season losing streak. The 1982 Colts were winless in a strike-shortened season, but did get a tie in one game. The 1990 New England Patriots had a 1–1 record when several of the players sexually harassed a female reporter. The fallout from the scandal contributed to the team {{finishing}} 0–14 in its remaining games. The 2013 Houston Texans also managed to match the Buccaneers' single-season losing streak after starting 2–0. Most recently, the 2016 Cleveland Browns lost their first 14 games (including an 0–4 preseason) to match the Buccaneers' single season streak, but managed to avoid becoming the NFL's second 0–16 team by winning their <b>penultimate</b> game against the San Diego Chargers.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} the <b>penultimate</b> {{appearance of the}} alien black oil; it would appear for a final time via flashback in the series' finale. Visual effects for the black oil were created with molasses, chocolate syrup, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). A scene showing black oil {{coming out of a}} worker's eyes, ears, and mouth was mostly filmed on a visual effects stage. Nine takes were needed to get the syrupy mixture to spill correctly.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} internationally and attracted large audiences and positive reviews, though some criticized it for commercializing the tragedy {{so soon after}} the event. It is now regarded as a lost film, as the last known prints were destroyed in an Éclair studio fire in March 1914. Only a few printed stills and promotional photos are known to survive. It is Gibson's <b>penultimate</b> film, as she reportedly suffered a mental breakdown after completing it.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} stages that began or ended outside of Italy. Stage 12 {{ended in the}} Slovenian city Kranj and served as the start for the race's thirteenth stage. Stage 13 ended at Lienz in Austria, and the fourteenth began there. The Giro's {{mountain}}ous stage 20 ended {{on the slopes of}} Les Deux Alpes, and the <b>penultimate</b> stage began on the mountain the next day.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by Gilbert's <b>penultimate</b> operatic parody, Robert the Devil, a burlesque of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera, Robert le diable, {{which was part of}} a triple bill that opened the Gaiety Theatre, London, in 1868. The piece was Gilbert's biggest success to date, running for over 100 nights and being frequently revived and played continuously in the provinces for three years thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Thurisind (Latin: Turisindus, died c. 560) {{was king}} of the Gepids, an East Germanic Gothic people, from c. 548 to 560. He was the <b>penultimate</b> Gepid king, and succeeded King Elemund by staging a coup d'état and forcing the king's son into exile. Thurisind's kingdom, known as Gepidia, was located in Central Europe and had its centre in Sirmium, a former Roman city on the Sava River (now the town of Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia).|$|E
5|$|United met Newcastle United in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium, the <b>penultimate</b> FA Cup final to be {{held there}} before it was closed for rebuilding. Less than 10 minutes into the match, Keane was injured and {{replaced}} by Sheringham. He and Scholes both finished with a goal apiece in the 2–0 win that sealed the double.|$|E
