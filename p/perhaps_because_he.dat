5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} for the nomination, {{refused to be}} the Democratic candidate, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had already {{decided to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because {{there was no one to}} replace him and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E
5|$|Athamas {{ruled in}} Boeotia {{and had a}} {{complicated}} family life, several details of which {{are known to have}} played part in the Catalogue. His first children were Phrixus and Helle, whose mother was Nephele. In what was the first episode of the Argonautic saga, she gave her children a ram with a golden fleece upon which they fled the intrigues of their stepmother Ino according to other sources. Athamas was driven mad by the gods, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> took the young Dionysus into his household, and slaughtered his and Ino's son Learchus; Ino herself jumped into the sea with their son Melicertes and became the sea-goddess Leucothea. At some point before his marriage to Ino, Athamas had sired Leucon and Schoeneus by Themisto, and Leucon's daughters Peisidice, Euippe and Hyperippe were given extended group treatment in the Catalogue.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this controversy, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it, <b>he</b> {{released}} a record himself, [...] "Hand In Hand"/"Friends In Need", on the Butterfly record label. It {{was not a}} chart hit.|$|R
50|$|In truth, from {{beginning}} to end, and from production to consumption, use-value and exchange-value form a dialectical unity. If this is not fully clear from Marx's writings, that is <b>perhaps</b> mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> never theorised the sphere of final consumption in any detail, nor {{the way in which}} commerce reshapes the way that final consumption takes place.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy did {{not know}} why he smiled, but <b>perhaps</b> it was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was stirred a little and did not wish to show it. In any case, Valentine frowned at him.|$|R
5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|William ceased his active {{service in}} the Royal Navy in 1790. When Britain {{declared}} war on France in 1793, he was anxious to serve his country and expected a command, but was not given a ship, perhaps at first because he had broken his arm by falling down some stairs drunk, but later <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war. The following year he spoke in favour of the war, expecting a command after his change of heart; none came. The Admiralty did not reply to his request. He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post. In 1798 he was made an admiral, but the rank was purely nominal. Despite repeated petitions, he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he {{was appointed to the}} honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet. In 1813, he came nearest to any actual fighting, when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries. Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.|$|E
5|$|William's {{great work}} is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184. It {{contains}} twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 {{and the beginning of}} 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the conquest of Syria by Umar in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals {{with the advent of the}} First Crusade and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the Historia was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> now realized that European readers would also be interested in the history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.|$|E
2500|$|Early that day, Boaz went to {{the city}} gate {{to meet with the}} other male {{relative}} before the town elders. The relative is not named: Boaz addresses him as [...] "Friend", ploni almoni, literally [...] "so and so". The Expanded Bible's editors comment that [...] "the man is not named, <b>perhaps</b> ironically <b>because</b> <b>he</b> refused to preserve Naomi’s family name".|$|R
5000|$|According to his daughter, Marc {{gives up}} the name [...] "Backlash"; seeking, {{as she put}} it, {{to keep it in}} the family, Jodi uses it herself. Marc Slayton appears in Sleeper as a plainclothes agent of Department PSI with the rank of Commander. For some reason, <b>perhaps</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>he</b> chose not to, Slayton did not use his powers during this time.|$|R

25|$|He {{altered the}} {{dynamics}} {{of the end of the}} Inn Scene, making the conclusion loud and bombastic, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was dissatisfied that all of Mussorgsky's scenes with the exception of the Coronation Scene end quietly.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his predecessors, Robert was impetuous and violent, in part, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had {{inherited}} a severe form of gout from his grandfather. He was also unreliable {{and lacking in}} political sophistication. Almost {{as soon as he}} took control of his estate, he attacked the priory of Tutbury, which his family were patrons of.|$|E
25|$|Some {{asserted}} that Rachmaninoff's music was derivative, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a Romantic at heart and eschewed {{much of the}} contemporary revolution in musical thought which was emerging in the early 20th century. Music critic Paul Rosenfeld’s remark that Rachmaninoff's music ‘wants the imprint of a decided and important individuality,’ can have done nothing to alleviate the composer's writer's block.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, critic Steve Leggett {{wrote of}} the reissue [...] "Atkins was a master {{musician}} working in a genre all too often prone to caricature and posturing, {{and he did it}} all without wearing a big hat. If Atkins wasn't exactly perceived as a guitar god by the public, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> everything <b>he</b> did seemed so smooth and effortless, other players certainly knew what he could do." ...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1965, {{with the}} {{publication}} of Contaminated and Natural Lead Environments of Man, Patterson tried to draw public attention to the problem of increased lead levels in the environment and the food chain from lead from industrial sources. <b>Perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was criticizing the experimental methods of other scientists, he encountered strong opposition from those then recognized as experts, such as Robert A. Kehoe.|$|R
60|$|He {{started and}} glanced quickly at the tombs around him. <b>Perhaps</b> it was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had been {{thinking}} of the dead,--but the voice sounded like HIS. Yet {{it was only the}} SISTER, who had glided, pale and haggard, from the thicket.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} Frederick arrived in Great Britain, cricket had {{developed}} into the country's most popular team sport and it thrived on gambling. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wished to Anglicise and so {{fit in with}} his new society, Frederick developed an academic interest in cricket and soon became a genuine enthusiast. He began to make wagers and then to patronise and play the sport, even forming his own team on several occasions.|$|E
25|$|Shoghi Effendi later {{expressed}} {{to his wife}} and others that he had no foreknowledge of the existence of the Institution of Guardianship, least of all that he was appointed as Guardian. The most he expected was <b>perhaps,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the eldest grandson, `Abdu'l-Bahá might have left instructions as to how the Universal House of Justice was to be elected and he might have been designated as Convener of the gathering which would elect it.|$|E
25|$|According to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev {{would go}} on to say that this {{incident}} was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home. The collapse of the summit also saw an increased tension between the Soviets and the Americans in the years to come. After this debacle the arms race accelerated and any considerations for negotiations were dashed for the immediate future.|$|E
50|$|Born in New York City, he was {{six years}} old when the Civil War started. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of that <b>he</b> early {{developed}} a lifelong interest in American history, particularly in the Civil War and in the generals who fought it. His intense studies into history allowed Kelly to bring to his work a degree of detail that makes his drawings and statues noteworthy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe Snip thinks {{as much of}} you as you do of him," [...] Seth replied gloomily. [...] "I {{never knew}} him {{to make friends with}} any one before; but <b>perhaps</b> that was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> saw only the fellers who liked to tease him.

5000|$|For his {{portrayal}} of Callum, Baker was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 2009 Inside Soap Awards. Of Callum's most memorable moment, a Holy Soap writer said [...] "After almost being killed by a falling tree in the bush, Callum came under suspicion for starting a devastating fire. Luckily, the real culprit was finally caught". Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture praised the character of Callum, calling him a [...] "decent addition to Ramsay Street". She added [...] "For the first time, they've found a kid who's actually not too bad. He isn't as goody-goody or out and out brattish as most Erinsborough young, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> not actually related {{to any of the}} neighbours". In July 2010, Deller again praised the character saying [...] "Callum has since established himself {{as one of the best}} characters on Ramsay Street, who always sees things with a more realistic/honest/sarcastic perspective than his neighbours. The best storyline of the Aussie soap this year was when he teamed up with the best character on the Street, Paul Robinson, and Paul started teaching him about machiavelli. This, not silly storylines about dancing and shrugaleros, is what we want".|$|R
25|$|Drăghici {{fell from}} {{power at the}} CC plenary of April 1968, {{when he came into}} {{conflict}} with Ceaușescu for supremacy within the party. The plenary saw Pătrășcanu rehabilitated and Drăghici excluded from the party altogether. Over the course of the year, he was removed from the CC's politburo and permanent presidium; from the deputy premiership; and from his officer's rank, being downgraded to a common soldier in the reserves. However, he suffered no further consequences, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knew too much compromising information.|$|E
25|$|In August, Canaris {{met with}} Franco's brother-in-law, Ramón Serrano Súñer, {{who was about}} to become Spain's Foreign Minister. Canaris urged Serrano Súñer to do what he could to {{convince}} Franco {{to stay out of the}} war. Soon after, Franco dispatched Serrano Súñer to Berlin to get an idea of Hitler's attitude, since Canaris had assured him that Germany would not forcibly intervene in Spain. When Serrano Súñer met Hitler on 16 September, Hitler did not press very hard for Spanish involvement in the war, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> planned to meet Franco himself very soon.|$|E
25|$|Delany {{worked for}} a brief period as {{principal}} of a colored school before going into practice as a physician. During another cholera outbreak in 1854, most doctors abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, as no one knew how the disease was caused nor how to control the epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for the victims. Delany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African American education (Anderson, 1988; Bullock, 1967; Butchart, 1980). He is not counted among African American educators, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.|$|E
60|$|Middlemas, indeed, {{consented to}} go with his {{companion}} to the Isle of Wight, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> if <b>he</b> should quarrel with him, the whole plan of his Indian voyage, and all the hopes built upon it, must fall to the ground. But he altered his purpose of intrusting his comrade with his little fortune, to lay out as his occasions might require, and resolved himself to overlook the expenditure of his money, which, {{in the form of}} Bank of England notes, was safely deposited in his travelling trunk. Captain Hillary, finding that some hint he had thrown out on this subject was disregarded, appeared to think no more about it.|$|R

5000|$|Drum (corporately styled DRUM) was an American LGBT-interest {{magazine}} {{based in}} Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Published monthly beginning in 1964 by the homophile activist group the Janus Society and edited by Clark Polak, Drum took its title from a quote by Henry David Thoreau: [...] "If {{a man does}} not keep pace with his companions, <b>perhaps</b> it is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> hears the beat of a different drummer." ...|$|R
25|$|Known as o Bruxo (the Sorcerer), Pascoal {{often makes}} music with {{unconventional}} {{objects such as}} teapots, children's toys, and animals, as well as keyboards, button accordion, melodica, saxophone, guitar, flute, voice, various brass and folkloric instruments. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{grew up in the}} countryside, he uses nature as a basis for his compositions, as in his Música da Lagoa, in which the musicians burble water and play flutes while immersed in a lagoon: a Brazilian television broadcast from 1999 showed him soloing at one point by singing into a cup with his mouth partially submerged in water. Folk music from rural Brazil is another important influence in his work.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{favored the}} {{provisional}} government, Skerrett suddenly and unexpectedly was relieved of {{command of the}} Pacific Squadron by John Irwin and replaced Irwin {{in command of the}} Asiatic Squadron, which Skerrett assumed on 30 October 1883. Skerrett was promoted to rear admiral on 16 April 1894. His mandatory retirement from the Navy upon reaching the age of 62 was scheduled for 18 January 1895, but he voluntarily requested an earlier retirement based on time in service in order to make room for Commodore Joseph P. Fyffe to be promoted to rear admiral before Fyffes mandatory retirement at age 62 on 26 July 1894. Skerrett thus was placed on the retired list early, on 9 July 1894, allowing Fyffe to be promoted to rear admiral shortly before his own mandatory retirement.|$|E
25|$|Rochester {{opposed the}} {{election}} of William and Mary as king and queen, raising his voice {{for the establishment of}} a regency on behalf of the exiled James. But he soon reconciled himself to the new order, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could not retain his pension unless he took the oaths of allegiance. After this he was quickly in the royal favour and again a member of the Privy Council. He advised the queen in ecclesiastical matters, and returned to his former position as the leader of the High Church party. Rochester tried to mediate in the quarrel between Princess Anne and the King and Queen, but with little success. Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, thanked him for his expressions of goodwill, but added sarcastically that she would have valued them much more if she thought that they had been sincere.|$|E

50|$|Chi-chen {{studied the}} Confucian {{classics}} at home, then entered {{the middle school}} affiliated with Tsinghua University in Beijing in 1913. Upon graduation he proceeded to the United States on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program scholarship. In 1922-1924 he studied at the University of Wisconsin and earned an A.B. in Economics. In 1924-1927 he attended Columbia University’s business and journalism schools and the Graduate Faculties of Political Science, Philosophy and Pure Science. Wang did not study for a higher degree <b>perhaps</b> <b>because,</b> as <b>he</b> later wrote, {{he was not a}} “good student”. He confessed he was more interested in pursuing girls (although back in Shandong he had a wife by arranged marriage who later bore him a son).|$|R
50|$|Huan and Zhang Jianzhi {{thereafter}} demoted Yao {{to be the}} prefect of Bo Prefecture (亳州, roughly modern Bozhou, Anhui). <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of this, <b>he</b> {{survived the}} subsequent reprisal that Emperor Zhongzong later carried out {{at the suggestion of}} his cousin Wu Sansi (Wu Zetian's nephew) against the coup leaders in 706, and he later was made the prefect of Chang Prefecture (常州, roughly modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), then Yue Prefecture (越州, roughly modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), then Xu Prefecture (許州, roughly modern Xuchang, Henan).|$|R
