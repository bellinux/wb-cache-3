50|$|A {{number of}} iron objects were discovered, {{including}} two spearheads and an axehead. Locational {{information from the}} excavation is poor, although one of the spearheads was found associated with the guard cell. Nail heads, bronze pins and a bronze ring were also found. Evidence of metal-working, including a mass of conglomerate with fused pottery and iron, was also found. Bone <b>pins,</b> <b>combs,</b> antler fragments and cetacean bone vessels were found along with several dice. A large quantity of pottery was also found, along with the remains of whale, seal, ox, pig, red deer, sheep, horse, gannet and other birds, and human bone.|$|R

5000|$|Between 27 BC and 102 AD, in Imperial Rome, women wore {{their hair}} in {{complicated}} styles: {{a mass of}} curls on top, or in rows of waves, drawn back into ringlets or braids. Eventually noblewomen's hairstyles grew so complex that they required daily attention from several slaves and a stylist {{in order to be}} maintained. The hair was often lightened using wood ash, unslaked lime and sodium bicarbonate, or darkened with copper filings, oak-apples or leeches marinated in wine and vinegar. [...] It was augmented by wigs, hairpieces and pads, and held in place by nets, <b>pins,</b> <b>combs</b> and pomade. Under the Byzantine Empire, noblewomen covered most of their hair with silk caps and pearl nets.|$|R

There are a total of 18 items, of which 5 are combs and 13 are hairpins, which also includes cosmetic pins which were used to form hairstyles. They were generally found as grave goods and they are analyzed typologically; most may be dated from the first to fourth centuries...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a woman with}} right brain damage who denied the ownership of her left hand and of extracorporeal objects (e. g. rings) which were worn on the left hand itself. When the same objects were worn on the right hand or were held by the examiner, the patient correctly recognized them as her own. Other personal objects unrelated to the left hand (e. g. <b>pins,</b> earrings, <b>comb)</b> were always correctly recognized as her own. Thus, by inference, the mental image of one's body may include inanimate objects which had been in contact or in close proximity with the body itself. These findings provide, for the first time, experimental support to the speculative notion of an extended body schema...|$|R
50|$|The {{isolation}} {{within the}} closed districts {{resulted in the}} oiran becoming highly ritualised in many ways and increasingly removed from the changing society. Strict etiquette governed appropriate behavior. Their speech preserved the formal court standards rather than the common language. Casual visitors were rejected; clients were accepted only by referral from certain teahouses, and only by appointment, which increased both the cost and the delay. In a time when both dress and hairstyles were becoming simpler, oiran's costumes {{became more and more}} ornate, culminating in a style with eight or more <b>pins</b> and <b>combs</b> in the hair, and many layers of highly ornamented garments derived from the early Edo period. Similarly, the entertainments offered were derived from those of the original courtesans generations before. Ultimately, the culture of the oiran grew increasingly rarefied and remote from everyday life, and their clients dwindled.|$|R

On stage, Eliscu acted in The Little Minister, Cyrano de Bergerac (1899), Beau Brummel (1899), Her Majesty (1900), Don Caesar's Return (1901), The Smoldering Flame, Pickpockets, Jacque Duval, Romeo and Juliet (1903), Marta of the Lowlands (1903), The Light from Saint Agnes (1906), Ruth (1907), The Third Degree (1909-1910), The Outsider (1924, 1928), If I Were You (1931), Triplets (1932), Creeping Fire (1935), and Winterset (1936).

5000|$|The term [...] "music box" [...] is also {{applied to}} {{clockwork}} devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used {{only in a}} [...] "programming" [...] function without producing the sounds directly by means of <b>pins</b> and a <b>comb.</b> Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified wind instrument or plucked the chords on a modified string instrument. Some devices could do {{both at the same}} time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the Orchestrion.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, in a shift that historians {{attribute}} {{to the influence}} of the West, Japanese men began cutting their hair into styles known as jangiri or zangiri (which roughly means [...] "random cropping"). During this period, Asian women were still wearing traditional hairstyles held up with <b>combs,</b> <b>pins</b> and sticks crafted from tortoise, metal, wood and other materials, but in the middle 1880s, upper-class Japanese women began pushing back their hair in the Western style (known as sokuhatsu), or adopting Westernized versions of traditional Japanese hairstyles (these were called yakaimaki, or literally, soirée chignon).|$|R
50|$|A still-sealed burial chamber, number 45, {{contained}} the richest {{of more than}} a thousand private middle Assyrian burials. It was associated with a large house uncovered during excavations in 1908 in Aššur and consisted of a shaft leading to an 8 foot by 5 foot chamber containing the remains of nine adults and a child. Most skeletal remains were heaped against a wall or in an urn, making space for the two most recent arrivals who were thought at the time to be a male and female by contemporary archeologists. The male may well have been Bābu-aḫa-iddina himself as his archive was found nearby. Unfortunately the bones were discarded after excavation preventing further analysis and doubts have subsequently been raised as to whether there was a male at all, based on the grave goods which included gold, lapis lazuli, carnelian and banded agate jewelry, elaborately carved ivory <b>combs,</b> <b>pins</b> and vessels and pottery articles comprising a pyxis with a lid and a cosmetic dish.|$|R

It {{eventually}} snares the log of ambergris and the Nisshin Maru winches it up {{into the}} flensing bay {{through the back of}} the ship. Below deck, the Female Guest wanders through the corridors in a thin towel following her bath. She is encouraged to sit before a mirror in another preparation room by an amah, who carefully combs and arranges her hair into an ornate, traditional style using pieces of organic marine material arranged on <b>combs,</b> <b>pins</b> and boards. Another amah attends to the Male Guest, replacing his shorn eyebrows and hair with similar objects. Both Guests are stripped and redressed in ceremonial costume of skins and furs, with a base layer of damp fabric resembling thick kelp. The female Guest's eyebrows are shaved, her face painted with a thick layer of white foundation, and her lips painted over with the small, red pout of a Shinto bride. Both Guests also carry a large conch shell strapped to their backs, flensing knives with horn handles and a small bone instrument resembling a folded fan. Meanwhile, on deck, the field emblem sculpture has hardened in the mould and the crew use flensing tools and a winch to strip the central piece out of the mould.|$|R

[...] "Hes very creative and unafraid of taking chances," [...] she said of the director. [...] "I really respect him. Hes wonderful." [...] Also during this period, Fenn appeared on the cover and in a nude pictorial in the December 1990 edition of Playboy magazine.|$|R
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of <b>pins</b> on the <b>comb</b> cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector <b>comb</b> and the <b>pins</b> of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the <b>pins</b> of the <b>comb</b> circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the <b>comb</b> circle <b>pins</b> by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R

We are not made of wood or stone, and the things which connect {{themselves}} with our hearts and habits cannot, like bark or lichen, be rent away without our missing them. The farmer's dame lacked her usual share of intelligence, perhaps also the self-applause which she had felt while distributing the awmous (alms), in shape of a gowpen (handful) of oatmeal, to the mendicant who brought the news. The cottage felt inconvenience from interruption of the petty trade carried on by the itinerant dealers. The children lacked their supply of sugarplums and toys; the young women wanted <b>pins,</b> ribbons, <b>combs,</b> and ballads; and the old could no longer barter their eggs for salt, snuff, and tobacco.

40|$|The Scottish Atlantic Iron Age is {{recognised}} as {{falling into}} four periods, the EIA, MIA, LIA I and LIA II. Least {{is known of}} the LIA I, the immediate post-broch period. Original analysis of the C- 14 record confirms these divisions; they result as {{a combination of the}} effects of the Trondheim calibration curve but mainly the history of archaeological survival and previous excavation strategy. A large data base of <b>pins</b> and <b>combs</b> is examined and analysed, following on the earlier work of Stevenson (1955 a), because these are some of the more ubiquitous and chronologically sensitive artefacts belonging to the LIA. This provides the basis for a reconsideration of the nature of LIA settlement throughout the Atlantic Province as a whole, more particularly in the study area of Orkney and Caithness. There are still severe problems in recognising LIA, particularly LIA I activity. This analysis forms the basis for a case study of Orkney and Caithness from around the early centuries of the first millennium BC to the eighth or ninth century AD. A scheme is suggested for the structural developments witnessed over this period, and on the basis of the general trends observed, a social interpretation is put forward. An attempt is made to apply Fields of Discourse, which is contrasted with previous work in this area, because of its sound methodological approach. Archaeological application of the technique of access analysis is described and used to investigate how the use of space structured and reproduced these changing social relations. The shift from locally based power sources to more centralised, in relation to Orkney and Caithness more distant, sources of authority is demonstrated, and related to the development of the southern Pictish kingdom. This change reflects the move from intensive to extensive sources of power. Other aspects of social reproduction are examined to see if they fit within this framework. On analogy with contemporary situations elsewhere and the evidence to hand, the means by which this power may have been exercised, specifically changing agricultural practice and land tenure, and the ideological power of Christianity are speculated upon...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1908, {{less than}} two months after the arrest of the Maniktola conspirators, a [...] "new gang" [...] - symbol of a new spirit - {{commenced}} operations on the Eastern Bengal State Railway. The series of outrages began with a bomb thrown into a train. The Police experts held that the bombs used in these occasions were inferior to those prepared by Barin Ghosh's party; instead of dynamite or picric acid, these were coconut shell bombs with a mixture of sulphide of arsenic and chlorate of potash stuffed with bits of broken glass, nails, <b>pins</b> of jute <b>combs,</b> causing great injury on explosion. These outrages continued sporadically till April 1909. The Special Department of the Police traced them to a gang of Brahmans in Bhatpara, led by Kartik Datta and Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N.

50|$|Act X, Amakawaya Gihei Uchi no ba - (“The House Amakawaya Gihei”) Act X is {{only rarely}} {{performed}} but provides a realistic interim (performed in the sewamono style) between Yuranosuke setting {{out at the}} end of Act IX and the final vendetta. The action takes place at the premises of Amakawaya Gihei, a merchant who lives in the port of Sakai, near Osaka. Yuranosuke has entrusted Gihei with the purchase and shipment to Kamakura of all the weapons, armour and other equipment which they will need for the vendetta. Knowing that he may be linked to the vendetta, Gihei has been preparing by dismissing his staff so that they would not be aware of what he was doing. He has even sent his wife, Osono, to her father’s so that she would be out of the way.The act usually opens with some of the boatmen discussing the loading of the chests and the weather and, as they go off, Gihei’s father-in-law, Ryōchiku, comes, demanding a letter of divorce so that he can marry Osono off to another man. Gihei agrees, thinking that his wife has betrayed him. After Ryōchiku’s departure, law officers arrive and accuse Gihei of being in league with Hangan’s former retainers. Gihei refuses to allow them to open one of the chests of weapons and armour, even threatening to kill his own son to allay their suspicions. Suddenly Yuranosuke himself appears and confesses that the law officers are, in fact, members of the vendetta and that he sent them to test Gihei’s loyalty. He praises Gihei’s resolution and commitment to their cause. As they all go off to a back room for a celebratory drink of sake, Gihei’s wife, Osono arrives, wishing both to return the letter of divorce, which she has stolen from her father, and to see their child. Gihei, however, torn between his love for his wife and his duty to Yuranosuke reluctantly forces her to leave. Shut outside, she is attacked in the dark by two men who steal her hair <b>pins</b> and <b>combs</b> and cut off her hair. Yuranosuke and his men reappear and, about to depart, place some gifts for Gihei on an open fan. The gifts turn out to be Osono’s shorn hair and ornaments. Yuranosuke had his men attack her and cut her hair to that her father would be unable to marry her off. No one would take a wife with hair as short as a nun’s. In hundred days, he says, her hair will grow back and she can be reconciled with her husband, Gihei. By then, Yuranosuke and his men will also have achieved their goal. Gihei and Osono, overawed by his kindness, offer their deepest thanks. Yuranosuke and his men depart for their ship.|$|R
