40|$|T HERE ARE MANY {{emergency}} {{situations in which}} <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration</b> may be needed but {{in which it is}} impossible to place the victim in the prone or supine position for administering any one of the standard methods. For instance, a victim may be in a foxhole, jeep, small boat or in some part of a helicopter, plane or submarine where space is inadequate for giving a standard method of <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration.</b> In all of these situations, an adapted method must be used if the victim is to be revived. There are other conditions besides lack of space which demand the use of modified methods of <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration.</b> Victims may be found lying under debris with only certain parts of the body accessible, or they may have wounds and fractures which will not permit the administration of any standard technique of <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration.</b> Although it is impossible to foresee all unusual conditions, the present investiga-tors attempted to discover some basic maneuv-ers which could be used in most of the situations.

5000|$|First aid {{treatment}} is {{pressure on the}} wound and <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration</b> once the paralysis has disabled the victim's respiratory muscles, which often occurs within minutes of being bitten. Because the venom primarily kills through paralysis, victims are frequently saved if <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration</b> is started and maintained before marked cyanosis and hypotension develop. Efforts should be continued even if the victim appears not to be responding. Respiratory support, together with reassurance, until medical assistance arrives ensures the victims will generally recover.|$|R

50|$|Curare {{poisoning}} can {{be managed}} by <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration</b> such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Yet, curare poisoning mimics the total locked-in syndrome in that there is paralysis of every voluntarily controlled muscle in the body (including the eyes), making it practically impossible for the victim to confirm consciousness while paralyzed.|$|R

50|$|Curare {{poisoning}} mimics a total {{locked-in syndrome}} by causing paralysis of all voluntarily controlled skeletal muscles. The respiratory muscles are also paralyzed, but the victim {{can be kept}} alive by <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration,</b> such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In a study of 29 army volunteers who were paralyzed with curare, <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration</b> managed to keep an oxygen saturation of always above 85%, a level at {{which there is no}} evidence of altered state of consciousness. Spontaneous breathing is resumed after the end of the duration of action of curare, which is generally between 30 minutes and eight hours, depending on the variant of the toxin and dosage.|$|R
