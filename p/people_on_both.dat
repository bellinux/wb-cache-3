25|$|The great {{majority}} of Indians remained in place with independence, but in border areas millions of people (Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu) relocated across the newly drawn borders. In Punjab, where the new border lines divided the Sikh regions in half, there was much bloodshed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was more limited. In all, somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the new borders, among both the refugee and resident populations of the three faiths, died in the violence.|$|E

The Ghanaian Provisional National Defence Council, for example, established road, air, and telecommunications links between Ghana and Burkina.|$|R

25|$|The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) {{recruited}} from Bakongo refugees in Zaire. Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in Léopoldville, and especially {{from a common}} border with Zaire, Angolan political exiles were able {{to build up a}} power base among a large expatriate community from related families, clans, and traditions. <b>People</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo. Though as foreigners skilled Angolans could not take advantage of Mobutu Sese Seko's state employment programme, some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures. The migrants eventually formed the FNLA with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to Angola.|$|E

500|$|In 2016, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov {{commented on}} the global {{significance}} of the match, saying: I think the reason {{you look at these}} matches probably was not so much the chess factor but to the political element, which was inevitable because in the Soviet Union, chess was treated by the Soviet authorities as a very important and useful ideological tool to demonstrate the intellectual superiority of the Soviet communist regime over the decadent West. That’s why the Spassky defeat [...] was treated by <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the Atlantic as a crushing moment {{in the midst of the}} Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu {{refugees}} trekked [...] {{the newly}} drawn borders {{in the months}} surrounding independence. In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the new borders died in the violence. While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta {{in an attempt to}} stem the carnage.

500|$|On 6 March 1946, a {{tentative}} {{agreement was reached}} {{at the last minute}} (with Leclerc's fleet already in the Gulf of Tonkin) between Sainteny and Ho. The agreement stated that France would recognise Vietnam as a free state within the French Union, a new name for the French empire broadly similar to the British Commonwealth, and that Ho would allow France to base 25,000 soldiers in Vietnam for five years. The Ho-Sainteny agreement was never confirmed because it disappointed <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides. Ho's immense prestige largely silenced Vietnamese dissent, but the agreement caused a serious split within the French side. French businessmen, planters, and officials in Saigon were [...] "indignant at the prospect of losing their colonial privileges." ...|$|E

[...] He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the [...] "areas where we have differences with China" [...] and vowed [...] "robust engagement" [...] on human rights if confirmed. The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt [...] "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, {{in a way that}} respects the wishes of the <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> Taiwan and the mainland.

500|$|Relations between British colonists and Native Americans, {{which had}} been {{severely}} strained during the French and Indian War, reached a new low during Pontiac's Rebellion. According to historian David Dixon, [...] "Pontiac's War was unprecedented for its awful violence, as both sides seemed intoxicated with genocidal fanaticism." [...] Historian Daniel Richter characterizes the Native attempt to drive out the British, and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Native Americans from their midst, as parallel examples of ethnic cleansing. <b>People</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the conflict {{had come to the}} conclusion that colonists and Native Americans were inherently different and could not live with each other. According to Richter, the war saw the emergence of [...] "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
