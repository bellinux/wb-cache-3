5|$|Unlike other cnidarians, anemones (and other anthozoans) entirely {{lack the}} free-swimming medusal stage of their lifecycle; the <b>polyp</b> {{produces}} eggs and sperm, and the fertilized egg develops into a planula larva which develops directly into another <b>polyp.</b> Both sexual and asexual reproduction can occur.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarian sexual {{reproduction}} often involves a complex life cycle with both <b>polyp</b> and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a <b>polyp.</b> This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the <b>polyp</b> re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Shortened {{forms of}} this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the <b>polyp</b> stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety of}} life cycles. Some have no <b>polyp</b> stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the <b>polyp</b> and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Nasal <b>polyps</b> {{are usually}} {{classified}} into antrochoanal <b>polyps</b> and ethmoidal <b>polyps.</b> Antrochoanal <b>polyps</b> {{arise from the}} maxillary sinuses and are the much less common; ethmoidal <b>polyps</b> arise from the ethmoidal sinuses.|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} recently {{three cases}} of ureteral <b>polyps</b> including {{a case of}} multiple <b>polyps.</b> The first patient was a 33 -year-old man with multiple <b>polyps</b> at the left upper ureter. The second patient was a 51 -year-old man and the third 49 -year-old man, and both cases were complicated with ureteral stones. We divided 88 ureteral <b>polyps</b> reported in Japan from 1970 to 1990 into <b>polyps</b> in children and those in adults. We further divided the individual <b>polyps</b> into single and multiple <b>polyps</b> and examined them clinically. Characteristic findings were obtained in <b>polyps</b> in children; namely, multiple <b>polyps</b> were dominant, {{almost all of them}} occurred at the left upper ureter and no cases were complicated with ureteral stones. Furthermore, many of the multiple <b>polyps</b> in adults occurred at the left upper ureter and few were complicated with stones as in the children. In conclusion, the ureteral <b>polyps</b> in children and multiple ureteral <b>polyps</b> in adults were similar in character and we presumed that some congenital factors might be involved in their occurrence...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Lesions {{of nasal}} cavity present {{difficulty}} in their diagnosis, prognosis and management because of unusual clinicopathological features. This study {{was done to}} evaluate the nasal <b>polyps</b> with regard to age, sex distribution and histologic types. Methods: The present study included 70 polypoidal lesions of the nasal cavity. The study period constituted from January 2003 to December 2006. All the tissues were fixed in 10 % formalin, processed stained with H & E and studied for various histopathological features. Results: Simple <b>polyps</b> accounted for 88. 57 % of total cases and neoplastic <b>polyps</b> accounted for 11. 42 %. Of the simple <b>polyps</b> non allergic <b>polyps</b> accounted for 58. 06 % and allergic <b>polyps</b> for 41. 93 %. Seventy five percent of neoplastic <b>polyps</b> were benign and 25 % were malignant. All the malignant <b>polyps</b> {{in the study were}} squamous cell carcinomas. Interpretation & Conclusion: The majority of the nasal <b>polyps</b> sent for histology are simple <b>polyps.</b> A variety of benign and malignant lesions of the nasal cavity may present as <b>polyps,</b> hence all <b>polyps</b> need histological examination...|$|R
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{of an individual}} scleractinian <b>polyp</b> {{is known as a}} corallite. It is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of the}} body, and initially forms a cup surrounding this part of the <b>polyp.</b> The interior of the cup contains radially aligned plates, or septa, projecting upwards from the base. Each of these plates is flanked by a pair of mesenteries.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} <b>polyp</b> {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The <b>polyp</b> has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{subdivided}} into three subclasses: Octocorallia, Hexacorallia and Ceriantharia, which form monophyletic groups and generally show differentiating reflections on symmetry of <b>polyp</b> structure for each subclass. The relationships within the subclasses are unresolved.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Current {{recommendations}} on post-polypectomy surveillance recommend shorter intervals {{in case of}} 3 or more <b>polyps,</b> irrespectively of histological findings (see reference below). These recommendations doesn't differentiate between diminutive (1 - 5 mm) <b>polyps</b> and <b>polyps</b> of larger size (> 5 mm). AIMS & METHODS: Aim {{of the present study}} was to assess, in a group of patients with "isolated" diminutive <b>polyps,</b> i. e. without associated <b>polyps</b> of larger size, if the presence of 3 or more diminutive <b>polyps</b> is associated with higher number of <b>polyps</b> with villous histology (VH) or high grade dysplasia (HGD). Retrospective examination of endoscopical records and of histopathological records of patients with diminutive <b>polyps.</b> RESULTS: 315 patients with "isolated" diminutive <b>polyps</b> were identified; 171 patients showed neoplastic (i. e. adenomatous) histology, while remaining showed hyperplastic histology or absence of polypoid features at histology. Data on prevalence of villous component at histology according to number of <b>polyps</b> detected are shown in the table. N° of patients VH HGD TOT N° of <b>polyps</b> (...|$|R

40|$|The massive coral Goniopora tenuidens {{can develop}} {{elongated}} sweeper <b>polyps.</b> These {{are thought to}} be involved in aggressive interactions with neighbouring benthic organ isms, like the sweeper tentacles of other corals. The cnidoms of sweeper <b>polyps</b> and ordinary <b>polyps</b> of G. tenuidens from the Great Barrier Reef were compared. Sweeper <b>polyps</b> had significantly greater densities of elongate holotrichous isorhizas (34577 +/- 3839 /mg; mean +/- SD, n = 6) than ordinary <b>polyps</b> (936 +/- 371 /mg; p < 0. 05), while ordinary <b>polyps</b> had significantly greater densities of spirocysts (75994 +/- 15992 /mg) than sweeper <b>polyps</b> (19469 +/- 7808 /mg; p < 0. 05). This suggests that sweeper <b>polyps</b> of G. tenuidens, like the sweeper tentacles of other corals, are modified for aggression, and that they probably act through nematocyst discharge. However, the scattered distribution of sweeper <b>polyps</b> observed on colonies of G. tenuidens in the field suggests that sweeper <b>polyps</b> may have other functions...|$|R
5|$|Stony corals {{are members}} of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The {{individual}} animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the <b>polyp</b> secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the <b>polyp</b> consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre of the oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls. The <b>polyp</b> is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like retractor muscles.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals {{have a great}} {{range of}} {{reproductive}} strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having {{both male and female}} gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a <b>polyp.</b> In colonial species, this initial <b>polyp</b> then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the <b>polyp,</b> stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the <b>polyp</b> eventually dies.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the pattern of}} Ki- 67, Bcl- 2 and COX- 2 expression in the glandular epithelium and stroma of malignant and benign endometrial <b>polyps</b> in post-menopause. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 390 postmenopausal women underwent surgical hysteroscopy; women with endometrial <b>polyps</b> were included. Polypoid lesions were histologically classified as benign, premalignant or malignant lesions. Ki- 67, Bcl- 2 and COX- 2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry according to percentage of stained cells, staining intensity, and final score. RESULTS: The prevalence of malignancy in endometrial <b>polyps</b> was 7. 1 % and was associated with postmenopausal bleeding. The final score showed that only mean COX- 2 expression was higher in malignant <b>polyps</b> both in the glandular epithelium (6. 1 +/- 2. 5) (p < 0. 001) and stroma (2. 4 +/- 3. 0) (p < 0. 01). There was a higher Bcl- 2 expression, especially in the glandular epithelium, with no differences between benign <b>polyps</b> and premalignant/malignant <b>polyps.</b> Ki- 67 expression was low in both benign <b>polyps</b> and premalignant/malignant <b>polyps.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>Polyps</b> in postmenopause have a high COX- 2 expression that is higher in malignant <b>polyps</b> than in benign <b>polyps.</b> There {{was no difference in}} Ki- 67 and Bcl- 2 expression between malignant <b>polyps</b> and premalignant/malignant <b>polyps.</b> (Anal Quant Cytopathol Histopathol 2012; 34 : 264 - 272...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile <b>polyps</b> are {{regarded}} as hamartomatous <b>polyps</b> and occur in sporadic and familial syndromic settings. There is increased risk of gastrointestinal neoplasia in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms are not known. We therefore studied 78 colorectal juvenile polyposis from 12 patients with juvenile <b>polyps</b> syndrome and 34 sporadic juvenile <b>polyps</b> for epithelial dysplasia and genetic changes associated with colorectal neoplasia. Dysplasia occurred in 31 % of syndromic juvenile <b>polyps</b> but not in sporadic juvenile <b>polyps</b> (P < 0. 0001). Topographic control of proliferation and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 (WAFI/CIP 1) seen in native colorectal epithelium was lost in 79 % of dysplastic juvenile <b>polyps</b> and in 8 % of nondysplastic juvenile <b>polyps</b> (P < 0. 000001). Somatic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene were demonstrated in 50 % of dysplastic juvenile <b>polyps</b> (3 of 6) but not in any of 16 juvenile <b>polyps</b> without dysplasia (P = 0. 01). Both sporadic and syndromic juvenile <b>polyps</b> had K-ras mutations (14 %) {{and there was no}} relationship to dysplasia. p 53 gene product overexpression identified by immunohistochemical staining occurred rarely in dysplastic juvenile <b>polyps</b> (2 of 24, 8 %). Our results indicate that the multiple genetic alterations involved in usual colorectal neoplasia also play a role in neoplastic transformation of juvenile <b>polyps,</b> predominantly in juvenile polyposis syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Gastric <b>polyps</b> are {{frequently}} encountered on endoscopic examinations. While {{many of these}} represent true epithelial lesions, some of the <b>polyps</b> may result from underlying stromal or lymphoid proliferations or even heterotopic tissue. Histologic examination is essential for accurate typing of the <b>polyps</b> to predict malignant potential and underlying possible genetic abnormalities. The focus of this review is on gastric hamartomatous <b>polyps,</b> which are relatively rare and diagnostically challenging. Though most of the gastric hamartomatous <b>polyps</b> are benign, certain types are associated with increased malignant potential. These include certain <b>polyps</b> associated with specific genetic familial polyposis syndromes and gastric inverted hamartomatous <b>polyps.</b> Identification of these <b>polyps</b> can result in the prevention or early diagnosis of gastric carcinoma and also help {{in the identification of}} family members with polyposis syndromes.

5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of coral kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small <b>polyp</b> stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large <b>polyp</b> stony coral is a sort of compromise between the two.|$|E
5|$|Corals are sessile {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of the animal is a <b>polyp.</b> Most corals are colonial, the initial <b>polyp</b> budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and water movement being significant.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism {{refers to}} the {{occurrence}} of structurally and functionally more than {{two different types of}} individuals within the same organism. It is a characteristic feature of Cnidarians, particularly the <b>polyp</b> and medusa forms, or of zooids within colonial organisms like those in Hydrozoa. In Hydrozoans, colonial individuals arising from individuals zooids will take on separate tasks.|$|E

50|$|Juvenile <b>polyps</b> are hamartomatous <b>polyps</b> {{which often}} become evident before {{twenty years of}} age, but {{can also be seen}} in adults. They are usually solitary <b>polyps</b> found in the rectum which most {{commonly}} present with rectal bleeding. Juvenile polyposis syndrome is characterised by the presence of more than five <b>polyps</b> in the colon or rectum, or numerous juvenile <b>polyps</b> throughout the gastrointestinal tract, or any number of juvenile <b>polyps</b> in any person with a family history of juvenile polyposis. People with juvenile polyposis have an increased risk of colon cancer.|$|R
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of a stony coral in the order Scleractinia is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of}} the polyp; this forms a corallite, a cup-shaped hollow made of calcium carbonate, in which the <b>polyp</b> sits. In colonial corals, following growth of the <b>polyp</b> by budding, new corallites are formed, with the surface of the skeleton being covered by a layer of coenosarc. These colonies adopt a range of massive, branching, leaf-like and encrusting forms. Soft corals in the subclass Octocorallia are also colonial and have a skeleton formed of mesogloeal tissue, often reinforced with calcareous spicules or horny material, and some have rod-like supports internally. Other anthozoans, such as sea anemones, are naked; these rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support. Some of these species have a sticky epidermis to which sand grains and shell fragments adhere, and zoanthids incorporate these substances into their mesogloea.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each <b>polyp</b> having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a <b>polyp</b> broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means one has the basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E
40|$|Prewarmed saline enemas and transabdominal {{ultrasound}} (hydrosonography) {{were used}} to evaluate 17 consecutive children with rectal bleeding before colonoscopy. Twelve patients with <b>polyps</b> were identified (10 by ultrasound, 10 by endoscopy) : these included multiple hyperplastic <b>polyps</b> (1), multiple <b>polyps</b> (1), solitary <b>polyps</b> (9), and pseudopolyps (1). Ultrasound identified 11 <b>polyps</b> in 10 patients, missing two patients with small <b>polyps</b> less than 0. 5 cm in diameter. The <b>polyps</b> were hyperechoic ovoid masses fixed to the colonic wall, with a stalk (7), submucosal infolding (5), and intraluminal floating (5). There was one false positive. Colonoscopy was refused by one patient and failed to reach beyond the distal sigmoid in another following previous surgery for malrotation. Colonoscopy was superior in identifying finer mucosal detail (colitis, ulcers, proctitis, anal fissure) and in detecting smaller <b>polyps</b> (sessile <b>polyps,</b> hyperplastic <b>polyps).</b> Hydrosonography of the colon is a simple, relatively non-invasive procedure that provides an alternative, radiation-free examination of the whole colon before colonoscopy.

40|$|Background/Aim: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} serrated colorectal <b>polyps</b> in the King AbdulAziz University Hospital population and to review the current classification of colorectal serrated <b>polyps</b> with emphasis on morphological features. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study used cases diagnosed with serrated colorectal <b>polyps</b> at the histopathology laboratory of King AbdulAziz University Hospital during last five years (2004 - 2008). The slides were reexamined microscopically and the lesions were renamed according to the terminology discussed in this article. Results: Diagnosed hyperplastic <b>polyps</b> represented 12. 3 &#x 0025; of all colorectal <b>polyps</b> submitted to our laboratory during the study period. However, the false positive rate {{was found to be}} 42. 5 &#x 0025;.

40|$|Aim-To {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) {{in a series of}} hyperplastic <b>polyps,</b> serrated adenomas, and mixed <b>polyps</b> of the colorectum. Methods-DNA was extracted from samples of 73 colorectal <b>polyps</b> comprising tubular adenomas (23), hyperplastic <b>polyps</b> (21), serrated adenomas (17), and mixed <b>polyps</b> (12). The presence of MSI was investigated at six loci: MYCL, D 2 S 123, F 13 B, BAT- 40, BAT- 26, and c-myb T 22, using polymerase chain reaction based methodology. MSI cases were classified as MSI-Low (MSI-L) and MSI-High (MSI-H), {{based on the number of}} affected loci. Results-The frequency of MSI increased in tubular adenomas (13 %), hyperplastic <b>polyps</b> (29 %), serrated adenomas (53 %), and mixed <b>polyps</b> (83 %) (Wilcoxon rank sum statistic, p < 0. 001). Hyperplastic epithelium was present in nine of 12 mixed <b>polyps</b> and showed MSI in eight of these. MSI was mostly MSI-L. MSI-H occurred in two serrated adenomas and three mixed <b>polyps.</b> Clonal relations were demonstrated between hyperplastic and dysplastic epithelium in four of eight informative mixed <b>polyps.</b> Conclusions-The findings support the view that hyperplastic <b>polyps</b> may be fundamentally neoplastic rather than hyperplastic. A proportion of hyperplastic <b>polyps</b> may serve as a precursor of a subset (10 %) of colorectal cancers showing the MSI-L phenotype, albeit through the intermediate step of serrated dysplasia. This represents a novel and distinct morphogenetic pathway for colorectal cancer...|$|R
5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new <b>polyp</b> {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E

The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks.

Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E
