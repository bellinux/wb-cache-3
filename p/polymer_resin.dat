25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the {{transmission electron microscope}} {{is the need for}} extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a focused ion beam. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a <b>polymer</b> <b>resin</b> to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.|$|E

The amine-terminated <b>polymer</b> <b>resins</b> {{will not}} have any {{intentional}} hydroxyl moieties. Any hydroxyls are the result of incomplete conversion to the amine-terminated <b>polymer</b> <b>resins.</b> The resin blend may also contain additives, or non-primary components. These additives may contain hydroxyls, such as pre-dispersed pigments in a polyol carrier. Normally, the resin blend will not contain a catalyst(s).|$|R

2500|$|AMPs can be covalently {{bound to}} a surface, which {{minimizes}} the [...] "leaching effect" [...] of peptides. The peptide is typically attached {{by a very}} exergonic chemical reaction, thus forming a very stable antimicrobial surface. The surface can be functionalized first with a <b>polymer</b> <b>resin</b> such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Recent {{research has focused on}} producing synthetic polymers and nanomaterials with similar mechanisms of action to endogenous antimicrobial peptides.|$|E
2500|$|Plastics {{extrusion}} commonly uses plastic chips or pellets, {{which are}} usually dried, to drive out moisture, in a hopper {{before going to the}} feed screw. The <b>polymer</b> <b>resin</b> is heated to molten state by a combination of heating elements and shear heating from the extrusion screw. [...] The screw, or screws as the case with twin screw extrusion, forces the resin through a die, forming the resin into the desired shape. The extrudate is cooled and solidified as it is pulled through the die or water tank. A [...] "caterpillar haul-off" [...] (called a [...] "puller" [...] in the US) is used to provide tension on the extrusion line which is essential for overall quality of the extrudate. Pelletizers can also create this tension while pulling extruded strands in to be cut. The caterpillar haul-off must provide a consistent pull; otherwise, variation in cut lengths or distorted product will result. [...] In some cases (such as fibre-reinforced tubes) the extrudate is pulled through a very long die, in a process called [...] "pultrusion". The configuration of the interior screws are a driving force dependent on the application. Mixing elements or convey elements are used in various formations. Extrusion is common in the application of adding colorant to molten plastic thus creating specific custom color.|$|E

The prepolymer, or quasi-prepolymer, can be made of an amine-terminated <b>polymer</b> <b>resin,</b> or a hydroxyl-terminated <b>polymer</b> <b>resin.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Polymer</b> <b>resins</b> with immobilized metal {{nanoparticles}} represent highly promising {{materials for}} attaining intelligent and ecologically friendly catalysts.

This paper presents a study on the distinct role of the polymer support. Here, the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was chosen as a model reaction, and nanoparticles of different metals were taken into account. The course of the reaction revealed the essential role of the <b>polymer</b> <b>resins</b> in controlling the diffusion, in particular of the reagents, to and from the catalytically active sites {{on the surface of the}} nanoparticles thereby influencing the catalytic activity of the metal and opening up a new approach to catalytic engineering...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational procedure for producing tailor made <b>polymer</b> <b>resins,</b> satisfying customers' needs while operating with maximum profit. The {{case study is}} an industrial large-scale polymerization reactor. The molecular properties considered are melt index (MI), which measures the molecular weight distribution, and stress exponent (SE), which is related to polydispersity. An economic objective function is associated to a deterministic mathematical model and the resulting optimization problem is solved by genetic algorithm (GA), a stochastic method. The GA parameters for both binary and real codifications are tuned {{by means of the}} design of experiments. Attempting to achieve the global optimum, a hybrid method, which introduces process knowledge into GA random initial population, is proposed. The binary codification performs better than the real GA, especially with hybridization.
