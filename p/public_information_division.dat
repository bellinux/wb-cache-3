40|$|In {{a beauty}} contest framework, welfare can {{decrease}} with <b>public</b> <b>information</b> if {{the precision of}} private information is exogenous, whereas welfare necessarily increases with <b>public</b> <b>information</b> if the precision is endogenous with linear costs of information acquisition. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to reconcile these results by considering nonlinear costs of information acquisition. The main result of this paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for welfare to increase with <b>public</b> <b>information.</b> Using it, we show that costs of information acquisition are linear if and only if welfare necessarily increases with <b>public</b> <b>information.</b> Thus, welfare can decrease with <b>public</b> <b>information</b> for any strictly convex costs. This is because convex costs mitigate the so-called crowding-out effect of <b>public</b> <b>information</b> on private information, thereby making the social value of <b>public</b> <b>information</b> with endogenous precision closer to that with exogenous precision...|$|R
