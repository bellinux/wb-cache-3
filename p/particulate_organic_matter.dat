Observations were carried out in summer season at the five stations set up in Harima-nada of Seto Inland Sea. It appears more likely that the lowering level of dissolved oxygen in bottom water depends mainly on the reductive conditions of bottom mud and ensuing the accumulation of organic acids and sulfides, rather than on the sedimentation of <b>particulated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> on sea bottom. Based on the results obtained in this study, discussed the mechanism of lowering of dissolved oxygen in bottom water.

40|$|Wet {{detention}} ponds are {{storm water}} control structures providing both retention {{and treatment of}} contaminated storm water runoff. A typical wet detention pond design is shown in Figure 1. The pond consists of a permanent pool of water into which storm water runoff is directed. Runoff from each rain event is detained and treated in the pond until it is displaced by runoff from the next storm. By capturing and retaining runoff during storm events, wet detention ponds control both storm water quantity and quality. The pond’s natural physical, biological, and chemical processes then work to remove pollutants. Sedimentation processes remove <b>particulates,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> and metals, while dissolved metals and nutrients are removed through biological uptake.

The role of ecosystems on the POC export toward sediments or offshore areas was actually highlighted and feedbacks between ecosystems and <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> are proposed to explain paradoxical model results to the sensitivity test. In fact, the conversion of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in living organisms would increase the retention of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the food web and this matter transfer along the food web could explain the minor quantity of POC of marine origin observed in the shelf sediments. Thus, the effective carbon deposition on the shelf might be strongly dependent on the zooplankton presence in the GoL. Owing to their fertilizing ability in phosphorus, the LSW lenses could then have indirectly a negative impact on the carbon deposition on the shelf by favouring the development of large phytoplankton fuelling in turn zooplankton communities. The effective carbon deposition would then be delayed out of the GoL, unless a novel transfer of matter occurs toward higher trophic levels further in the open sea through small pelagic fishes...|$|R
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of bacteria in lakes and ponds obtain their energy by decomposing vegetation and animal matter. [...] In the pelagic zone, dead fish and the occasional allochthonous input of litterfall are examples of coarse <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (CPOM>1mm). [...] Bacteria degrade these into fine <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (FPOM<1nbsp&mm) and then further into usable nutrients.

[...] Very low concentrations of nutrients are released during decomposition because the bacteria are utilizing them {{to build their own}} biomass. [...] Bacteria, however, are consumed by protozoa, which are in turn consumed by zooplankton, and then further up the trophic levels. [...] Nutrients, including those that contain carbon and phosphorus, are reintroduced into the water column at any number of points along this food chain via excretion or organism death, making them available again for bacteria.

2500|$|According to the RCC, low ordered {{sites are}} small shaded streams where {{allochthonous}} inputs of CPOM are a necessary resource for consumers. [...] As the river widens at mid-ordered sites, energy inputs should change. [...] Ample sunlight should reach {{the bottom in}} these systems to support significant periphyton production. [...] Additionally, the biological processing of CPOM (Coarse <b>Particulate</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Matter</b> - larger than 1nbsp&mm) inputs at upstream sites is expected to result in the transport of large amounts of FPOM (Fine <b>Particulate</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Matter</b> - smaller than 1nbsp&mm) to these downstream ecosystems. [...] Plants should become more abundant at edges of the river with increasing river size, especially in lowland rivers where finer sediments have been deposited and facilitate rooting. The main channels likely have too much current and turbidity {{and a lack of}} substrate to support plants or periphyton. [...] Phytoplankton should produce the only autochthonous inputs here, but photosynthetic rates will be limited due to turbidity and mixing. [...] Thus, allochthonous inputs are expected to be the primary energy source for large rivers. This FPOM will come from both upstream sites via the decomposition process and through lateral inputs from floodplains.|$|E

2500|$|Saturn's largest moon Titan {{is known}} to have {{extensive}} fields of dunes, though the origin of the material forming the dunes is not known - it could be small fragments of water ice eroded by flowing methane, or possibly <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> that formed in Titan's atmosphere and rained down on the surface. [...] Scientists are beginning to call this loose icy material regolith because of the mechanical similarity with regolith on other bodies, although traditionally (and etymologically) the term had been applied only when the loose layer was composed of mineral grains like quartz or plagioclase or rock fragments that were in turn composed of such minerals. [...] Loose blankets of ice grains were not considered to be regolith because when they appear on Earth in the form of snow they behave differently from regolith, the grains melting and fusing with only small changes in pressure or temperature. [...] However, Titan is so cold that ice behaves like rock. Thus there is an ice-regolith complete with erosion and aeolian and/or sedimentary processes.|$|E

40|$|The {{elemental}} and {{isotopic composition}} of <b>particulate</b> and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> {{was investigated in}} the Piracicaba River basin, São Paulo State, Brazil. Comparison of riverine <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> from the Piracicaba River basin, a region where rivers and streams receive urban sewage and industrial effluents, with data reported for the pristine Amazon system revealed significant differences associated with anthropogenic impacts. One important difference was N enrichment in the <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> material of the Piracicaba basin rivers, due to (a) urban and industrial effluents, and (b) enhanced phytoplankton growth, which results from the combination of nutrient enrichment and damming of sections of the rivers. Radiocarbon concentrations were overall more depleted (older 14 C age) in the Piracicaba basin rivers than in the Amazon, which may reflect the importance of soil erosion in the former. Analyses of stable and radioactive carbon isotopes and lignin-derived compounds indicated that coarse <b>particulate</b> <b>organic</b> material is composed of a mixture of soil particles and degraded <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> from C 3 and C 4 vascular plants.

The scheme allows for production and degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> by both photic and aphotic processes with transformation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to increasingly refractory forms. The proposed scheme was compared to 10 [*]months of experimental observations of the turnover and fate of <b>particulate</b> and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in stream water from a peat-covered catchment. The scheme was able to explain average decline in DOC concentration of 65 % over 70 [*]h with a 13 % mean average percentage error based on turnover in three types of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (<b>particulate,</b> labile dissolved, and refractory dissolved) although the order and rate of reactions did change between sets of experimental observations.

40|$|Patterns {{of habitat}} use by spider crab juveniles, Maja brachydactila, from two {{geographic}} {{areas in the}} NW coast of the Iberian Peninsula, were analyzed through the analysis of Carbon and Nitrogen stable isotope relations in two tissues (muscle and hepatopancreas). The main organisms that constitute the diet of spider crab juveniles in rocky and sandy habitats and the different <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> sources in coastal food webs were analysed too. The isotopic ratios of C and N did not show any difference between habitats. The use of carapace colour and epibiosis {{as an indicator of}} habitat use was not supported by our data. These results suggest much more frequent movements between both types of habitats than those suggested by former studies (carried out using behavioural observations and sampling distributions) that hypothesized seasonal and ontogenetic changes. In the coastal food web, two main trophic compartments were identified according to the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> source: one based in plankton and seaweeds, that corresponds, mainly, with rocky habitats, and another based in sedimentary <b>particulated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> that correspond with sandy bottoms. The relationships observed between the C and N isotopic ratios and the proportions of lipids and proteins in muscle and hepatopancreas seem to indicate a clear relation between the trophic origin of the food consumed by the spider crab juveniles and its energetic condition, and the individuals that spent more time feeding in sandy areas would show a better energetic condition. Juveniles of Maja brachydactila, independently of the habitat of capture, would consume in average approximately two thirds of the preys in rocky habitats and a third in sedimentary habitats.
