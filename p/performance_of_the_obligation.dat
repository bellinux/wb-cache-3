The accord is the agreement to discharge the obligation and the satisfaction is the legal [...] "consideration" [...] which binds the parties to the agreement. A valid accord does not discharge the prior contract; instead it suspends the right to enforce it in accordance with the terms of the accord contract, in which satisfaction, or performance of the contract will discharge both contracts (the original and the accord).

This provision is slightly problematic on a theoretical level in two ways. First, ‘matters relating to a contract‘ lacks, although the European Court of Justice (ECJ) considers it as an [...] "independent" [...] and thus 'European' concept, a clear or uniform definition.

Second, 'the place of performance' lacks an independent European concept as well. However, unlike 'matters relating to a contract', the Regulation does contain a harmonisation of 'the place of performance' for two categories of (common) contracts in Article 5(1)b of the Regulation: sale of goods and the provision of services. However, Article 5(1)c (2012 recast: Article 7(1)c) of the Regulation defines that if the conditions for Article 5(1)b (2012 recast: Article 7(1)b) are not fulfilled, the standard provision of Article 5(1)a is applicable again, making the national law for defining ‘the place for performance’, {{in the absence of a}} uniform concept, take over.|$|E

The current study aims to review the experience gained with the quota obligation system. The report {{provides an overview of}} the regions where obligation systems have been implemented and contains a detailed evaluation of the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> systems in the USA, the UK and in Sweden. The obligation systems in these countries have been evaluated based on the following criteria: Effectiveness; Market efficiency; Certainty for the renewable energy industry; Cost effectiveness; Stakeholder support for the obligation system; and Equity. The evaluation of international experiences with the obligation system gives rise to a mixed picture. Although an obligation in theory is effective and cost effective, it seems too early to conclude that the system delivers these promises in practice. On the one hand {{this is due to the}} limited period of implementation that makes it hard to distinguish between the direct effect of the system and some teething problems that will be solved in due time. On the other hand, the conclusion can be drawn that the obligation is a complex system, which will only function well if designed carefully. It does seem worthwhile, however, to continue monitoring the experiences with the obligation system abroad, because this will further reveal whether the system is indeed effective and cost effective in practice. In the longer term, e. g. beyond 2010, the introduction of an obligation system in the Netherlands could be considered. Finally, as the design of support schemes is being improved, it appears that the basic concepts of both the obligation system and the feed in system have been refined in such a way that the two systems are gradually converging. An important difference between the two systems however remains, namely that an obligation system relies more on market forces whereas the feed-in system is based on a greater involvement of the government...|$|E

International uniform law envisages {{a number}} of {{situations}} in which a breach {{is said to have}} occurred prior to the time agreed upon for performance. In the area of international sales contracts, arts. 71, 72, and 73 (2) of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (hereafter "CISG"), applicable to both the buyer and the seller, lay down, on the one hand, the situations in which an anticipatory breach is deemed to have occurred and, on the other hand, the remedies available to the aggrieved party. In other words, these provisions designate the circumstances in which, even though no breach of contract has yet been committed and the time for <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> has not yet elapsed, a party may, in order to protect his own interests, temporarily stop complying with his contractual obligations or completely free himself from those obligations. In this respect, arts. 71, 72, and 73 (2) CISG differ from arts. 49 and 64 CISG, which govern the right of the aggrieved party to avoid the contract when performance is overdue, that is when the other party has actually committed a fundamental breach of contract. Under art. 71 CISG, if it becomes apparent that one party will not perform a substantial part of his obligation, the other party may suspend performance of his obligations. The innocent party is however compelled to restore performance if the other party provides adequate assurance of performance. Such assurance may be considered adequate even if it shows that performance might not be complete and perfect. Furthermore, the failure, by one party, to provide adequate assurance of performance does not constitute, in itself, a fundamental breach, and consequently does not authorize the other party to declare the contract avoided. In turn, the conditions that ought to be satisfied, under art. 72 CISG, for the innocent party to be entitled to declare the contract avoided, are more onerous than those of art. 71 CISG. They require that the future occurrence of the breach be objectively "clear" (rather than just "apparent") and that the suspected breach be of fundamental nature. Furthermore, in the case of art. 72 CISG, the innocent party must give notice to the other party prior to the declaration of avoidance, in order to allow the latter party to provide adequate assurance of performance...|$|E

40|$|A presente dissertação trata do direito de preferência para a celebração de negócios jurídicos, em geral translatícios de propriedade, que não encontra definição expressa no Código Civil, muito embora diversos dispositivos legais aludam ao referido direito. Na medida em que limita a liberdade contratual do vinculado à prelação, no tocante à escolha do outro contraente, a preferência, de origem legal ou negocial, atribui ao sujeito ativo da relação prelatícia o direito de ser preferido. Para tal, exige-se que o vinculado à preferência tenha decidido, de maneira livre e inequívoca, celebrar um contrato preferível, e que a sua intenção se tenha materializado, com a presença de um terceiro efetivamente interessado em com ele contratar. Constituído o direito do preferente, o que em geral chega a seu conhecimento por meio de notificação extrajudicial remetida pelo obrigado à prelação, pode aquele manifestar interesse em preferir, ou não. No primeiro caso, nasce na esfera jurídica do vinculado à prelação o dever de com ele contratar, nos mesmos termos e condições ajustados com terceiro. Dever este cuja violação, a depender da eficácia, real ou obrigacional, da preferência, possibilitará ao sujeito ativo perseguir não só as perdas e danos por ele eventualmente sofridas em decorrência do desrespeito a seu direito, como também, cumulativamente, lhe facultará exigir o cumprimento específico da obrigação. Neste último caso, o negócio jurídico celebrado entre o obrigado à preferência e terceiro será, perante o preferente, inoponível. This thesis {{examines}} {{rights of}} first refusal {{to enter into}} a business transaction, generally involving the transfer of property. Rights of first refusal are not specifically defined in the Brazilian Civil Code, although various provisions of the Code allude to them. While on one hand rights of first refusal, whether legal or contractual in origin, limit the contractual freedom of the obligor, by restricting his choice of contracting parties, on the other they generate a preference or option in the right holder to conclude the transaction contemplated by the right. Before this preference or option can be exercised, however, the obligor must have formed the free and unmistakable intention to enter into the business transaction subject to the right of first refusal, and this intention must be made manifest in relation to a third party that is effectively interested in making the contract. The holder of the right of first refusal usually becomes aware that the right has become exercisable by notice sent by the obligor, and in response the right holder is required to state whether the right will be exercised or not. If the right is exercised, a new obligation arises {{on the part of the}} obligor to enter into the transaction with the right holder, on the same terms and conditions agreed with the third party. Depending on whether the right of first refusal is personal or real in nature, violation of this obligation can give rise not only to the right to reparation of losses suffered as a consequence of the breach, but also the right to demand specific <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation,</b> in which case any transaction made between the obligor and a third party will be unenforceable against the holder of the right of first refusal...|$|E

Not only it analyzes <b>the</b> current state <b>of</b> law and case law but tries to interpret Act No 89 / 2012 Coll., New Civil Code. First part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis aims at the preconditions for set-off. Firstly, <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> set-off of foreign currency claims in New Civil Code is discussed. It also reflects upon the long standing discussion of set-off of due rights against rights which are not due. Then it proceeds to new precondition for set-off - certainty of rights.

40|$|Frustration {{of purpose}} is a defense to <b>the</b> {{enforcement}} <b>of</b> a contractual obligation. Legal systems generally provide this defense when an unforeseen event undermines a party’s purpose for entering into a contract. In many legal systems {{frustration of purpose}} is often treated and discussed jointly with <b>the</b> related doctrine <b>of</b> impossibility, which concerns situations where unforeseen events render impossible (practical impossibility) or far more burdensome (economical impossibility) <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> specified in <b>the</b> contract. Although different in their substance, <b>the</b> economic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doctrines <b>of</b> frustration and impossibility share a common logic. In the following analysis we shall therefore treat these doctrines together. When unexpected contingencies occur during <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> a contract, {{there may be a}} divergence between what parties have expressly agreed upon in the contract and what they have implicitly assumed was their contractual obligation in terms of assumption of risk. In other words, when there is a period <b>of</b> time between <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract and <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties, there may be a fundamental change of circumstances that makes <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract far more burdensome, or even physically impossible, for one party, or that completely frustrates <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract for one party. The event that causes the change is, as said, unexpected or unforeseen and is not explicitly referred to in the parties’ agreement. If it were in the parties’ agreement, the general rules on breach of contract would apply. In all <b>of</b> these cases, <b>the</b> overarching question is whether the burdened party should be obligated to perform (or, if her performance has become impossible, pay damages) or whether she may be allowed to escape contractual liability by resorting to one of several “contract defenses. ” Such defenses might include the rebus sic stantibus (“all the things thus standing”) clause under which a party’s <b>obligation</b> under <b>the</b> contract is required only when conditions are the same as they were when the contract was formed...|$|R

50|$|Before <b>the</b> {{enactment}} <b>of</b> IRC 5891, {{which became}} effective on July 1, 2002, some states regulated <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> structured settlement payment rights, while others did not. Most states that regulated transfers {{at this time}} followed a general pattern, substantially similar {{to the present day}} process which is mandated in IRC 5891 (see below for more details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-2002 process). However, <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfers processed from 1988 to 2002 were not court ordered. After negotiating <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transaction (including the payments to be sold and the price to be paid for those payments), a formal purchase contract was executed, effecting an assignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject payments upon closing. Part of this assignment process also included <b>the</b> grant <b>of</b> a security interest in the structured settlement payments, to secure <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seller’s <b>obligations.</b> Filing a public lien based on that security agreement created notice of this assignment and interest. The insurance company issuing the structured settlement annuity checks was typically not given actual notice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer, due to antagonism by the insurance industry against factoring and transfer companies. Many annuity issuers were concerned that factoring transactions, which were not contemplated when Congress enacted section 130, might upset <b>the</b> tax treatment <b>of</b> qualified assignments. House of Representatives Bill 2884 (discussed below) resolved this question for annuity issuers.|$|R
5000|$|In their {{decision}} in Makdessi the Supreme Court reviewed <b>the</b> historical origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule against penalty clauses in contracts. [...] The law {{originated in the}} fifteenth century in relation to [...] "defeasible bonds" [...] (sometimes called penal bonds) which were a contractual promise to pay money, which might be discharged if certain obligations were performed (and if <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> were not performed, then the payment terms under the bond could be enforced). [...] However <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> equity regarded these as what they really were - security for <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>obligation</b> - and were prepared to restrain enforcement of such bonds where the defaulting party paid any damages due at common law. [...] In time <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> common law began to mirror this approach and stay any proceedings on such bonds where the defendant gave an undertaking to pay damages together with interest and costs. <b>The</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common law courts was adopted and codified in <b>the</b> Administration <b>of</b> Justice Act 1696 and later <b>the</b> Administration <b>of</b> Justice Act 1705. Accordingly, procedurally relief in relation to such bonds was thereafter administered entirely by the common law courts without intervention by <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> equity. However, <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> equity began to develop concurrent remedies for relief from forfeiture. With <b>the</b> decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> defeasible bonds <b>the</b> procedural mechanics became increasingly applied to liquidated damages clauses.|$|R
40|$|Interpretative {{practices}} between {{legal systems}} and domestic courts vary widely. This inevitably will affect <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> rules {{of international law}} by domestic courts. The question is whether there are good grounds for national courts to limit divergence of interpretations, by relying on international principles of interpretation. This paper explores three possible grounds on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> which domestic courts can resort to an application of international rules <b>of</b> interpretation: <b>the</b> effective <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> treaty <b>obligations,</b> <b>the</b> international quality <b>of</b> domesticated norms, and <b>the</b> external authority <b>of</b> decisions <b>of</b> domestic courts. <b>The</b> paper argues that, depending on <b>the</b> context, each <b>of</b> these grounds may offer a justification for relying on international rules of interpretation, but that competing considerations may pull in diverging directions, and that <b>the</b> international rules <b>of</b> treaty interpretation do not necessarily preclude this...|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{research}} is to study <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employee. <b>The</b> <b>performance,</b> namely the relationship between time spent on performance and achievement, helps to define <b>the</b> fulfilment <b>of</b> employee’s obligation: <b>the</b> work {{is not likely to}} satisfy <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employer if it does not produce an utility. The majority doctrine denies that performance has a significance of its own in employer-employee relationship: according to the majority orientation <b>performance</b> is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to diligence as defined in article 2104 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Code. Instead, examining <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employment contract and the relationship between diligence and performance, research has led to the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> opinion as to <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service that finds its legal basis, not in <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to diligence, but in <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to collaboration, enshrined in article 2094 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Code that requires the employee must cooperate by carrying out a profit. Starting from <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> case law on a lack <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> I have examined its consequences in the employer-employee relationship. Finally, research has deepened <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> as a parameter for determining pay in order to reward the employee who stands out for its productivity...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to analyse the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> jurisdiction applicable to the cases arising from contracts concluded by electronic means (e-contracts). Considering <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> foreign origin that often affect this type <b>of</b> contracts, and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> a global agreement regarding international jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement <b>of</b> judgements, <b>the</b> objectives pursued by the author are:- identification of rules of jurisdiction applicable to the cases arising from e-contracts,- identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation,- issuing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> de lege ferenda proposals. At European Union level, according to <b>the</b> provisions <b>of</b> Brussels I Regulation, as a general rule, actions against a person domiciled in a Member State shall be brought to <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> that State. According to the same Regulation, cases resulting from a contractual relationship may be decided by <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contractual <b>obligation.</b> In lack of specific jurisdictional rules, the above rules apply to B 2 B e-contracts. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> B 2 C e-contracts, the consumer can bring proceedings either before <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Member State <b>of</b> his domicile or before <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Member State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defendant’s domicile. The consumer can only be sued in <b>the</b> Member State <b>of</b> his domicile. <b>The</b> rules protecting the consumer apply if the trader ‘directs its activities’ to the Member State in which the consumer is domiciled. If the defendant is not domiciled in a Member State, the international jurisdiction is determined, in each Member State, according to its national rules of international private laws...|$|R
