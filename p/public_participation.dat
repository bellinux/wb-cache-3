5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active {{religious}} life may have been more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an important part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{original}} Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed {{greater emphasis on}} conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater <b>public</b> <b>participation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} {{considered as a}} recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities – the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of <b>public</b> <b>participation</b> in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human–animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered {{an integral part of}} the ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|A crucial {{debate is}} under way {{concerning}} the <b>public's</b> <b>participation</b> in biotechnology decision-making processes.

Drawing on interviews with actors involved in XTP in each country, we analyse and explain the inclusion and exclusion of publics in policy decision-making processes. In particular, we highlight the significance of the role of scientists and politicians in generating discourses which exclude the <b>public</b> from <b>participation</b> in policy decision-making...|$|R
5|$|On December 3, 1855, the {{legislature}} convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation {{to move the}} capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, {{the legislature}} re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask {{the people of the}} territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a runoff. The initial vote set up a runoff between Eugene and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low <b>public</b> <b>participation,</b> the election was ignored, and the capital remained in Salem.|$|E
