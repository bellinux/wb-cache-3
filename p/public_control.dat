5|$|The {{construction}} and {{opening of the}} Erie Canal in 1825 along the same alignment as the Albany to Buffalo route began to eat away at the revenues of these turnpike companies. In time, the turnpike business had become unprofitable and the companies were dissolved by 1852, causing the roads to revert to <b>public</b> <b>control.</b> The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852. The old, southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus, NY175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill, and NY173 from there east to Chittenango.|$|E
5|$|As Energy Minister, Baird was {{entrusted}} with implementing the government's plan {{to sell off}} part of Ontario's Hydro One. A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly {{in many parts of}} the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government's price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer. Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap. The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office. The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves announced that Hydro One would remain under <b>public</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

5|$|To {{protect the}} UERL group's income, its {{chairman}} Lord Ashfield lobbied {{the government for}} regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison {{at the forefront of}} debates as to the level of regulation and <b>public</b> <b>control</b> under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC's tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The Board was a compromise– public ownership but not full nationalisation– and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the LER and the other Underground companies were liquidated.|$|E

25|$|According to its supporters, {{any attempt}} to solve global {{problems}} is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand {{some or all of}} the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing international organisations, e.g. the United Nations, as well as the creation of new institutions such as a World Parliament, which ideally would enhance <b>public</b> <b>control</b> over, and accountability in, international politics.|$|E
25|$|The period {{also brought}} another scandal: Ghenadie found himself {{at odds with}} parts of the establishment, {{at a time when}} the Orthodox Church was being governed under a new statute, {{allowing}} for extended <b>public</b> <b>control</b> exercised by civilian members of the Synod. The statute was hotly opposed by members of the clergy: as Protosyngel Miron Cristea noted in 1909, Ghenadie's rule coincided with a nadir for the nation's clergymen. Metropolitan Iosif's own criticism of such legislation, as endorsed by the Conservatives, had been a factor in his decision to leave office. Shortly before coming to power as Prime Minister, Sturdza spoke out against the new legislation.|$|E

Philip Snowden was a rigid exponent of orthodox finance and would not permit any deficit spending to stimulate the economy, despite the urgings of Oswald Mosley, David Lloyd George and the economist John Maynard Keynes. Mosley put forward a memorandum in January 1930, calling for the <b>public</b> <b>control</b> of imports and banking {{as well as an}} increase in pensions to boost spending power. When this was repeatedly turned down, Mosley resigned from the government in February 1931 and formed the New Party. He later converted to Fascism.|$|E
25|$|Many {{transit systems}} in the United States were {{changing}} from private to <b>public</b> <b>control</b> in the 1950s, as growth in private-car ownership and other factors made the provision of mass transit service an increasingly difficult business in which to make a profit. By 1962, all but two major West Coast cities had made the change and begun subsidizing transit, {{and one of those}} two exceptions was Portland, served by the Rose City Transit Company (with San Diego being the other). By 1967, RCT was the last remaining privately owned big-city transit system on the West Coast, after San Diego Transit became municipalized. Rose City Transit's annual ridership declined from 32.3million in 1956 to 15.7million in 1968.|$|E
25|$|Tacoma's {{relationship}} with public utilities extends back to 1893. At {{that time the}} city was undergoing a boom in population, causing it to exceed the available amount of fresh water supplied by Charles B. Wright's Tacoma Light & Water Company. In response to both this demand and a growing desire to have local <b>public</b> <b>control</b> over the utility system, the city council put up a public vote to acquire and expand the private utility. The measure passed on July 1, 1893, with 3,195 in favor of acquiring the utility system and 1,956 voting against. Since then, Tacoma Public Utilities (TPU) {{has grown from a}} small water and light utility to be the largest department in the city's government, employing about 1,200 people.|$|E

25|$|By 1858, {{the turnpike}} had {{basically}} begun to fold, with tolls only being charged at one gate {{for several years}} as most traffic had moved to rails rather than road. That year however, there were some upgrades made to the road, but not by much. In 1867, the competitor Camden and Amboy Railroad merged with the United New Jersey Railroad {{to create a new}} company. In December 1871, that company then became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, {{which was one of the}} major railroads at that point. The railroad also took over jurisdiction of the turnpike. In 1899, people from Trenton and nearby Penns Neck approached the railroad to help reconstruct the old turnpike road, but no full proposal ever came forward. By 1903, the 1804 charter had expired, and the roadway was placed under <b>public</b> <b>control,</b> but was still in a derelict condition.|$|E
25|$|The magistrates {{were people}} who {{occupied}} a public post and formed {{the administration of the}} Athenian state. They were submitted to rigorous <b>public</b> <b>control.</b> The magistrates were chosen by lot, using fava beans. Black and white beans were put in a box and depending on which color the person drew out they obtained the post or not. This was a way of eliminating the personal influence of rich people and possible intrigues and use of favors. There were only two categories of posts not chosen by lot, but by election in the Popular Assembly. These were strategos, or general, and magistrate of finance. It was generally supposed that significant qualities were needed to exercise each of those two offices. A magistrate's post did not last more than a year, including that of the strategoi and in this sense the continued selection of Pericles year after year was an exception. At the end of every year, a magistrate would have to give an account of his administration and use of public finances.|$|E
25|$|European {{settlers}} had {{two main}} criticisms of British South Africa Company railway policy. Firstly, that its financial arrangements unfairly benefited {{the company and}} its shareholders, and secondly, that the settlers paid for these benefits through exorbitant railway rates. Although the allegations were probably ill-founded, they caused tensions between the settlers and the BSAC. On the shorter east coast route from Beira, running expenses were high because of construction debts and because the Mozambique Company, which was granted the original concession to build the railway in 1891, imposed a transit duty of up to 3% on goods destined for Rhodesia in return for the sub-concession to the Beira Railway Company. From 1914, the European settlers had a majority in the Advisory Council, and called for the replacement of BSAC control of the railways through nationalisation. In 1923 responsible government was achieved, but rather outright nationalisation, the settler government opted for a form of <b>public</b> <b>control</b> under the Railway Act of 1926. This left BSAC as owner of the railways, which were called Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways until 1927, and Rhodesia Railways Limited after. This remained the situation until 1947, when the Rhodesian Government acquired the assets of Rhodesia Railways Limited.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1980s, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} trend to split up railway companies, with companies owning the rolling stock separated from those owning the infrastructure. This is particularly true in Europe, where this arrangement is required by the European Union. This has allowed open access by any train operator to any portion of the European railway network. In the UK, the railway track is state owned, with a <b>public</b> <b>controlled</b> body (Network Rail) running, maintaining and developing the track, while Train Operating Companies have run the trains since privatization in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} years, {{partly as a}} result of the stimulus represented by the environmental campaign, <b>public</b> <b>controls</b> are gradually enhanced, so the Green Schooner campaign changes slowly, moving from one action to check up on the sea conditions (which also remains) to broader spectrum of initiatives: the promotion of activities to report illegal buildings, and illegal waste management on the beaches. Among these activities, the better known is the campaign to bring down two hotels that had been built illegally, the Fuenti Hotel in Vietri sul Mare and the 'Saracinesca' in Punta Perotti (Bari).|$|R
