40|$|A 28 {{year old}} female patient with Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{due to an}} adrenal adenoma also suffered from recurrent urinary infections (proteus), tonsillitis (streptococcus), permanent candidiasis and <b>perimandibular</b> <b>abscess</b> (Staphylococcus pyogenes). Suppression of cellular and humoral immunity was confirmed by in vitro tests. After successful right adrenalectomy the clinical signs of Cushing's syndrome disappeared and no evidence of either bacterial or fungal infection were noted one year postoperatively. Immunological tests showed the restitution of both cellular and humoral immunity. The course of the disease in the patient supports the idea that Cushing's syndrome might {{be considered as a}} transitory immune deficiency state...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{treatment}} of a large implant periapical lesion (IPL) that caused paraesthesia and <b>perimandibular</b> <b>abscess.</b> IPL is a pathologic phenomenon that rarely involves implants. This event first described in 1992 with an incidence rate of 0. 26 - 9. 9 % and the origin is not well known. The most likely suggested causes are presence of preexisting bone pathology, contamination of implant surface, bone overheating during implant surgery, vascular ischemia, excessive tightening of the implant, fenestration of the buccal plate and different implant surface designs. In the present case report, we describe relatively large periapical lesions involving several implants caused severe abscess accompanied by transient inferior alveolar nerve paraesthesia and its successful management. A brief {{review of the literature}} and a discussion of possible causes and different treatment plans are also included...|$|E
