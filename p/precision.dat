5|$|Five major <b>precision</b> bombing {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} {{as part of}} the Empire Plan. On 9June, two groups of B-29s bombed an aircraft factory at Narao and another two groups raided a factory in Atsuta; both facilities were badly damaged. A single group of Superfortresses also attempted to bomb a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory at Akashi but accidentally struck a nearby village instead. The next day, XXIBomber Command bombers escorted by 107 P-51s successfully attacked six different factories in the Tokyo Bay region. <b>Precision</b> bombing raids were also conducted on 22June, when 382 B-29s attacked six targets at Kure, Kakamigahara, Himeji, Mizushima and Akashi in southern Honshu. Most of the factories targeted were badly damaged. Four days later, 510 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were sent against nine factories in southern Honshu and Shikoku. Heavy clouds over the region meant that many bombers attacked targets of opportunity individually or in small groups, and little damage was done to the raid's intended targets. Cloudy weather prevented any further large-scale <b>precision</b> attacks until 24July, when 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven targets near Nagoya and Osaka. Four of the factories attacked suffered heavy damage. Renewed cloudy weather prevented any further Empire Plan <b>precision</b> attacks in the last weeks of the war.|$|E
5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of <b>precision</b> air attack {{throughout}} his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in <b>precision</b> guided weapons to make <b>precision</b> bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E
40|$|If supersymmetric {{particles}} {{were discovered}} at the ILC, {{would we be}} able to prove that the dark matter candidate discovered is the only dark matter particle? This was investigated using a scenario with a mostly bino lightest supersymmetric particle and a coannihilating stau. In this scenario, the ILC could find the sleptons and lighter gauginos, while the LHC could discover and measure parts of the coloured spectrum. We will demonstrate which measurements and <b>precisions</b> are needed to determine whether the observed dark matter candidate is the sole constituent of the dark matter relic density. The required <b>precisions</b> will be compared to the predicted <b>precisions</b> at the ILC...|$|R

Two aspects of the statistical and computational development are a practical procedure for solving a linear integer system, and a stable linearization routine for ratios.

5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to <b>precision</b> of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between <b>precision</b> and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low <b>precision,</b> while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high <b>precision</b> data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E

40|$|The maximally {{entangled}} {{states are}} excellent candidates for achieving Heisenberg-limited measurements in ideal quantum metrology, however, they are fragile against dissipation such as particle losses and their achievable <b>precisions</b> may become {{even worse than}} the standard quantum limit (SQL).

The input spin cat states are of excellent robustness against particle losses and their achievable <b>precisions</b> may still beat the SQL. For realistic measurements based upon our scheme, comparing with the population measurement, the parity measurement is more suitable for yielding higher <b>precisions.</b> In phase measurement with realistic dissipative systems of bosons, our scheme provides a robust and realizable way to achieve high-precision measurements beyond the SQL.
