5|$|One of {{the points}} of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has important <b>parts</b> <b>constructed</b> <b>in</b> several different centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|R

This railroad was named after Tonawanda Creek, which flows through Batavia. Historian Edward Dunn questions the derivation of the naming, as the eleven miles of line constructed up the valley of the Tonawanda Creek to Attica was an afterthought.

40|$|The hydro {{projects}} in Himalayan region <b>in</b> India are <b>constructed</b> <b>in</b> <b>head</b> reaches of river basins. These projects envisage a concrete or masonry or rockfill {{or even an}} earthen dam. The underground inspection galleries and drainage gallery of these dams are constructed using concrete linings of different grades. Its durability is determined by various factors viz. aggressivity of surrounding water, temperatures fluctuations etc. The water in Himalayan Rivers is generally soft which is injurious to the useful life of concrete structures as it leads to leaching of lime. Leaching is a phenomenon that is caused by water migrating through the permeable concrete. The reduced alkalinity and permeated water causes corrosion of reinforcement leading to weakening of structure. Once such phenomenon is observed in any such structures a vigilant periodic monitoring approach becomes mandatory. The suitable remedial measure to be adopted {{will depend on the}} observed degree of deterioration. In this paper effort has been made to assess degree of corrosion of reinforcement in the gallery of one of the {{projects in}} Himalayan region using Half Cell Potentiometer which is a technique, used for assessment of the durability of reinforced concrete and helps in diagnosing reinforcement corrosio...|$|R

Despite {{the western}} part being {{commissioned}} by Hugh de Lacy before 1186, the castle owes its name to King John (Richard the Lionheart's brother) who visited Carlingford in 1210.

It is built mostly of local rag-stone with a tiled roof and stone framed windows in a variety of sizes, but also has later sections constructed of red brick. The interior features some 16th-century moulded plaster ceilings, but historic timber panelling dating from the 1520s was removed from the house in 1923 and taken to the United States.|$|R

An extension to the Hart Auto Company building was added in 1926, containing similar corbelled and sawtooth brickwork, {{as well as}} industrial windows. In about 1929 the Kunkle Manufacturing Company, an auto parts manufacturer, demolished a store {{on the other side}} of the block and built a factory with two and three-section windows on the front facade. Some time later a gable-roofed connector was constructed between the 1914 Hart building and the 1929 Kunkle building.|$|R

This paper argues that spatial part Ns in French divide into two coherent groups with distinct properties: fixed spatial part terms, which denote concrete, perceptible objects and whose interpretation is completely predictable {{on the basis}} of the shape and position of the whole and relative spatial part terms, which denote a location projected from the whole. A detailed study of the two classes of expressions shows that, while the former are true nouns, the latter are in fact Axial Parts, a category motivated crosslinguistically in the semantic decomposition of preposition...|$|R

Elevated stations, <b>in</b> most <b>parts,</b> were <b>constructed</b> <b>in</b> four major styles with distinctive roof designs for specific portions of the line. The KL Sentral station, added later, features a design more consistent with the Stesen Sentral station building. Underground stations, however, tend to feature unique concourse layout and vestibules, and feature floor-to-ceiling platform screen doors to prevent platform-to-track intrusions. 13 stations (including two terminal stations and the five subway stations) utilize a single island platform, while 11 others utilize two side platforms. Stations with island platforms allow easy interchange between north-bound and south-bound trains without requiring one to walk down/up to the concourse level.|$|R

This unique nature for knowledge construction {{in terms of}} formulating ideas by reacting to previous contributions and building knowledge together in a discourse community has shown that learners take an active <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>constructing</b> knowledge <b>in</b> an authentic ICT environment. While many have acknowledged the role of discourse {{in the building of}} knowledge, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that collaborative knowledge building can be investigated independently of the discourse.
