A block appears to develop in the secretory machinery of young cotyledon cells resulting in extended galactosylation and diversion of XG traffic to the periplasm without fucosylation. The primary walls buried beneath accretions of storage XG eventually swell and lose cohesion, probably because they continue to extend without incorporating components like fucosylated XG that are needed for maintaining wall integrity...|$|R

Style-oriented characteristics are difficult to define programmatically, a problem that is particularly prominent for a robot’s interactive behaviors, those that must react accordingly to dynamic actions of people. In this paper, we present a technique for programming the style of how a robot should follow a person by demonstration, such that non-technical designers and users can directly create the style of following using their existing skill sets. We envision that simple physical interfaces like ours can be used by nontechnical people to design the style {{of a wide range of}} robotic behaviors. I...|$|R

6000|$|I {{have met}} with but one or two persons {{in the course of}} my life who {{understood}} the art of Walking, that is, of taking walks,--who had a genius, so to speak, for sauntering: which word is beautifully derived [...] "from idle people who roved about the country, in the Middle Ages, and asked charity, under pretence of going à la Sainte Terre" [...] to the Holy Land, till the children exclaimed, [...] "There goes a Sainte-Terrer," [...] a Saunterer,--a Holy-Lander. They who never go to the Holy Land in their walks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds; but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense, such as I mean. Some, however, would derive the word from sans terre, without land or a home, which, therefore, in the good sense, will mean, having no particular home, but equally at home everywhere. For this is the secret of successful sauntering. He who sits still in a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all; but the saunterer, in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the meandering river, which is all the while sedulously seeking the shortest course to the sea. But I prefer the first, which, indeed, is the most probable derivation.

It may convict me of want of taste and absence of due feeling for the marvelous beauties of vegetation, but I must frankly own that I never penetrate far into a wood without finding that the getting out of it again is the pleasantest part of my walk--the getting out on to the barest down, the wildest hill-side, the bleakest mountain top--the getting out anywhere, so that I can see the sky over me and the view before me as far as my eye can reach.|$|R

School based participatory life skills based child to child hygiene education was undertaken for message dissemination and behavior change. The effect of this hygiene education on identified key behaviors was assessed after one month Results: Out of the 118 (50 male and 68 female) subjects examined 21 (17. 8 %, 95 %CI, 11. 4 – 25. 9 %) had intestinal parasite infection. The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was significantly high among children having dirty untrimmed nails (47. 4 %, 95 %CI, 30. 9 – 64. 1 %) followed by those having poor hand washing practices (37. 2 %, 95 %CI, 22. 9 – 53. 2 %).

40|$|At least 85 % of {{individuals}} with multiple sclerosis report walking dysfunction as their <b>primary</b> complaint. <b>Walking</b> and strength measures are common clinical measures to mark increasing disability or improvement with rehabilitation. Previous studies have shown an association between strength or walking ability and spinal cord MRI measures, and strength measures with brainstem corticospinal tract magnetization transfer ratio. However, the relationship between walking performance and brain corticospinal tract magnetization transfer imaging measures and the contribution of clinical measurements of walking and strength to the underlying integrity of the corticospinal tract has not been explored in multiple sclerosis. The objectives {{of this study were}} explore the relationship of quantitative measures of walking and strength to whole-brain corticospinal tract-specific MRI measures and to determine the contribution of quantitative measures of function in addition to basic clinical measures (age, gender, symptom duration and Expanded Disability Status Scale) to structural imaging measures of the corticospinal tract. We hypothesized that quantitative walking and strength measures would be related to brain corticospinal tract-specific measures, and would provide insight into the heterogeneity of brain pathology. Twenty-nine individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (mean(SD) age 48. 7 (11. 5) years; symptom duration 11. 9 (8. 7); 17 females; median[range] Expanded Disability Status Scale 4. 0 [1. 0 – 6. 5]) and 29 age and gender-matched healthy controls (age 50. 8 (11. 6) years; 20 females) participated in clinical tests of strength and walking (Timed Up and Go, Timed 25 Foot Walk, Two Minute Walk Test) as well as 3  T imaging including diffusion tensor imaging and magnetization transfer imaging. Individuals with multiple sclerosis were weaker (p =  0. 0024) and walked slower (p =  0. 0013) compared to controls. Quantitative measures of walking and strength were significantly related to corticospinal tract fractional anisotropy (r >  0. 26; p    0. 29; p    0. 05). Walk velocity was a significant contributor to magnetization transfer ratio (p =  0. 006) and fractional anisotropy (p =  0. 011) in regression modeling that included both quantitative measures of function and basic clinical information. Quantitative measures of strength and walking are associated with brain corticospinal tract pathology. The addition of these quantitative measures to basic clinical information explains more of the variance in corticospinal tract fractional anisotropy and magnetization transfer ratio than the basic clinical information alone. Outcome measurement for multiple sclerosis clinical trials has been notoriously challenging; the use of quantitative measures of strength and walking along with tract-specific imaging methods may improve our ability to monitor disease change over time, with intervention, and provide needed guidelines for developing more effective targeted rehabilitation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{currently}} {{much interest in}} encouraging individuals to increase physical activity {{in order to reduce}} CVD risk. This study has been designed to determine if personalised CVD risk appreciation can increase physical activity in adults at high risk of CVD. Methods/Design In a 2 × 2 factorial design participants are allocated at random to a personalised 10 -year CVD risk estimate or numerical CVD risk factor values (systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and fasting glucose) and, simultaneously, to receive a brief lifestyle advice intervention targeting physical activity, diet and smoking cessation or not. We aim to recruit 200 participants from Oxfordshire primary care practices. Eligibility criteria include adults age 40 – 70 years, estimated 10 -year CVD risk ≥ 20 %, ability to read and write English, no known CVD and no physical disability or other condition reducing the ability to <b>walk.</b> <b>Primary</b> outcome is physical activity measured by ActiGraph accelerometer with biochemical, anthropometrical and psychological measures as additional outcomes. Primary analysis is between group physical activity differences at one month powered to detect a difference of 30, 000 total counts per day of physical activity between the groups. Additional analyses will seek to further elucidate the relationship between the provision of risk information, and intention to change behaviour and to determine the impact of both interventions on clinical and anthropometrical measures including fasting and 2 hour plasma glucose, fructosamine, serum cotinine, plasma vitamin C, body fat percentage and blood pressure. Discussion This is a pilot trial seeking to demonstrate in a real world setting, proof of principal that provision of personalised risk information can contribute to behaviour changes aimed at reducing CVD risk. This study will increase our understanding of the links between the provision of risk information and behaviour change and if successful, could be used in clinical practice with little or no modification. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background MANOSHI, an {{integrated}} community-based package of essential Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health (MNCH) services is being implemented by BRAC {{in the urban}} slums of Bangladesh since 2007. The objective of the formative research done during the inception phase {{was to understand the}} context and existing resources available in the slums, to reduce uncertainty about anticipated effects, and develop and refine the intervention components. Methods Data were collected during Jan-Sept 2007 in one of the earliest sites of programme intervention in the Dhaka metropolitan area. A conceptual framework guided data collection at different stages. Besides exploring slum characteristics, studies were done to map existing MNCH service providing facilities and providers, explore existing MNCH-related practices, and make an inventory of community networks/groups with a stake in MNCH service provision. Also, initial perception and expectations regarding the community delivery centres launched by the programme was explored. Transect <b>walk,</b> observation, pile <b>sorting,</b> informal and focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, case studies, network analysis and small quantitative surveys were done to collect data. Results Findings reveal that though there are various MNCH services and providers available in the slums, their capacity to provide rational and quality services is questionable. Community has superficial knowledge of MNCH care and services, but this is inadequate to facilitate the optimal survival of mothers and neonates. Due to economic hardships, the slum community mainly relies on cheap informal sector for health care. Cultural beliefs and practices also reinforce this behaviour including home delivery without skilled assistance. Men and women differed in their perception of pregnancy and delivery: men were more concerned with expenses while women expressed fear of the whole process, including delivering at hospitals. People expected 'one-stop' MNCH services from the community delivery centres by skilled personnel. Social support network for health was poor compared to other networks. Referral linkages to higher facilities were inadequate, fragmentary, and disorganised. Conclusions Findings from formative research reduced contextual uncertainty about existing MNCH resources and care in the slum. It informed MANOSHI to build up an intervention which is relevant and responsive to the felt needs of the slum population. </p...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundMucopolysaccharidosis II, {{also known}} as Hunter syndrome, is a rare, X-linked disease caused by a {{deficiency}} of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate- 2 -sulfatase, which catalyses {{a step in the}} catabolism of glycosaminoglycans. the glycosaminoglycans accumulate within tissues affecting multiple organs and physiologic systems. the clinical manifestations include neurologic involvement, severe airways obstruction, skeletal deformities and cardiomyopathy. the disease has a variable age of onset and variable rate of progression. in those with severe disease, death usually occurs in the second decade of life, whereas those patients with less severe disease may survive into adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy with intravenous infusions of idursulfase has emerged as a new treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis type II. ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase compared to other interventions, placebo or no intervention, for treating mucopolysaccharidosis type II. Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register (date of last search 22 July 2013). We also searched EMBASE, PubMed and the Literature Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude (LILACS) (date of last search 09 July 2013). Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase compared to no intervention, placebo or other options (e. g. behavioral strategies, transplantation). Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently screened the trials identified, appraised quality of papers and extracted data. Main resultsOne study (96 patients) met the inclusion criteria, although the primary outcome of this review - z score for height and weight, was not assessed in the study. This trial was considered to be of overall good quality. Following 53 weeks of treatment, patients in the weekly idursulfase 0. 5 mg/kg group demonstrated a significant improvement rate compared with placebo for the <b>primary</b> outcome: distance <b>walked</b> in six minutes {{on the basis of the}} sum of ranks of change from baseline, mean difference 37. 00 (95 % confidence interval 6. 52 to 67. 48). the every-other-week idursulfase 0. 5 mg/kg group also showed an improvement, which was not significant compared with placebo, mean difference 23. 00 (95 % confidence interval - 4. 49 to 50. 49). After 53 weeks, there was no statistical significance difference in per cent predicted forced vital capacity between the three groups and absolute forced vital capacity was significantly increased from baseline in the weekly dosing group compared to placebo, mean difference 0. 16 (95 % confidence interval CI 0. 05 to 0. 27). No difference was observed between the every-other-week idursulfase 0. 5 mg/kg group and placebo. In addition, liver and spleen volumes and urine glycosaminoglycan excretion were significantly reduced from baseline by both idursulfase dosing regimens. Idursulfase was generally well tolerated, but infusion reactions did occur. Idursulfase antibodies were detected in 31. 7 % of patients at the end of the study and they were related to a smaller reduction in urine glycosaminoglycan levels. Authors' conclusionsThe current evidence is limited. While the randomised clinical trial identified was considered to be of good quality, it failed to describe important outcomes. It has been demonstrated that enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase is effective in relation to functional capacity (distance walked in six minutes and forced vital capacity), liver and spleen volumes and urine glycosaminoglycan excretion in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type II compared with placebo. There is no available evidence in the included study and in the literature on outcomes such as improvement in growth, sleep apnoea, cardiac function, quality of life and mortality. More studies are needed to obtain more information on the long-term effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of active travel {{to school in}} children is low and declining. For example, the 2014 National Travel Survey showed that just 46 % of <b>primary</b> school children <b>walk</b> to school. This is {{despite the fact that}} children who actively travel {{have been shown to be}} more physically active overall as well as perform better in class. Beat the Street is a community based intervention which uses RFID (Radio Frequency ID) chip readers attached to locations around the neighbourhood. The aim of the intervention is to encourage walking and cycling by gamifying these travel behaviours; individuals taking part gain points by touching a smartcard on the readers and these points become part of a competition. One of the aims of Beat the Street is to encourage children who already walk and cycle to and from school to do so more, as well as achieve modal shift from motorised transport to active travel as a means of commuting. However, habitual travel mode is ‘sticky’ and, despite the potential health benefits being greater, it may be more difficult to change mode than it is to encourage more activity in those who already walk or cycle. Set in a neighbourhood in the city of Norwich, England, this analysis examines how travel mode prior to the initiation of Beat the Street is associated with subsequent engagement with the intervention and what the association of this engagement is with physical activity change. Aim: This pilot study evaluates how prior travel mode to school is associated with engagement in the Beat the Street intervention in schoolchildren in the city of Norwich, England. Methods: The Beat the Street intervention was conducted within a Norwich neighbourhood for 9 weeks during May-July 2014. Children were recruited to the evaluation via two schools; one in the intervention neighbourhood, and a control located on the opposite side of the city. All year 4 and 5 children (aged 8 - 10 years) were invited at both schools. Recruited children completed a travel diary that recorded their mode of travel to school (active or non-active) for 1 week at baseline (Week 0), mid-intervention (Week 7), and 3 months post-intervention (Week 20). Engagement with the intervention was measured by identifying the total number of times each child touched a Beat the Street RFID reader with their smartcard across the 9 weeks, with this information being automatically stored by the RFID readers. Based on this data, children were classified as having either ‘no’, ‘low’ or ‘high’ engagement with the intervention. Finally, to measure children’s physical activity levels, each participant wore an accelerometer during all three measurement periods, and from accelerometery we derived mean counts per minute (CPM) for each measurement occasion. We then examined differences in levels of engagement with the intervention by travel mode to school, and subsequent changes in physical activity, using linear models. Results: Fifty-one children (34. 0 %) participated at the intervention school and 29 (51. 8 %) at the control. We found that engagement with the intervention was highest amongst those actively travelling to school at baseline with individuals making 99. 9 smartcard touches across the 9 weeks (95 %CI 34. 5, 165. 3), versus 35. 9 (2. 4, 69. 4) for non-active travellers and 24. 0 (11. 8, 36. 2) for those using a mix of active and non-active travel. However, those individuals who were non-active travellers at baseline but switched to become active travellers at post-intervention had the highest levels of engagement overall (192. 5 smartcard touches, 95 %CI 84. 5, 300. 5). Those children who engaged with the intervention the most experienced the greatest increase in physical activity. For example, children with high levels of engagement increased their physical activity by + 13. 1 CPM (95 %CI - 30. 9, 57. 0) during the morning commute to school, whereas those with low levels of engagement experienced a smaller increase in physical activity of + 1. 3 CPM (- 22. 5, 25. 0), and those who did not engage with the intervention experienced a decrease in physical activity of - 5. 1 CPM (- 18. 0, 7. 7) across the study. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that engagement with Beat the Street was highest amongst those children already active travelling to school, with non-active travellers plus those using a mix of active and non-active modes showing much lower levels of engagement with the intervention. Furthermore, children who demonstrated high levels of engagement with the intervention experienced an increase in physical activity, compared to the decline experienced by those who did not engage. These findings suggest that prior travel behaviours were associated with uptake of this intervention and whilst Beat the Street successfully encouraged active children to undertake more activity, a challenge remains for technology based physical activity interventions to find novel ways to engage and support individuals to switch from inactive behaviours to becoming active...|$|R
