5|$|A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead {{has been}} {{contemplated}} since the 1940s and planned {{since at least}} 1960. The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users: local traffic made up of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities' small-town charm; regional traffic comprising <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued {{to work in the}} Baltimore area; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover. The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987. By the early 1990s, it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001. Progress toward construction of the bypass was continually delayed. The bypass was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979. The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990, when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992. However, in 1991, the bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding.|$|E
