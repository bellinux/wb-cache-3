2500|$|A {{study of}} {{international}} transport [...] "mega-projects" [...] led by Professor Harry Dimitriou of University College London concluded that tolls on the East West Link {{would have to}} be a minimum of $10.50 to produce a profit for investors, and the government would come under pressure to toll the Eastern Freeway. Two contributors to the study, Sophie Sturup and Nicholas Low, suggested the large profits flowing to <b>private</b> <b>consultants</b> during the planning phase created a moral hazard—"because those who will make money from the road are not those who will invest in it or use it. Knowing that their employer and cash cow has committed itself to the construction, there is a strong incentive for consultants to invent reasons for the project from which they can walk away when the financial architecture they have created collapses like a house of cards." [...] Kenneth Davidson, a columnist for The Age and outspoken critic of the project, claimed the government's business case did not justify the road and that [...] "the financial burden on the Victorian taxpayer will be so big that it will 'crowd out' the state's core responsibilities for funding schools, hospitals, rail transport and even other roads for at least a generation." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} chances of policy failures, policy makers need {{information}} {{about the effects of}} policies. Sometimes, policy makers can rely on agents who already possess the information. Often, the information does not exist yet. This raises two questions. First, how much resources should be devoted to the production of information? Second should information be produced by a profitmaximizing firm (a <b>private</b> <b>consultant)</b> or by someone who has an interest in policy outcomes (a political adviser) ? This paper shows that policy makers may prefer hiring a political adviser for two reasons. First, in contrast to a <b>private</b> <b>consultant,</b> a political adviser need not be fully compensated for exerting effort. Second, a political adviser with moderate preferences produces information of a higher expected quality than a <b>private</b> <b>consultant</b> is induced to do by the optimal monetary incentive scheme. The cost of hiring a political adviser is that she may distort policy decisions by manipulating information. As long as a political adviser is not too biassed, the policy maker prefers consulting a political adviser to consulting a <b>private</b> <b>consultant,</b> even if a political adviser and a <b>private</b> <b>consultant</b> are equally costly. Competition among political advisers is shown to reduce the willingness of political advisers to produce information...|$|R

50|$|For {{the first}} decade of its {{existence}} the PSA was a centralised organisation which controlled all building and estates management works for government departments and the armed services.

50|$|Proponents of Open Referral cite as {{advantages}} of the scheme that data they have collected from previous referrals makes them better placed to find a suitable <b>private</b> <b>consultants</b> compared to many GPs.

In the old days, GPs knew all consultants in their area, but now they don’t and they also don’t have such strong relationships with patients.” Using a consultant from an approved list also ensures the cost of treatment is fully covered by the insurance, whereas a GP specified or patient chosen consultant's fee might be higher than the coverage provided by insurance, leaving the patient {{to make up the}} shortfall. Insurance companies that provide a choice of consultants also cite increased choice as compared to a single suggestion that may have been offered by a GP.|$|E
