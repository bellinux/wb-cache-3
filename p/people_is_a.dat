5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Third Class city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Second Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E
5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious <b>People</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E

25|$|Collecting {{for most}} <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> choice, {{but for some}} {{it can be a}} compulsion, sharing {{characteristics}} with obsessive hoarding. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.|$|E

25|$|False positives {{can also}} produce serious and counter-intuitive {{problems}} when the condition being searched for is rare, as in screening. If a test has a false positive {{rate of one}} in ten thousand, but only {{one in a million}} samples (or <b>people)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> true positive, most of the positives detected by that test will be false. The probability that an observed positive result is a false positive may be calculated using Bayes' theorem.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, {{under the}} Mubarak government, Coptic Christmas (January the 7th) was {{recognized}} as an official holiday, though Copts complain of being minimally represented in law enforcement, state security and public office, and of being discriminated against in the workforce {{on the basis of}} their religion.

25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst {{the advocates of}} different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the Encyclopedia uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing {{an increasing number of}} <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.|$|E

25|$|A chair {{without a}} back or arm rests is a stool, or when raised up, a bar stool. A chair with arms is an armchair; one with upholstery, {{reclining}} action, and a fold-out footrest is a recliner.

With wheels it is a wheelchair; or when hung from above, a swing. An upholstered, padded chair for two <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 'loveseat', while if it is {{for more than two}} person it is a couch, sofa, or settee; or if is not upholstered, a bench. A separate footrest for a chair, usually upholstered, is known as an ottoman, hassock, or pouffe.|$|E
25|$|Health {{care for}} {{homeless}} <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major public health challenge. Homeless {{people are more}} likely to suffer injuries and medical problems from their lifestyle on the street, which includes poor nutrition, exposure to the severe elements of weather, and a higher exposure to violence (robberies, beatings, and so on). Yet at the same time, they have little access to public medical services or clinics, in part because they often lack identification or registration for public health care services. There are significant challenges in treating homeless people who have psychiatric disorders because clinical appointments may not be kept, their continuing whereabouts are unknown, their medicines may not be taken as prescribed and monitored, medical and psychiatric histories are not accurate, and for other reasons. Because many homeless people have mental illnesses, this has presented a crisis in care.|$|E
