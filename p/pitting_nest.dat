Adults and immature stages of this predatory mite were sometimes found near the vein axils on the undersurface of the leaves but were more often found nesting in small feeding pits created by young green looper Chrysodeixis eriosoma (Doubleday) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) near the mid-vein. This is the first report on the use of insect feeding <b>pits</b> as <b>nests</b> by phytoseiids.

40|$|Many cichlid species dig {{spawning}} <b>pits</b> or <b>nests</b> in soft bottoms and exhibitmany substrate oriented activities. Despite {{this fact}} being of general knowledge, captive cichlids in laboratory and aquaculture set-ups are often {{kept in the}} absence of a soft substrate that they can manipulate. This raises a potential welfare issue, depending on how the substrate is valued by cichlid fish. The aim of this study is to assess the importance of substrate for male Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in social and non-social contexts. Preferences were established as a measure of time spent in two choice compartments, before and after the presence of a female. Locomotory activity, social interactions and substrate-related behaviours were recorded. Results show that dominant males prefer the area with substrate regardless of social context, and that female’s presence strengthens this preference. The same preference is not apparent in the subordinate males, except for foraging. To draw conclusions on the importance of substrate to subordinates, preferences should also be assessed in agonistic contexts, during which substrate may serve to displace aggression. These results, together with related previous studies, show that the lack of substrate is particularly deleterious in a reproductive context, and thus it is likely to decrease the welfare state of breeding males of Mozambique tilapia...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the natural}} {{whitewater}} habitats of these fish, which makes natural observation difficult, most observations {{of the behavior of}} this fish is largely known from study of fish in aquaria. Natural history and reproduction of this fish are not well known. When inactive, these fish often swim in a vertical posture, probably to help blend into stems of reeds and other aquatic plants; when active, they swim in a normal, horizontal manner. They may use this camouflage either to hide from predators or as part of ambush predation. These fish feed on fish and crustaceans, and as adults are largely piscivorous. Sorubim species have been observed in captivity to excavate a small <b>pit</b> as a <b>nest</b> and even to guard freshly hatched young (unfortunately, none of these young survived).|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of dredging {{as a major}} player for surface mine applications has led Royal IHC, a large equipment supplier and consultant for dredging and mining operations, and the TU Delft to work on more advanced optimizations techniques {{for the design of}} dredge mines. Three implications of the design of a dredge mine were found to be crucial for optimizations, namely: 1) depth control, 2) mining direction and 3) creation of multiple ponds. The conventional approach for open pit mines, in which a series of <b>nested</b> <b>pits</b> are created to determine an optimal mining sequence, was tested using the core module of Whittle and showed not to be readily applicable on dredge mines, because 1) multiple ponds may be created, 2) the depth to be mined for a certain area changes in time and 3) the <b>nested</b> <b>pits</b> expand randomly towards high graded zones. A new method for optimizing dredge mines was introduced as a second approach, which determines an ultimate depth per stacked block model, based on the cumulative values and finds an optimal route for a pond through these stacked blocks by using an adapted version of the Nearest Neighbour algorithm. Four limitations for this approach are recognized: 1) the depth difference between stacked blocks could become impractical, 2) full utilization of the field is not possible because it may reach a premature dead-end or it may enclose a group of non-mined blocks, 3) the blocks have to meet the same length and width requirements of a pond; therefore not incorporating the accuracy of the data and 4) it lacks the function ability to mine the area in layers. Project Alpha indicated that the new approach finds an optimal mine design; however, the long lifetime of the mine (> 60 years) results in a low recovery of 65 %. Decreasing the lifetime of the mine would result in a higher recovery. The conventional approach showed to be impractical for the design of a dredge mine, while it created multiple thin deposits. The NPV of the worst case scenario of Whittle turns out slightly lower than the NPV of the optimal route determined by the second approach.

40|$|Lignite price {{negotiation}} between opencast {{mine and}} power plant as a two-stage, two-person, cooperative, non-zero sum game. Based on the simple {{model of the}} lignite deposit the methodology of finding the optimal solution for bilateral monopoly (BM) of lignite mine and power plant is shown taking into account <b>nested</b> <b>pits</b> generated by the pit optimisation process. It is proposed to treat lignite price negotiation {{as a kind of}} two-stage game. In the first step (cooperative) both sides should select the ultimate pit maximising joint profits of BM and in the second one (competitive) the agreement should be achieved regarding profit division. This can be realised through side payments or by establishing the lignite transfer price. Lack of cooperation and opportunism can lead to the suboptimal solution – excavation of the smaller pit. Due to existence of information asymmetry and the mine predominant strategy attainment of the optimal solution is more probably in vertically integrated firms. Dynamic adjustments of LOM BM plan to short-term changes of energy market using optimisation techniques, BM model, game theory and their valuation as real options is the new direction of further research. ...|$|R
2500|$|In early 1915 it {{was decided}} to build new {{defenses}} further away from the city center. The new defenses were stronger fixed fortifications with positions quarried into rock or dug into ground. Fortifications were built from wood and stone masonry as well as concrete. New fortifications had a network of defensive structures, with trenches, rifle <b>pits,</b> machine gun <b>nests,</b> barbed wire obstacles, shelters and roads. Artillery batteries were located [...] behind the front line, often located on reverse slope. Artillery batteries had 2-6, typically four, guns. Heavily fortified caponiers providing flanking fire were built on places of the front line. First a northern line was built at Leppävaara-Kaarela-Pakila-Pukinmäki-Myllypuro-Vartiokylä. Construction on a western line from Leppävaara to Westend via Tapiola began shortly afterwards. In late 1915 {{it was decided}} to build an outer line of defence on the northern and eastern sectors, extending the fortifications northward and in the east from Pukinmäki to Malmi, Mellunkylä and Vuosaari. Fortification works continued until the February revolution of 1917, and some work was done until early 1918. The land front was divided into three sectors, eastern, northern and western with 36 bases, numbered I-XXXVII. The bases were usually centered on hilltops with the strongest defences.|$|R
40|$|Many {{environmental}} cues {{are thought}} to influence nest site selection by loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, and much debate exists over the possible influence of sand temperature. This study had two primary objectives: (1) to measure thermal differences across transects of a major nesting beach of Casey Key (28. 7 N, 82. 3 W), Florida and (2) to evaluate thermal pattern variation that influenced nesting patterns of adult female loggerhead sea turtles. A secondary objective {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy of infrared thermometers to collect sand surface temperatures in the field. Temperature data were collected from 145 nest events and 8 false crawls in the 2008 and 2009 nesting seasons. Infrared thermometers and thermocouple probes were used to obtain surface temperatures from the water, waterline, beach sand, body <b>pit</b> attempts, <b>nest</b> chamber attempts, eggs, and the surface of the gular skin of the nesting female, within the crawl track created by the female and at one meter adjacent to the crawl track (from undisturbed sand). Weather influences at the time of nesting were recorded, including the presence or absence of rain, wind, or clouds. Beach slope was measured using an angle locator. Temperature data from the infrared thermometer and the thermocouple probe were highly correlated, indicating that an infrared thermometer is an effective measurement tool on a nesting beach. In 2008, there was a significant difference between temperatures collected within the crawl tracks of false crawl events and nest events, indicating a potential for females to use thermal cues in choosing whether to false crawl or nest. In both nesting seasons, the sand temperature in the body pit and the surface of the gular skin of the nesting female were nearly identical, suggesting females may locate a suitable nest site using their skin temperature. Data collected at other loggerhead rookeries in the United States and Australia yielded similar results, however, variability in the use of temperature may arise seasonally, and according to different nesting environments. Rain, wind and cloud cover significantly thermally altered several locations on Casey Key, but it remains unclear if these weather events significant affect turtle nesting behavior. Additionally, crawl distance and beach slope were significantly, positively correlated. Gravid females most likely use multiple environmental cues to select a nest site. Assimilating information from multiple sources allows for the highest degree of adaptability, and future studies should consider implications for climate change and beach renourishment projects...|$|R
50|$|The {{spawning}} {{season for the}} creek chubsucker runs from March to May, with the eastern subspecies spawning at a water temperature of 11 degrees C, with most activity at night. The western subspecies spawns at water temperatures of 12-24 degrees C, spawning in the afternoon. Habitat suitable for spawning is usually in small creeks with small cleared depressions on clear, gravel bottoms of pools just above riffles. Prior to spawning, males and females migrate upstream where possible. Males defend territories in moderately swift water over beds of gravel or near pits constructed by various minnow species. Males do not initiate the digging of <b>nest</b> <b>pits,</b> but will modify existing pits by pushing stones around with their snouts. Females congregate upstream of males in quiet water, periodically drifting tail first into male territories. Once in a male’s territory, the female digs in the gravel with her snout, apparently signaling to the male that she is ready to spawn. In contrast to most species of suckers, creek chubsuckers frequently engage in trio spawning involving two males {{on either side of}} one female. Actual spawning lasts three to five seconds as the males press against the female. Both release gametes while quivering and stirring the substratum with their caudal and anal fins. The fertilized eggs are demersal and semi adhesive. Color varies from light to deep golden yellow, and yolk occupies most of egg with no oil drops in the yolk mass. Egg production has been extremely variable with anywhere between 8,500 and over 80,000 eggs being produced by a single female. Regardless of high fecundity this species is not found in high numbers. Females may live for 6 or 7 years, though males only live for 5 years.|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} approach to open pit design is {{to optimize the}} pit shape using the criterion of maximum total profit {{on the basis of}} a revenue block model of the orebody. There are some difficult problems inherent in such an approach. For example, scheduling and production rates will have a significant effect on the shape of the pit; if the bulk of the rich (and thus high revenue earning) ore is at the bottom of the pit and will not be mined until near the end of the life of the mine, then the time value of money may make the simple revenue block approach meaningless. In addition, optimality is a function of economic parameters which may change significantly over time. The aim of the parametric approach is to express the solution (Le., the optimal pit shape) as a function of one or more parameters such as costs, prices or cut-off grade. Matheron's parametric approach is to use a grade block model together with the techniques of functional analysis without making any economic assumptions. This leads to a set of technically optimal <b>nested</b> <b>pits</b> which can be used for mine scheduling. Whittle uses the traditional revenue block approach with the Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm and finds a set of optimal pits which are functions of the price/cost ratio. The aim of this project is to combine the two approaches mentioned above and provide a complete parametric solution in terms of technical and economic parameters. The project includes the development of an interactive computer program for the parametric design and scheduling of open pits. The author reviews the literature on optimal open pit design and scheduling and then provides an overview of the parameterization method. In this research project the parameterization method has been extended to allow for the selection of an economically optimum pit. Scheduling is then discussed in detail and a new method that combines linear programming and user-activated simulation is introduced. All software developed during this project is described in detail in the final Chapter...|$|R
40|$|Ice-Rich Layer: Polygonal {{features}} with {{dimensions of}} approximately 100 meters, bounded by cracks, are commonly observed on the martian northern plains. These features are generally attributed to thermal cracking of ice-rich sediments, in direct analogy to polygons in terrestrial polar regions. We mapped polygons {{in the northern}} mid-latitudes (30 to 65 N) using MOC and HiRISE images. Polygons are scattered across the northern plains, with a particular concentration in western Utopia Planitia. This region largely overlaps the Late Amazonian Astapus Colles unit, characterized by polygonal terrain and <b>nested</b> <b>pits</b> consistent with periglacial and thermokarst origins. Bright and Dark Polygonal Cracks: An examination of all MOC images (1997 through 2003) covering the study area demonstrated that, at latitudes of 55 to 65 N, most of the imaged polygons show bright bounding cracks. We interpret these bright cracks as exposed ice. Between 40 and 55 N, most of the imaged polygons show dark bounding cracks. These are interpreted as polygons from which the exposed ice has been removed by sublimation. The long-term stability limit for exposed ice, even in deep cracks, apparently lies near 55 N. Bright and Dark Spots: Many HiRISE and MOC frames showing polygons in the northern plains also show small numbers of bright and dark spots, particularly in western Utopia Planitia. Many of the spots are closely associated with collapse features suggestive of thermokarst. The spots range from tens to approximately 100 meters in diameter. The bright spots are interpreted as exposed ice, due to their prevalence on terrain mapped as ice rich. The dark spots are interpreted as former bright spots, which have darkened as the exposed ice is lost by sublimation. The bright spots may be the martian equivalents of pingos, ice-cored mounds found in periglacial regions on Earth. Terrestrial pingos from which the ice core has melted often collapse to form depressions similar to the martian dark spots. Future Observations: The SHARAD radar {{should be able to}} confirm the presence and measure the depth of the interpreted ice-rich layer that forms the Astapus Colles unit. If this layer is confirmed it will strengthen the interpretation of bright polygon cracks and bright spots as exposed ice. HiRISE images of the northern plains are showing unprecedented details of the polygonal cracks. Future HiRISE images that include bright spots, compared to MOC images taken years earlier, will illustrate the temporal stability of the spots. The CRISM spectrometer, with multiple spectral bands and a spatial resolution around 20 meters, should allow mineralogical identification of the material exposed in the polygonal bounding cracks and in the bright spots...|$|R
50|$|Females {{lay their}} eggs about one to two months after mating. The nesting season can fall in nearly every month of the year. In the {{northern}} extremes of the distribution (i.e. Somalia ot Egypt), the nesting season is December through February while in the southern limits (i.e. South Africa or Tanzania) is in August through December. In crocodiles between these distributions egg-laying is in intermediate months, often focused between April and July. The dates correspond to about {{a month or two}} into the dry season within that given region. The benefits of this are presumably that nest flooding risk is considerably reduced at this time and the stage at which hatchlings begin their lives out of the egg falls roughly {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season, when water levels are still relatively low but insect prey is in recovery. Preferred nesting locations are sandy shores, dry stream beds, or riverbanks. The female digs a hole a few metres from the bank and up to 500 mm (20 in) deep, and lays on average between 25 and 80 eggs. The number of eggs varies and depends partially on the size of the female. The most significant prerequisites to a nesting site are soil with the depth to permit the female to dig out the nest mound, shading to which mother can retire during the heat of the day and access to water. She finds a spot soft enough to allow her to dig a sideways slanted burrow. The mother Nile crocodile deposits the eggs in the terminal chamber and packs the sand or earth back over the <b>nest</b> <b>pit.</b> While, like all crocodilians, the Nile crocodile digs out a hole for a nest site, unlike most other modern crocodilians, female Nile crocodiles bury their eggs in sand or soil rather than incubate them in rotting vegetation. The female may micturate sporadically on the soil to keep it moist, which prevents soil from hardening excessively. After burying the eggs, the female then guards them for the three-month incubation period. Nests have been recorded seldomly in concealed positions such as under a bush or in grasses, but normally in open spots on the bank. It is thought the Nile crocodile cannot nest under heavy forest cover as can two of the three other African crocodiles because they do not utilize rotting leaves (a very effective method of producing heat for the eggs) and thus require sunlight on sand or soil the surface of the egg chamber to provide the appropriate warmth for embryo development. In South Africa, the invasive plant Chromolaena odorata has recently exploded along banks traditionally used by crocodiles as nesting sites and caused nest failures by blocking sunlight over the nest chamber.|$|R
