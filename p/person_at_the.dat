Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Capitol she considers a friend.

Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.|$|E

5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Within the series, Connor is the superhuman son of {{the title}} {{character}} Angel, who is a vampire. Introduced in the third season as a newborn, Connor is kidnapped and taken to a hell dimension {{in an act of}} revenge against his father. He returns as a battle-hardened, disturbed teenager who has been raised to hate Angel. His consequent violent and estranged relationship with his father and increasing internal conflict making him shift alliances between protagonists and antagonists forms the storyline for his character. Towards the end of season four, events take their toll on Connor's sanity, and his memories are rewritten to give him a normal life. The next time he appears in season five, Connor is a well-adjusted <b>person.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> return of his memories, Connor finally reconciles with Angel in the series finale. The comic book series follows Connor accepting his abilities and role of a hero in addition to maintaining a normal life as a college student.|$|E
5|$|After his dismissal, {{his successors}} {{reversed}} his policy of reconciliation, {{resulting in a}} large-scale anti-Arab rebellion among the Soghdians. Another major defeat against the Turgesh in the Battle of the Defile {{was followed by the}} almost complete collapse of the Arab position in Trasoxiana and the outbreak of a major rebellion in Khurasan itself, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Appointed for a second time to govern Khurasan in late 734, Asad brought fresh troops into the province and managed to suppress Harith's uprising in 735–736, although the rebel leader himself escaped capture. An expedition in Khuttal in 737 brought about the intervention of the Turgesh khagan at the head of an army. Despite initial Arab setbacks and the Turgesh invasion of Khurasan, Asad succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon the khagan in <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Kharistan, turning back the Turgesh army. Despite Asad's death a few months later, this success was instrumental in preserving Muslim rule in Central Asia, as the blow to the khagans prestige led to his murder soon after and the collapse of Turgesh power. At the same time, Asad's conciliatory policy towards the native population laid the foundations for its eventual acceptance of Muslim rule and the Islamization of Central Asia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was {{accompanying}} two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reasons for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who {{was in the midst of}} an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.|$|E
5|$|In 1409, Jelena {{decided to}} travel to Venice to {{negotiate}} peace in <b>person.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of May, she arrived in Dubrovnik but {{had to wait for}} almost two months because her hosts warned her that there were Napolitan galleys in the Adriatic Sea. On 9 July 1409, while she was still waiting in Dubrovnik, Venice purchased the entire Dalmatian coast from Ladislaus of Naples for 100,000 ducats. The Kingdom of Naples was not a threat to Venetians anymore. By gaining the Dalmatian coast, Venetians further increased their influence and power in the region of the Adriatic Sea, which made Jelena's negotiating position difficult. When she finally arrived in Venice at the end of July, she was financially broken because of her long voyage. The Venetians had to support her with three ducats a day during negotiations which lasted for the next three months. On 26 October 1409, a year-long peace agreement with the Venetian doge, Michele Steno, was signed without territorial changes for any of the parties. Jelena traveled back to Zeta through Dubrovnik where she received 100 ducats worth of presents. Although both she and the Venetian representative swore on the Gospel to respect the truce, in reality there was no peace.|$|E
5|$|In 828, al-Ma'mun {{appointed}} Abu Ishaq {{as governor}} of Egypt and Syria in place of Abdallah ibn Tahir, who departed to assume the governorship of Khurasan, while the Jazira and the frontier zone (thughūr) with the Byzantine Empire passed to al-Abbas. Egypt had just been brought back under caliphal authority and pacified after the tumults {{of the civil war}} by Ibn Tahir, but the situation remained volatile. When Abu Ishaq's governor, Umayr ibn al-Walid, tried to raise taxes, the Nile Delta and Hawf regions rose in revolt. In 830, Umayr tried to forcibly subdue the rebels, but was ambushed and killed along with many of his troops. With the government troops now confined to the capital Fustat, Abu Ishaq intervened in <b>person,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of his 4,000 Turks. The rebels were soundly defeated and their leaders executed. In 831, however, soon after his departure, the revolt flared up again, this time encompassing both the Arab settlers and the native Christian Copts under the leadership of Ibn Ubaydus, a descendant of one of the original Arab conquerors of the country. The rebels were confronted by the Turks, led by al-Afshin. Al-Afshin conducted a systematic campaign, winning a string of victories and engaging in large-scale executions: the male Copts were executed and their women and children sold into slavery, while the old Arab elites who had ruled the country since the Muslim conquest of Egypt were practically annihilated. In early 832, al-Ma'mun came to Egypt, and soon after that the last bastion of resistance, the Copts of the coastal marshes, were subdued.|$|E

50|$|One of Parfit's {{arguments}} is as follows: self-interest theorists {{consider the}} differences between different <b>persons</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as significant in terms of rationality, but do not consider the difference between <b>the</b> same <b>person</b> <b>at</b> different times to be as significant. But if, as Parfit argues, a reductionist theory of personal identity holds, then the difference between different <b>persons</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time is more like the difference between <b>the</b> same <b>person</b> <b>at</b> different times. So, if reductionism is true, self-interest theorists are inconsistent in viewing spatial relations as significant but temporal relations insignificant. Thus, {{the foundations of the}} self-interest theory are undermined by non-reductionism, which lends support to the present-aim theory of rationality, the critical version of which Parfit favours.|$|R
