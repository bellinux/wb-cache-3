Of the documentary she said that [...] "the material is potent and persuasive", but that Lohan was a [...] "constant, distracting presence". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote a satirical, mocking letter ostensibly {{from the point of}} view of Lohan: [...] "Some of these kids are sent to work when they're so young. Which I can relate to because I started out working as a child model aged three, and got into movies when I was 11. I can, like, so totally understand where these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> from".|$|E

According to Vesna Wallace, a professor of religious studies at UC Santa Barbara: [...] "Now more <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> to temples and visiting monasteries. There is also a new interest in meditation among the general public." ...|$|E

"Now, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> {{back and}} almost {{adopting}} {{it as their}} own anthem, and it's hard, I think, to write an anthem that's not cheesy, and I hope {{that this could be}} something in that category. I hope this could be {{one of those things where}} it's like, 'Yeah, I want to put my fist up and feel proud and feel strong. But I also don't want to be cheesy, it's a fine line, and I think 'Firework' ... would be like the opus or my one song — if I had to pick a song to play — 'cause it has a great beat. But it also has a fantastic message. Many people refer to the lines 'like the 4th of July; however the original lyrics were 'like a firefly' as they reminded me of fireworks at night whenever I saw them. However the trend caught on and in live performances I now sing 4th of July, which happens to make great sense for the song name." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Daniel Mindel {{stated that}} The Force Awakens would use real {{locations}} and scale models over computer-generated imagery {{to make it}} aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy. Rian Johnson, director of The Last Jedi, reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: [...] "I think <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> back around to [...] It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think {{that more and more}} people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick." [...] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.|$|E
2500|$|After excelling {{in grade}} school and junior high, in 1923, Wright earned the {{position}} of class valedictorian of Smith Robertson junior high school. He was assigned to write a paper to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Later, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying [...] "...the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've written." [...] The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might {{not be allowed to}} graduate if he persisted, despite having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an Uncle Tom, Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.|$|E

2500|$|After {{securing}} {{his position}} in a bloody confrontation with the Iron Guard, Antonescu involved Romania {{in the war against}} the Soviet Union. Antisemitic measures and the clampdown on dissident activities reached a peak. Ailing from heart disease and noticeably poor, Moscovici was threatened with imminent eviction from his Bucharest home in Vatra Luminoasă, and had to move in with friends. As noted by his daughter Mira, the signal for this persecution was an article in the fascist newspaper Porunca Vremii. Against the family's protests, the house was listed for rent by the Romanianization bureau, which had barred Jews from placing bids. When Moscovici presented his certificate of service in World War I, guaranteeing him special treatment, the officials objected that he was not a war invalid. Moscovici was also prevented from cashing into his Journalists' Union pension, owing to his racial origins. He was advised to seek an interview with Antonescu, but he rejected the idea outright. Although exposed to such persecution, Moscovici had remained cautious of the Soviet Union, and informed himself about its crimes. His young friend Belu Zilber, at the time involved with the clandestine PCdR, recalls a brush with the anticommunist Moscovici some time after the Battle of Stalingrad. According to Zilber, Moscovici shouted at him that: [...] "those Katyn <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming,</b> and they're going to kill you!". In summer 1943, with Petrescu, Moscovici also wrote a note to the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, detailing the [...] "treason" [...] of Flueraș and Grigorovici.|$|E

60|$|The king {{then made}} signs, {{pointing}} to a hill a good way off, {{as if it would}} come from thence very quickly; and then looked to see if his <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming,</b> as if he was impatient till they came, as well as our men.|$|R
60|$|He departed. And Stephen glanced absently at the group. They {{were picking}} their {{way over the}} muddy {{crossing}} toward him.
