Ewbank Preece OhEocha, in association with Symonds Travers Morgan, produced a conceptual design and tender documents for Cork Corporation on a design and construct format based on geometric and <b>performance</b> <b>specification.</b> Thirteen parties showed interest in the contract. From these, four consortia were selected and Cork Corporation made a final contract decision in December 1994. As is typical on a large-scale project of this type, the chosen contractor was a joint venture of Tarmac Walls JV, formed by Tarmac Construction, now a division of Carillion, and P.J. Walls (Civil) Ltd., part of Ireland's Walls Group. Subcontractors then handled many of the key tasks of construction.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzed rulings and court cases from the General Accounting Office, Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals and Federal Court of Claims {{with respect to}} contract protests and disputes involving <b>Performance</b> <b>Specifications.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Specifications</b> generally leave the contractor open to decide the best means to accomplish {{the work of a}} contract and deliver the product called for in the contract. As compared with Design Specifications, which tell the contractor exactly the processes and materials that must be used to accomplish the task, <b>Performance</b> <b>Specifications</b> only specify the final product to be delivered and the parameters it will fulfill or operate within, and thus leave the contractor open to decide the best processes and procedures to accomplish the task. The use of <b>Performance</b> <b>Specifications</b> in the Defense acquisition process has been mandated from the Secretary of Defense since 1994. The intent in using <b>Performance</b> <b>Specifications</b> was to provide incentive to the contractor to become innovative and resourceful in performing the contract and hopefully, result in cost avoidances and savings to the Federal Government. This thesis will examine protests and disputes from the above sources to evaluate the use of <b>Performance</b> <b>Specifications</b> to date and compile any patterns of success or failure that can then be passed on to today's acquisition workforce.

40|$|We discuss output {{feedback}} control design with multiple <b>performance</b> <b>specifications,</b> each measured in a weighted H∞-norm. The multidisk design problem consists in finding a stabilizing output {{feedback control}}ler which minimizes the different <b>performance</b> <b>specifications</b> simultaneously using a worst case strategy. This is less conservative than existing approaches, but difficult to solve algorithmically due to inherent nonsmoothness and nonconvexity. We present a nonsmooth optimization method suited for the multidisk problem and more generally, for programs where the maximum of an infinite family of nonconvex maximum eigenvalue functions is minimized. The method is shown to perform well on a control problem for a helicopter at hover.
