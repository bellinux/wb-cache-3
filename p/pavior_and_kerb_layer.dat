40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an experimental study about partial substitution of granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS) as fine aggregate in production of concrete paving blocks <b>and</b> <b>kerbs.</b> GBFS is replaced sand for different GBFS/sand ratios in concrete during production of <b>kerb</b> <b>and</b> paving block specimens. Some tests orienting towards strength and durability were applied on these specimens including control specimens that are produced with normal concrete. Then, the results of tested properties of GBFS-replaced specimens and control specimens were compared. GBFS decreases the compressive strength of paving blocks <b>and</b> <b>kerbs</b> according to the results. However, some durability properties which {{are more important than}} strength for these elements are improved with GBFS replacement. The most improved property was abrasion resistance. It is concluded that it is feasible to use GBFS in paving block <b>and</b> <b>kerb</b> production with an optimum replacement ratio for these specimens...|$|R

50|$|Kerbing in Green Street between Charlotte and Helen Streets was {{commenced}} in December 1900 {{and completed}} in August 1901. Kerbing along Walker Street from the Commercial (now Cooktown) Hotel to {{the junction of}} Helen Street was constructed between November 1901 <b>and</b> March 1902. <b>Kerbing</b> along Hope Street commenced in June 1902. In January 1903 {{it was reported that}} <b>kerbing</b> <b>and</b> undertables were constructed in Helen Street between Walker and Hogg Streets and in November the same year the kerbing was continued in Hope Street to the corner of Pryde Street. In 1904 a culvert <b>and</b> <b>kerbing</b> was constructed in Adelaide Street and the Furneaux Street kerbing was constructed in 1905.|$|R

The band held their last concert with Čuturilo on October 14, 1989 in Sarajevo. He was replaced by Zoran Ilić, a former Bezobrazno Zeleno member.|$|R
50|$|In Gill Street, {{which has}} become the main centre for {{commercial}} activity within the city, most of the early granite <b>kerbing</b> <b>and</b> channeling has been removed and replaced with concrete <b>kerb</b> <b>and</b> channeling.

50|$|The Australians {{were then}} drawn against Germany for their {{play-off}} tie; considered {{a challenge for}} the team {{due to the fact}} that there were four Germans in the top forty: Andrea Petkovic (No. 10), Sabine Lisicki (No. 14), Julia Görges (No. 21) <b>and</b> Angelique <b>Kerber</b> (No. 22). Stosur was chosen to lead the tie, with Gajdošová and Dellacqua also playing alongside Rogowska, who was accepted ahead of Dokic as a reward for her sudden rankings improvement. Rodionova expressed disappointment at her omission from the team, nevertheless, as she was the country's highest ranked doubles player and third-highest ranked singles player at the time. The Germans selected an in-form <b>Kerber</b> <b>and</b> Görges to lead their team, with Petkovic also playing despite recovering from a back injury, and Anna-Lena Grönefeld entering as a doubles specialist. Stosur <b>and</b> <b>Kerber,</b> who played each other during Stosur's win at Flushing Meadows, were set to open the tie, with Gajdošová and No. 16 Görges assigned for the second rubber.|$|R
30|$|The average {{velocity}} of natural buoyancy driven flows or natural ventilation through {{the bottom of}} a door during ventilation-controlled conditions is approximately 1.5 – 2.0  m/s (3.4 – 4.4 mph) (<b>Kerber</b> 2010; Quintiere <b>and</b> McCaffrey 1980). Average velocities of natural ventilation flows through windows have been recorded between 0.5 and 1.0  m/s (1.1 – 4.4 mph) depending on the sill height and elevation of the opening within the wall (<b>Kerber</b> 2010; <b>Kerber</b> <b>and</b> Walton 2005; Quintiere and McCaffrey 1980). The square root of height of the opening is the relevant determinant of the max velocity (Babrauskas 1980; Quintiere 1995). The reported velocity of flows from wind-assisted or mechanically induced flows through {{the bottom of a}} door and window can be on the order of 10  m/s (22 mph) (<b>Kerber</b> <b>and</b> Walton 2005; Madrzykowski <b>and</b> <b>Kerber</b> 2009).|$|R
