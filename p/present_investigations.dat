6000|$|... [A] The Lycée, No. 36, for January 1st, has a {{long and}} rather [...] {{premature}} article, in which it endeavours to show anticipations by [...] French philosophers of my researches. It however mistakes the [...] erroneous results of MM. Fresnel and Ampère for true ones, and then [...] imagines my true results are like those erroneous ones. I notice it [...] here, however, {{for the purpose of}} doing honour to Fresnel in a much [...] higher degree than would have been merited by a feeble anticipation of [...] the <b>present</b> <b>investigations.</b> That great philosopher, at the same time [...] with myself and fifty other persons, made experiments which the [...] present paper proves could give no expected result. He was deceived [...] for the moment, and published his imaginary success; but on more [...] carefully repeating his trials, he could find no proof of their [...] accuracy; and, in the high and pure philosophic desire to remove error [...] as well as discover truth, he recanted his first statement. The [...] example of Berzelius regarding the first Thorina is another instance [...] of this fine feeling; and as occasions are not rare, it would be to [...] the dignity of science if such examples were more frequently [...] followed.--February 10th, 1832.|$|E
50|$|In {{the frame}} work of single-point {{closures}} (Reynolds-stress transport models = RSTM) still {{provide the best}} representation of flow physics. Due to numeric requirements an explicit formulation based on a low number of tensors is desirable and was already introduced originally most explicit algebraic stress models are formulated using a 10-term basis:The reduction of the tensor basis however requires an enormous mathematical effort, to transform the algebraic stress formulation for a given linear algebraic RSTM into a given tensor basis by keeping all important properties of the underlying model. This transformation {{can be applied to}} an arbitrary tensor basis. In the <b>present</b> <b>investigations</b> an optimum set of basis tensors and the corresponding coefficients is to be found.|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{distribution}} of Myriapoda and spiders, the Tokyo Imperial Palace area had been a laurel forest facing the sea, before the entry of Tokugawa Ieyasu into the Edo castle. Since then, it had been changed {{in a number of ways}} such as the castle, residences of daimyos, gardens and a golf course. In 1937, the administration as a park had been discontinued and in 1948, at the request of Hirohito that nature of old Musashino or old Tokyo should be revived, some of the plants of Musashino or old Tokyo were transplanted. Although it is not a virgin forest, the Tokyo Imperial Palace is exceptionally rich in nature, considering its location in the heart of a great city. Therefore, the biota of the Palace is rich in vegetation as well as in animals of the Animal Kingdom. While small Japanese mole has outlived a long history since the Edo era, this is an exceptional case, and it is considered that many living creatures and plants have disappeared. Especially due to urbanization and pollution, such as photochemical smog in the 1970s, big trees such as fir and Cryptomeria have withered. Large sized lichens have completely disappeared. As a constituent of the biota of the Palace, the bringing of animals or plants from outside, either intentionally or unintentionally, is important. In the <b>present</b> <b>investigations,</b> many new species have been observed. Although the Palace is a closed circumstance, the effects from other places should be watched for any changes. As constituents of animals and vegetation, Cryptoparlatorea edentata (Takagi et Kawai, 1966) might have been introduced in the Edo era with transplanted fir, indicating the effects of trees at large. Some of land shellfishes might also have been introduced. Some species which had not been documented were found in algae, Oribatida and earthworms. The Palace is encircled by Central Tokyo, and bordered by moats. Some of the living creatures without an ability to move may disappear, while the introduction of bullfrogs produced immense effects on other animals. There is closedness of the Palace but at the same time, there are also strong connections with the outer world. The northern goshawk has become a sedentary bird, producing great changes in the ecology of other birds. The biota has shown constant changes, and it should be maintained, with the least artificial modulations of the circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Hematology {{is defined}} as the branch of biology, which deals with the {{morphology}} of blood and blood forming organs. Haematological profiles of blood can provide important information about the internal environment of the organism. In the <b>present</b> <b>investigation</b> the effect of chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate compound on the blood components is determined in albino rats. The <b>present</b> <b>investigation</b> was aimed to examine the haematological changes of of albino rats with oral sub lethal (20 mg/kg) administration of chlorpyrifos as single, double and multiple doses with 48 hr intervals. The decrease in RBC count, Hb and PCV observed in the <b>present</b> <b>investigation</b> could be described are retarded haemopoisis, destruction and shrinkage of RBC. MCV, MCH and MCHC showed significant decrease in all doses in the <b>present</b> <b>investigation,</b> due to destruction of RBC (size and shape) and decrease in Hb synthesis and hemoglobin content. These symptoms imply the microcytic- hypo chromic anemia.
