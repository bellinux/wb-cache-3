5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea <b>pens,</b> <b>and</b> gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds {{and bolts of}} cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into <b>pens</b> <b>and</b> slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E

When choosing bimanual input, system designers must select the input device that each hand will control. In this paper, we argue for the use of <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch two-handed input, and describe an experiment in which users were faster and committed fewer errors using <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch input in comparison to using either touch <b>and</b> touch or <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>pen</b> input while performing a representative bimanual task.

5|$|Khandoba is {{described}} as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada. He is responsible for cleaning the sheep <b>pens</b> <b>and</b> taking the sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she will not give him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} <b>pens</b> <b>and</b> other Atlantic Wall fortifications {{had been}} built in 1940 and 1941, when the Germans had air superiority and could deter Allied air attacks. By 1942 this advantage had been lost to the United States Army Air Forces, which had begun deploying to England in May 1942, and a greatly expanded Royal Air Force. The German Army preferred an alternative approach which would use trailer-style mobile launch platforms called Meillerwagen accompanied by testing and fuelling equipment mounted on railway cars or trucks. Although this configuration was far less efficient and would have a much lower rate of fire, it would have the great advantage of presenting a much smaller target for the Allied air forces. The Army was not convinced that fixed bunkers could resist repeated air attacks and was particularly concerned about {{the vulnerability of the}} launch sites' road and rail links, which were essential for resupplying them with missiles and fuel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Current {{interfaces}} {{for common}} information visualizations such as bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots usually {{make use of}} the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and a Pointer) interface paradigm with its frequently discussed problems of multiple levels of indirection via cascading menus, dialog boxes, and control panels. Recent advances in interface capabilities such as the availability of <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch interaction challenge us to re-think this and investigate more direct access to both the visualizations and the data they portray. We conducted a Wizard of Oz study to explore applying <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch interaction to the creation of information visualization interfaces on interactive whiteboards without implementing a plethora of recognizers. Our wizard acted as a robust <b>and</b> flexible <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch recognizer, giving participants maximum freedom in how they interacted with the system. Based on our qualitative analysis of the interactions our participants used, we discuss our insights about <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch interactions in the context of learnability and the interplay between <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch gestures. We conclude with suggestions for designing <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch enabled interactive visualization interfaces.

40|$|Combined bimanual <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> {{touch input}} on digital tab-letops is an {{appealing}} interaction paradigm enjoying grow-ing popularity among many HCI researchers.

We present an empirical evaluation consisting of three experiments aimed at investigating a few important issues of <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch interaction on horizontal surfaces. Specifically, we examine the compromise between speed and accuracy for the two input modalities in position-ing and tracing contexts, the influence of palm-resting on <b>pen</b> precision <b>and</b> bimanual coordination for pen mode-switching via postures. We report on quantitative and quali-tative results obtained from these trials and discuss their potential impact {{on the design of}} <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> touch systems.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{d-penicillamine}} (<b>Pen)</b> <b>and</b> mixtures of <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> copper sulfate on {{the capacity of}} normal human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBM) to generate immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC) in response to the T-cell-dependent polyclonal B-cell activators pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and staphylococcal protein A (SPA) was examined. PBM obtained from normal individuals were incubated for 1 - 2 h at 37 °C with medium alone, Pen, CuSO 4, or a mixture of <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> CuSO 4. After washing, the cells were incubated for 6 - 7 d with PWM or SPA and then, with a reverse hemolytic plaque assay, assayed for the number of ISC generated. Preincubation of PBM with either Pen (100 μg/ml) or CuSO 4 (2 μg/ml) did not alter the subsequent capacity of the cells to generate ISC in response to PWM or SPA. In contrast, responsiveness to both mitogens was nearly abolished when PBM were similarly preincubated with a mixture of <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> CuSO 4. Inhibition of responsiveness could not be ascribed to cell death, carry-over of the inhibitors, or an alteration in the concentration of PWM or the length of incubation yielding maximum responses. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> CuSO 4 preincubation had not caused augmented suppressor cell function. Experiments in which PBM were separated into adherent and nonadherent populations indicated that <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> CuSO 4 preincubation inhibited the responsiveness of the nonadherent cells but did not alter the accessory cell function of monocytes. To determine whether <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> CuSO 4 preincubation effected T- or B-cell function, PBM were separated into B- and T-cell-enriched populations, individually preincubated with <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> CuSO 4, and then co-cultured with PWM. The results indicated that <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> CuSO 4 markedly inhibited helper T-cell function and had little effect on the capacity of B cells to generate ISC. The observation that in the presence of CuSO 4 Pen inhibits helper T-cell activity may, in part, explain the therapeutic efficacy of Pen in rheumatoid arthritis and especially the capacity of Pen therapy to decrease antiglobulin titers in treated patients...|$|R
