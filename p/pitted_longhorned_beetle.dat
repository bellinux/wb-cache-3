40|$|ABSTRACT: The Acacia seyal Del. var. seyal {{belongs to}} family Mimosaceae is {{known locally as}} gum Talha tree. It is a {{multipurpose}} tree species occurs throughout the African gum belt in Savannah mostly in pure forest. In Sudan it thrives on heavy clay soils that receive an annual rainfall between 400 - 800 mm. It is {{an important source of}} rural energy (fuelwood and charcoal) and forage. As mentioned by Nair (2007) the economic damage causes by insect in natural forest often difficult to judge due to no enough research attention The tree is frequently affected by biotic factors among them the insect pests.

40|$|With the surges in {{international}} trade, {{the threat of}} invasive wood-boring <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles</b> continues to increase. These beetles could potentially cause damage worth {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars as has been demonstrated by the Asian <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle.</b> While we cannot conduct realistic invasion experiments, we can study the behavioral traits of the native <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles.</b> The <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles</b> are a good study group of potential invaders because their diversity results in great variation in biological and behavioral traits. The aims of this project were to construct a molecular phylogeny of the <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles</b> that are native to the Midwestern U. S. and to map biological and behavioral traits onto this phylogeny. During the first step of collecting the beetles we set up traps on private forest lands. We studied the relationship between forest productivity and <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle</b> communities. Our results suggest that the numbers of both the pest and the harmless species increase with decreasing forest productivity. Chapter 1 deals with this change in communities with forest health. Chapter 2 deals with the species Sternidius alpha, which is common in the eastern part of the United States. Two populations of Sternidius alpha that differed in color were collected from two geographically disjunct Indiana sites. One population was red and the other gray. The technique of DNA barcoding employed in our laboratory separated the red and gray beetles into different phylogenetic clades. In Chapter 3, a phylogeny of all the <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle</b> species collected was inferred based on partial DNA sequences from two mitochondrial genes: 12 S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inferences were used for building a phylogenetic tree. All of the subfamilies in the family Cerambycidae were monophyletic, which supports the delineation of the subfamilies based on morphological characters. An unexpected result, however, was the placement of the subfamily Prioninae, as a derived sister of the subfamily Cerambycinae. This contrasts with the previous finding that suggest Prioninae is basal to most of the remaining subfamilies of the Cerambycidae. Also, the subfamily Lamiinae, thought to be a sister to the subfamily Cerambycinae on the tree based on morphology, did not have a sister subfamily on the molecular tree. In Chapter 4, an ultrametric Bayesian algorithm was used to reconstruct the ancestral states on the phylogenetic tree of the <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles.</b> This analysis showed that the inferred ancestral <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle</b> was probably a polyphagous feeder as a larva on long dead and decaying angiosperms and non-feeding as an adult. As the lineages diversified over time this ancestral biology gave rise to other traits as well, although some species retained the traits that the ancestor displayed. In Chapter 5, the ultrametric Bayesian tree was used to calculate the extent of phylogenetic signal in the phylogenetic tree for various biological traits. The phylogenetic signal was strong for the following traits: host condition for larval feeding, adult feeding behavior, plant part attacked, the plant tissue attacked and the utilization of angiosperms or gymnosperms. The presence of phylogenetic signal in the first four traits was used to build a threat index to predict which newly introduced species could be capable of becoming invasives. Study of the invasion-promoting traits among native species can be useful in predicting which of the relatives of the native species are likely to share a suite of traits that could enable them to become invasive. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{literature}} review, I discuss {{the environmental and}} economic importance of <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles</b> and detail the use of semiochemicals in their mating systems. Cerambycids employ three host and mate location strategies to unite the sexes: a mutual response {{of males and females}} to host plant volatiles; male-produced aggregation pheromones; and female-produced sex pheromones. The review concludes with a discussion of natural enemies of <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles.</b> ^ In Chapter 1, I explore the mate location behavior of M. dasystomus and test the hypotheses that the sexes are mutually attracted to volatiles emanating from the larval host and that females release a volatile pheromone that is attractive to males alone. In a Y-tube olfactometer, male and female M. dasystomus responded to volatiles from host material (i. e., sweetgum and sugarberry). However, only males responded to females in the olfactometer, suggesting that females release a volatile sex pheromone. Choice tests performed in a greenhouse also revealed that males and females are attracted to logs of known host plants over non-host material. In further bioassays in a greenhouse, males also responded significantly to host material containing a live female. These findings are evidence of the critical role host volatiles and pheromones play in mating systems of <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles.</b> ^ In Chapter 2, I test the hypothesis that volatile pheromone components of <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles</b> may serve as generic lures to attract a variety of species within the family. I set three transects, each with 11 panel traps spaced 10 meters apart. Two transects were set at the USDA Delta Experimental Forest, Washington Co., Mississippi. The third transect was set at Delta National Forest, Sharkey Co., Mississippi. I collected a total of 1042 specimens representing 35 species of <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles.</b> There was a greater treatment effect of some species than others, indicating that the compound may be an important pheromone component of that species. This information provides further evidence that pheromone structures may be conserved within subfamilies, and may help expedite identification of cerambycid pheromones. Individual components of cerambycid pheromones from four subfamilies (Cerambycinae, Lamiinae, Prioninae and Spondylidinae) may be used as generic lures to attract a variety of longhorn species within these subfamilies. ...|$|R

Here we describe the dynamics of an establishment event for the Asian <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle</b> in a small, isolated population within the regulated quarantine zone near Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. These data were collected during an opportunity afforded by logistical limits on the Cooperative Asian <b>Longhorned</b> <b>Beetle</b> Eradication Program administered by state, federal, and local government partners. Seventy-one infested red maple (Acer rubrum) trees and 456 interspersed un-infested trees were surveyed in an isolated, recently established population within a ~ 0. 29 ha stand in a suburban wetland conservation area in which nearly 90 % of the trees were host species, and nearly 80 % were Acer rubrum. Tree-ring analyses show that within this establishing population, Asian <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetles</b> initially infested one or two A. rubrum, before moving through the stand to infest additional A. rubrum based not on distance or direction, but on tree size, with infestation biased towards trees with larger trunk diameters. Survey data from the larger landscape suggest this population may have generated long-distance dispersers (~ 1400 m), and that these dispersal events occurred before the originally infested host trees were fully exploited by the beetle. The distribution and intensity of damage documented in this population suggest dispersal here may have been spatially more rapid and diffuse than in other documented infestations. Dispersal at these larger spatial scales also implies that when beetles move beyond the closed canopy of the stand, the direction of dispersal may be linked to prevailing winds...|$|R

Complementary studies of genes encoding enzymes involved in digestion of woody plant tissues or detoxification of plant allelochemicals were undertaken with the genomes of 14 additional insects, including the newly sequenced emerald ash borer and bull-headed dung beetle. Results The Asian <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle</b> genome encodes a uniquely diverse arsenal of enzymes that can degrade the main polysaccharide networks in plant cell walls, detoxify plant allelochemicals, and otherwise facilitate feeding on woody plants. It has the metabolic plasticity needed to feed on diverse plant species, contributing to its highly invasive nature. Large expansions of chemosensory genes involved in the reception of pheromones and plant kairomones are consistent with the complexity of chemical cues it uses to find host plants and mates. Conclusions Amplification and functional divergence of genes associated with specialized feeding on plants, including genes originally obtained via horizontal gene transfer from fungi and bacteria, contributed to the addition, expansion, and enhancement of the metabolic repertoire of the Asian <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle,</b> certain other phytophagous beetles, and to a lesser degree, other phytophagous insects.

This research aimed at (1) improving laboratory rearing methods for the biological control agent Aprostocetus anoplophorae (Hym. : Eulophidae), an egg parasitoid specific to CLB, and defining release techniques allowing its establishment; (2) test {{the efficacy of the}} sentinel tree technique for the early detection of CLB; and (3) evaluating the efficacy of traps baited with artificial lures in attracting adults of ALB and possibly CLB. Several problems were faced while rearing the egg parasitoid in laboratory. It appeared that the rate of parasitism of the hosts could depend on the age of the host eggs and/or age of the laying parasitoid females. Data results from the field experiments about A. anoplophorae release-capture showed that the percentage of slits containing a CLB egg was particularly low on most sentinel trees and the percentage of CLB eggs that were killed, because of natural predators, was high. Only one egg amongst those exposed was attacked by the released parasitoid. These negative results were anyway very useful, since they provided evidence and information on the type of host plants to be used, the time necessary for the exposure of the plants to the egg-laying CLB females, the number of laying parasitoid females to be inserted per cage. The sentinel trees technique revealed to be not successful; signs and symptoms of CLB presence were not recorded during the two seasons of field observations (2012 - 2013).

In plate assays, the larvae were susceptible to both EPN species but were more susceptible to S. carpocapsae (65. 0 - 97. 5 % mortality) than H. bacteriophora (42. 5 - 87. 8 %). Both nematode species were able to penetrate and reproduce within O. coerulescens larvae, but reproduction rate for H. bacteriophora was {{higher than those of}} S. carpocapsae; however, the penetration rate for S. carpocapsae was greater than H. bacteriophora. In a migration test on agar plate, S. carpocapsae showed negligible attraction to the pest or to Galleria mellonella cues. However, H. bacteriophora was strongly attracted to the sector of Petri dishes containing larvae. In a test using apricot tree branches, both species of EPN passed from mass frass of O. coerulescens larvae in the tip of the branches, penetrated into the larval galleries, and located and killed the larvae of O. coerulescens in their natural habitat deep inside the branches. Our findings provide the first insight into the biocontrol efficacy of EPN against O. coerulescens larvae, and highlight their potential for the control of this pest. Field experiments are needed to evaluate their potential under the environmental conditions in which rosaceae <b>longhorned</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae are found...|$|R
