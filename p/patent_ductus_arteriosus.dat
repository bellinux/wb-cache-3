5|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> {{also appears}} in the breed. It is a {{condition}} where a small blood vessel connecting two major arteries does not close following birth. It can cause complications as it is positioned to allow the blood flow to bypass the lungs. It also appears in American Staffordshire Terriers.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. <b>Patent</b> <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus,</b> where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a <b>patent</b> <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5000|$|In typical anatomy, {{the left}} side of the heart {{receives}} oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. In people with HLHS, the aorta and left ventricle are underdeveloped (beginning in utero), and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small to allow sufficient blood flow or are atretic (closed) altogether. [...] As blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, it must pass through an atrial septal defect to the right side of the heart so it can be pumped to the rest of the body. This blood must flow through a <b>patent</b> (open) <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus.</b> Since the <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> usually closes within eleven days after birth, blood flow may be severely restricted and eventually blocked, leading to dangerously low circulation and, eventually, shock. Babies are often cyanotic at birth to varying degrees, depending on the severity of their defects.|$|R

40|$|The {{adverse effects}} of nonselective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors on the {{immature}} kidney have been described in newborn rabbits, but {{it is much more}} laborious and difficult to study its relative impact on renal function in human neonates. Amikacin clearance was therefore used as surrogate marker to study the impact of nonselective COX-inhibitors on glomerular filtration rate. Clinical characteristics and amikacin clearance of infants on respiratory support were retrospectively collected. Results in neonates in whom either ibuprofen-lysine or acetylsalicylic acid was administered prophylactically to induce closure of a <b>patent</b> asymptomatic <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> were compared to infants not cotreated with any COX-inhibitor (Mann-Whitney U-, chi-square tests).

Tunica media became more muscular and composed of loosely arranged smooth muscle fibres in connective tissue matrix containing very fine wavy elastic fibres at 34 cm CVRL. The <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> did not show any remarkable changes from 26 - 40 cm CVRL foetus. The distinguishing feature was the formation of intimal cushions at 50 cm CVRL foetus i. e. 186 days.

This type is most common in adults. It is associated with notching of the ribs (because of collateral circulation), hypertension in the upper extremities, and weak pulses in the lower extremities. Postductal coarctation is most likely the result of the extension of a muscular artery (<b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus)</b> into an elastic artery (aorta) during fetal life, where the contraction and fibrosis of the <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> upon birth subsequently narrows the aortic lumen.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{anatomic}} {{closure of the}} <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> was studied at the ultrastructural level in 15 normal beagles (age 0 hour to 13 days) and in 18 specimens from a strain of dogs with hereditary persistent <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> (age 4 hours to 27 days). Normal ductal closure takes place from the pulmonary artery to the aortic end. It {{is accompanied by a}} series of histologic changes: 1) separation of the endothelial cells from the internal elastic lamina resulting in a wide region of subendothelial edema; 2) ingrowth and infolding of endothelial cells and migration of undifferentiated smooth muscle cells from the inner media into the subendothelial region; 3) apposition of endothelial cells bordering the lumen; and 4) degenerative changes. In persistent <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus,</b> these changes do not occur.

Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Histologic {{study of}} the {{persistent}} <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> {{in case of a}} congenital rubella syndrome revealed that this persistency is probably due to an arrest {{in the development of the}} ductus.

THE RELATION between maternal rubella and con-genital malformations in infants exposed to the infec-tion in utero was first observed by Gregg. 1 Since then many abnormalities have been shown to be related to maternal rubella. 2 6 Congenital heart disease is seen in about two-thirds of the infants with congenital rubella, and persistent <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> accounts for about one-third of the anomalies.

40|$|ABSTRACT Delayed {{closure of}} the <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> after birth has been {{observed}} in newborn infants with critical pulmonic stenosis and in newborn lambs with experimental pulmonic stenosis. This delayed ductal closure {{may be caused by}} a decreased ability of the muscle to contract when exposed to oxygen or to an increased production of or sensitivity to prostaglandin (PG) E 2, the endogenous <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> vasodilator. To determine whether the abnormal hemodynamic pattern during fetal life associated with pulmonic stenosis alters the responsiveness of the <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus,</b> we operated on 10 fetal lambs of gestational ages 70 to 77 days (term is 148 days) and placed a band around the pulmonary artery. Catheterization at 137 to 142 days showed severe pulmonic stenosis. We then studied isolated rings of <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> from these lambs. The oxygen-induced increase in tension in rings of <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> from lambs with pulmonic stenosis was significantly decreased (2. 55 0. 38; n = 10) compared with rings from control lambs (4. 03 ± 0. 51; n = 6, p <. 03). There was no {{difference between the two groups}} in either the amount of PGE 2 released by the rings or in the sensitivity (expressed as median effective dose) of the rings to PGE 2. There was also no difference in the increase in tension when endogenous PGE 2 was inhibited by indomethacin. We conclude that delayed {{closure of the}} <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> in lambs with experimental pulmonic stenosis is not caused by increased sensitiv-ity to or production of PGE 2 in the <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> (as it is in premature lambs) but rather is the result of a diminished ability of the <b>ductus</b> <b>arteriosus</b> to contract when exposed to oxygen...|$|R
