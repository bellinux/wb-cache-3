50|$|<b>Pendimethalin</b> acts both pre-emergence, that {{is before}} weed {{seedlings}} have emerged, and early post-emergence. <b>Pendimethalin</b> inhibits root and shoot growth. It controls the weed population and prevents weeds from emerging, {{particularly during the}} crucial development phase of the crop. Its primary mode of action is to prevent plant cell division and elongation in susceptible species. In the HRAC classification of herbicides according their mode of action, <b>pendimethalin</b> is listed in group K1.|$|E
50|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} typically increases {{production costs}} and limits options for herbicide selection, cultivations and rotations. Up to now <b>Pendimethalin</b> {{does not show}} resistance. It is not cross-resistant with other grass weed herbicides. This means that <b>Pendimethalin</b> supports the effects of other supplementary grass weed herbicides that use a different mode of action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pendimethalin</b> is an {{herbicide}} of the dinitroaniline class used in premergence and postemergence {{applications to}} control annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds.

5000|$|Preemergence: Preemergence {{herbicides}} {{are applied}} before the weed seedlings emerge through the soil surface. Herbicides do not prevent weeds from germinating but they kill weeds {{as they grow}} through the herbicide treated zone by affecting the cell division in the emerging seedling. Dithopyr and <b>pendimethalin</b> are preemergence herbicides. Weeds that have already emerged before application or activation are not affected by pre-herbicides as their primary growing point escapes the treatment.|$|E
50|$|In {{areas where}} weed {{infestation}} is particularly high, yield losses can render wheat production economically unviable. In addition to wheat, {{a large number}} of crops are grown in Europe that are a relatively small percentage of total agricultural output.

50|$|When {{resistance}} is first suspected or confirmed, {{the efficacy of}} alternatives {{is likely to be}} the first consideration. The use of alternative herbicides which remain effective on resistant populations can be a successful strategy, at least in the short term. The effectiveness of alternative herbicides will be highly dependent on the extent of cross-resistance. If there is resistance to a single group of herbicides, then the use of herbicides from other groups may provide a simple and effective solution, at least in the short term. For example, many triazine-resistant weeds have been readily controlled by the use of alternative herbicides such as dicamba or glyphosate. If resistance extends to more than one herbicide group, then choices are more limited. It should not be assumed that resistance will automatically extend to all herbicides with the same mode of action, although it is wise to assume this until proved otherwise. In many weeds the degree of cross-resistance between the five groups of ALS inhibitors varies considerably. Much will depend on the resistance mechanisms present, and it should not be assumed that these will necessarily be the same in different populations of the same species. These differences are due, at least in part, to the existence of different mutations conferring target site resistance. Consequently, selection for different mutations may result in different patterns of cross-resistance. Enhanced metabolism can affect even closely related herbicides to differing degrees. For example, populations of Alopecurus myosuroides (blackgrass) with an enhanced metabolism mechanism show resistance to <b>pendimethalin</b> but not to trifluralin, despite both being dinitroanilines. This is due to differences in the vulnerability of these two herbicides to oxidative metabolism. Consequently, care is needed when trying to predict the efficacy of alternative herbicides.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} impact of three pre plant herbicides, trifluralin, <b>pendimethalin</b> and {{prometryn}} on the incidence {{and the development of}} Rhizoctonia solani- induced cotton seedling damping-off in the field. In a field experiment conducted in Safford, Arizona, pre plant application of <b>pendimethalin</b> or prometryn but not trifluralin caused significant (P < 0. 05) increases in disease incidence. In another field experiment in Tucson, Arizona, significant (P < 0. 05) increase in disease incidence was observed in plots treated with prometryn and not in those treated with <b>pendimethalin</b> and trijuralin. In Tucson field experiment, application of herbicides also affected disease development as judged by the slope of disease progress curves...|$|E

Field studies were conducted on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam and an 85 / 15 (v/v) sand/Sharpsburg soil mixture was used for controlled-environment and rhizotron studies. Herbicide treatments included bensulide at 8. 5 kg/ha, DCPA at 11. 9 kg/ha, <b>pendimethalin</b> at 1. 7 kg/ha, oxadiazon at 3. 4 kg/ha, and prodiamine at 0. 56 kg/ha. Leachate was collected weekly from rhizotron root cells to monitor <b>pendimethalin</b> movement. Plant tissue, thatch, and soil were sampled at 0, 10, 21, 42, 84 and 168 days after treatment (DAT). The soil was sampled at 0 - 2. 5 cm, 2. 5 - 5 cm and 5 - 10 cm depths in the field and rhizotron cells, with additional sampling at 30 cm, 60 cm, and 120 cm depths in the rhizotron. ^ <b>Pendimethalin</b> concentration was highest in plant tissue and thatch and accounted for approximately 95...|$|E
