This report {{presents}} two cases of primary hydatid cysts located subcutaneously: one in the medial thigh and one in the left palm between the index and middle <b>fingers.</b> <b>Case</b> presentations A 64 -year-old male farmer visited our hospital because a swelling on the right medial thigh had grown during the last year. Superficial ultrasound and computed tomography revealed a lesion resembling a hydatid cyst. A germinative membrane was encountered during surgical excision. Pathological examination was compatible with a hydatid cyst. The second case involved a 67 -year-old male farmer who complained of a swelling that had grown in his left palm in the last year. The preliminary diagnosis was a lipoma. However, a hydatid cyst was diagnosed during surgical excision and after the pathological examination. The patient did not have a history of hydatid cyst disease and hydatid cysts were not detected in other organs. There has been no disease recurrence after following both patients for 3 years. Conclusion A hydatid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous cystic lesions in regions where hydatid cysts are endemic, and should be excised totally, with an intact wall, to avoid recurrence. </p...|$|R

Physical examination demonstrated a painful, tender index finger with diffuse swelling centred at the distal interphalangeal joint. There was no wound, erythema, or abnormal warmth (Fig. 1). She underwent biopsy of this mass. A large amount of myxomatous granulation tissue was removed from the subcutaneous space with some involvement of the flexor sheath at the D. I. P. joint.

40|$|Abstract Background Scar {{sarcoidosis}} is a {{rare and}} uncommon but specific cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis. In general it arises in pre-existing scars deriving from mechanical traumas. As most surgeons dealing with scars might {{not be aware of}} cutaneous sarcoidosis and its different types of appearance the appropriate staging and treatment might be missed or at least delayed. To our knowledge this is the first case in literature of scar sarcoidosis on a <b>finger.</b> <b>Case</b> presentation We present a case of a 33 -year-old carpenter who developed scar sarcoidosis on his right index finger 4 [*]years after the tendon of the long digital flexor got accidentally cut by an angle grinder. He was referred due to a swelling of the finger suspected to be a malignant soft tissue tumour. The circumference of the affected finger had almost doubled, adding up to 94 [*]mm. Incision biopsy revealed typical noncaseating granulomas. Further investigation showed a systemic extent of the disease with involvement of the lung. A systemic treatment with oral steroids led to an almost full regression of the swelling with restoration of function and resolution of lung infiltrates. Conclusion In case of a suspicious and/or progressive swelling a definite diagnosis should be achieved by biopsy within a short time to enable a proper treatment. If scar sarcoidosis is proven further investigation is necessary to exclude a systemical involvement. A surgical treatment of the swelling is not indicated. </p...|$|R

Chondromas of soft tissues are thought to arise from the synovium of tendon sheaths by metaplasia nd represent extra-articular forms of synovial chondromatosis (Dahlin, 1974). Whether the lesion arises from tendon sheath or the synovial tissue of a joint {{does not seem to}} make much difference in regard to histological appearance. The lesion is benign. We present a typical case of chondroma rising from the tendon sheath of the flexor side {{of the left}} middle <b>finger.</b> <b>Case</b> Report A fifty-two-year-old woman presented herself with a swelling in her left middle finger which she had noticed three months before. The mass had grown sufficiently to interfere with flexion of the finger, but there was no tenderness. Examination of the finger revealed a hard swelling on the palmar aspect situated between the proximal and middle interphalangeal creases. It was unattached to the skin, it was slightly movable transversely but not in the long axis. At operation the tumour lay beneath the flexor sheath and as the sheath was opened the cartilaginous tumour shelled out. The origin from the sheath was evident since there was no attachment to the normal flexor tendon and it had no relation to the joints. The tumour was firm on palpation, measured 1 • 1 x 1. 5 cm, was whitish and on the cut surface yellowish in the centre. Microscopic examination showed mature hyaline cartilage surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule (Figure 1). There was no cellular pleomorphism suggestive of malignancy and no multinucleated chondrocytes were found (Figure 2). In the centre of the tumour streaks of hyaline connective tissue and microcystic degeneration were seen. There were no signs of calcification or ossification (Figure 3). Normal function of the finger was restored within two weeks. Received for publication November, 1984...|$|R
