Education was according to Bobbitt primarily a <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood</b> and not for childhood or youth. This resulted in an early differentiation in education. Bobbitt was not a supporter of coeducation. In his view girls had a very different future than boys, so they did not need the same sort of education.|$|E
5000|$|According to Jewish tradition, {{adulthood}} {{is reached}} at age 13 (the minimal {{age of the}} Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah) for Jewish boys and girls; {{they are expected to}} demonstrate <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood</b> by learning the Torah and other Jewish practices. The Christian Bible and Jewish scripture contain no age requirement for adulthood or marrying, which includes engaging in sexual activity. The 1983 Code of Canon Law states, [...] "A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age, and likewise a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age, cannot enter a valid marriage". According to The Disappearance of Childhood by Neil Postman, the Christian Church of the Middle Ages considered the age of accountability, when a person could be tried and even executed as an adult, to be age 7.|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} period of socialization commences {{when they are}} approximately three weeks old and will continue until they are twelve to fourteen weeks old, during which they {{move to the next}} stage of development, the juvenile period. This period of socialization is the time when puppies form social bonds, learn to explore and learn when/how to base fear. Additionally, this stage consists of teaching them how to appropriately react and habituate to environmental changes in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood.</b> Habituation is the process when a puppy has gotten used to stimuli in their environment and therefore ignores it, deeming it non-threatening. The puppy’s future personality will be greatly influenced during the socialization period. Their temperament and character is developed throughout this period as well, which will last for the duration of their life. During the socialization stage, all five senses are being stimulated by exposure and desensitization of sights, sounds, tastes, smells and touch of things around them.|$|E

After rep li-cating the commonly found cultural differences in AM in samples from Asia (PR China, N = 77), Africa (Cameroon, N = 68), and Europe (Germany, N = 100), the authors demonstrate {{that the number of}} siblings has a substantial effect on AM variables. The cultural variance explained by the number of siblings ranges from 30 % in the age of first memory to 99 % in specificity and integration.

5000|$|This is {{the first}} stage that a person {{undergoes}} {{at the beginning of}} life and terminates at about age 22. Levinson refers to this era as the [...] "formative years," [...] by which a person undergoes unique experiences that assists in both development and the <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood.</b> The pre-adulthood stage entails the most rapid physical growth; as manifested by the initial change from infancy to childhood, followed by childhood to adolescence, and finally adolescence to adulthood in the later years. Individuals also become faced with the crisis of me vs. not me, by which an individual transitions from a state of dependence to a state of independence that is usually achieved around the age of 20. When life begins, infants rely on their mothers to simply survive, however as they mature they become less dependent on others and increasingly self-sustaining. This ongoing formation of independence not only aids in individualization but is also critical to survival because it ultimately prepares one for the onset and course of adulthood...|$|E

40|$|Transition to <b>adulthood</b> <b>for</b> {{students}} with disabilities is of interest both to service providers and families. It is, however, a lengthy and often tortuous journey, and the success with which parents navigate it has implications for them, for their adult children with disabilities, and for providers of services. In this study, {{we were able to}} predict maternal responses to the Transition Daily Rewards and Worries Questionnaire (TDRWQ) from maternal personality, measures of well-being and depression, and child adaptive and maladaptive behaviour measured 6 years earlier. Most notably, the personality variable of Extraversion, a global measure of well-being, and both adaptive and maladaptive behaviour of the child with disabilities predicted 32. 7 % of the variance of a general positive orientation to the future.

40|$|If {{education}} is to be about ‘human flourishing’ (De Ruyter, 2004) as well as <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood</b> and work, then religious and citizenship education {{would seem to have}} a key contribution towards this goal, both offering opportunities for the exploration and development of a robust sense of identity. However, despite the opposition of most religious educators, religious education has been treated by successive UK governments simply as a form of inculcation into a homogenous notion of citizenship based on nominal church attendance. Moreover, the teaching of the relatively new subject of citizenship education, whilst recognising that the sense of identity and allegiance is complex, has not regularly included faith perspectives. I argue that the concept of ‘spiritual development’, which centres on an existential sense of identity, offers a justification for combining lessons in both religious and citizenship education. I conclude on a cautionary note, arguing that pupils need to be given a critical awareness of ways in which such identities can be provided for them by default, particularly since consumer culture increasingly makes use of ‘spiritual’ language and imagery...|$|E
40|$|Teenagers aging out {{of foster}} care face harms {{that can be}} traced to their lack of <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood.</b> This Article argues that {{teenagers}} in foster care have a substantive due process right to services not only while they are in state custody but also after they age out of care. The lower federal courts have interpreted the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services to mean that foster children-like prisoners and mentally retarded people held in state custody-have a substantive due process right to personal safety. What the courts have not considered is how these rights apply to foster teenagers. For teenagers, the primary risks of harm are associated with leaving care, not harm from within the system. Foster teens should have a recognized right to receive services to prepare them for adulthood, at least until age eighteen and potentially into adulthood. If they do not receive such services and then suffer harm {{as a result of the}} denial, they should be able to sue for a violation of their constitutional rights...|$|E
40|$|Adolescent {{nutritional}} {{behaviors are}} assuming considerable importance in nutrition interventions given their important relationships with medium- and long-term outcomes. This is {{the period when}} young people undergo major anatomical and physiological maturational changes in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood.</b> Nutritional requirements during puberty are higher during adolescence than during the prepubertal stage and during adulthood. A significant proportion of adolescents also become parents, and hence {{the importance of their}} health and nutritional status before as well as during pregnancy has its impact on their own health, fetal well-being, and newborn health. In this paper, we describe the evidence-based nutrition recommendations and the current global guidance for nutrition actions for adolescents. Despite the limitations of available information, we believe that a range of interventions are feasible to address outcomes in this age group, although some would need to start earlier in childhood. We propose packages of preventive care and management comprising nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions to address adolescent undernutrition, overnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies. We discuss potential delivery platforms and strategies relevant to low- and middle-income countries. Beyond the evidence synthesis, there is a clear need to translate evidence into policy and for implementation of key recommendations and addressing knowledge gaps through prioritized research...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{one piece}} of a statewide Children's Mental Health System Analysis {{conducted}} in Washington State, the specific service needs of severely emotionally disturbed children were investigated. METHODS: The primary case-workers of 3398 children {{under the care of}} the state responded to a survey of the child's treatment history, social and clinical condition, and service needs. Service need data on the 2455 children in the sample who were classifiable as severely emotionally disturbed were examined using log linear analysis.

40|$|Background: Evidence {{suggests}} that depression in adolescents have {{increased over the}} last decade, so much so, at its current rate {{it will be an}} epidemic in young people. Therefore the aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the multifaceted aetiology of depression by examining its biological, environmental, sociological and psychological factors, in order to address and tackle this public health issue now and into the future. Methods: A review of the literature was undertaken between the years 2010 - 2015 to identify key themes and priority areas of development. Results: Adolescence signals the beginning of a transformative phase for young people, in which physical, emotional, social and intellectual development occurs in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood.</b> Therefore the exposure to a range of environmental and sociological factors, in addition to pre-existing biological and cognitive vulnerabilities may considerably increase the risk of adolescents developing depression, which is most significant in adolescent girls. Conclusion: This review identifies distinctive male and female trajectories during adolescence, particularly in relation to brain development. Therefore further research is required within this area in order to educate young people, parents/carers and professionals working within universal services on the complexity of this subject in order to promote the early identification of depression in adolescents...|$|E
40|$|A Study of Progression in Irish Higher Education by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in 2010 {{highlighted}} {{the issue of}} high attrition rates among first year Computer Science students (Chantler et Al, 2010). The importance of improving retention in Computer Science programmes is recognised and extensive research {{has been carried out}} to identify contributing factors (Kuh et al, 2007, Braxton, 2006). Braxton 2006 identifies Student Course Learning as a fundamental contributor to success in higher education encompassing 6 key areas including: academic attainment, acquisition of general education, development of academic confidence, development of cognitive skills and intellectual disciplines, occupational attainment and <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood</b> and citizenship. This paper presents the effects of a pilot project in which first year Computer Science students participated in a week long induction programme aimed at improving first year student retention through early student engagement. The induction programme had two key aims: - Integrating new students into the School of Computing, giving them a sense of identity as Computing students - Kick starting a series of transferable skills SWAT (Study Weapons and Tactics) workshops The key focus of the programme was a week-long Problem Based Learning (PBL) project supported by faculty through transferable skills workshops. Here, students competed in teams to plan a Fresher’s Week event for first year students in conjunction with the Students’ Union. This activity was further supported by interactive introductory lectures, career talks and past project presentations. The week culminated in Dragons Den style presentations of the three finalist ideas where the winning team was chosen and prizes were awarded. This paper is structured as follows. Section 1 describes the challenges faced by Computing Departments in third level institutes in tackling student retention.

40|$|While much of {{the rest}} of the world looked upon Jordan and {{surrounding}} regions in 2013 with fear of continual revolt and religiously motivated violence, Jordanians continued to live their everyday lives, attending to ordinary concerns, such as the raising and socialization of children. The central question that this dissertation explores is: how are children in Amman, Jordan, socialized into matters of morality? Though moral education is rooted in Islam, the source of moral education is found not only in formal religious education, but also in the way Islam is lived in the everyday. Moral education is integrated into interactions between children and their caretakers. Through activities such as answering questions in the classroom, to misbehaving and then being scolded, children are absorbing values about how to be members of the community and, specifically, how to be good, moral community members. But this <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>adulthood</b> is done within a context of change. Amidst political, social, and economic instability, what it means to be good is in flux. Jordan is also in the midst of large-scale educational reforms, which have led to new curriculums and methods of teaching. Economic reforms have fallen short in creating jobs for the increasingly educated population. In my dissertation, I look closely at language—starting at the interactional level and moving to broader discourses about bilingualism—and argue that children are caught between what it means to be good in a moral, Islamic, and cultural sense, and what it means to be good in a globalized sense where English and the pressure toward individual achievement take on tremendous power in Jordan’s move into the future. While the particulars of the balancing act differ across Jordan and even within the population I worked with, moral education is about finding a balance between local values and concerns (like who are you and how you relate to others) and progress (tied to leaving Jordan, learning English, and achieving individual success in education). The dissertation analyzes classrooms at Al-Dawran, a mid-sized private school in Amman, and interactions between children and their caregivers at home, including parents and extended family...|$|E
