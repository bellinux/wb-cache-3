The centralized system also identifies the traffic intensity thereby prioritizing the roads that need quick {{action to be taken}} upon. Moreover, the system helps the driver to detect the level of damage to the road stretch and route the vehicle from an alternative path to its destination. The system sends a feedback to the concerned authorities for a quick response to the condition of the roads. The system we use comprises a laser sensor and pressure sensors in shock absorbers to detect and quantify the intensity of the pothole, a centralized server which maintains a database of locations of all the potholes which can be accessed by another unit inside the vehicle. A <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>connection</b> device is also installed in vehicles so that, when a vehicle detects a pothole which is not in the database, all the vehicles within a range of 20 meters are warned about the pothole.

If the destination is unknown, then the system will check for potholes in the current road and displays the level of damage.
