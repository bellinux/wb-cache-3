The maxin. im torque, maxi-mum torsional deformation, energy absorbed to fracture, and torsional stiffness all increased with {{the rate of}} deformation, reached a maxinaim, and then declined. The bones absorbed 67 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> more energy, had 33 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> more <b>torque</b> and torsional deformation, and 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> more stiffness at {{the highest rate of}} deformation as corn-pared with the lowest. Strength of the bone, a term frequently used clinically, represents to a mechan-ical engineer a generic term which is imprecise. It may presume that one or many of the numerous and complex mechanical testing methods are applicable and show con-sistent results, or it may be so general as to have no precise meaning. Because bone shows viscoelastic behavior, it has neither a single stress-strain curve nor a single characteristic for ultimate failure.
