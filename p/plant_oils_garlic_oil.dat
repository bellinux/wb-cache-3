40|$|Ruminant nutritionists aim to {{manipulate}} the ruminal microbial ecosystems and fermentation to improve feed utilization and feed conversion to animal products. Antibiotics have good effects on feed utilization and production, but have been banned due to the increasing public concern for their usage. Thus, looking for natural alternative has gained interest and importance. Phytogenic extracts (Cedillo et al., 2015), exogenous enzymes (Vallejo et al., 2016), and yeast (Hassan et al., 2016) are gaining increasing interest as feed additive for animal feeding. Such feed additives can reduce energy losses as methane (CH 4), and nitrogen (N) as ammonia, which reduce animal performance {{and contribute to the}} release of pollutants to the environment. Ruminal fermentation is accompanied by production of methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) which are greenhouse gases (GHG) that cause environmental pollution. The effect of natural feed additives on the in vitro fermentation and production of CH 4 and CO 2 in dairy calf has had less attention. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil,</b> xylanase enzyme, and yeast on in vitro biogas production from dairy calves fed a high concentrate diet. Rumen contents from 60 -d old Holstein calves fed a concentrate diet were used as inoculum source. <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> was included at 30, 120, 250 and 500 mL/g dry matter (DM), while xylanase was included at 3 and 6 mL/g DM and yeast at 2 and 4 mg/g DM. The substrate used was the same as the diet fed to calves. <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> linearly decreased (P < 0. 05) in vitro DM digestibility and there were no differences among levels of either xylanase or yeast. <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> decreased (P < 0. 05) DM degradability while xylanase and yeast had no effect. The lag phase was linearly increased (P < 0. 05) with increasing level of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> quadratically decreased CH 4 and CO 2 production. The control treatment had the highest CH 4 and CO 2 production followed by xylanase, yeast and <b>garlic</b> <b>oil.</b> Increasing level of xylanase and yeast increased (P < 0. 05) CO 2 production. It can be concluded that <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> followed by yeast and then xylanase can be used to mitigate in vitro CH 4 and CO 2 production from dairy calves fed a high concentrate diet.

The results suggest that, in this experimental model, <b>oil</b> extract of <b>garlic</b> promotes intestinal transference of calcium by modulating the activities of both intestinal alkaline phosphatase and Ca 2 + activated ATPase. Also the observed low bone mineral content and low bone tensile strength in these rats were significantly restored by <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> supplementation.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Application of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> in food {{industry}} {{can be improved}} by encapsulation. There is no study about the formation of inclusion complex of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> by beta-cyclodextrin. The aim {{of the present study}} is comparison of the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of free and encapsulated <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> with beta-cyclodextrin. Materials and Methods: Antioxidant activity was determined by 1, 1 - diphenyl- 2 - picryl-hydrazyl assay, and antibacterial properties by agar well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration and bacterial growth assay. Statistical analysis was performed by Minitab statistical software. Results and conclusion: <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> had poor antioxidant activity (EC 50, 5222 µg ml- 1) and EC 50 because garlic oil/beta-cyclodextrin (containing 1495 µg ml- 1 released <b>garlic</b> <b>oil)</b> was achieved after 5 h and 25 min. Agar well diffusion showed no inhibition zone on Muller Hinton Agar for <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>garlic</b> oil/betacyclodextrin (with initial release (shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h at 37 ºC) and without initial release). Staphylococcus aureus was the most susceptible bacterium to <b>garlic</b> <b>oil,</b> and <b>garlic</b> oil/beta-cyclodextrin with and without initial release (minimum inhibitory concentration 10 - 5, 10 - 4 and 10 - 3 % w v - 1, respectively); however, Bacillus cereus was the most resistant. The effect of initial release for garlic oil/betacyclodextrin on inhibiting the growth of all four bacteria was significant. There was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) between the inhibitory effect of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>garlic</b> oil/beta-cyclodextrin with initial release on Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, also Salmonella entrica and Escherichia coli. <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> showed a weak antioxidant activity in 1, 1 - diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl assay. <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> and its complex were not able to penetrate to the solid media; therefore, no inhibition zone and no antibacterial activity in the agar well diffusion assay were observed. Initial release of garlic oil/beta-cyclodextrin had significant impact on the inhibition of four bacterial growth, similar to free <b>garlic</b> <b>oil.</b> Since encapsulation of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> can cover its drawbacks (low solubility in water, liquid form, and intense odor), garlic oil/beta-cyclodextrin could be considered as an nonsynthetic antibacterial agent.

The dose of black seed <b>oil</b> or <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> (0. 8 ml per day) was administered orally and daily through gavage to the females until the weaning age offspring of second pregnancy. The offspring (at PD 28 age) were subjected to the locomotory test and subsequently their serum analysis was done to measure the level of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT or AST), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT or ALT), cholesterol (HDLP), triglycerides (TG), and glucose (GLU). It was observed that black seed consumption increased the fecundity (total number of offspring) in both pregnancies. The number of male offspring increased significantly whereas the number of female offspring remained unaffected in both pregnancies. On the contrary, garlic showed {{no change in the}} sex ratio of offspring. Male offspring of the mothers consuming black seed oil were comparatively more active than the offspring of mothers consuming <b>garlic</b> <b>oil.</b> However, female offspring of mothers consuming both black seed and <b>garlic</b> <b>oils</b> were significantly active as compared to the controls. Black seed and <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> consumption by the mothers had a lowering effect on the level of TG, GOT, GPT and GLU in the serum of the offspring of both pregnancies, whereas no change was observed on the level of serum HDLP.

Next, solutions of thymol, benzoate, and sorbate, individually and in various combinations were applied to carpet square samples, which were then inoculated with A. versicolor and P. chrysogenum and incubated at 25 °C with 97 % relative humidity (RH). Spore counting was conducted, and carpet treated with the mixture of thymol (3. 3 μg/mm 2), benzoate (16. 5 μg/mm 2), and sorbate (16. 5 μg/mm 2) (TBS-carpet) showed inhibitory effects at the low concentrations tested. Ethylcellulose was then added to the TBS mixture as a coating polymer (TBSC-carpet). TBSC- and TBS-carpet were compared and results indicated that the addition of the cellulose maintained the antifungal properties of TBS even in carpet samples stored for up to 12 months. These comparison tests were repeated under extreme conditions of high humidity (99 %RH for 168 hours) or immersion in water (for 24 hours followed by a 10 minute rinse). HPLC determination for the amounts of remaining thymol, benzoate, and sorbate in carpets indicated that all were greater in the TBSC-carpet than in the TBS-carpet. Spore counting also was performed.

40|$|<b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to protect the cardiovascular system; however, the effects and mechanisms behind the cardioprotection of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> on diabetes-induced cardiaomyopathy are unclear. In this study, we used streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats to investigate whether <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> could protect the heart from diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy. Wistar STZ-induced diabetic rats received <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> (0, 10, 50 or 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 body weight) by gastric gavage every 2 days for 16 days. Normal rats without diabetes were used as control. Cardiac contractile dysfunction and cardiac pathologic hypertrophy responses were observed in diabetic rat hearts. Cardiac function was examined using echocardiography. In addition to cardiac hypertrophy-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways (e. g., p 38, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and extracellularly responsive kinase (ERK 1 / 2)), the IL- 6 /MEK 5 /ERK 5 signaling pathway was greatly activated in the diabetic rat hearts, which contributes to the up-regulation of cardiac pathologic hypertrophy markers including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and leads to cardiac contractile dysfunction. <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> treatment significantly inhibited the up-regulation in MAPK (e. g., p 38, JNK and ERK 1 / 2) and IL- 6 /MEK 5 /ERK 5 signaling pathways in the diabetic rat hearts, reducing the levels of cardiac pathologic hypertrophy markers such as ANP and BNP, and improving the cardiac contractile function. Collectively, data from these studies demonstrate that <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> shows the potential cardioprotective effects for protecting heart from diabetic cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|The {{individual}} and combined effects of dietary fat and <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> on two drug-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P- 450 2 B 1 and the placental form of glutathione (GSH) S-transferase (PGST), in rat liver {{were examined in}} this study. Rats were fed a low corn oil, high corn oil or high fish oil diet and received various amount of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> (0, 30, 80, 200 mg/kg body) orally three times per week for 6 wk. The fat energy in the low and high fat diets accounted for 11. 6 and 45. 7 % of total energy, respectively. Final body weights did not differ among the three dietary fat groups and were not affected by <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> treatment. The fatty acid profile in hepatic phospholipids revealed higher eicosapentaenoic acid [20 : 5 (n- 3) ] and docosahexaenoic acid [22. 6 (n- 3) ] levels in the fish oil-fed group than in the low and high corn oil-fed groups (P < 0. 05). In contrast, the corn oil-fed groups had greater hepatic phospholipid arachidonic acid [20 : 4 (n- 6) ] levels (P < 0. 05). Both dietary fat and <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> significantly affected hepatic cytochrome 7 -pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity and GST activity toward ethacrynic acid. Rats fed the high fish oil diet had 85 and 51 % higher PROD activity compared with those fed the low or the high corn oil diet, respectively (P < 0. 05). The GST activity in the high fish oil and the high corn oil groups was 33 and 18 % higher than that in the low corn oil group (P < 0. 05), respectively, and the GST activity in rats fed the high fish oil diet was higher than in those fed the high corn oil diet (P < 0. 05). <b>Garlic</b> <b>oil</b> dose-dependently increased GST activity. No interaction between dietary fat and <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> on PROD or GST activity was noted. Northern and Western blot analysis revealed that dietary fish oil increased both cytochrome P- 450 2 B 1 and PGST mRNA and protein levels. Cytochrome P- 450 2 B 1 and PGST mRNA and protein levels were also dose-dependently increased by <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> treatment. The effects of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> and dietary fat on P- 450 2 B 1 and PGST mRNA and protein expression were independent. These results indicate that dietary fat and <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> independently modulate P- 450 2 B 1 and PGST expression at transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional stages...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to improve faba bean yield since this plant remains an {{important}} part of the human diet. So, experiments have been designed to determine the effect of some bio-compounds on faba bean growth, chemical composition and chocolate spot disease. In vitro, results revealed that Bio Zeid and Bio ARC completely inhibited the linear growth, mycelia dry weight and sporulation of Botrytis fabae. <b>Plant</b> <b>oils</b> (cumin, cornation, <b>garlic</b> and rocket <b>oils)</b> completely inhibited the sporulation only. In vivo, results (2007 / 2008 and 2008 / 2009 seasons) confirmed the positive return of the tested compounds in which, the highest increase in fresh weight was recorded with Bio ARC, while in dry weight the highest increase was recorded with rocket <b>oil.</b> <b>Plant</b> height, number of branches, pods/plant and seeds/pod increased significantly with Acadian-C plant. The weight of 100 seeds reached to the maximum with aminogreen. In addition to the general improvements in N, P, K, Zn, Fe and Mn content. Total chlorophyll reached to the maximum values when using Bio Zeid, Bio ARC, Acadian-C <b>plant</b> and rocket <b>oil.</b> Bio ARC, Bio Zeid and <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> revealed the most superior positive effect among other additions on total phenolic compounds. Bio ARC and Bio Zeid led to maximum reduction of chocolate spot disease severity. Bio-, organic and natural additives were found to be most effective in increasing growth, chemical composition and yield parameters of faba bean and decrease the disease severity of chocolate spot disease...|$|R

Owing {{to the great}} potential of garlic and its preparations in developing antiinflammatory drugs, {{the aim of the}} present study is to investigate the effect of <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> on the locomotion of a neutrophil-like cell by measuring the dynamic features of cell migration including migration direction, average migration speed, chemotactic index (CI), and motility index (MI) with the newly designed Labchip. We found that <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> treatment lowered the values of CI and MI and reduced the average speed of cell migration from 13 to 8 &#x 2009;&#x 03 BC;m/min. The results indicate that <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> is a potential inhibitor for neutrophil-like cell migration and chemotactic responsiveness. By comparing with the effects of nocodazole and cytochalasin B, we also suggest that the antiinflammatory activity exhibited by <b>garlic</b> <b>oil</b> was mainly through inhibiting the assembly-disassembly processes of the cytoskeleton...|$|R
