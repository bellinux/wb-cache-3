5|$|Solar One {{operated}} successfully from 1982 to 1988, {{proving that}} solar power towers work efficiently to produce utility-scale power from sunlight. The Solar One plant used water/steam as the heat-transfer fluid in the receiver; this presented several problems {{in terms of}} storage and continuous turbine operation. To address these problems, Solar One was upgraded to Solar Two, which operated from 1996 to 1999. Both systems had a 10 MW <b>power</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wind <b>power</b> <b>capacity</b> has {{expanded}} rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and {{wind energy production}} was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly.

5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear <b>power</b> <b>capacity.</b> Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of wind <b>power</b> <b>capacity</b> in South Australia has been encouraged {{by a number}} of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll tax rebate scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full <b>power</b> <b>capacity</b> when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Prost paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Félix da Costa in second, and Lopez third. D'Ambrosio and Ma Qinghua (who was unable to {{complete}} a maximum power lap) were the group's two slowest drivers. Buemi was the fastest driver in the second group, half a second ahead of teammate Turvey. Heidfeld, Sarazzin, and Evans rounded out the top five. In the third group, Vergne recorded the overall fastest time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 20.993 seconds. Di Grassi qualified 12th overall after narrowly avoiding colliding with the wall between the sixth and seventh turns. His teammate Abt was second quickest in the group, ahead of di Grassi, Maro Engel, and Duval (who went wide on his timed lap which was recorded on reduced power). Rosenqvist immediately employed his car's full <b>power</b> <b>capacity</b> and was the fastest driver in the fourth (and last) group. He finished ahead of Bird, who equalled Vergne's pace at first, but then his rear tyre made contact with the wall which cost him time. Piquet was third on his fastest lap which saw him make contact with the wall once. Robin Frijns and Adam Carroll were the slowest drivers of the fourth group; the latter locked his rear tyres and went wide at the first corner, resulting in him starting 20th (and last). At the end of the group qualifying stage, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Buemi, Bird and Piquet were the five drivers to qualify for the Super Pole round.|$|E
