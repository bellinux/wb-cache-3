5|$|According to Henderson, {{newspaper}} {{articles on the}} Flying Spaghetti Monster {{attracted the attention of}} book publishers; he said that at one <b>point,</b> <b>there</b> were six publishers interested in the Flying Spaghetti Monster. In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from Villard to write The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Taylor moved to Raleigh, North Carolina with his five daughters {{and worked as}} a UPS package handler, then worked as a beer distributor. By 2006, he had moved back home and was working as a bricklayer with his father. In January 2005, police charged Taylor with misdemeanor child abuse for allegedly leaving four of his children (ages from 2 to 11) alone for more than eight hours. He did not show up for his court date, and at one <b>point</b> <b>there</b> were four outstanding warrants for his arrest.|$|E

5|$|At this <b>point,</b> <b>there</b> is a {{divergence}} in {{the classical}} sources as to {{the course of events}} which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}}, {{the mental}} foramen, {{an opening in}} the mandible just before the first molar, opens to the outside, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that <b>point.</b> <b>There</b> is no capsular process of the lower incisor, a trait Mindomys shares with only a few other oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Age {{began in}} Scotland from about {{the seventh century}} BCE. From this <b>point</b> <b>there</b> are the first finds of iron {{artifacts}} in hoards that are consistent containing other items {{that are consistent with}} Bronze Age practice. there is also evidence of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included roundhouses and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.|$|E

5|$|The Seven Fold Way is also {{reflected}} in the group's initiatory system, which has seven grades through which the member can gradually progress. Theses are: (1) Neophyte, (2) Initiate, (3) External Adept, (4) Internal Adept, (5) Master/Mistress, (6) Grand Master/Mousa and (7) Immortal. The group has revealed that very few of its members raise to the fifth and sixth degrees, and in a 1989 article the ONA stated that at that <b>point</b> <b>there</b> were only four individuals who had reached the stage of Master.|$|E
5|$|The first Bishop of Wells was Athelm (909), who crowned King Æthelstan. Athelm and {{his nephew}} Dunstan both became Archbishops of Canterbury. During this period a choir of boys was {{established}} to sing the liturgy. Wells Cathedral School, which {{was established to}} educate these choirboys, dates its foundation to this <b>point.</b> <b>There</b> is, however, some controversy over this. Following the Norman Conquest, Bishop John de Villula moved {{the seat of the}} bishop from Wells to Bath in 1090. The church at Wells, no longer a cathedral, had a college of secular clergy.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} tourist {{facilities}} on Lismore, including a cafe and a post office. Bicycles may be hired at <b>Point.</b> <b>There</b> is no petrol filling station.

5|$|After the war, {{construction}} of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated {{the closure of the}} line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this <b>point</b> <b>there</b> were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily from Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. The engine shed was closed in 1924.|$|E
5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that <b>point,</b> <b>there</b> were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this <b>point</b> <b>there</b> was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, at which <b>point</b> <b>there</b> were {{four types of}} member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E
5|$|In the 1250s, the {{fortunes}} of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master Hugh Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this <b>point</b> <b>there</b> were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this <b>point,</b> <b>there</b> were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E

5|$|Maintaining {{its peak}} {{intensity}} {{for over a}} day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the Westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The system passed over the western Azores as a minimal hurricane on September15. At this <b>point,</b> <b>there</b> is uncertainty as {{to the structure of}} Debbie, whether it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone or maintained its identity as a tropical system. Regardless of which took place, the system deepened as it neared Ireland, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September16. Shortly thereafter, the system was confirmed to have become extratropical as it continued towards the northeast. The remnants of the storm later turned eastward, striking Norway and Russia, before dissipating on September19.|$|E
5|$|Records of burghs, {{small towns}} granted legal {{privileges}} from the crown, {{can be found}} from the eleventh century. Burghs (a term derived from the Germanic word for fortress), developed rapidly {{during the reign of}} David I (1124–53). Up until this <b>point</b> <b>there</b> were no identifiable towns in Scotland. Most of the burghs that were granted charters in his reign probably already existed as settlements. Charters were copied almost verbatim from those used in England, and early citizens, called burgesses, that were usually English or Flemish. They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements. Most of the early burghs were on the east coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Aberdeen, Berwick, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the European continent. In the south-west, Glasgow, Ayr and Kirkcudbright were aided by the less-profitable sea trade with Ireland, {{and to a lesser extent}} France and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{calendar}} for the ELCA {{is similar}} to many other Western Calendars in {{that it does not}} commemorate any persons from the Old Testament. The calendars of the Orthodox Churches have Old Testament individuals, and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod has done the same. At one <b>point</b> <b>there</b> was a proposal to include a day on the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E
