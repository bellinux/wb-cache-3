5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, {{women are more likely}} than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
50|$|More independently, Witkin wrote a Journal of Abnormal Psychology {{review of}} {{relationships}} between Field Dependency/Psychological Differentiation and types of psychopathology.

50|$|In another example, a {{study of}} the {{portrayal}} of race, ethnicity, and nationality in televised sporting events by journalist Derrick Jackson in 1989 showed that black <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than white <b>people</b> to <b>be</b> described in demeaning intellectual terms.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites {{as well as the}} intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined the}} relationship between distinctiveness and self-schematicity. Experiment I revealed that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> self-schematic in domains of strong performance when they felt distinct from family and peers in those domains. Experiments 2 and 3 extended this finding into the arena of stereotypes by demonstrating that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> self-schematic in domains of strong performance when their performance was counterstereotypic rather than stereotypic. In particular, African Americans and women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> schematic for intelligence than Caucasians and men if they performed well academically, whereas Caucasians-especially men-were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than African Americans to be schematic for athletics if they performed well athletically.

25|$|Overall, {{intensity}} of aphasia treatment {{is an area}} that requires more research.

25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} by the following example. Assume that an opinion poll is conducted by calling random telephone numbers. Unemployed <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be home and answer the phone than employed people are. Therefore, unemployed respondents {{are likely to be}} over-represented in the sample. The probability distribution of employed versus unemployed respondents in a sample of n respondents can be described as a noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
25|$|Example: We visit every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} answer the door. In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to answer the door (e.g. an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|E
25|$|Incentive {{theory in}} {{psychology}} treats motivation {{and behavior of}} the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities {{that are expected to}} be profitable. Incentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.F. Skinner. Incentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person's actions always have social ramifications: and if actions are positively received <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.|$|E

25|$|Rheumatic fever {{may occur}} {{following}} an {{infection of the}} throat by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. If the infection is untreated rheumatic fever can occur in up to three percent of people. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the production of antibodies against a person's own tissues. Due to their genetics, some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to get the disease when exposed to the bacteria than others. Other risk factors include malnutrition and poverty. Diagnosis of RF is often based {{on the presence of}} signs and symptoms in combination with evidence of a recent streptococcal infection.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{susceptibility}} to decompression sickness has components {{which can be}} attributed to a specific cause, and components which appear to be random. The random component makes successive decompressions a poor test of susceptibility. Obesity and high serum lipid levels have been implicated by some studies as risk factors, and risk seems to increase with age. Another study has also shown that older subjects tended to bubble more than younger subjects for reasons not yet known, but no trends between weight, body fat, or gender and bubbles were identified, and the question of why some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to form bubbles than others remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to {{cooperate}} on a task {{if they can}} {{communicate with one another}} first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.|$|E

25|$|BME LGB {{communities}} are disproportionately affected by homophobic violence, abuse and harassment. In {{a study conducted}} in London, BME LGB <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to experience physical abuse, <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to experience harassment from a stranger and were equally likely to have experienced verbal abuse as their White British LGB counterparts, and due to the pressures of discrimination and victimisation, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have poorer mental health.|$|R
25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to think {{that they will not be}} harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors which}} can affect {{decompression}} risk include oxygen concentration, carbon dioxide levels, body position, vasodilators and constrictors, {{positive or negative}} pressure breathing. and dehydration (blood volume). Individual susceptibility to decompression sickness has components which {{can be attributed to}} a specific cause, and components which appear to be random. The random component makes successive decompressions a poor test of susceptibility. Obesity and high serum lipid levels have been implicated by some studies as risk factors, and risk seems to increase with age.

25|$|Police {{brutality}} {{is measured}} {{based on the}} accounts {{of people who have}} experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This is because {{there is no way to}} quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Because police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting. Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.|$|E
50|$|Although this {{variable}} {{is not included}} in Latané's theory, Burger et al. (2004) conducted studies that examined the effect of similarity and compliance to a request.
