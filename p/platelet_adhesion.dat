5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for <b>platelet</b> <b>adhesion.</b>|$|E

In this study, we screened for additional proteins which associate with phosphorylated <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecule 1, using surface plasmon resonance. We found that, besides SHP- 1 and SHP- 2, <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecule 1 binds the cytoplasmic signalling proteins SHIP and PLC-γ 1 via their Src homology 2 domains. Using two phosphopeptides, NSDVQpY 663 TEVQV and DTETVpY 686 SEVRK, we demonstrate differential binding of SHP- 1, SHP- 2, SHIP and PLC-γ 1. All four cytoplasmic signalling proteins directly associate with cellular <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecule 1, immunoprecipitated from pervanadate-stimulated THP- 1 cells.

In endothelial cells, not only vascular endothelial cadherin but also <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecule- 1 localizes into junctions and associates with β-catenin. To explore a putative cooperation of <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecule- 1 and vascular endothelial cadherin, we analyzed transfectants expressing either <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> (CD 31 cells) or vascular endothelial cadherin (CD 144 cells) or both molecules (CD 31 /CD 144 cells), and, for comparison, human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Basic fibroblast growth factor completely dissociated vascular endothelial cadherin/β-catenin complexes and robustly moved β-catenin into the nucleus in CD 144 cells, whereas in CD 31 /CD 144 cells {{as well as}} in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, fibroblast growth factor only partially dissociated the junctional complex followed by a significantly reduced nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In contrast, in CD 31 cells, the subcellular distribution of β-catenin remained unaffected by fibroblast growth factor. As a functional consequence, fibroblast growth factor induced a complete collapse of the F-actin network in CD 144 cells, a limited rearrangement of F-actin fibers in CD 31 /CD 144 cells and no F-actin rearrangement in CD 31 cells. We also analyzed the effect of fibroblast growth factor-induced rearrangement of junctions on junction permeability for leukocytes: in line with our observation that vascular endothelial cadherin was required for cells to respond to fibroblast growth factor, only in CD 31 /CD 144 cells, but not in CD 31 cells, leukocyte transmigration was significantly enhanced by fibroblast growth factor. In conclusion <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecule- 1 cooperates with vascular endothelial cadherin in a mutual fashion; <b>platelet</b> endothelial cell <b>adhesion</b> molecule- 1 reduces and temporarily limits fibroblast growth factor-induced dissociation of vascular endothelial cadherin/β-catenin complexes, but requires vascular endothelial cadherin to control leukocyte transmigration in dependence of fibroblast growth factor...|$|R

The size of the nanocones strongly depended on treatment time. The optimal results in terms of material hemocompatibility were obtained after treatment with oxygen plasma for 15 s, when both the nanotopography and wettability were the most favorable, since marked reduction in adhesion and activation of platelets was observed on this surface. At prolonged treatment times, the rich surface topography was lost and thus also its antithrombogenic properties. Chemical composition of the surface was always more or less the same, regardless of its morphology and height of the nanocones.

40|$|AbstractTo better {{understand}} {{the means by which}} cells such as human platelets regulate the binding of the integrin αIIbβ 3 to fibrinogen, we have examined agonist-initiated inside-out and outside-in signalling in CHRF- 288 cells, a megakaryoblastic cell line that expresses αIIbβ 3 and the human thrombin receptor, PAR 1. The results show several notable similarities and differences. (1) Activation of PAR 1 caused CHRF- 288 cells to adhere and spread on immobilized fibrinogen in an αIIbβ 3 -dependent manner, but did not support the binding of soluble fibrinogen or PAC- 1, an antibody specific for activated αIIbβ 3. (2) Direct activation of protein kinase C with PMA or disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with low concentrations of cytochalasin D also caused CHRF- 288 cells to adhere to fibrinogen. (3) Despite the failure to bind soluble fibrinogen, activation of PAR 1 in CHRF- 288 cells caused phosphoinositide hydrolysis, arachidonate mobilization and the phosphorylation of p 42 MAPK, phospholipase A 2 and the Rac exchange protein, Vav, all of which occur in platelets. PAR 1 activation also caused an increase in cytosolic Ca 2 +, which, when prevented, blocked adhesion to fibrinogen. (4) Finally, as in <b>platelets,</b> <b>adhesion</b> of CHRF- 288 cells to fibrinogen was followed by a burst of integrin-dependent (‘outside-in’) signalling, marked by FAK phosphorylation and a more prolonged phosphorylation of p 42 MAPK. However, in contrast to <b>platelets,</b> <b>adhesion</b> to fibrinogen had no effect on Vav phosphorylation. Collectively, these observations show that signalling initiated through PAR 1 in CHRF- 288 cells can support αIIbβ 3 binding to immobilized ligand, but not the full integrin activation needed to bind soluble ligand. This would suggest that there has been an increase in integrin avidity without an accompanying increase in affinity. Such increases in avidity are thought to be due to integrin clustering, which would also explain the results obtained with cytochalasin D. The failure of αIIbβ 3 to achieve the high affinity state in CHRF- 288 cells was not due to the failure of PAR 1 activation to initiate a number of signalling events that normally accompany platelet activation nor did it prevent at least some forms of outside-in signalling. However, at least one marker of outside-in signalling, the augmentation of Vav phosphorylation seen during platelet aggregation, did not occur in CHRF- 288 cells...|$|R

40|$|During {{hemostatic}} and inflammatory responses, {{cell adhesion}} molecules {{play a major}} role in regulating the leukocytes and <b>platelets</b> <b>adhesion</b> to vascular surfaces under the hydrodynamic environment of the circulation. Selectin-ligand interactions (bonds) mediate leukocyte rolling on vascular surfaces. The molecular basis for differential ligand recognition by selectins is poorly understood. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), the kinetics of three mutants L-selectin interacting with surrogates of PSGL- 1 and PNAd, is compared with those of wild-type L-selectin. The interaction between glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) mediates platelet translocation at the vascular vessel damage sites, which plays a critical role in initiating the <b>platelets</b> <b>adhesion</b> and thrombus formation. Translocation of platelets on VWF requires a shear threshold, suggesting a possible catch bond at work there. We characterized the kinetics of GPIbα interacting with VWF A 1 domain, confirming the catch bond existed. Two type 2 B VWD A 1 mutants eliminated the catch bond and gave longer low force lifetimes. The prolonged lifetimes at low force resulted in more agglutination of platelets with A 1 coated microspheres in flow. During the process of hemostasis, the size of prothrombotic ULVWF affects the affinity of VWF to platelets bearing GPIbα on the membrane. ADAMTS 13 has been identified and characterized as a multi-domain metalloprotease that regulate the size of ULVWF. We studied how force regulated the binding and cleavage of ADAMTS 13 on VWF. We found the cleavage effects could only be observed after the catastrophic structural change of A 1 A 2 A 3. The unfolding exposed the ADAMTS 13 cleavage site and favored the cleavage. Two protocols using different stretching molecules (GPIbα and CR 1) and A 1 A 2 A 3 immobilization methods revealed the cleavage effects diminished with increasing stretching force. This study elucidated mechanisms of the binding kinetics of L-selectin with different structure components from PSGL- 1 and PNAd by structural variants. It also provided new insights into our current knowledge of the dynamic adhesion and regulation of GPIbα-VWF interaction in vivo. Using single molecule method, the chemical catalytic reaction between enzyme and substrate has been targeted. These results help us understand this important enzyme-substrate interaction involved in the hemostasis. Ph. D.
