Cyclic growth exploiting the faster growth and etch rates of the rotational variants, yields films that are 99 % composed of aligned domains. Precovering the substrate with a high density of graphene nuclei prior to CVD yields pure films of aligned domains extending over millimeters.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an extended}} Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) approach for {{the calculation of}} image formation in low energy <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (LEEM) and <b>photo</b> <b>electron</b> emission <b>microscopy</b> (PEEM). This approach considers aberrations up to fifth order, appropriate for image formation in state-of-the-art aberration-corrected LEEM and PEEM. We derive Scherzer defocus values for both weak and strong phase objects, {{as well as for}} pure amplitude objects, in non-aberration-corrected and aberration-corrected LEEM. Using the extended CTF formalism, we calculate contrast and resolution of one-dimensional and two-dimensional pure phase, pure amplitude, and mixed phase and amplitude objects. PEEM imaging is treated by adapting this approach to the case of incoherent imaging. Based on these calculations, we show that the ultimate resolution in aberration-corrected LEEM is about 0. 5 nm, and in aberration-corrected PEEM about 3. 5 nm. The aperture sizes required to achieve these ultimate resolutions are precisely determined with the CTF method. The formalism discussed here is also relevant to imaging with high resolution transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Both types of samples showed formation of &# 956;m-sized grains of graphene. The sharp (1 &# 215; 1) &# 956;-LEED pattern and six Dirac cones observed in constant energy photoelectron angular distribution patterns from a grain showed that adjacent layers are not rotated relative to each other, but that adjacent grains in general have different azimuthal orientations. Diffraction spots from the SiC substrate appeared in &# 956;-LEED patterns collected at higher energies, showing that the rotation angle between graphene and SiC varied. C 1 s spectra collected did not show any hint of a carbon interface layer.

40|$|Upon cooling, {{branched}} line defects {{develop in}} epitaxial graphene grown at high temperature on Pt(111) and Ir(111). Using atomically resolved {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} we demonstrate that these defects are wrinkles in the graphene layer, i. e. stripes of partially delaminated graphene. With low energy <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (LEEM) we investigate the wrinkling phenomenon in situ. Upon temperature cycling we observe hysteresis in the appearance and disappearance of the wrinkles. Simultaneously with wrinkle formation a change in bright field imaging intensity of adjacent areas and {{a shift in the}} moire spot positions for micro diffraction of such areas takes place. The stress relieved by wrinkle formation results from the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of graphene and the substrate. A simple one-dimensional model taking into account the energies related to strain, delamination and bending of graphene is in qualitative agreement with our observations.

In particular, we acquired images before, during, and after growth while changing the polarization in a stepwise manner. For the stationary states of the clean and the α- 6 T covered surfaces, we monitored the local electron yield {{and the intensity of}} the ultraviolet C-light (100 – 280 nm) reflected from the whole sample using PEEM and a photodiode, respectively. Due to the high ionization potential (IP> 5 eV), there is no direct photoelectron emission from the organic crystallites. However, the photoelectron emission of the metal/organic interface is influenced by anisotropic absorption of the incident light beam, since the adsorbed molecules act as dichroic filters with distinct orientations...|$|R

40|$|Biomineral {{production}} in marine organisms employs transient phases of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) {{in the construction}} of crystalline shells. Increasing seawater pCO 2 leads to ocean acidification (OA) with a reduction in oceanic carbonate concentration which could {{have a negative impact on}} shell formation and therefore survival. We demonstrate significant changes in the hydrated and dehydrated forms of ACC in the aragonite and calcite layers of Mytilus edulis shells cultured under acidification conditions (1000 [*]μatm pCO 2) compared to present day conditions (380 [*]μatm pCO 2). In OA conditions, Mytilus edulis has more ACC at crystalisation sites. Here, we use the high-spatial resolution of synchrotron X-ray <b>Photo</b> Emission <b>Electron</b> <b>Microscopy</b> (XPEEM) combined with X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the influence of OA on the ACC formation in the shells of adult Mytilus edulis. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) confirms that OA reduces crystallographic control of shell formation. The results demonstrate that OA induces more ACC formation and less crystallographic control in mussels suggesting that ACC is used as a repair mechanism to combat shell damage under OA. However, the resultant reduced crystallographic control in mussels raises concerns for shell protective function under predation and changing environments...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{interest}} in non-volatile memory and logic devices has encouraged {{the scientific community}} to develop improved magnetic control mechanisms. In the present work, control of magnets by magnetoelastic anisotropy is investigated {{within the context of}} magnetoelectric (ME) heterostructures of different geometry and scale. The ME heterostructure is an artificial multiferroic material which exhibits both a coexistence and coupling of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering. This device architecture provides a route to control magnetism with electric fields via interfacial mechanical stress. In the present work, the initial magnetization morphology and behavior under mechanical stress is investigated for bulk laminate composites, thin film heterostructures, patterned single domain nanostructures, and ring shaped nanostructures. Significant differences were observed in the magnets' response to magnetoelastic anisotropy depending on the scale and or geometry of the magnetic material. Generally speaking, as the scale and aspect ratio of a magnetic system is reduced, the intrinsic magnetostatic and shape anisotropy energies are also reduced thus increasing the relative magnitude (and influence) of magnetoelastic anisotropy. The unambiguous control of a magnet's easy axis is here called deterministic control and this is achieved experimentally in single domain and ring shaped magnets. The magnetization of these nanostructures is shown to rotate 90 ° with an applied electric field, an important proof of concept for the proposed strain-based magnetic writing devices. The experimental results are confirmed by multiple characterization techniques including magnetic force microscopy (MFM), magneto optic Kerr effect (MOKE), <b>photo</b> emission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (PEEM), and Lorentz transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (TEM).

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of laser}} induced, liquid mediated crystallization of amorphous Ge thin films were studied using multi frame dynamic transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> DTEM, a nanosecond scale <b>photo</b> emission transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> technique. In these experiments, high temperature gradients are established in thin amorphous Ge films with a 12 ns laser pulse with a Gaussian spatial profile. The hottest region {{at the center}} of the laser spot crystallizes in rv 100 ns and becomes nano crystalline. Over the next several hundred nanoseconds crystallization continues radially outward from the nano crystalline region forming elongated grains, some many microns long. The growth rate during the formation of these radial grains is measured with time resolved imaging experiments. Crystal growth rates exceed 10 m s, which are consistent with crystallization mediated by a very thin, undercooled transient liquid layer, rather than a purely solid state transformation mechanism. The kinetics of this growth mode have been studied in detail under steady state conditions, but here we provide a detailed study of liquid mediated growth in high temperature gradients. Unexpectedly, the propagation rate of the crystallization front was observed to remain constant during this growth mode even when passing through large local temperature gradients, in stark contrast to other similar studies that suggested the growth rate changed dramatically. The high throughput of multi frame DTEM provides gives a more complete picture of the role of temperature and temperature gradient on laser crystallization than previous DTEM experiments.
