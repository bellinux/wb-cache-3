Little is known about spatial correlation between the <b>pseudointima</b> elongation and the local distribution of shear stress gradients. We aimed to determine significant shear stress gradients and their spatial relation to the <b>pseudointima.</b> Methods: Firstly, 9 native femoro-popliteal ePTFE grafts (diameter 4 mm) were implanted into 7 pigs. After a follow-up period of 6 weeks, the prostheses were excorporated and histologically processed. Secondly, in order to assemble data about the fluid mechanics inside this anastomosis, we used the technique of particle image velocimetry. Finally, results of both studies were spatially 2 -dimensionally correlated to compare <b>pseudointima</b> extension and shear stress gradients during the systole. Results: We observed a separation zone at all upstream convexities caused by eddying of the mainstream. Furthermore we perceived <b>pseudointima</b> extension exactly within these zones. The highest vorticity was measured in the transition zone between mainstream and separation zone. In addition, the shear stress appeared to be significantly higher in the transition zone in comparison to surrounding areas. Conclusions: The <b>pseudointima</b> extension does not exceed the transition zone. Conversely, we expect the <b>pseudointima</b> to be effectively reduced by a new prosthetic design that averts separation zones...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the experimental efficacy of PEG-hirudin/iloprost coated small caliber PTFE grafts. MethodsThirty-six femoro-popliteal ePTFE grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, diameter 4 mm) were inserted into 18 pigs. Grafts were randomised individually for each leg and grouped for 3 groups. Group I consisted of native ePTFE grafts, group II were grafts coated with a polylactide polymer (PLA) without drugs and group III grafts were coated with PLA containing a polyethylene glycol (PEG) -hirudin/iloprost combination. The follow-up period was 6 weeks. Patency rates were calculated and development of <b>pseudointima</b> inside the grafts was noted. Thickness of intimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomoses was measured using light microscopy. ResultsPatency rates for group I were 6 / 9 (67 %), for group II 9 / 10 (90 %) and 12 / 12 (100 %) for group III. In groups I and II there was a significant reduction of blood flow proximal to the graft at graft harvest, to 29 ± 12 and 28 ± 20 ml/min respectively (both p< 0. 01 versus preoperative value), whilst in group III blood flow, 99 ± 21 ml/min, remained at the preoperative level. Subtotal stenosis due to development of <b>pseudointima</b> was noted in each of the native and PLA coated grafts but not in group III grafts. Intimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomosis was lowest in group III. ConclusionsThe PEG-hirudin/iloprost coating of ePTFE prostheses effectively reduced <b>pseudointima</b> and intimal hyperplasia development and led to superior graft patency...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe {{long-term}} prognosis of arteriovenous (AV) polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hemodialysis grafts is dissatisfying. Responsible for {{the poor}} outcome is a stenosis of the venous anastomosis. This originates from both pseudointimal (PI) and neointimal hyperplasia (IH) development. Although cuffed grafts have a better short-term prognosis than straight grafts, the late results of both types are poor. This current study aimed to compare both arteriovenous straight and Venaflo-type (Bard, Tempe, Ariz) prostheses in an animal study with regard to patency, PI, and IH development. MethodsSixteen iliac arteriovenous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) loops were inserted into 16 pigs. Animals were randomized into two groups. Group 1 animals received straight configured ePTFE grafts and group 2 animals received grafts with a Venaflo-type cuffed venous anastomosis. After insertion of the shunts and immediately before graft harvest, the shunt flows were measured. Six weeks after implantation, patency rates and development of <b>pseudointima</b> (PI) within the grafts were noted. The thickness of the venous intimal hyperplasia was measured using digital planimetry. ResultsPatency rates after 6 weeks were 25 % for straight and 62 % for Venaflo-type grafts. In both groups a significant decrease of the graft blood flow compared with the preoperative levels was observed, which was attributed to the marked development of <b>pseudointima.</b> The reduction in flow at graft harvest was greater in the straight ePTFE group (658 ± 68 vs 260 ± 42 mL/min, P <. 05) than for the Venaflo-type grafts (770 ± 107 vs 661 ± 284 mL/min, P = ns), but {{the differences between the}} groups were statistically not significant. A marked <b>pseudointima</b> developed in the Venaflo cuff. The PI development was significantly higher in the graft hood (2. 9 ± 0. 6 mm) than in the heel (2. 5 ± 0. 4 mm, P <. 05). In both groups, an intimal hyperplasia formed on the vein wall just opposite to the graft inflow. The intimal hyperplasia development was more pronounced in the straight configured shunts. ConclusionsThe {{results of the present study}} confirm the inferior clinical results of ePTFE grafts used for hemodialysis access. Although the patency rates of cuffed grafts were superior, in both graft types a significant <b>pseudointima</b> leading to subtotal graft stenosis was observed in all grafts. Both straight and Venaflo-grafts. The Venaflo grafts have a slightly bettertype cuffed ePTFE grafts have major hemodynamic drawbacks that have to be addressed in future graft design efforts. Clinical RelevanceArteriovenous grafts have a poor long-term prognosis. The problem in most cases is the development of a stenosis at the graft vein anastomosis. Currently, two different graft types are available, the straight and the Venaflo-type grafts. The Venaflo grafts have a slightly better outcome compared with the straight grafts. However, there are only clinical data available. The amount of <b>pseudointima</b> and intimal hyperplasia development is not exactly known. We therefore aimed to compare both graft types in a controlled animal setting. This is the first time that both graft types are evaluated using a randomized controlled animal study...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionThe {{long-term}} prognosis of arteriovenous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hemodialysis grafts remains poor, causing significant {{morbidity and}} costs. The high failure rate {{is due to}} a stenosis development of the graft-vein anastomosis, consisting of two pathophysiologically separate and characteristic lesions emerging from two main mechanisms: development of intimal hyperplasia in the vein and <b>pseudointima</b> in the graft. We developed a new venous anastomotic graft design that combines a flow diffuser and flow division, thereby creating a double-channel graft (Bi-Flow graft) and tested it in vitro. MethodsIn vitro experiments have been performed using silastic models of six different anastomotic configurations (straight end-to-side, cuffed Venaflo-type, large and small diffuser, and large and small Bi-Flow) inserted into a pulsatile-flow circuit. The silastic models were created using a computerized numerical control design approach, varying only the venous anastomoses. Velocity fields and shear stresses were obtained using particle image velocimetry, and volumetric flow rates through the models were measured using an ultrasound flowmeter. ResultsThe hooded graft configurations showed significantly lower shear forces than did the end-to-side anastomosis. The shear stresses in the straight end-to-side graft were as high as arterial wall stresses. Large separation areas were present in the hooded grafts, except for the small Bi-Flow graft, which showed only isolated separation zones near the baffle used to divide the flow. The double-channel grafts exhibited a parabolic flow profile consisting of laminar flow in the double-outflow portion of the model's laminar flow pattern through the venous anastomosis. A marked flow separation was present in the large Bi-Flow model. Volumetric flow measurements revealed an average flow increase of 21 % through the small Bi-Flow graft, which was attributed to the optimization of flow dynamics and pattern within the venous anastomosis of the double-channel graft. ConclusionThe new arteriovenous Bi-Flow graft design addresses two major problems responsible for the development of venous stenosis of prosthetic hemodialysis grafts in vitro. The new graft design should be further investigated in animal studies. Clinical RelevanceArteriovenous polytetrafluoroethylene grafts have a poor long-term prognosis, and most are occluded after only 2 years. The most important cause is the development of a venous anastomotic stenosis. The stenosis consists of venous intimal hyperplasia and graft <b>pseudointima</b> that narrows the lumen. The intimal hyperplasia results predominantly from high wall shear stresses, and the <b>pseudointima</b> develops within flow separation areas near the polytetrafluoroethylene wall. We developed a new arteriovenous graft design, which combines a flow diffuser to decrease flow velocity and resulting shear stress with a baffle that divides the outflow tract, thus forming two separate channels. The new graft was investigated using particle image velocimetry and volumetric flow measurements...|$|E

40|$|The biotolerant and haemodynamic {{effects of}} {{three types of}} woven {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (Dacron) arterial prostheses were compared. Two of these were unmodified, one low, one high porosity; and the third was the latter type radiation graft copolymerized with 5 % acrylic acid. The prostheses were implanted as aorto-aortic bypass grafts, in dogs, for periods ranging from three to seventeen months. The copolymerized prosthesis exhibited the smallest rise in circumferential elastance from the 'as supplied' state, {{as well as a}} significantly slower pulse wave velocity, a significantly thinner internal lining, and a markedly lower longitudinal impedance. Of the unmodified prostheses, the low porosity graft had a significantly greater circumferential elastance, the poorest handling characteristics, and a tendency for pseudo intimal detachment. It was concluded that, although there was little difference between the two unmodified prostheses, the low porosity one had little to recommend it for use in small calibre bypass grafting. Copolymerization with acrylic acid produced better haemotolerant and haemodynamic results as well as surface properties which appeared to discourage fibrin and platelet adherence, and promote a more complete and organised <b>pseudointima...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: Recently, heparin coated {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) shunts {{are available}} and are believed to improve inherent shunt problems such as thrombosis and excessive and incomplete neointima formation or occlusion. We aimed at comparing the potential histopathological differences in the neointima (in) between uncoated (UCS) PTFE shunts and heparin coated (HCS) PTFE shunts. Materials and Methods: Thirteen shunts (six UCS and seven HCS) were analyzed. The specimens were fixed in formalin, embedded inparaffinor inmethylmethacrylate, andcharacterizedby standardand immunohistochemical staining. The thickness of <b>pseudointima</b> proliferationwas graded as follows: 0 nocell layers, 1 few layers 100 mm, 3 complete layers 300 mm, and 5 occlusion.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: We {{assessed}} the fibrinolytic {{activity of the}} organized mural thrombus lining of aneurysms and prosthetic grafts. Methods: Between May 1995 and April 1998, the full-thickness mural thrombi of aneurysms and the <b>pseudointima</b> lining of vascular grafts were obtained from 12 patients, ranging from 55 to 78 years in age, who underwent elective surgery. These included five aortic arch aneurysms, four abdominal aortic aneurysms, and three patent synthetic vascular grafts. The specimens were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) /immunoblot and immunohistochemistry for human plasmin/plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and fibrin degradation product (D-dimer). Results: In the SDS-PAGE/immunoblot, 25 - and 27 -kd bands appeared specifically in experimental fibrin plates after limited digestion by plasmin and were also recognized in the mural thrombi. The presence of bands at 25 and 27 kd, which were most prominent in sections near the flow surface layer, {{was consistent with the}} hypothesis that the mural fibrin was digested by the endogenous plasmin. Apparent immunoreactivity was found at the flow surface of the masses at a thickness of 10 to 400 μm, suggesting the presence of a plasminogen and tPA-rich layer, with D-dimer as a consequential product of fibrinolysis. Conclusion: The hypothesis that fibrin surfaces in the arterial system acquire fibrinolytic activity because of digestion by circulating endogenous plasmin was confirmed; this may contribute to the antithrombogenicity of these flow surfaces.

40|$|AbstractOur {{goal was}} to {{identify}} the most appropriate material for right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduits in growing animals. We used 100 lambs that were 3 to 4 weeks old (mean weight 11. 7 kg). Follow-up was up to 24 months. Group I received plain tubular conduits: (1) Dacron knitted fabric, (2) collagen-coated knitted fabric, (3) Milliknit and Microknit material, (4) woven Dacron fabric, (5) three-dimensional Dacron fabric (crossweave 500 and 800), or (6) polytetrafluoroethylene. Group II received either a (1) woven Dacron fabric conduit with a built-in tissue valve or (2) polytetrafluoroethylene graft with a built-in St. Jude Medical valve. We did angiograms and catheterizations every 3 to 6 months and killed the lambs at 6, 12, 18, or 24 months. Tubular Dacron fabric woven or knitted grafts, regardless of matrix, pore size, thickness, or coating, caused formation of a thick acellular <b>pseudointima</b> buildup, which led to progressive obstruction starting as early as 3 months. Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in groups I and II showed the formation of thin inner and outer capsules (0. 5 mm) and none developed obstruction despite wall calcification. Conduits of woven Dacron fabric with a built-in tissue valve degenerated rapidly, leading to calcification thrombosis and obstruction within 3 months; no lamb survived 12 months. Polytetrafluoroethylene conduits with a St. Jude Medical valve in lambs receiving anticoagulants remained free of obstruction and continued to function well. It appears that synthetic conduits of polytetrafluoroethylene perform well in either of the situations here tested and {{may be the best}} choice at present.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} theeffects of increased shear stress on the aggregability of platelets as they traverse a long, small-caliber (6 mm) Dacron graft in the dog and on the surface thrombosis and endothelialization of such a graft. Methods: Each of nine dogs received bilateral carotid-femoral artery grafts, approximately 75 cm long, for 3 months; one graft of each pair had a distal femoral arteriovenous fistula to produce a higher shear rate than the contralateral graft. Platelet aggregation scores were determined on blood withdrawn from the external jugular vein and from the proximal and distal ends of the grafts in each animal. Graft flow rates, which were used in the computation of shear stress, and luminal pressure gradients through grafts were measured during surgery and specimen retrieval. Specimens were studied with light microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin and immunocytochemical staining and by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate the nature, composition, and thickness of the flow surface lining, as well as the transmural healing. Results: Two high-shear stress and two low-shear stress grafts occluded unilaterally; five dogs had bilaterally patent grafts, allowing comparative analyses. All subjects had low platelet aggregability with aspirin. Platelet aggregation scores taken from proximal and distal ends of the grafts were not significantly different. The high-shear stress grafts had significantly more endothelial-like cell coverage (p < 0. 0371) than the low-shear stress grafts, less flow-surface thrombus (p < 0. 0056), and a thinner surface lining (p < 0. 0029), on both the neointima and <b>pseudointima.</b> Conclusions: In subjects with low platelet aggregation scores, long Dacron grafts do not elevate platelet aggregability of blood flowing through them. High-shear stress grafts have less flow surface thrombus, more endothelialization, and a thinner surface lining than do low-shear stress grafts. (J V ASC S URG 1995; 22 : 382 - 92. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{prospective}} study was undertaken in 17 patients treated with 22 transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures and aimed {{to evaluate the}} nature and causes of short- and long-term shunt abnormalities. Specimens were collected after autopsy in 6 patients and after liver transplantation in 11 patients; the time from shunting ranging from 4 to 385 days. During the first 2 weeks the shunt surface was covered by poorly organized fibrin platelet clots that were mixed with inflammatory and red blood cells. Thereafter, a <b>pseudointima</b> developed, initially made of loose granulation tissue that was formed by edema, myofibroblasts, neo-capillaries, collagen fibers, and inflammatory cells. This pseudo-intima extended with time as the myofibroblasts increased in number, as the collagen fibers thickened, and as the inflammatory cells grew more scarce. Its thickness ranged from 50 to 3, 500 microm, the maximal values being observed {{in the middle of}} the shunt. The shunt was obstructed by a clot in 4 patients (18 %). In 7 shunts (31. 8 %) the pseudo-intima was thicker than 1, 000 microm and was referred to as hyperplastic pseudo-intima. It showed more dense inflammatory infiltrate and anarchic deposition of more scarce collagen fibers. Pseudo-intima hyperplasia was associated with previously diagnosed thrombosis, which had been treated by dilatation in 2 cases and by biliary deposits in 3 cases, while it remained unexplained in 2 cases. Accordingly, this study confirms the following: 1) that early TIPS obstruction results from thrombosis; 2) that 2 weeks after insertion, the stent is covered by a smooth pseudo-intima; 3) that thereafter, pseudo-intimal hyperplasia is the main cause of TIPS stenosis or occlusion; and 4) that biliary secretions and previous thrombosis could be important triggering mechanisms for this pseudo-intima overgrowth.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Research {{with animal}} models has {{demonstrated}} tissue healing of endovascular grafts in both native arte-rial segments and in experimentally created arterial aneurysms. Fundamental {{to the successful}} clinical use of endovascular grafts {{for the treatment of}} aneurysmal disease is the creation of a permanent hemostatic seal between the graft ends and the arterial wall. Characteristics of this healing process in patients with aneurysmal disease have not been fully studied. In this study, we analyzed the macroscopic and histopathologic changes of the arterial wall after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. Methods: Over a 7 -year period, 313 patients were treated with endovascular grafts to exclude arterial aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Of these patients, 11 had their endovascular grafts recovered for analysis. Five graft specimens were recovered during subsequent open aortic surgery. Six grafts were recovered at autopsy after the death of the patient of causes unrelated to the patient's endovascular graft. All specimens were fixed in formalin. Histologic analysis included light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome stains. Well-preserved specimens were selected after light microscopic examination and postfixed in 3 % buffered glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy. The aortas from autopsy specimens were removed en bloc and fixed in formalin; representative regions of each graft were sectioned for analysis. Adherence of the graft to the vessel wall was categorized as densely adherent or easily separated after graft explantation. Traction applied to the graft-aortic anastomosis was equal to traction generated by suspending a standardized 2 -kg weight. Infrarenal graft specimens were obtained with supraceliac aortic clamping, longitudinal aortotomy, and graft sampling before endograft revision. Results: In eight patients, endograft fixation was found to be firmly adherent to the arterial wall. A translucent film of fibrinous material was consistently seen across the entire luminal surface of the endograft. Light and electron microscopy failed to demonstrate an endothelial layer or organized <b>pseudointima</b> at the graft-artery interface. Conclusion: Despite suggestive experimental data regarding endograft healing in animals, minimal graft incorporation was apparent in the stent grafts recovered in this study. A greater emphasis on the construction and mechanism of fixation of endograft attachment systems will be important for long-term device function. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 733 - 8. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{modification}} of the distal anastomosis of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bypass grafts with vein interposition cuffs (VCs) {{has been reported to}} increase graft patency. However, the mechanisms that are responsible for this improved patency are unclear. Because intimal hyperplasia (IH) is a primary cause of prosthetic graft failure, we hypothesized that VCs affect the distal anastomosis by decreasing the IH response of the outflow artery. Methods: Twenty-three female domestic Yorkshire pigs (mean weight, 35 kg) underwent 42 femoral PTFE bypass grafting procedures. The PTFE bypass grafts were separated into the following three groups according to distal anastomotic configuration: end-to-side anastomoses (ES), VCs, and cuffs constructed with PTFE (PCs). Four femoral arteries from two pigs served as healthy controls. At sacrifice, the grafts were perfusion fixed, and the distal anastomoses harvested at 1 and 4 weeks. The specimens were hemisected and serially sectioned to identify the heel, toe, and mid-anastomotic regions. The sections were cut into 5 -μm segments and analyzed for intima and media thickness and area, intima/media area ratio, and the distribution of IH in the vein cuff. The roles of transforming growth factor–β 1 and platelet-derived growth factor–BB in IH development were assessed with immunohistochemistry. Results: IH development was significantly lower at all areas of the anastomosis, with VCs compared with ES and PCs at 4 weeks (P ≤. 001). IH decreased in VCs from 1 to 4 weeks in all areas of the anastomosis (P ≤. 001). PCs showed pronounced IH at the mid-anastomosis as compared with VCs and ES (P ≤. 001). IH was most pronounced at the toe with ES and PCs (P ≤. 001). Qualitatively, VCs altered the site of IH development, sparing the recipient artery with preferential thickening of the vein cuff and formation of a <b>pseudointima</b> at the vein-PTFE interface. Immunohistochemistry results showed positive staining for transforming growth factor–β 1, platelet-derived growth factor–BB, and smooth muscle α-actin in the hyperplastic intima. Conclusion: PTFE bypass grafts with VCs had less IH develop than did grafts with ES and PC anastomoses. IH regression in VCs at 4 weeks suggests compensatory vessel wall remodeling mediated by the presence of the VC. Furthermore, VCs caused a redistribution of hyperplasia to the vein-PTFE interface, delaying IH-induced outflow obstruction in the recipient artery. The marked increase in IH with PCs, despite a similar geometric configuration to VCs, suggests that the biologic properties of autogenous tissue dissipate IH development. Similarly, the flow patterns in PCs and VCs should be identical, which suggests a less important role of hemodynamic forces in VC-mediated protection. (J Vasc Surg 2000; 31 : 69 - 83. ...|$|E
