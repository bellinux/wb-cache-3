5000|$|In 2002, Chaison and {{co-author}} Barbara Bigelow examined the role legitimacy {{plays in the}} life of a union. The question of legitimacy flowed from Chaison's <b>prior</b> <b>examination</b> of union mergers. Did mergers negatively affect a labor organization's legitimacy in the eyes of its members, or in the eyes of the public? And if merger did so, what was the impact on the union's effectiveness in the various fields (such as organizing, servicing and collective bargaining) in which the union was active? In Unions and Legitimacy, Chaison and Bigelow argued that the concept of legitimacy provided a framework for understanding the sources of union strengths and weaknesses, and why some union survival strategies have failed. Chaison and Bigelow concluded that there were three ways in which legitimacy could be obtained: legal recognition, employer recognition, and public approval. Chaison and Bigelow, however, distinguished these three types further by arguing that there are two kinds of legitimacy: Pragmatic legitimacy, which is essentially an assessment of a union's effectiveness, and moral legitimacy, which conferred when people or organization outside the union treats the union as a socially valuable actor. Reviewers called the work [...] "...a fresh and lucid discussion of legitimacy as it applies to labor unions and their role in society." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Patients {{awareness}} before {{endoscopic examination}} This baccalaureate thesis deals with informedness of patients <b>prior</b> endoscopic <b>examinations.</b> The theoretic part {{deals with the}} issues of informing and preparing endoscopic examinations. Generally, informedness is a broad issue that can be discussed in professional circles {{as well as by}} the laic public. As the patient is considered an active element of the treatment process nowadays, informedness has gained an important role. This work tried to explain endoscopic methods, to map preparation for individual endoscopic examinations, and to stress the importance of information and communication skills when providing such information. Two objectives were set down. The first one was to find out the details about informedness of patients <b>prior</b> endoscopic <b>examinations.</b> The other one was to find out what method is used to inform patients <b>prior</b> endoscopic <b>examinations.</b> Two hypotheses were set down in the practical part. The first hypothesis is based on the presumption of sufficient patient informedness and it was defined as follows: Patients are informed sufficiently <b>prior</b> endoscopic <b>examinations.</b> The other hypothesis was based on a presumption defined as follows: The most frequently used method of informing patients <b>prior</b> endoscopic <b>examinations</b> is oral explanation. To find out about the current situation, the quantitative method using an anonymous questionnaire was employed. Only one kind of questionnaire containing 25 questions was used. The questions were closed, semi-closed and one open. Introductory questions were informative ones, the others focused on informedness <b>prior</b> an endoscopic <b>examination</b> and on the methods of providing information. A hundred questions were distributed at preselected wards at Nemocnice Tábor, a. s. (Hospital Tábor). The research group consisted of patients at the surgical, internal and gynaecological departments. The results were processed into graphs showing the percentage of the distribution of the respondents answers. The discussion was assessed and compared with professional literature. At the end of this thesis, the project summation results are presented as well as confirmed or unconfirmed hypotheses and possible proposals that may lead executive workers to consider what ways could be taken in the future to better patient informedness <b>prior</b> endoscopic <b>examinations...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} an automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system to detect breast cancers that were overlooked or misinterpreted in a breast MRI screening program for women at increased risk. METHODS: We identified 40 patients that were {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} in MRI and had a <b>prior</b> MRI <b>examination</b> reported as negative available. In these <b>prior</b> <b>examinations,</b> 24 lesions could retrospectively be identified by two breast radiologists in consensus: 11 were scored as visible and 13 as minimally visible. Additionally, 120 normal scans were collected from 120 women without history of breast cancer or breast surgery participating in the same MRI screening program. A fully automated CAD system was applied to this dataset to detect malignant lesions. RESULTS: At 4 false-positives per normal case, the sensitivity for the detection of cancer lesions that were visible or minimally visible in retrospect in prior-negative examinations was 0. 71 (95 % CI= 0. 38 - 1. 00) and 0. 31 (0. 07 - 0. 59), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of cancers that were misinterpreted or overlooked in an MRI screening program was detected by a CAD system in prior-negative examinations.
