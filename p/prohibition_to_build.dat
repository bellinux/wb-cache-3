40|$|Long-term load {{forecasting}} aims at {{predicting the}} evolution of the electric consumption in a certain area in order to resize the grid in accordance. There are two components to study: the increment in existing consumption and the appearance of new clients. We focus here on the latter. With this purpose, we present an ongoing work that applies agent-based modelling to this end. Representing each existing electric customer by an agent, candidate agents will decide their settlement based on their inquiries to present agents on their likes and actual urban constraints obtained from real sources (e. g. <b>prohibition</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> upon a lot marked as a park). We will test this system with a Monte-Carlo simulation and compare the obtained results with real data to validate our approach...|$|E
40|$|The cement {{industry}} {{is the second}} most-intensive sector in Taiwan, which underlines the need to understand its potential for energy efficiency improvement. A bottom-up model-based assessment is utilized to conduct a scenario analysis of energy saving opportunities up to the year 2035. The analysis is supported by detailed expert interviews in all plants of Taiwan. The simulation results reveal that by 2035, eighteen energy efficient technologies could result in 25 % savings for electricity and 9 % savings for fuels under the technical diffusion scenario. This potential totally amounts to about 5000 FJ/year, of which 91 % can be implemented cost-effectively assuming a discount rate of 10 %. Policy makers should support a fast diffusion of these technologies. Additionally, policy makers can tap further saving potentials. First, by decreasing the clinker chare, which is currently regulated to a minimum of 95 %. Second, by extending the <b>prohibition</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> new cement plants by allowing for replacement of existing capacity with new innovative plants in the coming years. Third, by supporting the use of alternative fuels, which is currently still a niche in Taiwan...|$|E

This study was conducted in Maros. This type of research is survey method with mixed methods approach which is a combination of qualitative methods and quantitative methods. Sampling was done by using simple random sampling of the population who are users of building permits during the year 2013 - 2014, while informants selected intentionally by certain considerations.

5000|$|At a {{discussion}} at Bellevue University on April 2, 2010, Lance Morgan, CEO of Ho-Chunk, Inc.—the development corporation of the Winnebago Reservation—said the Oglala Sioux needed {{to concentrate on}} economic development. He believes that poverty {{is at the heart}} of its people's problems. The Winnebago used revenues from a casino and alcohol sales at their reservation in eastern Nebraska <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an economic development corporation. It now employs 1,400 people in 26 subsidiaries. With its revenues, the Winnebago have been able <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a hospital, a new school and $1 million in new housing. Kevin Abourezk reported that Stew Magnuson—the author of The Death of Raymond Yellow Thunder, a study of issues related to the Pine Ridge reservation and its border towns—described alcohol prohibition at the reservation [...] "as a complete failure."

40|$|Research has {{revealed}} inconsistent associations between parents' prohibition of peer relationships and adolescents' deviant peer affiliation. This cross-sectional study examined parents' styles of <b>prohibition</b> <b>to</b> test {{the hypothesis that}} an autonomy-supportive style would relate negatively, whereas a controlling style would relate positively, to deviant peer affiliation. Such relations were expected because of the differential relations of styles of <b>prohibition</b> <b>to</b> adolescents' internalization of parental rules for friendships. Structural equation modeling provided support for the hypotheses {{in a sample of}} 234 Belgian midadolescents (M-age = 16. 45 years; 65 % female), as the differential relations of autonomy-supportive and controlling styles of <b>prohibition</b> <b>to</b> deviant peer affiliation were mediated by their differential relations to internalization. Implications for research on parental peer management are discussed...|$|R
