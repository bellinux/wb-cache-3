The programme was assisted by the partial recovery of a V-1 by Soviet forces at the Blizna test range in Poland. The initial V-1 copy was called 10Kh and later Izdeliye 10 ("Article 10").

40|$|A {{matrix of}} {{simulations}} of hypersonic flow over blunt entry vehicles with steady and <b>pulsing</b> retropropulsion <b>jets</b> is presented. Retropropulsion in the supersonic domain is primarily {{designed to reduce}} vehicle velocity directly with thrust. Retropropulsion in the hypersonic domain may enable significant pressure recovery through unsteady, oblique shocks while providing a buffer of reactant gases with relatively low total temperature. Improved pressure recovery, a function of Mach number squared and oblique shock angle, could potentially serve to increase aerodynamic drag in this domain. <b>Pulsing</b> <b>jets</b> are studied to include an additional degree of freedom to search for resonances in an already unsteady flow domain with an objective to maximize the time-averaged drag coefficient. In this paradigm, small jets with minimal footprints of the nozzle exit on the vehicle forebody may be capable of delivering the requisite perturbations to the flow. Simulations are executed assuming inviscid, symmetric flow of a perfect gas to enable a rapid assessment of the parameter space (nozzle geometry, plenum conditions, <b>jet</b> <b>pulse</b> frequency). The pulsed-jet configuration produces moderately larger drag than the constant jet configuration but smaller drag than the jet-off case in this preliminary examination of a single design point. The fundamentals of a new algorithm for this challenging application with time dependent, interacting discontinuities using the feature detection capabilities of Walsh functions are introduced...|$|R

50|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>jets</b> are {{mechanically}} simple devices that—in a repeating cycle—draw {{air through}} a no-return valve {{at the front}} of the engine into a combustion chamber and ignited it. The combustion forces the exhaust gases out the back of the engine. It produces power as a series of pulses rather than as a steady output, hence the name. The only application of this type of engine was the German unmanned V1 flying bomb of World War II. Though the same engines were also used experimentally for ersatz fighter aircraft, the extremely loud noise generated by the engines caused mechanical damage to the airframe that was sufficient to make the idea unworkable.|$|R
