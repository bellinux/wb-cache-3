5|$|An irregularly shaped parade area {{occupies}} {{the middle of}} the fort, which is divided by a sloping ramp leading up to the casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands {{to the right of the}} ramp. The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, about 100,000 pilgrims {{paid tribute}} to St. Barbara at St. Michael's Monastery. Before the Russian Revolution in 1917, rings {{manufactured}} and blessed at St. Michael's Monastery, known as St. Barbara's rings, were very popular among the citizens of Kiev. They usually served as good luck charms and, according to popular beliefs, occasionally <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> witchcraft but were also effective against serious illnesses and sudden death. These beliefs reference the facts that the Monastery was not affected by the plague epidemics in 1710 and 1770 and cholera epidemics of the nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|An Electronic Warfare Self Protection (EWSP) is a {{suite of}} {{countermeasure}} systems fitted primarily to aircraft {{for the purpose of}} protecting the aircraft from weapons fire and can include among others: DIRCM (<b>protects</b> <b>against</b> IR missiles), Infrared countermeasures (<b>protects</b> <b>against</b> IR missiles), Chaff (<b>protects</b> <b>against</b> RADAR guided missiles), DRFM Decoys (<b>Protects</b> <b>against</b> Radar guided missiles), Flare (<b>protects</b> <b>against</b> IR missiles).|$|R

50|$|A paint mask is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or rubber straps to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> paint mists or vapors. A paint mask is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a dust mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as some masks may <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dust particles, but not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> chemical vapors.|$|R
5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court {{laid the}} groundwork for the {{incorporation}} of many of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> infringement by the states.|$|E
5|$|In {{towns and}} central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion {{made possible by}} sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> the harsh climate. But {{the main reason for}} the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.|$|E
5|$|The Free Press Clause protects {{publication}} of information and opinions, and applies {{to a wide variety}} of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and New York Times v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> prior restraint—pre-publication censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.|$|E
50|$|Some barrier {{contraceptives}} <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> STIs. Hormonal contraceptives {{reduce the}} risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious complication of certain STIs. IUDs, by contrast, do not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> STIs or PID.|$|R

50|$|A {{dust mask}} is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or rubber straps to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, brick, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass production), or sweeping. A dust mask can also be worn to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> allergens. A dust mask is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a paint mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many dust masks with widely varied levels of protection may look similar, and even masks that do not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dust at all, such as paint masks and surgical masks. Misfitting masks are also a danger as they allow material to bypass the mask entirely. A correct fit may not be as critical in masks that are intended to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> splattering liquids or mists. Dust masks are manufactured to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> only certain dangers, and do not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> chemicals such as vapors and mists. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse dust masks with paint masks.|$|R
5|$|The {{first such}} battlecruisers were the Dutch Design 1047, {{designed}} to protect their colonies in the East Indies {{in the face of}} Japanese aggression. Never officially assigned names, these ships were designed with German and Italian assistance. While they broadly resembled the German Scharnhorst class and had the same main battery, they would have been more lightly armoured and only <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> eight-inch gunfire. Although the design was mostly completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940. The first ship would have been laid down in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|The slave's freedom {{could be}} either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> all {{attempts}} at re-enslavement—for instance, {{on the part}} of the former master's inheritors. In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the paramone, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.|$|E
5|$|These species {{live in a}} {{wide variety}} of habitats, ranging from dry {{deciduous}} forests to rainforests, and run quadrupedally across branches. Their diet consists primarily of tree gum and other exudates, though they may obtain some of their protein and nitrogen by hunting small arthropods later at night. Three of the four species are endangered and the other is listed as vulnerable. Their populations are in decline due to habitat destruction. Like all lemurs, they are <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> commercial trade under CITES Appendix I.|$|E
5000|$|Warships {{traditionally}} have vertical, or near vertical, belt armour which <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> missiles (shells) travelling horizontally, and horizontal deck armour, which <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> plunging (downward) shell fire. Belt armour is generally thicker than deck armour.|$|R
50|$|CRCs are {{specifically}} designed to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> common types of errors on communication channels, where they can provide quick and reasonable assurance of the integrity of messages delivered.

5|$|At Strangways' house, Bond sees a {{photograph}} of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named Quarrel, whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, Felix Leiter, a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica, but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> trespassers by an armed security force.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{is a city}} {{of books}} and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language {{publishing}} houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores; There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.|$|E
40|$|The {{high-density}} lipoprotein-associated enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) hydrolyzes lactones, aromatic esters, and neurotoxic organophosphorus (OP) compounds, including insecticide metabolites {{and nerve}} agents. Experiments with mice lacking PON 1 (PON 1 −/− mice) have established that plasma PON 1 <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-oxon and diazinon/diazoxon (DZO) exposure {{but does not}} <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> parathion/paraoxon or nerve agents. The catalytic efficiency of PON 1 determines {{whether or not it}} will <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> a given OP exposure. Expression of active recombinant human PON 1 (rHuPON 1) in Escherichia coli provides a system in which PON 1 can be engineered to achieve a catalytic efficiency sufficient to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> or treat specific OP exposures. Here, we describe the generation of highly purified engineered rHuPON 1 K 192 that <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> DZO exposure when injected into PON 1 −/− mice. The injected rHuPON 1 is nontoxic, persists in serum for at least 2 days after injection, and provides protection against DZO exposures of at least three times the median lethal dose value...|$|R

50|$|For this {{there are}} two {{different}} vaccines, the MMR and the MMRV. The MMR <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> measles, mumps and rubella and is given in 2 doses between 12 and 15 months of age. The MMRV <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> measles, mumps, rubella and varicella.|$|R
5|$|<b>Protected</b> <b>against</b> double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E
5|$|Recently, Israel has {{modified}} {{a number}} of its Merkava main battle tanks with ambulance features {{in order to allow}} rescue operations to take place under heavy fire in urban warfare. The modifications were made following a failed rescue attempt in which Palestinian gunmen killed two soldiers who were providing aid for a Palestinian woman in Rafah. Since M-113 armored personnel carriers and regular up-armored ambulances are not sufficiently <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> anti-tank weapons and improvised explosive devices, it was decided to use the heavily armored Merkava tank. Its rear door enables the evacuation of critically wounded soldiers. Israel did not remove the Merkava's weaponry, claiming that weapons were more effective protection than emblems since Palestinian militants would disregard any symbols of protection and fire at ambulances anyway. For use as ground ambulances and treatment & evacuation vehicles, the United States military currently employs the M113, the M577, the M1133 Stryker Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), and the RG-33 Heavily Armored Ground Ambulance (HAGA) as treatment and evacuation vehicles, with contracts to incorporate the newly designed M2A0 Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle (AMEV), a variant of the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (formerly known as the ATTV).|$|E

5|$|This {{shocked the}} French colonists, who feared that their capital city {{would be the}} next target. Quebec did not have {{extensive}} fortifications in 1690, and the whole landward side of the city to the north and west was exposed, particularly at the Plains of Abraham. Count Frontenac returned to Canada for a second term as Governor-General, and ordered the construction of a wooden palisade to enclose the city from the fort at the Château Saint-Louis to the Saint-Charles River. Town Major Provost oversaw the construction of eleven small stone redoubts in this enceinte, which would have <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> cannon. Facing the plains on the west side was the strong point of the landward defences — a windmill called Mont-Carmel where a three-gun battery was in place. The palisade line ended {{on the east side of}} the city, near the hospital. The batteries facing the river were also improved, with eight guns mounted beside the Château and six 18-pounders at the docksides. Temporary obstacles had also been put in place on the street leading up to the upper city.|$|E
