The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate, through pollen analysis, the types of pollen and nectar sources used by the uruçu bee (Melipona scutellaris L.) in the North Coast of Bahia. Honey samples were taken monthly from five colonies in an apiary from August 2010 to July 2011. <b>Pollen</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> was performed by using the acetolysis method, followed by qualitative and quantitative analysis of pollen grains. Fifty pollen types belonging to 40 genera and 17 families were identified. The results indicate predominance of pollen types belonging to the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae, which suggests that the bees preferred foraging from trees and shrubs. These plants should be included in regional reforestation projects in order to improve management of this bee species and honey production. ...|$|E

40|$|Nectar {{sources for}} the African {{honeybee}} Apis mellifera adansonii were investigated. The work involved analysis of three honey samples bought from open markets in Lagos, Nigeria. The pollen sediment of the honeys was acetolysed, mounted on slides and pollen types were identified and counted to determine the relative frequency of the different pollen types in the honey samples. The proportion of pollen {{from each of the}} honey samples varied from 196 in sample A, 280 in sample B to 238 in sample C. The most abundant taxa identified from the honey samples were Tridax procumbens and Elaeis guineensis belonging to the families Asteraceae and Palmae.

40|$|Melissopalynology (<b>pollen</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey)</b> is an {{indispensable}} method to authenticate honey origin and characteristics. It is very effective to determine {{and control the}} geographical origin of honeys and it also provides information about other important quality aspects. Melissopalynologists are challenged not only to identify the pollen found in honey but also {{decide what to do}} with the presence of pollen grains that are represented in the honey spectra. Pollen analyses of honey can also determine important information about honeybees such as foraging ecology, habitat and vegetation visited, changes in food sources and habitat composition. The advantages of a pollen analysis is that all, or most, nectar sources involved are recognised, and if quantitative data are available, their relationship to each component, or to the dominant source, can be determined. Pollen spectra gave consistent results for the same type of honey from different areas. The large variety of meliferous sources (223) enable in Romania to produce characteristic type of honeys. The interest in the production of unifloral honeys is a higher consumer preference for some honey varieties leading to a commercial interest of the beekeepers. In six sample of commercial unifloral honey, 16 pollen types were identified. These honeys are not especially rich in pollen types and compares with many honeys characteristic of Europe. Plantago pollen grains are irregularly found in these honeys, as elsewhere, although their numbers in any one sample are insignificant. The presence of this pollen type is considered accidental, especially as numbers are always low.

40|$|International audienceAbstract: Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) are {{a structural}} {{diverse group of}} toxicologically relevant secondary plant metabolites. Currently, two analytical methods are used to determine PA-content in honey. To achieve reasonably high sensitivity and selectivity mass spectrometry detection is demanded. One method is a HPLC-ESI-MS-MS approach, the other a sum parameter method utilizing HRGC-EI-MS operated in the selected ion monitoring mode (SIM). To date, no fully validated or standardized method exists to measure the PA- content in honey. To establish a LC-MS method, several hundred standard <b>pollen</b> <b>analysis</b> results <b>of</b> raw <b>honey</b> were analyzed. Possible PA-plants were identified and typical commercially available marker-PAs and corresponding PANOs were assigned. Three distinct honey sets were analyzed with both methods. Set A consisted <b>of</b> pure Echium <b>honey</b> (61 to 80 % Echium pollen). Echium is an attractive bee plant. It is quite common in all temperate zones world wide {{and one of the}} major reasons for PA-contamination in honey. Although, only echimidine/echimidine-N-oxide were available as reference for the LC-MS target approach, the results for both analytical techniques matched very well (n= 8; PA-content ranging from 311 to 520 µg kg- 1). The second batch (B) consisted of a set of randomly picked raw honeys, mostly originated from Eupatorium spp. (0 to 15 %), another common PA-plant, usually characterized by the occurrence of lycopsamine-type PA. Again, the results showed good consistency in terms of PA-positive samples and quantification results (n= 8; ranging from 0 to 625 µg kg- 1 retronecine equivalents). The last set (C) was obtained by consciously placing bee hives in areas with high abundance of Jacobaea vulgaris (ragwort) from the Veluwe region (The Netherlands). J. vulgaris increasingly infests country sides in Central Europe, especially areas with reduced farming or sites with natural restorations. Honey from two seasons (2007 and 2008) was sampled. While only trace amounts of ragwort pollen were detected (0 - 6. 3 %) in some cases extremely high PA-values were detected (n= 31; ranging from 0 to 13019 µg kg- 1, average 1261 or 76 µg kg- 1 for GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Here the result showed significant different quantification results. The GC-MS sum parameter showed in average higher values (in average differing by a factor 17). The main reason for the discrepancy is most likely the incomplete coverage of the J. vulgaris PA-pattern. Major J. vulgaris PAs like jacobine-type PAs or erucifoline/acetylerucifoline were not available as reference compounds for the LC-MS target approach. Based on the direct comparison both methods are considered from various perspectives and the respective individual strengths and weaknesses for each method are presented in detail...|$|R
