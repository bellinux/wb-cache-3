5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents.

25|$|At Borg in Norrköping Municipality, Östergötland, a small {{building}} was excavated that had two rooms {{on either side}} of a central hallway. There was a stone foundation interpreted as a hörgr {{at the far end of}} the hallway from the entrance. Two amulet rings were found near this and 98 amulet rings and 75 kg of unburned animal bones, including numerous skulls and jawbones, were found in the <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> in front of the entrance, suggesting the building had been used for ritual feasts. In the eleventh century the building and its yard had been covered with a thick layer of gravel and a church erected 100m away.|$|E
25|$|A {{little further}} up {{the slopes of}} Gaggera Hill is the spring from which the Sanctuary of the Malophoros gets its water. Fifty metres {{downstream}} {{of it is a}} building once believed to be a temple (the so-called “Temple M”), which is actually a monumental fountain. It is rectangular in shape (26.8 metres long x 10.85 metres wide x 8 metres high), constructed of squared blocks and contained a cistern, a closed basin protected by a portico with columns and an access staircase of four steps with a large <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> in front of it. The building is in the doric style and is dated {{to the middle of the}} sixth century mainly by the architectural terracotta discovered there. The fragments of metopes with the Amazonomachy, although found nearby, do not belong to the building, which had small, smooth metopes.|$|E

500|$|To {{the west}} of the mansio lay the public bath-house, {{separated}} from it by a cobbled road between [...] wide. From the street, a <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> led into a colonnade fronting the building on the east and continuing round the north side. Large doors in the centre of the eastern colonnade opened into a large, covered courtyard. This courtyard may have been a basilica; a settlement of this size would be expected to have one, and this is the only candidate on the site. At the far north end of the bath complex was the stoke-room or praefurnium, which contained the wood-fired furnaces of the hypocaust system. This underfloor heating system was present in the tepidarium, the caldarium and the laconicum where the floors were supported on pillars of tiles or pilae. The hot combustion gases from the stoke-room furnaces circulated under the floor between these pillars and were drawn up around the sides of the building through box tiles embedded in the walls, to escape finally through vents in the barrel-vaulted roof.|$|E
2500|$|Vergason's winning design {{envisioned a}} plot that formed a right triangle, {{with the right}} angle in the {{southwest}} corner of the site. Along the sidewalks that formed the legs of the triangle were dense rows of trees. [...] Slightly inward from the right angle was a pentagon-shaped <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> whose tip was aimed at {{the southwest corner of}} the site. Within this <b>paved</b> <b>area,</b> two walls formed a partial top of another pentagon, while two walls formed complete sides to it. The base of this shape, which faced northeast, was open to provide a view of the U.S. Capitol. Within the pentagonal area bounded by these walls was a fountain with a pentagon-shaped bowl. Aligned with the base of the paved pentagonal area was the edge of the reflecting pool. [...] Beginning near the tip of the pentagonal paving area were stone walls, approximately [...] high, which extended to the northern and southeastern tips of the site. These walls had rectangular windows in them, and they were inscribed with quotations about democracy, sacrifice, and honor. Paralleling the stone wall, creating a path about [...] in width, were glass walls approximately [...] high on which images of disabled veterans were inscribed. The glass walls were also to carry stories about disabled veterans and quotations from them about the meaning of their military service and the sacrifices they made. [...] The northeastern side of the right triangle site formed the base of a trapezoidal reflecting pool. [...] Its sides were the glass wall, and its top the edge of the <b>paved</b> <b>area.</b> [...] Trees partially lined the northeastern side of the site, with a gap in them to permit views of the Capitol.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 19th {{century the}} name of the square was changed to Commercial Square, being the site of a daily flea market and regular public auctions, as a result of which a Spanish name, Plazuela del Martillo, or more colloquially, El Martillo, was coined ("martillo" [...] being the Spanish word for a gavel). Another popular name at the time was Jews Market. These epithets fell out of usage and the square is {{typically}} referred to as The Piazza, an Italian name created following the construction of a <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> in the centre of the square, probably introduced by Gibraltar's Genoese settlers. The name [...] "John Mackintosh Square" [...] was officially adopted in 1940.|$|E

25|$|Terrains with no {{suitable}} habitat include lawns, <b>paved</b> <b>areas,</b> brickwork, {{or higher}} trees with trunks too wide for chameleons to climb. Foliage should also not be pruned or trimmed, or exposed to insecticide poisons, as this usually kills or injures chameleons.|$|R
50|$|A {{major concern}} of this {{principle}} is transport.

2500|$|Vergason's initial design {{underwent}} changes {{before being}} {{submitted to the}} Commission of Fine Arts for approval. [...] It now consisted of five elements. The first was the fountain. The fountain, intended {{to be the center}} of the memorial, was still located near the southwestern corner of the site. But instead of pentagonal shaped, the fountain was now a circular granite basin which contained both water and an eternal flame. The flame was about [...] high, and was designed to gout higher during times of war or national emergency. A circular area around the fountain was paved with specially colored stones to emphasize its centrality to the site. The second element were the stone walls and trees. [...] The white, marble-faced stone walls were now called the [...] "Walls of Loss", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them. Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness (as opposed to being walled in). The west and south sides of the site continued to be lined with trees, but the stone walls no longer connected with the <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> around the fountain. The stone walls were also no longer continuous, so as not to create the sense that the memorial was walled off from the surrounding area. The third element was the triangular reflecting pool, which extended south and east from the fountain, with trees at the north end emerging from the water at seemingly random points. An opening in the grove on the northeast portion of the site still permitted views of the U.S. Capitol. The fourth element was the glass walls. These were moved inward, away from the stone walls, to form trapezoidal paved areas that formed paths guiding the visitor between the various groves of trees. These trapezoidal, paved areas were oriented toward the north, or main, entrance to the memorial. They also created partial walls forcing visitors to use one of the memorial's three entrances. (In addition to the memorial's primary entrance on the north end, entrances existed in the southeast and southwest corners.) The glass walls were now called the [...] "Walls of Light". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism. [...] The fifth element consisted of the masses of trees around the site. [...] Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to view the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. The memorial also had a flagpole, and Vergason intended for [...] "works of art" [...] to be placed around the memorial site (although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined).|$|E
60|$|Objects now grew confused, {{for they}} came fast. We entered and crossed a <b>paved</b> <b>area,</b> that lay between the Seine, the Champs Elysées, {{the garden of}} the Tuileries, and two little palaces of {{extraordinary}} beauty of architecture. This was the place where Louis XVI. and his unfortunate wife were beheaded. Passing between the two edifices last named, we came upon the Boulevards, and plunged at once into the street-gaiety and movement of this remarkable town.|$|E
60|$|There was a broad <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> {{in front}} of it. In {{the centre of the}} {{building}} was a large arched doorway, with a sentry box on each side. At each of these sentry boxes stood a soldier on guard. All the royal palaces of England are guarded thus. There was a cab, that had brought a company of visitors to see the castle, standing near the centre of the square, by a great statue that was there. Another cab drove up just at the time that Mr. George arrived, and a party of visitors got out of it. All the new comers went in under the archway together. The soldiers paid no attention to them whatever.|$|E
50|$|Human {{activities}} {{can have a}} large and sometimes devastating impact on these factors.

60|$|The snow {{began to}} drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another trial; {{when a young}} man without coat, and {{shouldering}} a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a wash-house, and a <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> containing a coal-shed, pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe the 'missis,' an individual whose existence I had never previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute.|$|E
60|$|Our old ship-keeper, a Liverpool man by birth, who {{had long}} {{followed}} the seas, related a curious story concerning this dock. One of the ships which carried over troops from England to Ireland in King William's war, in 1688, entered the King's Dock {{on the first day}} of its being opened in 1788, after an interval of just one century. She was a dark little brig, called the Port-a-Ferry. And probably, as her timbers must have been frequently renewed in the course of a hundred years, the name alone could have been all that was left of her at the time. A <b>paved</b> <b>area,</b> very wide, is included within the walls; and along the edge of the quays are ranges of iron sheds, intended as a temporary shelter for the goods unladed from the shipping. Nothing can exceed the bustle and activity displayed along these quays during the day; bales, crates, boxes, and cases are being tumbled about by thousands of laborers; trucks are corning and going; dock-masters are shouting; sailors of all nations are singing out at their ropes; and all this commotion is greatly increased by the resoundings from the lofty walls that hem in the din.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{just beyond}} there," [...] said the landlord, {{and pointed to}} the tree-tops of the park, above the {{opposite}} houses. Newman followed the first cross-road to the right--it was bordered with mouldy cottages--and in a few moments saw before him the peaked roofs of the towers. Advancing farther, he found himself before a vast iron gate, rusty and closed; here he paused a moment, looking through the bars. The chateau was near the road; this was at once its merit and its defect; but its aspect was extremely impressive. Newman learned afterwards, from a guide-book of the province, that it dated from the time of Henry IV. It presented to the wide, <b>paved</b> <b>area</b> which preceded it and which was edged with shabby farm-buildings an immense facade of dark time-stained brick, flanked by two low wings, each of which terminated in a little Dutch-looking pavilion capped with a fantastic roof. Two towers rose behind, and behind the towers was a mass of elms and beeches, now just faintly green. But the great feature was a wide, green river which washed the foundations of the chateau. The building rose from an island in the circling stream, so that this formed a perfect moat spanned by a two-arched bridge without a parapet. The dull brick walls, which here and there made a grand, straight sweep; the ugly little cupolas of the wings, the deep-set windows, the long, steep pinnacles of mossy slate, all mirrored themselves in the tranquil river. Newman rang at the gate, and was almost frightened at the tone with which a big rusty bell above his head replied to him. An old woman came out from the gate-house and opened the creaking portal just wide enough for him to pass, and he went in, across the dry, bare court and the little cracked white slabs of the causeway on the moat. At the door of the chateau he waited for some moments, and this gave him a chance to observe that Fleurieres was not [...] "kept up," [...] and to reflect that it was a melancholy place of residence. [...] "It looks," [...] said Newman to himself--and I give the comparison for what it is worth--"like a Chinese penitentiary." [...] At last the door was opened by a servant whom he remembered to have seen in the Rue de l'Universite. The man's dull face brightened as he perceived our hero, for Newman, for indefinable reasons, enjoyed the confidence of the liveried gentry. The footman led the way across a great central vestibule, with a pyramid of plants in tubs in the middle of glass doors all around, to {{what appeared to be the}} principal drawing-room of the chateau. Newman crossed the threshold of a room of superb proportions, which made him feel at first like a tourist with a guide-book and a cicerone awaiting a fee. But when his guide had left him alone, with the observation that he would call Madame la Comtesse, Newman perceived that the salon contained little that was remarkable save a dark ceiling with curiously carved rafters, some curtains of elaborate, antiquated tapestry, and a dark oaken floor, polished like a mirror. He waited some minutes, walking up and down; but at length, as he turned at the end of the room, he saw that Madame de Cintre had come in by a distant door. She wore a black dress, and she stood looking at him. As the length of the immense room lay between them he had time to look at her before they met in the middle of it.|$|E
