25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the convergent evolution in perching and patrolling site preferences of Hemipepsis ustulata with other hilltopping insects of the Sonoran Desert. The high mountain ridges attract the males of various hilltopping insect species, including tarantula hawk wasps, various butterflies, and bot flies. Among these ridges, certain locations {{are much more}} likely to be occupied by territorial males. Additionally, these preferred territories appear to be stable from year to year, and different species appear to have similar preferences for available sites. Preferred territories tend to be large, visual targets, jutting high on mountain ridges. These observations were confirmed by a study using artificial landmarks. This similar ranking preference for territories suggests a widespread convergence among the capacity of hilltopping insects’ compound eyes in their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes a conspicuous landmark feature.|$|E

In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked the Clash number 28 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Critic Sean Egan wrote that the Clash were exceptional because:They were a group whose music was, and is, special to their audience because that music insisted on addressing the conditions of poverty, petty injustice, and mundane life experienced by the people who bought their records. Moreover, although their rebel stances were often no more than posturing, from the Clash's stubborn principles came a fundamental change in the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is possible in the music industry, from subject matter to authenticity to quality control to price ceilings.|$|E

Kosberg persuaded the film's director, Chris Marker, to let him pitch the project to Universal Pictures, seeing it as a perfect basis for a full-length science fiction film. Universal reluctantly agreed to purchase the remake rights and hired David and Janet Peoples to write the screenplay. Producer Charles Roven chose Terry Gilliam to direct, because he believed the filmmaker's style was perfect for 12 Monkeys nonlinear storyline and time travel subplot. Gilliam had just abandoned a film adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities when he signed to direct 12 Monkeys. The film also represents the second film for which Gilliam did not write or co-write the screenplay. Although he prefers to direct his own scripts, he was captivated by Peoples' [...] "intriguing and intelligent script. The story is disconcerting.

40|$|Health {{psychology}} {{has long}} been involved in studies of factors that lead to more effective caregiving. Drawing on the theory of distributive justice, the underlying hypothesis {{of this paper was}} that <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a demented parent was like, prior to becoming ill, influence an adult child caregiver’s provision of care, as well as the caregiver’s own well-being. A secondary question dealt with the nature of retrospective ratings by caregiver informants. The sample consisted of triads of two adult children (N = 385) and a parent (N = 201) diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, although in a few instances only one adult child was interviewed. Both retrospective and current ratings of the parent were made by caregivers, who were administered a semantic differential instrument twice over a 10 -month period. Comparison of ratings from first and second interview waves suggested that <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a parent was like, prior to the onset of dementia, were more stable over time than <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the parent was currently like, at each interview. Ratings of premorbid attributes were more strongly related to ratings of the present for those parents who displayed the least evidence of cognitive decline. Regression analyses supported the hypothesized relationship between adult children’s perceptions and both provision of care and well-being variables.

[...] Daytime television has been ahead of primetime for some time in exploring diverse or controversial storylines and characters, with the one glaring exception being homosexuality. Gay and lesbian issues or characters were invisible in 1950s and early 1960s TV.

2500|$|A {{great success}} on initial publication, the novel was almost {{forgotten}} in subsequent years.

Some believe that Charlotte's suppression of the book was to protect her younger sister's memory from further onslaughts. Others believe Charlotte was jealous of her younger sister. Even before Anne's death Charlotte had criticised the novel, stating in a letter to W.S. Williams: [...] "That it had faults of execution, faults of art, was obvious, but faults of intention of feeling could be suspected by none who knew the writer. For my part, I consider the subject unfortunately chosen – it was one the author was not qualified to handle at once vigorously and truthfully.

A lot of the modern realistic games tend to focus on gritty gray, brown palettes." [...] Several of the initial maps, Ilios, Dorado, and Nepal, were developed based on the idea of vacation spots and drew from various imagery of those locations. Kaplan noted that Dorado, set in Mexico, was inspired by a photograph they found while searching for images of colorful Mexican towns, but only later realized that the photo was that of Manarola, Italy. Others, like the Hollywood map, were created by a multicultural team that used only their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Hollywood was like, rather than any reference material, with the result being better than a realistic version, according to Kaplan.
