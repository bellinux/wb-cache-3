50|$|Advertiser pays {{publisher}} {{a commission}} for every install by a user of usually free applications bundled with adware applications. Users are prompted first {{if they really}} want to download and install this software. Pay per install is included in the definition for <b>pay</b> <b>per</b> <b>action</b> (like cost-per-acquisition), but its relationship to how adware is distributed made the use of this term versus <b>pay</b> <b>per</b> <b>action</b> more popular to distinguish it from other CPA offers that pay for software downloads. The term pay per install is being used beyond the download of adware.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{advertiser}} is purchasing inventory with a CPA target, {{instead of}} <b>paying</b> <b>per</b> <b>action</b> {{at a fixed}} rate, {{the goal of the}} effective CPA (eCPA) should always be below the maximum CPA. As described by Yang's Law, [...] This fundamental view of what the performance of conversion-based campaign should be is served as the baseline for many buy-side platform optimization algorithms.|$|R
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} {{affiliate}} programs today use revenue sharing or <b>pay</b> <b>per</b> sale (PPS) as a compensation method, nineteen percent use cost <b>per</b> <b>action</b> (CPA), {{and the remaining}} programs use other methods such as cost per click (CPC) or cost per mille (CPM, cost per estimated 1000 views).|$|R
50|$|<b>Pay</b> <b>per</b> click (PPC) {{and cost}} per click (CPC) are both forms of CPA (cost <b>per</b> <b>action)</b> with the action being a click. PPC is {{generally}} {{used to refer to}} paid search marketing such as Google's AdSense or Ad Words. The advertiser pays each time someone clicks on their text or display ad.|$|R

In return, the advertiser gives up control of where and when the ads will run.|$|R
5000|$|In text {{advertising}} commonly {{works on}} a cost per click (CPC) model, which means that each time a website visitor clicks on an In-text ad, the websites owner gets paid by the advertiser. Other models include cost per impression (CPM), cost <b>per</b> <b>action</b> CPA and cost per play CPP for multimedia content ads (also known as <b>Pay</b> <b>Per</b> Play (PPP)) ...|$|R

Performance-based compensation can also incorporate revenue sharing, where publishers earn a percentage of the advertiser's profits made {{as a result of the}} ad. Performance-based compensation shifts the risk of failed advertising onto publishers.|$|R
50|$|The {{final step}} {{that led to}} {{auctioning}} off domain names was Google’s <b>Pay</b> <b>per</b> click (PPC) auction model which allowed bidders to buy search terms. This allowed webpage owners to sponsor a keyword so that their ad could appear each time a user searched the term on Google, and thus increased {{the likelihood of the}} ‘clickthroughs’ their sponsor ad obtained. Gradually, as advertisement placement and sponsoring or trademarking search terms on the World Wide Web became a viable source of profit, so did domain names that attracted attention from Internet users and advertisers. Additionally, new business models for monetizing domain names are emerging. In addition to the <b>Pay</b> <b>per</b> click (PPC) model, the Cost <b>per</b> <b>action</b> (CPA) or pay-per-action model is being used as a new strategy for online advertising.|$|R
