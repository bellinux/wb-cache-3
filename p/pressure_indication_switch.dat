40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry constantly works to optimize operational aspects within drilling. The cost to {{drill a well}} is a parameter all companies want to minimize. To do this new technology and new methods are used to optimize the drilling process. Drilling the shoetrack is a process where components {{in the bottom of}} the casing are drilled out. The components include different equipment used when cementing the casing. Drilling the shoetrack can be a time consuming process, generating large cost and problems for the operators. The drilling of the shoetrack includes many factors, making it a complex situation. A study of the drilling parameters will help to optimize this process. Studies of the drilling parameters are expected to reduce the operational cost and time when drilling the shoetrack. Drilling data from 143 runs were given in order to get a better overview over the problems occurring, and to show were most of the time is used. Special cementing plugs are used to displace the cement slurry and give surface <b>pressure</b> <b>indications</b> during the cementing operation. After the casing is cemented into place, all the equipment in the shoetrack needs to be drilled out in order to reach the next open hole section. The inclination of the wells plotted against the total time to drill the shoetrack, shows that the more deviated a well is, the more time consuming the shoetrack drill out process is. The study further shows that the component in the shoetrack taking the most time to drill is the landing collar, this applies for 6 of 7 casing sizes studied. The landing collar is a component used in the shoetrack when the cementing operation takes place. The cement plugs that displace the cement when pumping will land and seal inside and on top of the landing collar, this will give surface <b>pressure</b> <b>indications,</b> indicating that the cementing job is complete. The use of different bit did not give any big difference when studying all the drilling runs, so for drilling the shoetrack, it is the drilling parameters that account for most of the effect. The shoetrack drillout of the 10 ¾” liners has shown to take too much time. The focus was therefore directed towards this casing size. A total of 15 wells in this casing size were selected, where Halliburton was the provider of the shoetrack equipment. Further, feet-by-feet data were examined, containing drilling parameters as weight on bit, rotation speed, torque and flowrate. The study included both single stage cemented liners and two stage cemented liners. The study clearly shows that drilling the cementing plug and lading collar, is the process taking most of the time. Since the landing collar took most of the time of the shoetrack drillout, a deeper studied was performed. For the single stage cemented liners a trend was seen when studying the flow rate up against the total time to drill the shoetrack. An increased flow gave better drillout times. For the WOB, no trend was seen. No trends were seen when studying the total drilling time up against WOB and flowrate for the two stage cemented liners. The materials studied for the shoetrack of 10 ¾” liners was relatively soft materials, consisting of aluminium, rubber, plastic and cement. Connecting the time to drill the landing collar up against the average values of WOB, Torque, flowrate and revolution speed gave some interesting results. The more weight and torque applied the more time the drilling of the landing collar took. The flowrate and rotation speed did not show a large effect in the drill out times...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{provide a}} review of current {{knowledge}} on comparability between biosimilars and originator biologics {{in view of the}} continuous evolution occurring in this highly dynamic area. Methods: English-language literature indexed in MEDLINE was explored, without time limits, to July 31, 2016, using the terms biosimilar, biotechnologic drug, biologic drug, monoclonal antibody, fusion protein, and anti-tumor necrosis factor. The reference lists of identified articles were examined carefully for additional pertinent publications. Findings: Biological medicines are much more structurally complex and extremely sensitive to manufacturing conditions and therefore more difficult to characterize and produce than small molecule drugs. Even minor changes in manufacturing may lead to significant variations of the cellular systems used for biological production, as well as to differences in the structure, stability, or other quality aspects of the end product, all of which have the potential to affect tolerability and/or efficacy and increase the risk of immune responses. Owing to these issues, specific regulatory guidance on biosimilars is continuously evolving, and there is some disagreement on which studies need to be implemented to approve a biosimilar. According to current literature, the following points on biosimilars deserve consideration: biosimilar development is characterized by global harmonization, although several not fully answered questions remain regarding extrapolation of <b>indications,</b> <b>switching</b> or interchangeability, and tolerability; in patients with rheumatic diseases, the tolerability and efficacy of biosimilars in clinical practice remain to be established; several medical and patient associations have published position papers on biosimilars requesting that safety, efficacy, and traceability be carefully considered; long-term postmarketing studies should be implemented to allow physicians to gain confidence in biosimilars. Implications: On the basis of current knowledge, and taking into consideration both regulatory rules and medical society positions, it can be concluded that, although cost savings are highly desirable, the approval process for biosimilars needs to place tolerability and efficacy, supported by scientifically sound evidence, as the highest priority. Moreover, physicians must retain full authority regarding the decision about which biopharmaceutical to use for treating patients...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{rates are}} set to {{increase}} at an alarming rate, from 10 million new cases globally in 2000 to 15 million in 2020. Regarding the pharmacological treatment of cancer, we currently are in the interphase of two treatment eras. The so-called pregenomic therapy which names the traditional cancer drugs, mainly cytotoxic drug types, and post-genomic era-type drugs referring to rationally-based designed. Although there are successful examples of this newer drug discovery approach, most target-specific agents only provide small gains in symptom control and/or survival, whereas others have consistently failed in the clinical testing. There is however, a characteristic shared by these agents: -their high cost-. This is expected as drug discovery and development is generally carried out within the commercial rather than the academic realm. Given the extraordinarily high therapeutic drug discovery-associated costs and risks, {{it is highly unlikely}} that any single public-sector research group will see a novel chemical "probe" become a "drug". An alternative drug development strategy is the exploitation of established drugs that have already been approved for treatment of non-cancerous diseases and whose cancer target has already been discovered. This strategy is also denominated drug repositioning, drug repurposing, or <b>indication</b> <b>switch.</b> Although traditionally development of these drugs was unlikely to be pursued by Big Pharma due to their limited commercial value, biopharmaceutical companies attempting to increase productivity at present are pursuing drug repositioning. More and more companies are scanning the existing pharmacopoeia for repositioning candidates, and the number of repositioning success stories is increasing. Here we provide noteworthy examples of known drugs whose potential anticancer activities have been highlighted, to encourage further research on these known drugs as a means to foster their translation into clinical trials utilizing the more limited public-sector resources. If these drug types eventually result in being effective, it follows that they could be much more affordable for patients with cancer; therefore, their contribution in terms of reducing cancer mortality at the global level would be greater...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} niobia {{has been shown}} to be an {{attractive}} support for application in Fischer-Tropsch catalysis at industrially relevant conditions without apparent deactivation up to at least 200 hours of operation. This proves that the level of potentially poisoning contaminants is sufficiently low and niobia is stable up to 260 °C and CO conversion levels higher than 80 % with concomitant high steam pressures. Niobia-supported cobalt catalysts were found to exhibit high selectivities towards liquid hydrocarbons at competitive cobalt-weight based activities. Due to the low porosity of crystalline niobia, only low cobalt loadings can be applied and consequently low catalyst-weight based activities could be obtained. However, using the reactor temperature or Pt-promotion, methods were found to compensate for the low cobalt loading and to obtain competing selectivities and catalyst-weight based activities while using a low amount of cobalt. Transition metal oxides are typical promoters added to cobalt Fischer Tropsch catalysts to enhance the selectivity towards heavy hydrocarbons. In this thesis niobia was found to be a very efficient selectivity promoter particularly at 1 bar. At 20 bar, the influence of support pore size appeared to be important. This fundamentally different role of promoters at 1 and 20 bar is very relevant to understand the necessity and role of transition metal oxide promoters in cobalt-based Fischer Tropsch catalysts but also calls for characterization methods at conditions as close as possible to industrially applied conditions, for example SSITKA at elevated <b>pressures.</b> <b>Indications</b> were found that the role of platinum in cobalt-based Fischer Tropsch synthesis was not limited to facilitation of cobalt oxide reduction but also played a role during Fischer Tropsch synthesis in PtCo/Nb 2 O 5 catalysts.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the high-pressure phase transitions in BiFeO 3 by single crystal and powder x-ray diffraction, {{as well as}} single crystal Raman spectroscopy. Six phase transitions are reported in the 0 - 60 GPa range. At low pressures, up to 15 GPa, 4 transitions are evidenced at 4, 5, 7 and 11 GPa. In this range, the crystals display large unit cells and complex domain structures, which suggests a competition between complex tilt systems and possibly off-center cation displacements. The non polar Pnma phase remains stable over a large pressure range between 11 and 38 GPa, where the distortion (tilt angles) changes only little with pressure. The two high-pressure phase transitions at 38 and 48 GPa are marked by the occurence of larger unit cells and an increase of the distorsion away from the cubic parent perovskite cell. We find no evidence for a cubic phase at high <b>pressure,</b> nor <b>indications</b> that the structure tends to become cubic. The previously reported insulator-to-metal transition at 50 GPa appears to be symmetry breaking. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
