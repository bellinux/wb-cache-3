50|$|The {{hydroxyl}} •OH radical {{is one of}} {{the main}} chemical species controlling the oxidizing capacity of the global Earth atmosphere. This oxidizing reactive species has a major impact on the concentrations and distribution of greenhouse gases and pollutants in the Earth atmosphere. It is the most widespread oxidizer in the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere. Understanding •OH variability is important to evaluating human impacts on the atmosphere and climate. The •OH species has a lifetime in the Earth atmosphere of less than one second. Understanding the role of •OH in the oxidation process of methane (CH4) present in the atmosphere to first carbon monoxide (CO) and then carbon dioxide (CO2) is important for assessing the residence time of this greenhouse gas, the overall carbon budget of the troposphere, and its influence on the process of global warming. The lifetime of •OH radicals in the Earth atmosphere is very short, therefore •OH concentrations in the air are very low and very sensitive techniques are required for its direct detection. Global average hydroxyl radical concentrations have been measured indirectly by analyzing methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) present in the air. The results obtained by Montzka et al. (2011) shows that the interannual variability in •OH estimated from CH3CCl3 measurements is small, indicating that global •OH is generally well buffered against perturbations. This small variability is consistent with measurements of methane and other trace gases primarily oxidized by •OH, as well as global <b>photochemical</b> <b>model</b> calculations.|$|E

To assist in that analysis, we have analyzed the Goddard 2 D <b>photochemical</b> <b>model</b> {{for the same}} time period with the same time-series model. Multiple runs of the <b>photochemical</b> <b>model</b> allow us to separate the effects of various terms on ozone, such as solar cycle and volcanic eruptions. We use this to help us separate those signals from each other in the data. We also used a smoothed version of the photochemical model's prediction of global ozone change in place of a simple linear trend. We find a number of interesting results. This particular <b>photochemical</b> <b>model</b> is more sensitive to chlorine perturbations than the atmosphere appears to be. It is less sensitive to solar cycle.

40|$|Current {{theories}} on the Martian water history are discussed {{on the basis}} of data for the D/H ratio in the Martian atmosphere (which was found to be enhanced by a factor of 6 + or - relative to the value on earth). In particular, the calculations of Yung et al. (1988), {{on the basis of}} their <b>photochemical</b> <b>model,</b> are found to be inconsistent with current theories for the evolution of the polar deposits on Mars. While the <b>photochemical</b> <b>model</b> predicts that about 95 percent of the Martian water has escaped over geologic time and the nonatmospheric reservoir is now only 02 m thick, the polar volatile theory suggest that polar deposits contain the equivalent of tens of meters of water, requiring a more rapid escape of H and D to space than predicted by the <b>photochemical</b> <b>model</b> to match the observed D/H ratio. The paper examines the behavior of the polar caps and the atmospheric water vapor over geologic time and the loss of H and D to space.

A meso-urban meteorological model, uMM 5, based on Taha (2008 a) and Dupont et al. (2004), improves the simulation of fine-resolution meteorological fields in the urban canopy layer. Compared to roughness-length-based mesoscale models, drag-force-based meso-urban modeling can capture phenomena of interest that are not typically detectable at the coarser scales. These include, for example, cool islands, heat islands, flow convergence associated with heat-island circulation, flow divergence at the leading edge of urban areas, and vertical variations in turbulent kinetic energy in response to changes in densities of buildings and vegetation canopies. Enhanced modeling of these meteorological fields is crucial for improved emissions and <b>photochemical</b> <b>modeling</b> of urban heat island mitigation.

During the summer of 1991 a comprehensive field monitoring study was conducted to collect data to support the application of the UAM-V.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the ionosphere of a CO-rich comet is computed using two different models. The first one, the <b>photochemical</b> <b>model,</b> assumes that the dissociation and ionization of cometary neutrals and ions are due to photoionization, and photodissociation by solar UV radiation together with dissociative recombinations and ion-neutral reactions. The second one, the internal source model, also incorporates the ionization and dissociation effects of an electric current discharging through the inner coma. The generation of this current has been discussed in earlier papers. It is concluded that the internal source model can explain qualitatively the basic morphology of the ionospheres of CO-rich comets such as Humason (1962, VIII) and Morehouse (1908, III), whereas the <b>photochemical</b> <b>model</b> cannot.

We have carefully investigated the photochemistry involving C 3 Hp compounds in the atmosphere of Titan (considering both photolysis and neutral reactions), which considerably impacts the abundances of many other hydrocarbon species (including C 2 compounds).
