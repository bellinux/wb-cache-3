The PLL includes the sliding Goertzel discrete Fourier transform (SGDFT) filter-based fundamental <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component</b> separator (FPSCS), the synchronousreference-frame PLL (SRF-PLL) and the secondary control path (SCP). In {{order to obtain}} an accurate fundamental <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component,</b> SGDFT filter is introduced as it features better filtering ability at the frequencies that are integer times of fundamental frequency. Meanwhile, the second order Lagrange-interpolation method is employed to approximate the actual sampling number including both integer and fractional parts as grid frequency may deviate from the rated value. Moreover, an improved SCP with single-step comparison filtering algorithm is employed as it updates reference angular frequency according to the FPSC, which promises a zero steady-state error of phase and improves the frequency tracking speed. In this paper, the mathematical model of the proposed PLL is constructed, its stability is analyzed. Also, design procedure of the control parameters is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed PLL is confirmed by experimental results and comparison with advanced pre-filtering PLLs...|$|E

30|$|For {{obtaining the}} {{complete}} fault {{information on the}} transmission line, a fault location technique has been presented which does not require any additional information beyond the synchrophasor measurements that are utilized for fault detection and classification. Fault location techniques proposed in earlier works [16 – 18] employ sophisticated algorithms to locate a fault. The most commonly used fault location techniques are impedance-based fault location methods. Single-ended impedance-based fault location algorithm techniques have several disadvantages [29]. They only work when the fault voltages and currents recorded by the PMU correspond to the faulted line. They also provide inaccurate results {{in the presence of}} tapped lines or three terminal lines. This situation necessitates the need for double ended fault location algorithms which are highly accurate but need measurements from both ends of the line. This can only be achieved when PMUs are present in all the buses. Hence, the proposed scheme takes advantage of data available from each bus of the system to enable accurate fault location. The voltage and current phasors at the two buses in the faulted branch (termed hereafter as Bus a and Bus b) are taken. From these phasor quantities, the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>components</b> of the voltage and current phasors are extracted. Here, the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>components</b> are used because they are non-zero for all types of faults (zero <b>sequence</b> <b>components</b> do not exist for non-ground faults and negative <b>sequence</b> <b>components</b> do not exist for symmetrical faults).|$|R

For this reason, the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage input to the polarizing memory is generally eliminated when the voltage is distorted [29]. To overcome from this problem a <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> current based approach is proposed in this paper.

A method to improve the inverter output current by using the capacitor current feedforward disturbance rejection was proposed in [7]. Reference [8] presented a method via the grid feed forward and the multi-harmonic resonant control for the current quality improvement. Another interesting method in [9] achieved the harmonic cancellation for grid-connected inverters by randomizing a tuning parameter of the current controller. Note that the abovementioned methods are mainly for single-phase grid-connected inverters. For three-phase grid-connected inverters, further requirements should be considered. The grid current should follow the fundamental <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component</b> of the grid voltage with a preset current value. That’s why so many phase-locked loops have been proposed in recent years [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In [10], a method for extracting the fundamental frequency positive-sequence voltage was proposed based on the simple mathematical transformations. Another interesting method in [11] utilized the decoupled double synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop. An improvement in [12] used an adaptive synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop. A multiple reference frame based phase-locked loop was reported in [13] to extract the fundamental <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component</b> of the grid voltage. Also, multiple reference frame based PI control was used to maintain a balanced set of three-phase sinusoidal currents.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a novel fuzzy logic controller for a three phase shunt active shunt filter {{for the power}} quality improvement. The Power Quality (PQ) problems in power distribution systems are not new but only recently {{the effects of these}} problems have gained public awareness. These non-linear loads are constructed by nonlinear devices in which the current is not proportional to the applied voltage. For the harmonic elimination different methods are used, but in this paper a novel fuzzy logic controller for a three-phase shunt active power filter for the power quality improvement such as reactive power and harmonic current compensation generated due to nonlinear loads. The approach of fuzzy logic control is linguistic description, so it does not require a mathematical model of the system. The application of the fuzzy logic controller to a three phase shunt active power filter is investigated. The controller is capable of controlling dc capacitor voltage and generating reference source currents. And this controller provides current compensation, such that the compensated current drawn from the network is sinusoidal and balanced, corresponding to the fundamental positive-sequence component of the load current, plus an additional fundamental <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component</b> to cover losses in the power circuit of the shunt active filter.

30|$|It is {{necessary}} to study a new directional relay which is adaptable to the outgoing transmission line of the wind farm. Given the difference of phase angles between fault and load current when a fault occurs forward and backward [7], a direction identification approach has been proposed. However, the method has the adaptability problem in a wind power system because of the fast variation of the load current. Two kinds of directional relays based on a sequence component are presented in [8]: one calculates {{the ratio of the}} negative sequence component to the zero sequence component and identifies direction by comparing the ratio with a statistical boundary value; the other compares the values of the fifth harmonic of the zero sequence component with the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component</b> to determine the fault direction. Both directional relays work well under ideal conditions. However, rich high order harmonics and non-periodic components during a fault in a wind power system will reduce the precision of this method. A new method for discriminating a directional element is proposed in [9]. This method applies the principle that the transient potential of a DFIG has inertia for a short time after a fault. However, due to the short duration of the inertia of the equivalent transient electromotive force (EMF) of the DFIG, this method will fail if the protection cannot effectively determine the fault direction during this period. In [10], a fault current classification method is proposed, and the fault direction is identified according to the difference of fault current waveforms. However, it needs to add frequency tracking links, and the action time for the protection is longer.|$|E
40|$|A stator turn {{fault in}} a safety-critical drive {{application}} must be detected at its initial stage and imperatively requires an evasive action {{to prevent a}} serious accident caused by an abrupt interruption in the drive s operation. However, this is much challenging for {{the case of an}} interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives {{because of the presence of}} the permanent magnets that cannot be turned off at will. This work tackles the problem of increase the stator turn fault tolerance of IPMSM drives in safety-critical applications. This objective is achieved by an on-line turn fault detection method and a simple turn fault-tolerant operating strategy. In this work, it is shown that a stator turn fault in a current-controlled voltage source inverter-driven machine leads to a reduced fundamental <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component</b> of the voltage references as compared to the machine without a turn fault for a given torque reference and rotating speed. Based on this finding, a voltage reference-based turn fault detection method is proposed. In addition, it is also revealed that an adjustment to the level of the rotating magnetic flux in an appropriate manner can yield a significant reduction in the propagation speed of the fault and possibly prevention of the fault from spreading to the entire winding. This would be accomplished without any hardware modification. Based on this principle, a stator turn fault-tolerant operating strategy for IPMSM drives maintaining drive s availability is proposed. To evaluate these turn fault detection method and fault-tolerant operating strategy, an electrical model and a thermal model of an IPMSM with stator turn faults are derived. All the proposed models and methods are validated through simulations and experiments on a 10 kW IPMSM drive. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Thomas G. Habetler; Committee Member: Ayanna M.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} {{additional}} contributions to control of multiphase machine, {{with a focus on}} asymmetrical six-phase induction machine (machine with two three-phase windings spatially displaced by 30 °). Using the VSD approach, the machine’s six phase variables can be transformed into six decoupled variables, namely α-β, x-y and two zero sequence variables. For machine with distributed windings, only the α-β components provide useful electro-mechanical energy conversion, while the other components merely produce losses. The studies presented in this thesis are based on this VSD approach, and are separated into three main parts: x-y current control methods, operation with series-connected converters and post-fault control. The first part of this research work looks into the x-y current control methods of the machine using PI controllers. It was found that the x-y currents can be physically interpreted as the circulating current between the two three-phase windings. Depending on the type of asymmetry, x-y currents can appear as <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component,</b> negative sequence component or a combination of both. Hence, performance of PI controller implemented under different reference frame is compared and discussed. In this part of the study, a dead time compensator implemented using resonant controller for x-y currents is also presented. The second part of this work investigates the operation of the six-phase machine with series-connected machine-side converters. Under this topology, the two three-phase windings are supplied by two separate two-level voltage source converters (VSCs) with their dc-link cascaded in series. The series-topology elevates dc-link voltage which gives a reduction in dc-link current and cable size. However, the additional dc-link voltage balancing control is needed to ensure equal voltage sharing. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ iv This is accomplished by controlling x-y currents, which is a new concept introduced in this work. The final part of the research work deals with post-fault control of six-phase induction machine for a single open-circuit fault. Post-fault control is based on the full order decoupling transformation, to minimise reconfiguration of the controller. Effect of the single open-circuit fault on the machine is discussed. Here, the leg-to-phase voltage relation is identified as an important issue {{that needs to be addressed}} when using PI controllers for post-fault operation. Different modes of post-fault operation are analysed and compared. The study considers both the cases where the six-phase machine is configured with single as well as with two isolated neutrals, such that a unified comparison is achieved. In conclusion, this thesis provides insights on the control of x-y currents in six-phase machine based on PI controllers in different reference frame. Two interesting uses of these currents, i. e. for dead time compensation and dc-link voltage balancing have also been presented. In terms of alternative converter topology, the operation of six-phase machine with series-connected machine-side converter is detailed, addressing the merits and demerits of the topology. Lastly, the operation of six-phase induction machine under different modes of post-fault control is studied and compared.

40|$|Diagnosing {{the type}} of fault and its {{location}} in a transmission lines is performed {{by a variety of}} techniques and mainly relies on monitoring currents and voltages in the transmission line. Accurate fault diagnosis {{plays an important role in}} improving the overall system reliability, has a significant effect on the quality of service provided, improves the protection system efficiency, reduces power outage time and limits the risks and the economic losses. Transmission lines extend over wide areas and are exposed to vulnerable situation, to the harsh and uncontrolled environment random events (e. g. ~lightning), this can lead to loss of lines due to various faults. This fact has an attraction for researchers to focus on utilising possible methods to improve protection system and supporting fault diagnosis solutions to overcome many of the transient fault conditions. This thesis explores an alternative method of fault diagnosis and location. The approach uses chromatic methodology to extract information from current and voltage waveforms from a simulated transmission line with different fault conditions. These waveforms are processed chromatically. The process involves two steps, filtering which is performed on a cycle by cycle basis of the three symmetrical components for each waveform, and then using the chromatic transformations to represent the outputs in an information space. Various chromatic models are available but the hue, lightness and saturation (HLS) model is employed in this study and the relation between changes in the waveforms and changes in the chromatic parameters forms the foundation for building the proposed diagnosis algorithms. A fault type classifier algorithm for the asymmetrical faults has been proposed for both, double and single line transmission systems. It employs the chromatic H parameter variation with the fault type for the negative sequence component. The processed waveforms are either the voltage or the current at a single terminal of the transmission line. L chromatic parameter values of the zero sequence component are incorporated in the algorithm to add the ground fault distinguishing element and the L parameter values of the rectified negative sequence component were used to support the classification decision even with high fault resistance. Another algorithm for fault location estimation for all types of faults has been used for the double transmission line system. It employs the L chromatic parameter values of the rectified <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component.</b> The processed waveforms are the current collected from both terminals of the transmission line. Finally, the proposed algorithms have been tested by variation of possible conditions of the faults, such as changing the fault location, the fault resistance, the line configurations and parameters, etc. In addition to robustness testing with different fault scenarios. Experimental results taken from a lumped parameter laboratory system have been also used to verify the outputs of the chromatic processing. The performance of the chromatic approach and other reported methods have been compared. The error of the chromatic method compares favourably with others.

Aker Solutions has proposed several specially connected transformers for subsea power supply of DEH systems, Scott-T being one of them. The Scott-T transformer is a three-to-two-phase transformer which provides balanced electrical power between the two systems when the two secondary one-phase loads are equal. By implementing this transformer, it can be possible to install the power supply subsea as there is no need for a balancing unit. In addition, the system may be applicable for long step out distances. This is because the pipeline is inductive and can use the reactive power produced by the long cable which also can increase the critical cable length. There are however some limitations on this system using the Scott-T transformer. There is a large variation in the magnetic permeability between individual joints of the pipeline. This can result in different load impedance of the two pipe sections connected to the Scott-T transformer. The result is unbalance in the power system. The method of symmetrical components is applied to investigate the behavior during unbalanced loading of the Scott-transformer. The relationship between the negative- and the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>component</b> of the current is used to express the degree of unsymmetry. For the simulations in SIMPOW, the Scott-T transformer is modelled by the use of Dynamic Simulation Language. The simulations on the DSL model give correct and reliable results for analysing the the degree of unsymmetry in the Scott-T transformer. When the load impedance of one pipe section is varied, simulation proves that it can change between 0. 75 and 1. 34 per unit of the other pipe impedance. The Scott-T transformer does still provide electrical power between the two systems which is below the limit for the degree of unsymmetry (15 %). Case 1 and Case 2 introduce two possible configurations for a subsea DEH system with the Scott-T transformer implemented. The configurations include an onshore power supply which is connected to a subsea power system for direct electrical heating and a subsea load at the far end of the subsea cable. The pipeline in Case 1 is 100 km long and is divided into two pipe sections of 50 km which are connected to a Scott-T transformer. The pipeline in Case 2 is 200 km long and is divided into four pipe sections of 50 km each. There are two Scott-T transformers in Case 2. For normal operation of the subsea load (50 MW, cosfi= 0. 9) and heating the pipe content from the ambient sea emperature, the results indicate that tap changers are necessary to keep the Scott-T transformers secondary terminal voltage at 25 kV. This meets the requirement in both cases for heating the pipe content from 4 to 25 degrees celsius within 48 hours after a shutdown of the process. The degree of unsymmetry is zero for both cases when the system is operated as normal. However, all system simulations indicate that reactive power compensation has to be included for Case 1 as well as for Case 2 in order to have a power factor of unity at the onshore grid connection. The fault scenarios indicate that the degree of unsymmetry is dependent on both the type of fault and the power supply in the system. For Case 1, the relationship (I-/I+) is only of 3. 3 % in the subsea cable when there is a short-circuit at DEHBUS 3, but as much as 87 % at the grid connection. The degree of unsymmetry in the Scott-T transformer is then 67 %. This is far beyond the limit for maximum negative sequence component of 15 %. The significant unsymmetry in the line between the grid and BUS 1 is most likely due to the large power delivered to the fault. During the fault, the reactive power delivered to the system increases from 10. 6 Mvar to 131. 9 Mvar after the fault, but the active power increases only from 75. 2 MW to 87. 1 MW. This means that it is most likely the reactive power that contributes to the consequent unsymmetry and negative sequence component of the current. There are two Scott-T transformers installed in Case 2. If the DEH system is only heating the pipe section closest to shore (at DEHBUS 33), simulations show that the three-phase power system becomes unsymmetric which results in different phase currents. The degree of unsymmetry at the grid connection is 32 % when only the pipe section at DEHBUS 33 is heated. In addition, the unbalance in the three-phase system caused by SCOTT 1 involves unbalance in the SCOTT 2 transformer as well. The load voltages are not equal in magnitude and dephased of 90 degrees for this mode, but are 32 kV and 35 kV respectively and dephased of 88 degrees. This concludes a very important behavior of the Scott-T transformer. The simulations conclude that the Scott-T transformer provides symmetrical conditions for both configurations when the two load impedances are equal. However, Case 2 shows an important result when installing two Scott-T transformers in the same system. Unbalanced loading of one of the specially connected transformers gives unsymmetrical conditions in the three-phase system which results in unbalanced load voltages for the other Scott-T transformer. The analysis is limited to the configurations given for Case 1 and Case 2, but shows typical results when an alternative transformer connection is implemented in a DEH system. </p...|$|E
