50|$|Throughout Europe and Middle East the <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> {{used are}} {{traditionally}} from Pinus pinea (stone pine). They are easily {{distinguished from the}} Asian <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> by their more slender shape and more homogeneous flesh. Because of the lower price, Asian <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are also often used, especially in cheaper preparations. <b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> contain thiamine (vitamin B1) and protein.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a {{value-added}} whey cheese through addition of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts.</b> Therefore, different concentrations of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> [2, 4, 6 and 8 % (w/w) ] were added to whey cheese. The {{study was designed to}} evaluate the influence of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> on physicochemical and sensory properties of whey cheese. The addition of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> resulted in an increase in fat content and total solids and a decrease in moisture content. However, no statistically significant difference was found in pH values. Sensory analysis was performed using the 9 -point hedonic scale, with selected assessors. The whey cheese sample with 4 % <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> was the most appreciated (7. 6 points), followed by the classic whey cheese, whey cheese with 6 and 8 % <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> (7. 4 points), and whey cheese with 2 % <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> (7. 3 points). Nevertheless, the sensory characteristics of whey cheese were not significantly influenced by the addition of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts.</b> Whey cheese sensory profiling was successful in differential characterization of whey cheese samples. </p...|$|R
50|$|Pinolenic acid (often misspelled as pinoleic acid) is a {{fatty acid}} {{contained}} in Siberian <b>Pine</b> <b>nuts,</b> Korean <b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> and {{the seeds of}} other pines (Pinus species).

5|$|Whitebark pine {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the <b>pine</b> <b>nut,</b> that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.|$|E
25|$|Pinhão is the <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> of the Araucaria angustifolia, {{a common}} {{tree in the}} {{highlands}} of southern Brazil. The nuts are boiled and eaten as a snack in the winter months. It is typically eaten during the festas juninas.|$|E

2500|$|The kibbeh {{is one of}} the {{favourite}} {{foods of}} the locals, and the Aleppines have created more than 17 types of kibbeh dishes, which is considered a form of art for them. These include kibbeh prepared with sumac (kәbbe sәmmāʔiyye), yogurt (kәbbe labaniyye), quince (kәbbe safarjaliyye), lemon juice (kәbbe ḥāmḍa), pomegranate sauce and cherry sauce. Other varieties include the [...] "disk" [...] kibbeh (kәbbe ʔrāṣ), the [...] "plate" [...] kibbeh (kәbbe bәṣfīḥa or kәbbe bṣēniyye) and the raw kibbeh (kәbbe nayye). Kebab Halabi -influenced by Armenian and Turkish tastes- has around 26 variants including: kebab prepared with cherry (kebab karaz), eggplant (kebab banjan), chili pepper with parsley and <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> (kebab khashkhash), truffle (kebab kamayeh), tomato paste (kebab hindi), cheese and mushroom (kebab ma'juʔa), etc. The favourite drink is Arak, which is usually consumed along with meze, Aleppine kebabs and kibbehs. Al-Shark beer -a product of Aleppo- is also among the favourite drinks. Local wines and brandies are consumed as well.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> (Pinus spp.) are {{becoming}} more popular in New Zealand cuisine and so their availability has increased. They have a unique taste because they contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. They are {{an excellent source of}} dietary fatty acids, such as linoleic and oleic acids. <b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are either locally-grown or imported and informal reports suggest that each cultivar has a very different taste because of the different patterns of fatty acids found in each of the cultivars. Five different cultivars of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> were harvested from trees growing in Marlborough and the fatty acid profiles were compared to samples of imported <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> available in local supermarkets. Individual fatty acids in each sample of nuts were analysed using FastGLC methods and the fatty acids were identified by mass spectrometry. Local fresh <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> contained high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, oleic and linoleic acid. They also contained several Δ 5 -­olefinic fatty acids, taxoleic, pinolenic, coniferonic, eicosadienoic, sciadonic and eicosatrienoic which are characteristic of gymnosperms. The pattern of these Δ 5 -­olefinic fatty acids can be used to determine the botanical origin of the <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> and can assist in the identification of the country of origin. Conclusion: <b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are generally assumed to be sourced from European stone pine (P. pinea), however, this analysis shows that imported <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are not P. pinea. The pinolenic acid content of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> is particularly interesting as it has been shown to have LDL­-lowering properties and appears to suppress hunger when eaten...|$|R
40|$|In {{the results}} of survey against {{households}} engaging in gathering and producing <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> in Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggido and Hongcheon-gun, Gangwon-do, the representative <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> producing region in Korea, {{it was found that}} average household managing land were relatively smaller as 1. 5 ha and 0. 9 ha in Gapyeong-gun and Hongcheon-gun. Among 20 households having forest in Gapyeong-gun, only 3 households conducted thinning practice during the last 5 years and any positive forest management such as forest practice for increase of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> production and silviculture and crown shape control facilitating gathering of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> was not shown. However, although the ration of income from <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> against the whole gross income took relatively large ratio as 46 % and 45 % in Gapyeong-gun and Hongcheon-gun, respectively, only 4 household of Gapyeong-gun and 2 households of Hongcheon-gun had a plan for expansion. Therefore, it was concluded that in this depressed situation of Korean forest management, review of various measures such as support of cold storage for public use to prevent price drop in flood shipment and the end of gathering and prepare price rise in the alternate year, support of hulling machines for public use to save the cost for hulling, installation and expansion of transport way for <b>pine</b> <b>nuts,</b> and purchase for price stabilization of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> would be required to make the <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> gathering and producing activity expanded as a stable income source of rural and mountain households...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, {{complaints}} were increasingly reported from consumers that experienced dysgeusia following {{the consumption of}} <b>pine</b> <b>nuts.</b> In the present study, <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> samples (N = 16) from consumers that reported dysgeusia have been analyzed to identify the botanical origin of critical <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> samples. The fatty acid composition of the samples was performed, and diagnostic index values were used to identify the botanical origin of the samples. Pinus armandii nuts were identified in all the samples pure or in mixture with P. koraiensis nuts. P. armandii is not reported as edible <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This study confirmed that consumption of P. armandii nuts may lead to dysgeusia.

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are non-wood forest {{products}} (NWFP) with a constantly growing market notwithstanding a series of phytosanitary issues and related trade problems. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the literature on the relationship between phytosanitary problems and trade development. Production and trade of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> in Mediterranean Europe have been negatively affected by the spreading of Diplodia sapinea (a fungus) associated with an adventive insect Leptoglossus occidentalis (fungal vector), with impacts on forest management, production and profitability and thus in value chain organization. Reduced availability of domestic production in markets with a growing demand has stimulated the import of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts.</b> China has become a leading exporter of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts,</b> but its export is affected by a symptom caused by the <b>nuts</b> of some <b>pine</b> species: ‘pine <b>nut</b> syndrome’ (PNS). Most of the studies mentioned in the literature review concern PNS occurrence associated with the nuts of Pinus armandii. We highlight the need for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of the <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> value chain organization, where research on food properties and clinical toxicology may be connected to breeding and forest management, forest pathology and entomology, and trade development...|$|R
