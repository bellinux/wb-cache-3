40|$|Abstract Background It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>patient</b> generates overall <b>satisfaction</b> with medical service and sub satisfaction {{on the basis}} of response to patient's trust in medical service and response to patient's attitude towards health policy in China. This study aimed to investigate the correlations between patient's trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy and <b>patient's</b> overall <b>satisfaction</b> with medical service/sub satisfaction in current medical experience and find inspiration for future reform of China's health delivery system on improving <b>patient's</b> overall <b>satisfaction</b> with medical service and sub <b>satisfaction</b> in considering <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service and patient's attitude towards health policy. Methods This study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics to collect a sample of 3, 424 residents from 17 provinces and municipalities in a 2008 China household survey on patient's trust in medical service, patient's attitude towards health policy, <b>patient's</b> overall <b>satisfaction</b> and sub satisfaction in current medical experience. Results <b>Patient's</b> overall <b>satisfaction</b> with medical service and most kinds of sub satisfaction in current medical experience were significantly influenced by both patient's trust in medical service and patient's attitude towards health policy; among all kinds of sub satisfaction in current medical experience, patient's trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy had the largest influence on <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with medical costs, the influences of patient's trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy on <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with doctor-patient interaction and satisfaction with treatment process were at medium-level, patient's trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy had the smallest influence on <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with medical facilities and hospital environment, while <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with waiting time in hospital was not influenced by patient's trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy.

Since <b>patient</b> <b>satisfaction</b> metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement.

40|$|Background: Pain {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} concerns of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA); which is severe and intolerable within 72 hours post-surgery. Appropriate pain management is a key factor in patient's early mobilization, launching physiotherapy, less hospital length of stay and more importantly, <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> New studies with the infiltration of combined analgesic agents peri and intra-articularly has shown encouraging results in pain reduction, good clinical outcome and <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic effect of locally infiltrated analgesia (I) compared with single injection femoral nerve block (F) and its impact on pain relief, <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> morphine consumption and clinical outcome. Methods: This research was a double-blind randomized clinical trial on 36 consecutive patients undergone TKA divided into group (F) in which the ipsilateral femoral nerve in the inguinal area was blocked by a single injection of 20 ml ropivacaine (10 mg/ml) and group (I) which a combination of ketorolac, ropivacaine and epinephrine was injected peri and intra-articularly on the knee during TKA. Pain intensity measured by visual analog scale (VAS), clinical outcome (based on range of motion), morphine consumption and <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> of pain management after TKA were compared between the two groups. Results: Pain intensity score (VAS) and Morphine consumption were statistically less in group I than group F during the first 6 hours and 24 hours post surgery respectively (P< 0. 05); however, group F had 12 -hour VAS score of 5 which was less than group (I) by 1 grade in pain scale (VAS) (P< 0. 05). Other parameters were not statistically different in the two groups and patients' response to our pain management protocols proved to be satisfactory in both groups. Conclusion: Lower level of pain and morphine consumption in group (I) during the first 24 hours post-surgery in contrast to group (F) and its ease of use by a surgeon intra-operatively, introduce local infiltration analgesia as an effective method to decrease the patient's pain and improve <b>patient's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in early post-surgery period after total knee arthroplasty...|$|R
