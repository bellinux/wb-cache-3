40|$|Affinity {{chromatography}} uses a biologically-related <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> as {{a stationary}} phase to undergo specific interactions with a target analyte (1 – 3). The selectivity {{of this approach}} is dependent on {{the way in which the}} <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> is attached to the support (4). It is common for a <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> such as a protein to be covalently immobilized through amine, sulfhydryl, carboxyl or carbonyl groups (4 – 6). However, covalent immobilization can produce multisite attachment or improper orientation of the <b>binding</b> <b>agent,</b> which may cause an apparent change in this agent’s activity. These issues can be minimized in some cases by coupling the <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> to the support through functional groups that occur in only a few locations in its structure, such as the use of the carbohydrate chains in antibodies or α 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP) for their site-selective attachment to hydrazide-activated supports (4, 6). Another approach to avoid these immobilization effects is to use the physical entrapment (or encapsulation) of the <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> within a support. This approach has been of interest for many years in work with materials such as sol gels and has generally been based on the physical containment of <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> in a highly cross-linked polymer network (7 – 9). However, past approaches have used materials with pressure or flow rate restrictions that are not easily amenable for use with HPLC. Also, a general entrapment approach is still needed that can be used with common HPLC supports such as porous silica...|$|R

50|$|The Solidification/Stabilization method {{utilizes}} chemically reactive formulations {{that form}} stable solids that are non-hazardous or less-hazardous {{than the original}} materials. Solidification refers to the physical changes in the contaminated material when a certain <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> is added. These changes include an increase in compressive strength, a decrease in permeability, and condensing of hazardous materials. Stabilization refers to the chemical changes between the stabilizing <b>agent</b> (<b>binding</b> <b>agent)</b> and the hazardous constituent. These changes should include a less soluble, less toxic constituent with hindered mobility. Common bonding agents include, {{but are not limited}} to, portland cement, lime, limestone, fly ash, slag, clay, and gypsum. Because of the vast types of hazardous materials, each agent should be tested on the site before a full-scale project is put under way. Most <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> used are a blend of various single <b>binding</b> <b>agents,</b> depending on the hazardous material it will be used on. Portland cement has been used to treat more contaminated material than any other S/S <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> because of its ability to bind free liquids, reduce permeability, encapsulate hazardous materials, and reduce the toxicity of certain contaminants. Lime can be used to adjust the pH of the substance of drive off water by using high heats of hydration. Limestone {{can also be used to}} adjust pH levels.

40|$|Abstract A {{procedure}} is defined for commercializing slags arising as by-products of steelmaking, {{and this is}} used to develop certain products. The outcome of the present work comprised three products or groups of products: 1) slag-based <b>binding</b> <b>agents,</b> 2) a road structure improved by means of stabilization with such <b>binding</b> <b>agents,</b> and 3) a procedure for designing stabilized structures. The commercialization procedure was drawn up by examining the technical properties of the initial materials, excluding environmental acceptability and the mechanisms of their chemical reactions. The research proceeded in stages, of which {{the first was a}} reconsideration of the results presented in the author's licentiate thesis concerning factors affecting the stabilization of road construction aggregates with blast-furnace slag-based <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> and their significance. This was followed by a series of experiments designed to test the validity of these results. At the third stage the selection of slag-based <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> was extended to include LD steel slag products, while the final stage consisted of the implementation of a set of test structures and associated preliminary experiments and monitoring measurements. The binding properties of three blast-furnace slag products and three LD steel slag products, used separately or in various combinations, were examined {{in the course of this}} work, taking cement as a reference material. Materials were then eliminated as the research proceeded, either on account of their poor binding properties or on economic grounds. The final construction experiments were performed with three combinations: cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag, LD steel slag-activated granulated blast-furnace slag and a mixture of ground granulated blast-furnace slag and cement. The actual novel product among the slag-based <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> to be introduced here is LD steel slag-activated granulated blast-furnace slag, which was found to be similar in its technical properties to cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag. Structural layers stabilized with these two <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> showed very similar bearing capacities, although the former did not reach the same compression strengths at an age of 91 days. The reasons for these similarities lay in a larger amount of <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> used when activated with LD steel slag and the greater thickness of the stabilized layer, factors which both tended to compensate for the poorer compression strength. The new information gained on the properties of cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag and the mixture of ground granulated blast-furnace slag and cement opens up fresh opportunities for selecting <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> and designing road structures. Formulae were developed here for predicting the uniaxial compression strength at 91 days, used as a stabilization criterion, from the value for a sample taken at 28 days, a technique which will speed up the assessment of stabilization results, especially when using slowly reacting slag-based <b>binding</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
