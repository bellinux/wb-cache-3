40|$|Evaluation of <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> is a <b>garment</b> {{standard}} accrediting method as to aim {{for meeting}} with the consumers' demand. This ascertains the appearance/shape retention performances of clothing. Scientists and scholars may encounter difficulties and shortages {{in the selection of}} appropriate testing and evaluation methods of <b>garment</b> <b>bagging.</b> A comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate the existing evaluation methods of <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> and to advance a novel improved evaluation method. It was noted that there are two essential factors for evaluating <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> deformation: simulation and measurement. It is important to develop objective evaluation methods and parameters to suit the practical requirement. Under such an aspiration, more practical and effective simulation methods, accurate and precious measurement should be developed along the pathway of the previous investigations.

In this study, a laser scanning system was proposed for a 3 D measurement of <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> and the advantages of this technique over conventional methods were revealed. A surface inspection method for <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> was developed; simple boundary filter, pick peaks tool, 5 point FFT smoothing and polynomial fit were applied to detect and measure the borderline of bagging deformation conditions.

40|$|Thermal <b>protective</b> <b>garment</b> {{has been}} deemed as an {{important}} shielding against fire hazard and inflammable gas leakage. The coupling model of thermal <b>protective</b> <b>garment,</b> air-gap, and human body has been widely established, but the heat transfer in air-gap was commonly simplified, resulting in inaccurate results. This paper suggests a coupling heat transfer model of the microsystem consisting of thermal <b>protective</b> <b>garment,</b> air-gap, and human body, {{taking into account the}} heat transfer of air-gap, and human skin, its numerical solution is obtained by the finite element method. The degree of skin burn could be extracted and determined from the model, and the effect of heat source, fabric thickness, and air-gap thick-ness on the degree of skin burn are investigated...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2008 ACPSEMThe {{literature}} contains both endorsements of, {{and advice}} against, {{the use of}} protective apparel in nuclear medicine procedures. The main issues usually centre around: Whether the shielding which can be provided by a <b>protective</b> <b>garment</b> light enough to wear (0 to 0. 6 mm lead equivalent at the gamma energies commonly encountered in nuclear medicine) is enough to warrant its use; and (more recently); Whether the dose enhancement behind the <b>protective</b> <b>garment</b> from electron scatter in lead is sufficient to be of concern. In this work, the Monte Carlo code EGSnrc was used to investigate the effectiveness of lead of thicknesses of 0 to 0. 6 mm, in shielding staff from photons of energies of 140 and 511 keV. Furthermore, dose escalation behind the lead was investigated. Reasonable dose reductions are obtained at 140 keV with <b>protective</b> <b>garments</b> of 0. 5 mm lead equivalence. This perhaps warrants their use, in certain circumstances. At 511 keV, the reduction in dose is less than 10 %, and their use is probably not justified (given the weight {{that has to be}} carried) from an ALARA point of view. It should be noted here that <b>protective</b> <b>garments</b> designed for X-ray shielding will generally not have the same lead equivalence at the gamma energies used in nuclear medicine. It {{should also be noted that}} <b>protective</b> <b>garments</b> which do not contain lead do not always attenuate as much as their stated lead equivalence claims. Dose escalation does occur, but the depth of penetration of the scattered electrons beyond the exit side of the lead shielding is such that it is highly unlikely that a significant dose would be delivered to viable tissue in wearers of <b>protective</b> <b>garments.</b> L.

The key parameters to control, in order to minimise the device failures due to electrostatic discharge (ESD), are peak ESD current and charge transfer in a direct discharge and device charging by induction and rubbing.
