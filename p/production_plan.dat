Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941.

5|$|The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti—People's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry) {{announced}} its 1941 <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> on 9 December 1940. Zavod Nr. 1 {{would be required}} to build a total of 3,500 in 1941. Zavod Nr. 43 in Kiev would begin construction of the MiG-3 and complete one hundred aircraft {{by the end of the}} year and Zavod Nr. 21 in Gor'kiy would start to plan construction of an upgraded version of the MiG-3, although this last program was canceled shortly afterwards. 140 were delivered in January 1941 and Zavod Nr. 1 was on pace to exceed its quota with 496 delivered in July, 562 in August and 450 in September. In October the German advance on Moscow forced the factory, and its OKO, to evacuate to Kuybyshev where production resumed under unsuitable conditions. However, shortly afterwards, Stalin sent a telegram to the directors of the plants building the Ilyushin Il-2 and the MiG-3 demanding more Il-2 production, resulting in MiG-3 production being terminated in favor of the Il-2, with a final thirty aircraft built in 1942 from spares. An additional factor in cancellation of the MiG-3 was that its Mikulin AM-35A engine was closely related to the Il-2's AM-38 allowing production to be quickly switched from one to the other.|$|E

Based on {{credibility}} {{theory and}} two-stage fuzzy optimization method, {{this paper presents}} a type of multi-product multi-period (MPMP) <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> model. Since the proposed <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem includes fuzzy variable coefficients with an infinite support, it is infinite-dimensional optimization problem. The approximation of the <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem is discussed, and the convergence of the objective value (optimal value) of the original <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem to the objective value (optimal value) of the approximating <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> problem is also considered.

25|$|Parliament granted NOK1.2 {{million to}} upgrade the mines, with the company having an {{operating}} deficit of NOK2.9 million that year. A further grant of NOK1.9 million was issued the following year. The population dropped to 72 while production was halted. In 1954 there was produced 5,000 tonnes of coal, mostly for the towns own consumption. By 1955 the estimates for continuing operation, mostly prominently the need for improved ventilation systems, reached an estimate of NOK20 million. A certain amount of production was resumed, reaching 15,000 tonnes in 1955. Parliament approved a new <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> on 20 March 1956, which set a production goal of 200,000 tonnes of coal annually. The company built a new power station, bath and a fire station, as well as additional housing. Ester I was re-opened and upgraded. Production gradually increased to 47,000 in 1958, before falling again, {{in part because of}} falling coal prices.|$|E

On November 10, 2012, President Yudhoyono gave the name Komodo to Pindad's new tactical vehicle at the Indo Defence 2012 Expo & Forum, Jakarta International Expo, Kemayoran, Jakarta.

However, the Air Force's leadership understood that its budget would not allow it to purchase enough F-15 aircraft to satisfy all of its missions. The Advanced Day Fighter concept, renamed F-XX, gained civilian political support under the reform-minded Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard, who favored the idea of competitive prototyping. As a result, in May 1971, the Air Force Prototype Study Group was established, with Boyd a key member, and two of its six proposals would be funded, one being the Lightweight Fighter (LWF).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> in manufacturing, which can be loosely defined as the problem of finding a release plan for jobs that minimizes the total cost (or maximizes the total profit). <b>Production</b> <b>planning</b> is a challenging optimization problem due to the variability in manufacturing systems and uncertainty in future demand, {{both of which have}} not been adequately addressed by existing <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> models.

2500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} March 1909. In April, Craig {{returned}} to Russia, meeting with Stanislavski in St Petersburg, {{where the company}} was on tour.

Since neither understood the other's language, they conducted their discussions {{in a mixture of}} English and German. This paired with the fact that Craig spent little time at rehearsal with the actors, caused the cast to say Craig was extremely difficult to work with. Craig spent more of his time with a built-to-scale replica of the set, where he used woodcuts of the actors to devise blocking. Craig was also highly demanding with Alisa Koonen, who played Ophelia, saying on his directions, “no actress could do it” (Innes 159).
