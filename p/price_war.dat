5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} <b>price</b> <b>war</b> caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the <b>price</b> <b>war</b> has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} {{in response to the}} opening of Gardermoen, which would allow any airline sufficient landing slots to compete with the incumbents Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Color Air commenced operations on 1 August 1998, with the two other airlines moving from Oslo Airport, Fornebu on 8 October. Following the airline's establishment, a <b>price</b> <b>war</b> broke out between it and the two incumbents. All three increased capacity and dropped prices, giving a 40% increase in seats on the dominant domestic routes and seat loads of between 30 and 50 percent. After thirteen months and NOK400 million in losses, Color Air gave up and filed for bankruptcy. The <b>price</b> <b>war</b> cost the three airlines more than NOK3 billion, and ultimately forced the other two to merge.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of the unique phenomenon of market competition, called <b>price</b> <b>wars,</b> as little is known about their nature and how they erupt. More precisely, we offer selected illustrations of the reality of <b>price</b> <b>wars,</b> identify key attributes of <b>price</b> <b>wars,</b> propose a definition of <b>price</b> <b>wars,</b> and offer a conceptual framework in which early warning signals (EWSs) of <b>price</b> <b>wars</b> are distilled and linked to the likelihood and the intensity of such wars. Also, initial empirical findings on some of the effects of <b>price</b> <b>wars</b> are offered, showing that <b>price</b> <b>wars</b> inflict substantial damage on the companies involved. Implications for researchers entail that numerous research opportunities exist to better understand <b>price</b> <b>wars</b> and to eventually develop a theory of <b>price</b> <b>wars</b> that may become a vital part of a firm's portfolio of competitive pricing strategies.

5|$|Oslo Airport, Gardermoen {{opened on}} 8 October 1998, {{replacing}} the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Trondheim using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. SAS and Braathens {{also saw the}} opportunity to increase the frequency on the route, and the three airlines between them introduced 39 daily flights. This made the route the fourth-busiest in Europe {{in terms of the}} number of aircraft. During this period, there were 84 daily departures to all destinations from Værnes. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a <b>price</b> <b>war</b> which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion.|$|E
5|$|Boeing 737-700s {{were taken}} into use {{starting}} in 1998, and the company rebranded from Braathens SAFE to Braathens. That year also saw the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which increased Braathens number of slots and allowed them {{to start a new}} route to Haugesund. Braathens started a costly <b>price</b> <b>war</b> with its competitors Color Air and SAS; after Color Air went bankrupt in 1999, Braathens started terminating routes, and the Swedish division was merged into the subsidiary Malmö Aviation. Málaga and Alicante were introduced as destinations in 2000. The next year, Braathens was bought by the SAS Group, and in 2002, the routes were split between SAS and Braathens. The latter kept only four international routes, but was granted new services to Northern Norway: Alta, Bardufoss, Kirkenes and Lakselv. Braathens was merged with SAS to create SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E

We find support for the conventional view that periods of low demand lead, through the emergence of excess capacity, to a breakdown of collusive pricing. We also find that the nature of <b>price</b> <b>wars</b> depends on the degree of excess capacity in the industry; while small amounts of excess capacity can lead firms to engage in "mild" <b>price</b> <b>wars,</b> characterized by uniform price reductions and market share stability, more "severe" <b>price</b> <b>wars,</b> characterized by <b>price</b> undercutting and market share instability, can emerge if excess capacity is sufficiently great.

5|$|From 1993 {{to early}} 1996, {{although}} Sega's revenue declined {{as part of}} an industry-wide slowdown, the company retained control of 38% of the U.S. video game market (compared to Nintendo's 30% and Sony's 24%). 800,000 PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995, compared to 400,000 Saturn units. In part due to an aggressive <b>price</b> <b>war,</b> the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two-to-one in 1996, while Sega's 16-bit sales declined markedly. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., more than twice the 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and Sega's 32-bit software were sharply reduced, while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three-to-one in the U.S. market in 1997. The 1997 release of Final Fantasy VII significantly increased the PlayStation's popularity in Japan. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47% of the console market, Nintendo controlled 40%, and Sega controlled only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases were proving helpful to the Saturn's success. Reflecting decreased demand for the system, worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2.35 million to 600,000 versus the same period in 1996; shipments in North America declined from 800,000 to 50,000. Due to the Saturn's poor performance in North America, 60 of Sega of America's 200 employees were laid off in the fall of 1997.|$|E
5|$|The airline {{was founded}} by {{shipowner}} Ludvig G. Braathen and initially flew to destinations in Asia. The original fleet consisted of Douglas aircraft; these were first used for long-haul flights, but were gradually shifted for use in medium- and short-haul charter services. The airline started domestic services in 1954, with all its scheduled routes flown domestically until 1987. However, it continued to fly charter services from both Norway and Sweden, mostly to the Mediterranean. For Norwegian routes, Braathens first used a fleet of Herons, which were replaced with the Fokker F27 from 1958. The airline became the launch customer of the Fokker F28 in 1969 and also took delivery of Boeing 737-200 aircraft. The jet aircraft were at first used for charter, but later also for domestic services. All later deliveries would consist of Boeing aircraft, and after 1977 Braathens operated only jets. Between 1986 and 1989 the airline operated only the 737-200. By 1994, {{they had all been}} replaced with 737-400 and -500. Braathens entered the Swedish internal market in 1997 by purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. This gave the airline a wider range of aircraft, including the 737-700, Fokker 100 and BAe 146. The losses suffered under a <b>price</b> <b>war</b> with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Color Air in 1998 and 1999 caused the airline to be taken over by the SAS Group in 2001. Braathens and SAS Norway merged to form SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E

When firms use this public information to monitor the collusive agreement, <b>price</b> <b>wars</b> may occur on the equilibrium path.
