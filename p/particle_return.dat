40|$|We derive a {{microscopic}} theory of glassy dynamics {{based on the}} transport of voids by micro-string motions, each of which involves particles arranged in a line hopping simultaneously displacing one another. Disorder is modeled by a random energy landscape quenched in the configuration space of distinguishable particles. We study the evolution of local regions with m coupled voids. At low temperature, energetically accessible local particle configurations can be organized into a random tree with nodes and edges denoting configurations and micro-string propagations respectively. A micro-string propagation initiated by a void can facilitate similar motions by other voids via perturbing the random energy landscape. Dynamics is dominated by coupled voids of an optimal group size, which increases as temperature decreases. We obtain explicit expressions of the particle diffusion coefficient and a <b>particle</b> <b>return</b> probability, which describe glassy behaviors at low temperature and small void density. Comparison with a distinguishable-particle lattice model (DPLM) of glass shows very good quantitative agreements using only a single adjustable parameter related to the interaction range of the micro-strings.

40|$|Highly {{cohesive}} powders aggregate into wide-size-disuibution fluidized agglomerates in fast bed, {{which can}} severely aggravate the fluidizing quality. In {{order to reduce}} the agglomerate size of highly cohesive powders in riser, "floating internals" are added into riser to cause the breakage of agglomerates. Floating internals are floated by the two-phase flow of gas and cohesive particles in riser. However, the floating internals should not be entrained into <b>particle</b> <b>return</b> system, and, should not have any reaction with powders or gas. Therefore the fast fluidization of cohesive particles with floating internals is different from the circulating fluidization of fine-coarse particle mixtures. Experiments on floating internals were conducted in a glass riser of 3. 25 m in height and 0. 075 m I. D, and four kinds of cohesive powders and floating internals were involved. Experimental results showed that appropriate matching of floating internals with cohesive particles could effectively avoid the formation of over-large agglomerates in the riser. A model has also been developed to predict the largest agglomerate size which floating internals could break under certain operating conditions. Comparing with experimental values, the predicted results of the model are reasonable and acceptable...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{combined}} impact of heterogeneous advection and mobile–immobile mass transfer on non-Fickian transport using the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW models solute transport in heterogeneous media as a random walk {{in space and}} time. Our study {{is based on a}} d-dimensional CTRW model that accounts for both heterogeneous advection and mass transfer between mobile and immobile zones, to which we also refer as solute trapping. The flow heterogeneity is mapped into the distribution of advective transition times over a characteristic heterogeneity scale. Mass transfer into immobile zones is quantified by a trapping rate and the distribution of <b>particle</b> <b>return</b> times. The total particle transition time over a characteristic heterogeneity scale then is given by the advective time and the sum of trapping times over the number of trapping events. We establish explicit integro-partial differential equations for the evolution of the concentration and discuss the relation to the multirate mass transfer approach, specifically the relation between the trapping time distribution and the memory function. We then analyze the signatures of anomalous transport due to advective heterogeneity and trapping in terms of spatial moments and first passage times or breakthrough curves. The behaviors for different disorder scenarios are analyzed analytically and through random walk particle tracking simulations. Assuming that advective mass transfer is faster than diffusive, we identify three regimes of distinct transport behaviors, which are separated by the characteristic trapping rate and trapping times. (1) At early times, we identify a pre-asymptotic time regime that is fully determined by advective heterogeneity and which is characterized by superlinear growth of longitudinal dispersion. (2) For longitudinal dispersion, we identify an intermediate regime of strong superlinear diffusion. This regime is determined by the combined effect of advective heterogeneity and trapping. (3) At larger time, the asymptotic trapping-driven regime shows the signatures of diffusion in immobile zones, which leads to both sub- and superlinear dispersion. These results shed some new light on the mechanism of non-Fickian transport and their manifestation in spatial and temporal solute distributions. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtThe support of the European Research Council (ERC) through the project MHetScale (617511) is gratefully acknowledged.
