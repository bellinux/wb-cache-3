5|$|This episode {{originated}} as {{a script}} from freelance writer Scott Kaufer, {{who was an}} acquaintance of Chris Carter and former employee of California magazine and Warner Bros comedy development department. Chris Carter rewrote the script, which included the addition of Barnett's salamander hand. Fox's standards and practices department fought with the producers over the scene where Barnett strangles Reggie Purdue, {{and as a result}} the producers were forced to reduce the length of the scene. The footage of the young girl with <b>progeria</b> was filmed after the production crew contacted the <b>Progeria</b> Society and were put in touch with the family of Courtney Arciaga, who was a young girl with the disease. She and her family were fans of the series, and were flown from their San Diego home to Vancouver to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|After {{a newborn}} baby rapidly ages into an 80-year-old man, Fringe {{division}} agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) investigate. They tie {{the case to the}} murders of young women, who have all had their pituitary glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in <b>progeria,</b> is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of <b>progeria,</b> the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
50|$|DNA repair defects {{are seen}} in {{nearly all of the}} {{diseases}} described as accelerated aging disease, in which various tissues, organs or systems of the human body age prematurely. Because the accelerated aging diseases display different aspects of aging, but never every aspect, they are often called segmental <b>progerias</b> by biogerontologists.|$|R
50|$|Victims {{of some of}} the {{so-called}} segmental <b>progerias</b> are vulnerable to different sets of diseases. Victims of Werner's syndrome suffer from osteoporosis, cataracts and cardiovascular disease, but not neurodegeneration or Alzheimer's disease. Victims of Down syndrome suffer type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, but not high blood pressure, osteoporosis or cataracts. Victims of Bloom syndrome most often die of cancer.|$|R
5000|$|Some biogerontologists {{question}} {{that such a}} thing as [...] "accelerated aging" [...] actually exists, at least partly on the grounds that all of the so-called accelerated aging diseases are segmental <b>progerias.</b> Many disease conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, etc., are associated with increased mortality. Without reliable biomarkers of aging it is hard to support the claim that a disease condition represents more than accelerated mortality.|$|R
5|$|Mutations in lamin genes {{leading to}} defects in {{filament}} assembly cause {{a group of}} rare genetic disorders known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as <b>progeria,</b> which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Progeria</b> is an {{extremely}} rare genetic disorder in which symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested {{at a very early}} age. <b>Progeria</b> is one of several progeroid syndromes. Those born with <b>progeria</b> typically live to their mid-teens to early twenties. It is a genetic condition that occurs as a new mutation, and is rarely inherited, as carriers usually do not live to reproduce. Although the term <b>progeria</b> applies strictly speaking to all diseases characterized by premature aging symptoms, and is often used as such, it is often applied specifically in reference to Hutchinson–Gilford <b>progeria</b> syndrome (HGPS).|$|E
25|$|Progeroid syndromes (PS) are a {{group of}} rare genetic {{disorders}} which mimic physiological aging, making affected individuals appear to be older than they are. The term progeroid syndrome does not necessarily imply <b>progeria</b> (Hutchinson–Gilford <b>progeria</b> syndrome), which is {{a specific type of}} progeroid syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Population ageing is {{probably}} {{the single most important}} healthcare challenge the developed and developing world will face in the 21 (st) century. This is because the later part of the human life course is marked by the emergence of a wide spectrum of pathological impairments which increase morbidity and reduce quality of life. The processes driving these increases in mortality and morbidity are often conceptualised as highly complex and multi-causal. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} there is no human 'ageing process', only distinct, disease-specific mechanisms of pathology. However, humans are not the only organisms within the biosphere to show ageing and the use of cross-species approaches has demonstrated that common ageing processes exist and allowed some of the common genetic pathways controlling them to be identified. Mutants in these pathways either delay or accelerate the development of late life diseases giving rise to extended healthy lives or <b>progerias,</b> respectively. These advances in fundamental understanding open opportunities for a more detailed investigation of the key causal mechanisms underlying ageing and the exploitation of that knowledge for improved interventions in later life...|$|R
40|$|Cockayne {{syndrome}} and other segmental <b>progerias</b> with inborn defects in DNA repair mechanisms {{are thought to}} be due in part to hypersensitivity to endogenous oxidative DNA damage. The accelerated aging-like symptoms of this disorder include dysmyelination within the central nervous system, progressive sensineuronal hearing loss and retinal degeneration. We tested the effects of congenital nucleotide excision DNA repair deficiency on acute oxidative stress sensitivity in vivo. Surprisingly, we found mouse models of Cockayne syndrome less susceptible than wild type animals to surgically induced renal ischemia reperfusion injury, a multifactorial injury mediated in part by oxidative damage. Renal failure-related mortality was significantly reduced in Csb-/-mice, kidney function was improved and proliferation was significantly higher in the regenerative phase following ischemic injury. Protection from ischemic damage correlated with improved baseline glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and a reduced inflammatory response following injury. Protection was further associated with genetic ablation of a different Cockayne syndrome-associated gene, Csa. Our data provide the first functional in vivo evidence that congenital DNA repair deficiency can induce protection from acute stress in at least one organ. This suggests that while specific types of unrepaired endogenous DNA damage may lead to detrimental effects in certain tissues, they may at the same time elicit beneficial adaptive changes in others and thus contribute to the tissue specificity of disease symptoms. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilatio...|$|R
40|$|How {{congenital}} defects causing genome instability {{can result}} in the pleiotropic symptoms reminiscent of aging but in a segmental and accelerated fashion remains largely unknown. Most segmental <b>progerias</b> are associated with accelerated fibroblast senescence, suggesting that cellular senescence is a likely contributing mechanism. Contrary to expectations, neither accelerated senescence nor acute oxidative stress hypersensitivity was detected in primary fibroblast or erythroblast cultures from multiple progeroid mouse models for defects in the nucleotide excision DNA repair pathway, which share premature aging features including postnatal growth retardation, cerebellar ataxia, and death before weaning. Instead, we report a prominent phenotypic overlap with long-lived dwarfism and calorie restriction during postnatal development (2 wk of age), including reduced size, reduced body temperature, hypoglycemia, and perturbation of the growth hormone/{{insulin-like growth factor 1}} neuroendocrine axis. These symptoms were also present at 2 wk of age in a novel progeroid nucleotide excision repair-deficient mouse model (XPD G 602 D/R 722 W /XPA /) that survived weaning with high penetrance. However, despite persistent cachectic dwarfism, blood glucose and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels returned to normal by 10 wk, with hypoglycemia reappearing near premature death at 5 mo of age. These data strongly suggest changes in energy metabolism as part of an adaptive response during the stressful period of postnatal growth. Interestingly, a similar perturbation of the postnatal growth axis was not detected in another progeroid mouse model, the double-strand DNA break repai...|$|R

25|$|Laminopathies are {{a family}} of {{diseases}} caused by mutations in nuclear lamins and include Hutchinson Gilford <b>progeria</b> syndrome and various lipodystrophies and cardiomyopathies among others.|$|E
25|$|Examples of PS include Werner {{syndrome}} (WS), Bloom syndrome (BS), Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS), Cockayne syndrome (CS), {{xeroderma pigmentosum}} (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), combined xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS), restrictive dermopathy (RD), and Hutchinson–Gilford <b>progeria</b> syndrome (HGPS). Individuals with these disorders {{tend to have}} a reduced lifespan. Progeroid syndromes have been widely studied in the fields of aging, regeneration, stem cells, and cancer. The most widely studied of the progeroid syndromes are Werner syndrome and Hutchinson–Gilford <b>progeria,</b> as they are seen to most resemble natural aging.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lamins are {{structural}} {{proteins that}} are the major determinants of nuclear architecture and play important roles in various nuclear functions including gene regulation and cell differentiation. Mutations in the human lamin A gene cause a spectrum of genetic diseases that affect specific tissues. Most available mouse models for laminopathies recapitulate disease symptoms for muscle diseases and <b>progerias.</b> However, loss of human lamin A/C also has highly deleterious effects on fetal development. Hence {{it is important to}} understand the impact of lamin A/C expression levels on embryonic differentiation pathways. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have investigated the differentiation potential of mouse embryonic stem cells containing reduced levels of lamin A/C by detailed lineage analysis of embryoid bodies derived from these cells by culture. We initially carried out a targeted disruption of one allele of the mouse lamin A/C gene (). Undifferentiated wild-type and embryonic stem cells showed similar expression of pluripotency markers and cell cycle profiles. Upon spontaneous differentiation into embryoid bodies, markers for visceral endoderm such as α-fetoprotein were highly upregulated in haploinsufficient cells. However, neuronal markers such as β-III tubulin and nestin were downregulated. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the commitment of cells into the myogenic lineage, but no discernible effects on cardiac, adipocyte or osteocyte lineages. In the next series of experiments, we derived embryonic stem cell clones expressing lamin A/C short hairpin RNA and examined their differentiation potential. These cells expressed pluripotency markers and, upon differentiation, the expression of lineage-specific markers was altered as observed with embryonic stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: We have observed significant effects on embryonic stem cell differentiation to visceral endoderm, neuronal and myogenic lineages upon depletion of lamin A/C. Hence our results implicate lamin A/C level as an important determinant of lineage-specific differentiation during embryonic development...|$|R
25|$|F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 {{short story}} The Curious Case of Benjamin Button {{is about a}} boy who was born with the {{appearance}} of a 70-year-old and who ages backwards. This short story is thought to be inspired by <b>progeria.</b> The description of the fictitious Smallweed family in the Charles Dickens' Bleak House suggests the characters suffered from <b>progeria.</b> Christopher Snow, the main character in Dean Koontz's Moonlight Bay Trilogy, suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum, as does Luke from the 2002 novel Going Out by Scarlett Thomas.|$|E
25|$|The recent {{progress}} in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of toxic progerin formation in laminopathies leading to premature aging {{has opened up}} {{the potential for the}} development of targeted treatment. The farnesylation of prelamin A and its pathological form progerin is carried out by the enzyme farnesyl transferase. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can be used effectively to reduce symptoms in two mouse model systems for <b>progeria</b> and to revert the abnormal nuclear morphology in progeroid cell cultures. Two oral FTIs, lonafarnib and tipifarnib, are already in use as anti-tumor medication in humans and may become avenues of treatment for children suffering from laminopathic <b>progeria.</b> Nitrogen-containing bisphosphate drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis reduce farnesyldiphosphate production and thus prelamin A farnesylation. Testing of these drugs may prove them to be useful in treating <b>progeria</b> as well. The use of antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit progerin synthesis in affected cells is another avenue of current research into the development of anti-progerin drugs.|$|E

25|$|<b>Progeria</b> and Werner {{syndrome}} {{are both}} single-gene genetic diseases that cause acceleration of many or most symptoms of ageing. The {{fact that a}} single gene malfunction can cause similar effects on many different manifestations of ageing suggests a common mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Some {{segmental}} progeroid syndromes, such as Werner syndrome (WS), Bloom syndrome (BS), Rothmund-Thomson syndromes (RTS) {{and combined}} xeroderma pigmentosa-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS), {{are associated with}} an increased risk of developing cancer in the affected individual; two exceptions are Hutchinson–Gilford <b>progeria</b> (HGPS) and Cockayne syndrome.|$|E

Taiyou no Uta, a 2006 Japanese film, features Kaoru Amane (portrayed by Yui), a 16-year-old girl suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson–Gilford <b>progeria</b> {{syndrome}} (HGPS) and restrictive dermopathy (RD) are two PS {{caused by}} a defect in lamin A/C, which is encoded by the LMNA gene. Lamin A is a major nuclear component that determines the shape and integrity of the nucleus, by acting as a scaffold protein that forms a filamentous meshwork underlying the inner nuclear envelope, the membrane that surrounds the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Laminopathies {{and other}} nuclear envelopathies {{have a large}} variety of {{clinical}} symptoms including skeletal and/or cardiac muscular dystrophy, lipodystrophy and diabetes, dysplasia, dermo- or neuropathy, leukodystrophy, and <b>progeria</b> (premature aging). Most of these symptoms develop after birth, typically during childhood or adolescence. Some laminopathies however may lead to an early death, and mutations of lamin B (LMNB1 gene) may be lethal before or at birth.|$|E
25|$|Bachchan's first {{release of}} 2009 was Delhi-6, which {{received}} a lukewarm response from critics. Later that {{year he was}} seen in the family dramedy Paa, which he also produced. The film's plot centered on a boy (Amitabh Bachchan) who suffers from <b>progeria</b> whose parents were played by Abhishek Bachchan and Vidya Balan. For his work as a producer on the film, Bachchan earned the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson–Gilford <b>progeria</b> {{syndrome}} {{is an extremely}} rare developmental autosomal dominant condition, characterized by premature and accelerated aging (~7 times the normal rate) beginning at childhood. It affects 1 in ~4 million newborns; over 130 cases {{have been reported in}} the literature since the first described case in 1886. The mean age of diagnosis is ~3 years and the mean age of death is ~13 years. The cause of death is usually myocardial infarction, caused by the severe hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis). There is currently no treatment available.|$|E
25|$|If DNA {{damage is}} the {{underlying}} cause of aging, it would be expected that humans with inherited defects {{in the ability to}} repair DNA damages should age at a faster pace than persons without such a defect. Numerous examples of rare inherited conditions with DNA repair defects are known. Several of these show multiple striking features of premature aging, and others have fewer such features. Perhaps the most striking premature aging conditions are Werner syndrome (mean lifespan 47 years), Huchinson-Gilford <b>Progeria</b> (mean lifespan 13 years), and Cockayne syndrome (mean lifespan 13 years).|$|E
25|$|Mutations causing <b>progeria</b> are {{defective}} in splicing LMNA mRNA, therefore producing abnormal lamin A protein, {{also known}} as progerin. The mutations activate a cryptic splice site within exon 11 of the gene, thereby causing the deletion of the processing site on prelamin A. This results in an accumulation of progerin that is unable to mature into lamin A, leading to misshapen nuclei. Missplicing also leads to the complete or partial loss of exon 11 and results in a truncated prelamin A protein in the neonatal lethal tight skin contracture syndrome.|$|E

500|$|In 2009 Vidya {{played the}} role of an unwed {{gynaecologist}} struggling with her 12-year-old son's <b>progeria</b> syndrome, in the R. Balki-directed dramedy Paa. Amitabh Bachchan {{played the role}} of Vidya's son and Abhishek Bachchan played the title character. A critical and commercial success, the film {{has been described as a}} major turning point in her career. Sukanya Verma compared her acting style to that of Dimple Kapadia and noted, [...] "Balan is poignant yet restrained and projects an impressive figure of grace and integrity"; Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India further argued that Vidya was successful in lending a [...] "rare dignity to the image of the Bollywood mom." [...] Her portrayal garnered her several awards, including a Filmfare Award for Best Actress and a Screen Award for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|From 2009 to 2012, Vidya {{starred in}} five {{consecutive}} films that garnered her widespread praise. In the 2009 comedy-drama Paa, Vidya starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan {{as the mother}} of a child afflicted with <b>progeria.</b> She played a seductress in Abhishek Chaubey's black comedy Ishqiya (2010), and portrayed the real-life character of Sabrina Lal in the semi-biographical thriller No One Killed Jessica (2011). Also in 2011, she played film actress Silk in the biopic The Dirty Picture, which earned her the National Film Award for Best Actress. Vidya next played a vengeful pregnant woman in Kahaani (2012), a thriller directed by Sujoy Ghosh. She was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her roles in Paa, The Dirty Picture, and Kahaani, and the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress for Ishqiya.

500|$|Olivia and Peter turn to {{an expert}} in <b>progeria,</b> Dr. Penrose (Mark Blum), to trying {{to learn more about}} rapid aging, but Dr. Penrose cannot help them further, though Peter {{suspects}} he is hiding something. Unseen by the Fringe division, Dr. Penrose visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer, Christopher (Derek Cecil), his son, who suffers from rapid aging syndrome. Penrose warns Christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process. [...] By this time, Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as Olivia's serial murderer. At Walter's lab, they identify the pituitary gland has been removed. They rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process. [...] Walter hypothesizes they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman's optical nerves induced by the paralyzing sedative. Borrowing an electronic pulse camera from Massive Dynamic, they discover the image of a suspension bridge near Stoughton and identify the likely location from which it was viewedthe same warehouse that Dr. Penrose visited. The FBI converge on the building, and Olivia and Peter find Penrose about to cut into another victim. Olivia chases off after Christopher, who eventually succumbs to his rapid aging and dies, while Peter, after nicking Penrose with a bullet, confers with Walter to apply a makeshift defibrillator to bring the victim back to life.|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script very much, and I think I stayed fairly close to the {{original}} draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with <b>progeria.</b> In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
