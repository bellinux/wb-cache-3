5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{photographic}} societies such as Danske Kamera Piktorialister (Danish Camera Pictorialists) in the 1930s, there was increasing pressure from activists such as H.B.J. Cramer to have photography recognized as an art form. Indeed, the movement continued {{right up to the}} 1970s. A counter-movement to <b>pictorialism,</b> the 1920s' Neue Sachlichkeit was slow to reach Denmark but surfaced in 1948 when Keld Helmer-Petersen published his abstract colour studies in 122 Colour Photographs.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of <b>pictorialism</b> to Irving, {{and to other}} theatre professionals of the Victorian era, is exemplified {{by the fact that}} Irving had used Ford Madox Brown's painting Cordelia's Portion as the inspiration for the look of his production, and that the artist himself was brought in to provide sketches for the settings of other scenes. A reaction against <b>pictorialism</b> came with the rise of the reconstructive movement, believers in a simple style of staging more similar to that which would have pertained in renaissance theatres, whose chief early exponent was the actor-manager William Poel. Poel was influenced by a performance of King Lear directed by Jocza Savits at the Hoftheater in Munich in 1890, set on an apron stage with a three-tier Globe-like reconstruction theatre as its backdrop. Poel would use this same configuration for his own Shakespearean performances in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Josef Jindřich Šechtl had a {{wide variety}} of {{interests}} in photography, including portrait photography, photojournalism, documenting changes in the town of Tábor, photography of architecture, film, color photography using the Autochrome process, street photography using an early Leica camera, and fine art photography influenced by photographic <b>pictorialism</b> (including use of the bromoil process).|$|E
25|$|At first, {{fine art}} photographers tried to imitate {{painting}} styles. This movement is called <b>Pictorialism,</b> often using soft focus for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, Ansel Adams, and others formed the Group f/64 to advocate 'straight photography', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself {{and not an}} imitation of something else.|$|E
25|$|Weston {{was born}} in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21. He {{knew he wanted to}} be a {{photographer}} from an early age, and initially his work was typical of the soft focus <b>pictorialism</b> that was popular at the time. Within a few years, however, he abandoned that style and went on to be one of the foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images.|$|E
25|$|After {{the decline}} in {{popularity}} of the <b>Pictorialism</b> movement the new style of photographic Modernism came into vogue, and the public's interest shifted to more sharply focused images. Edward Steichen, Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston {{were among the first}} photographers considered pioneers of low-key photography. Steichen's portrait of J.P. Morgan (1903), Pastoral – Moonlight (1907), published in Camera Work No 20, Cunningham's Succulent (1920) and Weston's Pepper No. 30 (1930) are considered the earliest low-key photographs.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} of income for the studio however {{remained}} its studio work, in which Josef Jindřich excelled: despite the provincial location of the studio, his works were comparable with those of the best Czech portrait studios. His work is influenced by photographic <b>pictorialism.</b> He used various visual aids and decorations to help express the personality of his subjects, often with a gentle sense of humor. His skilful use of light and contrast with shadows achieved stunning visual effects.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Stieglitz became {{increasingly}} intrigued {{with a more}} modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware {{of what was going}} on in avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that <b>pictorialism</b> no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter Charles Sheeler and by photographer Paul Strand. In 1915, Strand, who had been coming to see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz was one of the first to see the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of Camera Work to his photographs.|$|E

The exhibit launches the movement called <b>Pictorialism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{collection}} includes work {{covering all}} major movements and historical trends. [...] Particular strengths include nineteenth-century British photography, French {{photographs of the}} 1850s-1870s, and Japanese and American postwar photography. [...] The Museum has major holdings in <b>Pictorialism,</b> anchored by the Clarence H. White collection and the archives of his eponymous school of photography. [...] In 1976, Minor White bequeathed to the Museum his negatives, library, correspondence, and close to 20,000 prints {{of his own and}} other artists. [...] Other archives held by the Museum include those of Ruth Bernhard and William B. Dyer.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 {{he visited}} his sister May, {{who had moved}} to Middletown, Ohio. While there he made five or six {{photographs}} of the tall smoke stacks at the nearby Armco steel mill. These images signaled a change in Weston's photographic style, a transition from the soft-focus <b>pictorialism</b> of the past to a new, cleaner-edge style. He immediately recognized the change and later recorded it in his notes: [...] "The Middletown visit was something to remember…most of all in importance was my photographing of 'Armco'…That day I made great photographs, even Stieglitz thought they were important!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Consuelo Kanaga {{has been}} called [...] "one of America's most transcendent yet, surprisingly, least-known photographers." [...] She had {{a wide range of}} visual interests, from <b>pictorialism</b> to photojournalism to {{portraiture}} to cityscape to still lifes. It's been said that the dominant theme in her work is an [...] "abiding interest in, and engagement with, the American scene." [...] She celebrated the human in every photo she took, whether it was images of sharecroppers and their homes in the South or found still lifes of flowers and curtains. She was also noted as a technician of the highest skills in the darkroom.|$|E

[...] In 1957, he wrote a Seventeenth String Quartet, whose austerity of technique and emotional intensity [...] "provide a eulogy to his craft". [...] His Benedita Sabedoria, a sequence of a cappella chorales written in 1958, is a similarly simple setting of Latin biblical texts. [...] These works lack the <b>pictorialism</b> of his more public music.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} advance his own {{knowledge}} of photography {{and to encourage}} others in his small home town, in 1898 White brought together a group of 10 local people to form the Newark Camera Club. All of its members, including White at that time, were amateur photographers who shared an active interest in <b>pictorialism,</b> but it was White's leadership that soon propelled the club's influence far beyond {{a small town in}} Ohio. Ema Spencer, a club member and later member of the Photo-Secession wrote that the club [...] "was known in photographic circles here and abroad as 'the White School', a reflection of White's stature and prominence. A goal of the Club was to have at least one major show of its members' work each year, but also to show the work of [...] "photographers from the east as well as abroad, so their own work would profit from the examination and comparison." ...|$|E
2500|$|In many respects, the Victorian era {{continued}} until {{the outbreak of}} World War I in 1914, and the Royal Academy became increasingly ossified; the unmistakably late Victorian figure of Frank Dicksee was appointed President in 1924. In photography <b>Pictorialism</b> aimed to achieve artistic indeed painterly effects; The Linked Ring contained the leading practitioners. [...] The American John Singer Sargent was the most successful London portraitist {{at the start of}} the 20th century, with John Lavery, Augustus John and William Orpen rising figures. [...] John's sister Gwen John lived in France, and her intimate portraits were relatively little appreciated until decades after her death. [...] British attitudes to modern art were [...] "polarized" [...] at the end of the 19th century. Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by [...] "many conservative critics" [...] as a [...] "subversive foreign influence", but became [...] "fully assimilated" [...] into British art during the early-20th century. The London-born Irish artist Jack Butler Yeats (1871–1957), was based in Dublin, at once a romantic painter, a symbolist and an expressionist.|$|E
2500|$|A {{little more}} than a year later, Stieglitz, sensing a growing number of photographers who held his same beliefs about the artistry of the medium, founded the Photo-Secession, the first {{organization}} in America to promote <b>pictorialism</b> and fine art photography. He invited White and 10 others to become [...] "charter members", although Stieglitz himself strictly controlled what the group did. Immediately Stieglitz began planning how to best advance the work of his new organization, and within a short while he organized an exhibition of the groups' photographs, including several by White, [...] at the National Arts Club. Soon thereafter Stieglitz created another new magazine he called Camera Work to further display the work of the Photo-Secessionists. White had five of his photographs reproduced in the July 1903 issue and five more in January 1905. To be included in Camera Work and to be a member of the Photo-Secession meant that White was one of the inner circle of Stieglitz's friends at a time when Stieglitz was considered to be one of the top promoters of art photography in the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>pictorialism</b> from the 19th century {{well into the}} 1940s was both slow and determined. From its roots in Europe it spread to the U.S. {{and the rest of}} the world in several semi-distinct stages. Prior to 1890 <b>pictorialism</b> emerged through advocates who were mainly in England, Germany, Austria and France. During the 1890s the center shifted to New York and Stieglitz's multi-faceted efforts. By 1900 <b>pictorialism</b> had reached countries around the world, and major exhibitions of pictorial photography were held in dozens of cities.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pictorialism</b> had, for {{the most}} part, run its course, {{but in the early}} part of the 21st century it is now more popular than ever [...] Adolf Fassbender, a 20th-century {{photographer}} who continued to make pictorial photographs well into the 1960s, believed that <b>pictorialism</b> is eternal because it is based upon beauty first. He wrote [...] "There is no solution in trying to eradicate <b>pictorialism</b> for one would then have to destroy idealism, sentiment and all sense of art and beauty. There will always be pictorialism." ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{dominated}} {{primarily by}} German influences {{in the late}} 19th century, <b>Pictorialism</b> caught on in Norway when it did {{elsewhere in the world}} and was promoted by Oslo camera club, founded in 1921.

5000|$|As {{in other}} countries, {{opposing}} viewpoints engaged {{a wider range}} of photographers in defining what <b>pictorialism</b> meant. , [...] and Heinrich Kühn formed an organization called Das Kleeblatt (The Trilfolium) expressly to increase the exchange of information with other organizations in other countries, especially, France, Germany and the United States. Initially a small, informal group, Das Kleeblatt increased it influence in the Wiener Camera-Klub through its international connections, and several other organizations promoting <b>pictorialism</b> were created in other cities throughout the region. As in other countries, interest in <b>pictorialism</b> faded after World War I, and eventually most of the Austrian organization slipped into obscurity during the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|From {{an artistic}} {{point of view}} one might {{consider}} him {{as a representative of}} the generation of '98 in photography, but he is also often included within the photographic movement of <b>pictorialism,</b> being in fact the best known representative of the Spanish photographic <b>pictorialism,</b> even though this late definition never liked to Ortiz-Echagüe. His photographic work focuses on portraying the most defining characteristics of a people, their customs and their traditional costumes as well as locations. He managed to project through his pictures a personal expression which is closer to painting, often using effects during photo processing. Echagüe remained faithful throughout his life to the aesthetics and techniques of <b>pictorialism,</b> including using gum bichromate and coal.|$|E
5000|$|These debates {{reached their}} peak {{during the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, {{culminating}} in the creation of a movement that is usually characterized as a particular style of photography: <b>pictorialism.</b> This style is defined first by a distinctly personal expression that emphasizes photography's ability to create visual beauty rather than simply record facts. However, recently historians have recognized that <b>pictorialism</b> is more than just a visual style. It evolved in direct context with the changing social and cultural attitudes of the time, and, as such, it should not be characterized simply as a visual trend. One writer has noted that <b>pictorialism</b> was [...] "simultaneously a movement, a philosophy, an aesthetic and a style." ...|$|E

50|$|One of the {{key figures}} in {{establishing}} both the definition and direction of <b>pictorialism</b> was American Alfred Stieglitz, who began as an amateur but quickly made the promotion of <b>pictorialism</b> his profession and obsession. Through his writings, his organizing and his personal efforts to advance and promote pictorial photographers, Stieglitz was a dominant figure in <b>pictorialism</b> from its beginnings to its end. Following {{in the footsteps of}} German photographers, in 1892 Stieglitz established a group he called the Photo-Secession in New York. Stieglitz hand-picked the members of the group, and he tightly controlled what it did and when it did it. By selecting photographers whose vision was aligned with his, including Gertrude Käsebier, Eva Watson-Schütze, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Edward Steichen, and Joseph Keiley, Stieglitz built a circle of friends who had enormous individual and collective influence over the movement to have photography accepted as art. Stieglitz also continually promoted <b>pictorialism</b> through two publications he edited, Camera Notes and Camera Work and by establishing and running a gallery in New York that for many years exhibited only pictorial photographers (the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession).|$|E
