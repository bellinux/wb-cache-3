50|$|Specialized {{plumbing}} tools include pipe wrenches, flaring pliers, pipe vise, {{pipe bending}} machine, <b>pipe</b> <b>cutter,</b> dies and joining {{tools such as}} soldering torches and crimp tools. New tools {{have been developed to}} help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or problems, they use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>pipe</b> <b>cutters.</b> Plastic tubing cutters, which really look much like a pair of pruning shears, may be used for thinner pipes and tubes, such as {{sprinkler}} pipe. For use on thicker pipes, there is a pipecutter with a sharp wheel and adjustable jaw grips. These are used by rotating it around the pipe and repeatedly tightening it until it cuts all of the way through.|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} {{base of the}} college began to develop in 1957 in form of staff re-training and partial replenishment of workshop equipment. In 1960 technical facilities were expended with smithy operation and increasing production volumes. The first product of the college - <b>pipe</b> <b>cutters</b> supplied to {{many parts of the}} Soviet Union. Since 1967, when the college became a professional industry institution (under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering of the Ukrainian SSR), technical workshops concentrated mainly on requirements of [...] "Drohobych Drilling Plant" [...] including nozzle drill (chisel) bits [...] "244.5 OK - PV", [...] "TC SH2699 - PGV", bits covers [...] "C - Wildebeest". Workshops were replenished with new equipment, dramatically improving the quality of students' practical training.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than actual}} smoking equipment, many other items are {{associated}} with smoking; cigarette cases, cigar boxes, lighters, matchboxes, cigarette holders, cigar holders, ashtrays, silent butlers, <b>pipe</b> cleaners, tobacco <b>cutters,</b> match stands, <b>pipe</b> tampers, cigarette companions and so on. Some examples of these have become valuable collector items and particularly ornate and antique items can fetch high prices.|$|R
5000|$|A Lally {{column is}} a round {{thin-walled}} structural steel column oriented vertically {{to provide support}} to beams or timbers stretching over long spans. The steel shell of a Lally column is filled with concrete, which carries {{a share of the}} compression load, and helps prevent local buckling of the shell. The advantage of a Lally column over conventional structural steel is the ability to cut it to length on a construction site with simple hand tools such as a plumber’s <b>pipe</b> <b>cutter</b> or a reciprocating saw. Lally columns are generally not as strong or durable as conventional structural steel columns. The term [...] "lally column" [...] is sometimes incorrectly used in reference to other types of prefabricated steel columns.|$|E
5000|$|The Hughes Amendment {{affected}} only machine guns. All other NFA firearms {{are still}} legal for manufacture and registration by civilians under Form 1, and {{transfer of registration}} to civilians under Form 4 (though some states have their own laws governing which NFA firearms are legal to own there). Silencers and Short Barreled Rifles are generally the most popular NFA firearms among civilians, followed by Short Barrel Shotguns, Destructive Devices, and [...] "Any Other Weapons". While most NFA firearms are bought from manufacturers and transferred to civilians through a dealer, many are made by the civilians themselves after filing a Form 1 and paying the $200 manufacturing tax. In some cases the manufacture is simple (i.e., using a <b>pipe</b> <b>cutter</b> to shorten a shotgun barrel), and sometimes quite complex.|$|E
40|$|As {{anyone who}} has ever fixed things around the house can attest, the right tool at the right time is the {{difference}} between happiness and accomplishment versus frustration and swearing. That <b>pipe</b> <b>cutter</b> or that torque wrench seemingly so well designed for the task at hand becomes almost a friend for the dedicated plumber or the weekend mechanic. And the effect is not restricted to mundane tasks; just ask any surgeon or astronaut. While the scalpel does not make the surgeon, it does enable him or her {{to take full advantage of}} natural and acquired skills that would otherwise be nearly impossible to exercise. Judging from that point of view, software tools to design and develop user interfaces (UIs) are more likely to lead to swearing than to accomplishment. If we open the toolbox of a prototypical UI designer at a prototypical UI garage, if there is such a thing, this is what we would find: Microsoft Word, Visio, an...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} specific face-mask removal tools during football helmet face-mask retraction using 3 -dimensional (3 -D) video. Design and Setting: Four different tools were used: the anvil pruner (AP), polyvinyl chloride <b>pipe</b> <b>cutters</b> (PVC), Face Mask (FM) Extractor (FME), and Trainer 2 ̆ 7 s Angel (TA). Subjects retracted a face mask once with each tool. Subjects: Eleven certified athletic trainers served as subjects and were recruited from among local sports medicine professionals. Measurements: We analyzed a sample of movement by 3 -D techniques during the retraction process. Movement of the head in 3 planes and time to retract the face mask were also assessed. All results were analyzed with a simple repeated-measures one-way multivariate analysis of variance. An overall efficiency score was calculated for each tool. Results: The AP allowed subjects to perform the face-mask removal task the fastest. Face mask removal with the AP was significantly faster than with the PVC and TA and significantly faster with the TA than the PVC. The PVC and AP created significantly more movement than the FME and TA when planes were combined. No significant differences were noted among tools for flexion-extension, rotation, or lateral flexion. The AP had an efficiency score of 14; FME, 15; TA, 18; and PVC, 35. Conclusions: The subjects performed the face-mask removal task in {{the least amount of}} time with the AP. They completed the task with the least amount of combined movement using the FME. The AP and FME had nearly identical overall efficiency scores for movement and time...|$|R

40|$|The Hanford Site C Reactor Technology Demonstration Group {{demonstrated}} the High-Speed Clamshell <b>Pipe</b> <b>Cutter</b> technology, developed and marketed by Tri Tool Inc. (Rancho Cordova, California). The models demonstrated are portable, split-frame pipe lathes that require minimal radial and axial clearances for severing and/or beveling in-line pipe with ranges of 25 cm to 41 cm and 46 cm to 61 cm nominal diameter. The radial clearance requirement from the walls, floors, or adjacent pipes is 18 cm. The lathes were supplied with carbide insert conversion kits for the cutting bits for the high-speed technique that was demonstrated. Given site-specific factors, this demonstration showed {{the cost of}} the improved technology to be approximately 30 % higher than the traditional (baseline) technology (oxyacetylene torch) cost of $ 14, 400 for 10 cuts of contaminated 41 -cm and 61 -cm-diameter pipe at C Reactor. Actual cutting times were faster than the baseline technology; however, moving/staging the equipment took longer. Unlike the baseline torch, clamshell lathes do not involve applied heat, flames, or smoke and can be operated remotely, thereby helping personal exposures to be as low as reasonably achievable. The baseline technology was demonstrated at the C Reactor north and south water pipe tunnels August 19 [...] 22, 1997. The improved technology was demonstrated in the gas pipe tunnel December 15 [...] 19...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} {{the amount of}} helmet movement, time for task completion, tool satisfaction, and overall efficiency for various face-mask removal tools during football helmet face-mask removal. Design and Setting: Each subject performed one trial with the anvil pruner (AP), Face Mask Extractor (FME), PVC <b>pipe</b> <b>cutter</b> (PVC), and Trainer 2 ̆ 7 s Angel (TA). Each subject cut through 4 loop straps and removed the face mask while kneeling behind the athlete 2 ̆ 7 s head. Subjects: Twenty-nine certified athletic trainers (age 29. 5 +/- 6. 2 years, athletic training experience = 6. 3 +/- 5. 0 years). Measurements: Time {{to complete the task}} was recorded. Total range of motion and total movement of the helmet were assessed using a 6 -camera, 3 -dimensional motion-capture system. Satisfaction scores were measured for each subject for each tool. Efficiency scores were calculated using time and total helmet-movement data. Results: When using the FME, subjects were significantly faster than with all other tools (P 3 ̆c. 05), and when using the AP and TA, they were significantly faster than with the PVC. No differences were noted between tools in either movement variable. Significant differences were noted for satisfaction (P 3 ̆c. 05) for all comparisons except TA versus AP. Efficiency scores were FME, 11. 6; AP, 14. 3; TA, 14. 5; and PVC, 22. 9, with lower scores identifying increased efficiency. Conclusions: In general, subjects using the FME were superior in all variables except the movement variables. Future researchers should assess the removal task using specific protocols to determine whether the tools truly differ in terms of the movement created...|$|E
