50|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are the most}} effective for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive {{displacement pumps}} are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|E

50|$|Diesel exhaust {{contains}} {{relatively high}} levels of particulate matter (soot), consisting largely of elemental carbon. Catalytic converters cannot clean up elemental carbon, though they do remove up to 90 percent of the soluble organic fraction, so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or diesel particulate filter (DPF). Historically, a DPF consists of a cordierite or silicon carbide substrate with a geometry that forces the exhaust flow through the substrate walls, leaving behind trapped soot particles. Contemporary DPFs can be manufactured {{from a variety of}} rare metals that provide superior performance (at a greater expense). As the amount of soot trapped on the DPF increases, so does the back pressure in the exhaust system. <b>Periodic</b> <b>regenerations</b> (high temperature excursions) are required to initiate combustion of the trapped soot and thereby reducing the exhaust back pressure. The amount of soot loaded on the DPF prior to regeneration may also be limited to prevent extreme exotherms from damaging the trap during regeneration. In the U.S., all on-road light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after January 1, 2007, must meet diesel particulate emission limits, meaning that they effectively have to be equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. Note that this applies only to the diesel engine used in the vehicle. As long as the engine was manufactured before January 1, 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007. During the re-generation cycle, most systems require the engine to consume more fuel in a relatively short amount of time in order to generate the high temperatures necessary for the cycle to complete. This adversely affects the overall fuel economy of vehicles equipped with DPF systems, especially in vehicles that are driven mostly in city conditions where frequent acceleration requires a larger amount of fuel to be burned and therefore more soot to collect in the exhaust system.|$|R
50|$|Particulate matter (mainly carbon) {{that is not}} {{burned in}} the power stroke is wasted energy. Stricter {{regulations}} on particulate matter (PM) call for further emission controls to be introduced {{to compensate for the}} PM emissions increase caused by EGR. The most common is a diesel particulate filter in the exhaust system which cleans the exhaust but causes a constant minor reduction in fuel efficiency due to the back pressure created. The nitrogen dioxide component of NOx emissions is the primary oxidizer of the soot caught in the DPF at normal operating temperatures. This process is known as passive regeneration. Increasing EGR rates cause passive regeneration to be less effective at managing the PM loading in the DPF. This necessitates <b>periodic</b> active <b>regeneration</b> of the DPF by burning diesel fuel in the oxidation catalyst in order to significantly increase exhaust gas temperatures through the DPF to the point where PM is quickly burned by the residual oxygen in the exhaust.|$|R

The negative effect of concentration polarization {{on the process}} of separation of the filtered liquid and on the membrane surface is described (due to the increase in concentration, the selectivity and specific productivity of the membrane surface decrease). The physical picture of the flowing phenomena in a flat membrane channel with known geometric dimensions is considered, four sections with different effects on the filtration process are identified. The equation of material balance is analyzed by introducing boundary conditions into the criterion equation of material balance, with the aim of finding opportunities for mass transfer. It is revealed that the mass transfer coefficient km decreases, due to the growth of the thickness of the boundary layer. The main parameters significantly influencing the process of microfiltration are the flow rates G of the initial solution, the mass transfer coefficient km, and with decreasing km decreases and G. The analysis of theoretical and experimental data is carried out showing that the decisive role {{in the course of the}} microfiltration process is played by the motion regime of the initial solution, Physical-chemical properties, geometry of the membrane channel. The prospects for using the pulsating field in bioreactors and the need for a conceptual approach for the development of promising membrane devices are grounded. The need to create membranes of complex geometric shapes with the possibility of placing turbulent devices in them and the possibility of moving them relative to each other is considered, creating channels of variable cross-section, which will lead to the appearance of a sufficient number of possibilities for creating hydrodynamic instabilities of various intensities.

Increasing concerns regarding the two main pollutants from Diesel engines, NOx and PM, started a progressive process of tightening of emission limits; Tier 2 (USA) and Euro 5 b/ 6 (Europe) emissions regulations will definitively bring down NOx and PM, with also {{the introduction of new}} limitations such as, for instance, on PN emissions. Efficient and reliable after-treatment technologies for NOx and PM control are going to be necessary. PN emissions from a modern diesel engine were characterized by means of a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS); in addition, the performance of an Advanced Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (A-DOC), with low temperature NOx trapping capability, and a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) were assessed. PN emissions were evaluated under normal engine operating mode, as well as under DPF regeneration mode; unimodal distribution were found at both engine outlet and DOC outlet, without any effects of DOC on the emitted particles; conversely DPF reduction efficiency up to 2 orders of magnitude were observed, thus confirming the potential of DPF to be effective also on these small particles. PN emissions were found to increase during DPF regeneration, but it was shown that both DOC and DPF were effective in reducing PN under similar operating conditions. PN emissions were also evaluated during engine warm-up. A new experimental methodology, able to provide fundamental information about the soot loading process inside the DPF, was adopted to load small lab-size SiC DPF samples; advanced electron microscopy provided highly detailed images of soot deposited onto channel walls. While morphology of deposited soot and its compressibility characteristics were found in agreement with previous studies, it was shown that soot did not penetrate into channel walls, differently from what is reported in literature; conversely, a soot cake layer was taking place immediately. Finally, A-DOC technology was tested over NEDC. Reduction of NOx was found to be significantly high, especially during the urban driving; spontaneous release of stored NOx (without <b>periodic</b> rich <b>regeneration</b> such as for LNTs) was observed at high exhaust temperatures typical of extra-urban driving, highlighting the potential for a combined application with a downstream SCR system.

In contrast with much optimization work pertaining to spatially contiguous maintenance works, its principal economic emphasis and objective focus are centered on the optimal allocation of current maintenance and periodic renewal expenses, on their yearly distribution among large network partitions, and on infrastructure pricing. The model equations are based on very simple assumptions of infrastructure degradation laws and on a manager's objective function optimized through optimal control procedures. Equations are tested on national French rail track segment databases using Box–Cox transformations and match rail regeneration and maintenance practices prevailing in France.

There is some concern that the small numbers of parents used in early regeneration cycles may have reduced variability so that the accessions may not contain all of the variability present in the original population. The degree of diversity in five maize germplasm accessions as a function of isozyme polymorphism was determined and allelic frequencies examined following several cycles of regeneration. A statistical procedure was used to test whether the observed allelic frequency variation from cycle to cycle of regeneration was consistent with that predicted by the hypothesis of drift acting alone or if a linear trend indicated possible selection.

40|$|Historically, lowland totara was {{a common}} forest tree {{throughout}} much of lowland New Zealand but is now confined to small, mainly protected, areas usually as the dominant species in mixed podocarp forest with matai and kahikatea. Lowland podocarp forest has suffered the most extensive reduction of all New Zealand forest types, with only circa 1 % of the original forest cover remaining. The lowland totara dominated stands remaining therefore represent an highly fragmented population with relatively few individuals, making the collection of large data sets difficult. Sample sizes are small in some stands due to the limited area of to tara dominated forest (circa 1 hectare). The present study aims to describe the natural extent of lowland totara forest, document its reduction and current status, and {{to provide for the}} long-term survival of this species in the now fragmented forest environment. Literature relating to the ecology of Podocarpus totara is reviewed with respect to vegetative morphology and growth, reproductive biology, timber properties and· utilisation, and population dynamics. The ecological niche of lowland totara is defined, examining site characteristics and soil type. The distribution of lowland totara dominated stands is a function of several interlinked site characteristics such as climate, landform, drainage, disturbance regime, soil type, and altitude. Lowland totara appears to be confined to semi-fertile or fertile soils which are the result of landform and disturbance e. g. flood events on a river plain. Stand descriptions identify lowland totara forest as ranging from pure totara, to totara - matai, to totara - matai - kahikatea, to dense mixedpodocarps. The relative proportions of totara, matai, and kahikatea appear to be due to edaphic features such as fertility and drainage. In dense mixed podocarp forest, totara is confined in small populations to optimal sites such as terraces and ridges. The podocarps have differing nutrient, light, and disturbance regime requirements and these factors work together to partition the environment into optimal areas for the regeneration and persistence of each species. Totara dominated stands require high light to initiate and capture a high fertility site, and relatively free-draining ABSTRACT 3 fertile soils to remain dominant. Sub-optimal totara sites will see the dominance of other species such as rimu. Totara and kahlkatea dominate in catastrophically disturbed areas, miro responds to medium levels of disturbance such as tree fall, and rimu dominates in areas subject to continual disturbance such as canopy collapse. Regeneration of lowland totara dominated forest is seen to be a consequence of seedling dispersal to preferred microsites, and disturbance history. The broad scale forest pattern is detennined by the level of disturbance and the finer scale pattern of tree distribution is a result of light levels, parent and perch trees, and edaphic properties. There is no evidence that totara dominated stands are older than first generation, indicating that <b>periodic</b> catastrophic <b>regeneration</b> is required to reinitiate stands. The alteration of the natural disturbance regime by humans may pose problems for the future of lowland totara. There is no evidence that totara forest regenerates under a senescing totara canopy. Presently protected areas are therefore likely to undergo floristic composition change away from totara/matai/kahlkatea in the absence of disturbance. A landscape management plan is proposed as a mechanism for appropriate land use using ecological principles at catchment scale and to provide adequate areas for the long-term survival of totara dominated forest in a fragmented landscape. New Zealand's natural environment has been radically altered with the invasion of humans, introduced weeds and pests, and alteration of the natural disturbance regime. Restoration and revegetation are therefore options for the future survival of lowland totara in a fragmented landscape. Silvicultural plantations can provide timber (to tara heartwood being highly prized), income, and seed sources for regeneration. Land values such as water and soil quality will also benefit from artificial plantations. Stand spacing and age structure is described and can be used in the future when revegetation projects have the aim of approximating natural stands...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunication {{is defined}} as “Any transmission, {{emission}} or reception of signs, signals, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems”. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of in- formation between two or more entities (communication) includes the use of technology. Communication technology uses channels to transmit information, either over a physical medium, or {{in the form of}} electromagnetic waves. Nowadays, two advanced branches in information transport are electronics and pho- tonics, which exploit electrons and photons, respectively. Both of them are able to carry information over long distances, through electrical circuits or the technology of optical fibers. However, they have some defects: electronics circuits are affected by heat dissi- pation and thermal management and electronic noise; instead, photons Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive elec- trical components and interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible, and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunication, and signal processing. The analogous in the field of photonics can be performed using light to carry information. An optical communication system uses a transmitter, which encodes a message into an optical signal, a channel, which carries the signal to its des- tination, and a receiver, which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. The most common type of channel for optical communications is constituted by optical fibers. The transmitters in optical fiber links are generally light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes. Infrared light, rather than visible light is used more commonly, because optical fibers transmit infrared wavelengths with less attenuation and dispersion. The signal encoding is typically simple intensity modulation. The need for <b>periodic</b> signal <b>regeneration</b> was largely superseded by the introduction of the erbium-doped fiber am- plifier, which extended link distances at significantly lower cost. Beyond electrons and photons, an intriguing possibility to transport information is constituted by phonons; they are collective excitations of a periodic, elastic arrangement of atoms or molecules in solids and some liquids. Often designated as quasiparticles, they represent an excited state in the quantization of the vibrational modes of elastic struc- tures of interacting particles. With respect to electrons and photons, phonons have the particularity of coupling with almost everything, for example hybrid quantum devices and spin systems; this is very attractive in order to perform communication between systems which are very different from each other. This kind of communication typically cannot not be done using electrons and photons. However, phonons strongly depend on temperature and they are able to carry information only over small distances. Moreover, their characteristic frequencies (up to few GHz) are much lower than the photon ones (hundreds of THz). In order to perform on chip a simple communication experiment with phonons, three objects are required: a source, a waveguide and a detector. In this thesis I will focus on the implementation of coherent phonon sources. With respect to the laser working principle in photonics, where stimulated emission is used as the process at the basis of the oscillator, a phonon source is generally considered as an object which injects coherent phonons in the system. Ways of generating coherent phonons are coherent phonon spectroscopy (CPS) with femtosecond laser pulses, impulsively stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), displacive excitation of coherent phonons (DECP); otherwise coherent acoustic phonons can be generated in piezoeletric semiconductor heterostructures. Our idea to realize a coherent phonon emitter combines the field of nanomechanics with the technology of superconducting devices. Superconductors are particularly interesting for three reasons: they work at very low temperatures (few K), as many quantum de- vices do, and this strongly reduces the thermal noise; superconducting devices can be perfectly integrated on chip; finally, the new advanced nanofabrication techniques allow for the realization of superconducting devices (such as single junctions or SQUIDs) with very small dimensions. If a part of the device is suspended, a mechanical oscillator with vibrational frequencies up to few GHz can be obtained. The best candidate to be the final device is a Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID), which consists of a superconducting circuit with two superconduct- ing/normal metal/superconducting (SNS) junctions coupled in parallel. The idea is to fabricate a SQUID and then suspend one of the two junctions through an etching pro- cess. If a current is flowing along the wire and an in-plane magnetic field is applied orthogonal to the junction, the field exerts a Lorentz force on the nanowire itself. If the force frequency is resonant with the beam out-of-plane eigenmodes, coherent vibrations can be induced. The aim of the present thesis is to design, fabricate and investigate the transport and magnetic properties of single SNS junctions and DC SQUIDs, made of Al and Cu. the two classes of devices are fabricated through the combined use of electron-beam lithog- raphy (EBL) and metal deposition with the shadow-mask technique. The experimental characterization of single SNS junctions allows to investigate their su- perconducting properties and in particular the critical current behaviour as function of the applied in-plane magnetic field for different temperatures; on the other hand, testing non-suspended SQUIDs is a relevant milestone to verify the possibility of fabricating devices with the right geometry for the final experiment. The analytical model describing the behaviour of a mechanically actuable SQUID is solved in the time domain with the commercial software Mathematica. Using realistic parameters coming from the measurement of the fabricated devices, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} perform a DC detection of the mechanical vibration (with GHz frequen- cies) of the nanowire. Finally, an innovative, challenging approach, relying on the use of a silicon nitride membrane, is introduced as a way forward towards the fabrication of the final, suspended SQUID device...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{separated}} boundary-layer flow at {{the rear}} of a bump is considered. The flow undergoes two-dimensional low-frequency global oscillations known as 'flapping' typical for elongated separation bubbles. Computing equilibrium stationary states of the Navier-Stokes equations and performing a global instability analysis, the onset of the two-dimensional instability is shown to be characterized by a family of modes with localized structures around the reattachment point becoming almost simultaneously unstable. The optimal perturbation analysis, by projecting the initial disturbance on the set of temporal eigenmodes, reveals that the non-normal modes are able to describe localized initial perturbations associated with large transient energy growth. At larger time a global oscillation is found accompanied by a <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the flow perturbation inside the bubble, as the consequence of non-normal cancellation of modes. The low-frequency of the resulting beating behavior is retrieved when applying the optimal initial perturbation to Navier-Stokes time integration. Exploring the possibility of model reduction using temporal two-dimensional instability modes, a low-dimensional feedback controller is designed, performing a Petrov/Galerkin projection based on the bi-orthogonality between the direct and adjoint modes.

To validate the model a one-dimensional NOX trap system has been tested on a turbocharged, EGR-cooled, direct injection diesel engine controlled with an engine management system via DSPACE. Fast response emission analyzers have been used to provide high resolution data across the after-treatment system for model validation. Measurements show CO is the primary reductant. After the trap NO and NO₂ spikes (NOX slippage) were observed both {{at the beginning and end}} of the regeneration period. The former is believed to be due to insufficient reductant. Whilst the model can qualitatively describe the main storage and regeneration phases it failed to predict NOX slippage...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{separated}} {{boundary layer}} flow {{at the rear}} of a bump is considered. Two-dimensional equilibrium stationary states of the Navier-Stokes equations are determined using a nonlinear continuation procedure varying the bump height as well as the Reynolds number. A global instability analysis of the steady states is performed by computing two-dimensional temporal modes. The onset of instability is shown to be characterized by a family of modes with localized structures around the reattachment point becoming almost simultaneously unstable. The optimal perturbation analysis, by projecting the initial disturbance on the set of temporal eigenmodes, reveals that the non-normal modes are able to describe localized initial perturbations associated with large transient energy growth. At larger time a global low-frequency oscillation is found accompanied by a <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the flow perturbation inside the bubble, as the consequence of non-normal cancellation of modes. The initial condition provided by the optimal perturbation analysis is applied to Navier-Stokes time integration and is shown to trigger nonlinear 'flapping' typical for separation bubbles. We also show {{that it is possible to}} follow the stationary equilibrium state with increasing Reynolds number far beyond instability, ruling out for the present flow case the hypothesis of some authors that topological flow changes are responsible for the 'flapping'...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} stochastic processes Z = (Zt) [0,∞), on {{a general}} state space, having a certain <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration</b> property: {{there is an}} increasing sequence of random times (Sn) ∞ 0 such that the post-Sn process is conditionally independent of S 0,…,Sn given (Sn mod 1) and the conditional distribution {{does not depend on}} n. Our basic condition is that the distributions Ps(A) = P(Sn+ 1 − Sn ∈ A|Sn = s), s ∈[0, 1), have a common component that is absolutely continuous w. r. t. Lebesgue measure. Then Z has the following time-homogeneous regeneration property: there exists a discrete aperiodic renewal process T = (Tn) ∞ 0 such that the post-Tn process is independent of T 0,…,Tn and its distribution does not depend on n; this yields weak ergodicity. Further, the Markov chain (Sn mod 1) ∞ 0 has an invariant distribution π[0, 1) and it holds that Tn+ 1 − Tn has finite first moment if and only if m = ∫ m(Ps) π[0, 1) (ds) < ∞ where m(Ps) is the first moment of Ps; this yields periodic ergodicity. Also, some distributional properties of T 0 and Tn+ 1 − Tn are established leading to improved ergodic regults. Finally, a uniform key periodic renewal theorem is derived...|$|E
40|$|Despite a {{proliferation}} of research focusing on the synthesis and catalytic chemistry of Sn-containing zeolite Beta, research focusing on its intensification lacks behind, prohibting its further exploitation. In this manuscript, we investigate and optimise the continuous flow activity of Sn-β {{for a range of}} sustainable chemical transformations, including the transfer hydrogenation of model and bio-renewable substrates (furfural), and the isomerisation of glucose to fructose. Extended time-on-stream studies reveal Sn-β to be an very stable catalyst during continuous operation in an organic solvent. Spectroscopic methodologies reveal that deactivation in these cases is related to fouling of the micropores with the product and higher molecular weight carbonaceous residue. <b>Periodic</b> <b>regeneration</b> by heat treatment is found to restore full activity, allowing Sn-β to be used for over 700 h continuously with no greater than 20 % loss in activity. In contrast, operation in an aqueous media is extremely disadvantagous, as it causes total destruction of the catalyst and permanent deactivation. In these cases, however, long term activity can still be achieved by modifying the solvent chosen for reaction, with methanol appearing to be a suitable alternative. The promising results presented herein conclusively demonstrate the potential of Sn-β to operate as an industrial heterogeneous catalyst...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of energy efficient, lightweight sorption systems for removal of environmental contaminants in space flight applications {{is an area}} of continuing interest to NASA. The current CO 2 removal system on the International Space Station employs two pellet bed canisters of 5 A molecular sieve that alternate between regeneration and sorption. A separate disposable charcoal bed removes trace contaminants. An alternative technology has been demonstrated using a sorption bed consisting of metal meshes coated with a sorbent, trademarked and patented [1] as Microlith ® by Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI); these meshes have the potential for direct electrical heating for this application. This allows the bed to be regenerable via resistive heating and offers the potential for shorter regeneration times, reduced power requirement, and net energy savings vs. conventional systems. The capability of removing both CO 2 and trace contaminants within the same bed has also been demonstrated. Thus, the need for a separate trace contaminant unit is eliminated resulting in an opportunity for significant weight savings. Unlike the charcoal bed, zeolites for trace contaminant removal are amenable to <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration.</b> This paper describes the design and performance of a prototype sorber device for simultaneous CO 2 and trace contaminant removal and its attendant weight and energy savings...|$|E

Vacuum regenerations at effective time/temperature conditions, and estimated power requirements were experimentally verified for the combined CO 2 /trace contaminant removal prototype. The current paper details the design and performance of this prototype during initial testing at CO 2 and trace contaminant concentrations in the existing CDRA, downstream of the drier. Additional long-term performance characterization is planned at NASA. Potential system design options permitting associated weight, volume savings and logistic benefits, especially as relevant for long-duration space flight, are reviewed. The technology consisted of a sorption bed with sorbent- coated metal meshes, trademarked and patented as Microlith by Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI). By contrast the current CO 2 removal system on the International Space Station employs pellet beds. Preliminary bench scale performance data (without direct resistive heating) for simultaneous CO 2 and trace contaminant removal was reviewed in SAE 2004 - 01 - 2442.

40|$|Stringent {{pollutant}} {{regulations on}} diesel-powered vehicles {{have resulted in}} the development of new technologies to reduce emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The urea Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) system and Lean NOx Trap (LNT) have become the two promising solutions to this problem. Whilst the LNT results in a fuel penalty due to <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration,</b> the SCR system with aqueous urea solution or ammonia gas reductants could provide a better solution with higher NOx reduction efficiency. This thesis describes an experimental investigation which has been designed for comparing the effect NOx abatement of a SCR system with AdBlue urea spray and ammonia gas at 5 % and 4 % concentration. For this study, a SCR exhaust system comprising of a diesel particulate filter (DPF), a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and SCR catalysts was tested on a steady state, direct injection 1998 cc diesel engine. It featured an expansion can, nozzle and diffuser arrangement for a controlled flow profile for CFD model validation. Four different lengths of SCR catalyst were tested for a space velocity study. Chemiluminescence (CLD) based ammonia analysers have been used to provide high resolution NO, NO 2 and NH 3 measurements across the SCR exhaust system. By measuring at the exit of the SCR bricks, the NO and NO 2 profiles within the bricks were found. Comparison of the measurements between spray and gas lead to insights of the behaviour of the droplets upstream and within the SCR bricks. From the analysis, it was deduced that around half to three quarters of the droplets from the urea spray remain unconverted at the entry of the first SCR brick. Approximately 200 ppm of potential ammonia was released from the urea spray in the first SCR brick to react with NOx. The analysis also shows between 10 to 100 ppm of potential ammonia survived through the first brick in droplet form for cases from NOx-matched spray input to excess spray. Measurements show NOx reduction was complete after the second SCR bricks. Experimental and CFD prediction showed breakthrough of all species for the short brick with gas injection due to the high space velocity. The long brick gas cases predictions gave reasonable agreement with experimental results. NO 2 conversion efficiency was found higher than NO which contradicts with the fast SCR reaction kinetics. Transient response was observed in both cases during the NOx reduction, ammonia absorption and desorption process. From the transient analysis an estimate of the ammonia storage capacity of the bricks was derived. The amount of ammonia slippage was obtained through numerical integration of the ammonia slippage curve using an excel spreadsheet. Comparing the time constant for the spray and gas cases, showed a slightly faster time response from the gas for both NOx reduction and ammonia slippage...|$|E
40|$|Industry {{requires}} continuously new {{chemical processes}} to convert raw materials to valuable products limiting {{the formation of}} by-products. Since a few years, an increasing interest {{has been given to}} the intensification of chemical processes. This represents a new approach in chemical reaction engineering and calls for a new type of chemical reactors: the microstructured reactors. They are characterized by miniature structures whose components have a sub-millimeter size. The flow channels, for example, have a diameter from ten to several hundred microns. The distinctive feature of these structures is a very large surface/volume ratio, namely between 10 ' 000 and 50 ' 000 m 2 /m 3. In these conditions, heat transfer coefficient is very high, up to 25 kW · m- 2 · K- 1. It is accepted that the residence time distribution in a reactor strongly influences the product selectivity and yield. In these thin channels, the RTD is particularly narrow due to a short radial diffusion time (ms), allowing a precise control of the residence time. Another advantage of these microstructures is an increase of the inherent safety due to a small amount of the compounds used. However, fabrication of microreactors, especially the introduction of active catalyst in microchannels remains a difficult operation. And integration of microsystems in conventional chemical processes is still a challenge. The aim of this work is first to develop a novel membrane reactor based on a new microstructured catalytic packing in the filamentous form and to apply it to the nonoxydative dehydrogenation of propane. A second objective is to develop a reactor with micro heat exchangers allowing an optimized control of homogeneous reactions. This reactor was tested with the partial oxidation of propene to propylene oxide. The microstructured catalyst above is made of thin and long catalytic filaments placed in parallel with a tubular reactor. This new kind of catalyst is based on silica fibres covered by a γ-alumina layer. The position in parallel of these filaments of 7 μm diameter forces the gases to flow in the fibres direction between the filaments. The hydraulic diameter is about 70 μm. Due to this laminar and regular flow, the pressure drop in the bed was divided by 5 compared to a conventional bed (100 - 160 μm spheres) and the residence time distribution was particularly narrower. Such novel packing brings new opportunities to the heterogeneous catalysis domain because it can be used for many other reactions improving highly the hydrodynamics and keeping an excellent contact with the reactants. The microstructured catalyst was installed in two concentric zones of a tubular reactor separated by a palladium-silver membrane permeable to hydrogen. This product was removed from the gas phase to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium, enhancing the propane conversion from 22 % up to 30 %. Another significant advantage in this reactor is the increase of propene selectivity up to 97 % in comparison to conventional industrial processes reaching 80 - 90 %. This difference is due to the diminution of hydrogenolysis and hydroisomerization reactions. The dehydrogenation is known to be endothermic. Oxidation of the hydrogen passing through the membrane produced heat for this reaction along the catalytic zone. Moreover, a <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration</b> by air allowed recovering the activity of the catalyst deactivated by coke formed during dehydrogenation. Periodic reaction operations allowed producing continuously propene with a high selectivity, and regenerating simultaneously the catalyst. The second microstructured reactor was developed integrating two micro heat exchangers at the inlet and outlet of a macroscopic tube. The aim is to heat up very fast the gas and to cool it down as well. Without these exchangers, heating and cooling duration corresponded each to about 20 % of the total residence time. The use of the microstructures allowed diminishing significantly these durations (4 - 5 % each). Applied to partial oxidation of propene, this reactor reached a more precise control of reaction temperature and duration. The propylene oxide (PO) selectivity was not increased with this system but, due to the microstructures, it was possible to work at higher temperatures where the reaction becomes very fast, without reaching an oxygen conversion of 100 %. Indeed, it is essential to avoid this situation where oligomers and coke form dividing by 2 the PO selectivity. So another new kind of reactor was developed suitable for any fast exothermic reaction whose progression has to be limited because of potential consecutive reactions reducing, for example, the selectivity of an intermediate desired compound...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater is a {{major and}} {{sometimes}} lone source of drinking water worldwide. The chemical composition of groundwater is a combined product of the composition of water that enters the aquifer and its reaction with various minerals present in the soil and rock mass, which alter the water composition with time and space. Some important factors influencing groundwater quality are (1) physiochemical characteristics o the rocks through which the water circulates; (2) geology of the location; (3) climate of the area; (4) role of microorganisms, which includes oxidative and reductive biodegradation of organic matter; (5) chemical, physical, and mineralogical characteristics of the overburden soils through which the rainwater percolates; and (6) human intrusion affecting the hydrological cycle and degradation in water quality through utilization of water for agricultural and industrial activities. By far the most serious naturally occurring groundwater-quality problem in India derives from high fluoride, arsenic and iron concentrations which are dissolved from the bedrocks by geochemical processes. Presence of excess fluoride in groundwater is identified as a naturally occurring health hazard by the World Health Organization (WHO). Prolonged ingestion of fluoride beyond certain permissible limit leads to ffluorosis, {{one of the common}} water-related diseases recognized by the WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Endemic fluorosis is now known to be global in scope, occurring on all continents and affecting many millions of people. According to estimates made in the early 1980 s, around 260 million people in 30 countries worldwide were drinking water with more than 1 ppm of fluoride. The ultimate source of fluoride in water, soil or biosphere is associated with its distribution in rocks and its dispersion in groundwater. The three most important minerals of fluoride are fluorite (CaF 2), cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6) and fluorapatite (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F); cryolite is a rare mineral where as by far the largest amount of fluorine in the earth's crust {{is in the form of}} fluorapatite (about 3. 5 % by weight of fluorine) which is processed almost exclusively for its phosphate content. Fluoride substitutes readily in hydroxyl positions in late-formed minerals in igneous rocks, and in primary minerals especially micas (such as biotites) and amphiboles (such as hornblende). The most important controlling factors influencing fluoride presence in groundwater include: distribution of easily weathered fluoride-bearing minerals, the accessibility of circulating water to these minerals, pH of the percolating water, calcium content of the leaching water, temperature of the percolating water and the soil, exchangeable ions in the percolating water, extent of fresh water exchange in an aquifer, evaporation and evapotranspiration, complexing of fluoride ions with other ions, presence of CO 2 and other chemicals in draining water and residence time of the percolating water in soil. High fluoride levels are observed in the groundwater in 19 states of the country. Fluorite, apatite, rock phosphate, phosphorites, phosphatic nodules and topaz are major fluoride bearing minerals in India with varying levels of fluoride content. There are three major fluoride bearing areas in India : 1) Gujarat-Rajasthan in the north-west and 2) Chandidongri-Raipur in central India 3) Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh in the south; besides other areas in Karnataka, Bihar, Punjab and in the North-west Himalayas. The total mineral reserves of fluorite, rock phosphate and apatite in the country are estimated at 11. 6, 71 and 2. 82 million tonnes respectively. The distribution of areas with excess fluoride in groundwater concurs with that of fluorine-bearing minerals. Further high fluoride concentrations are observed from arid and semi arid regions of the country and the areas with advanced stage of groundwater development. An estimated 62 million people, including 6 million children suffer from fluorosis in India because of consuming fluoride-contaminated water. Endemic fluorosis is found to practically exist only in the villages due to lack of piped water supply. The Indian Drinking Water Standard specifies the desirable and permissible limits for fluoride in drinking water as 1. 0 and 1. 5 ppm respectively. De-fluoridation of groundwater is the only alternative to prevent fluorosis in the absence of alternate water source especially for immediate and/or interim relief. De-fluoridation of drinking water in India is usually achieved by the Nalgonda technique or activated alumina process. The Nalgonda method involves addition of aluminum salts (aluminium sulphate and/or aluminium chloride), lime and bleaching powder to water, followed by rapid mixing, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. Only aluminum salt is responsible for removal of fluoride from water. Fluoride removal is achieved in a combination of complexation with polyhydroxy aluminium species and adsorption on polymeric alumino hydroxides (floc). Activated alumina(Al 2 O 3) was proposed for de-fluoridation of water for domestic use in 1930 ’s and since then it has become one of the most advocated de-fluoridation methods. Activated alumina is a semi crystalline porous inorganic adsorbent and an excellent medium for fluoride removal. When the source water passes through the packed column of activated alumina, fluoride (and other components in the water) is removed via exchange reaction with surface hydroxides on alumina; this mechanism is generally called adsorption although ligand exchange is a more appropriate term for the highly specific surface reactions involved. The fluoride removal capacity of alumina is highly sensitive to pH, the optimum being about pH 5. 5 - 6. Significant reduction in fluoride removal by activated alumina is also observed in presence of sulfate and silicate ions. The column needs <b>periodic</b> <b>regeneration</b> once break point(where the effluent concentration is, for example, 2 ppm at normal saturation) is reached. For regeneration, the medium is backwashed for 5 - 10 min and then subjected to two step regeneration with base (NaOH) followed by acid(H 2 SO 4). A major cause for concern with the Nalgonda method is the possibility of formation of residual aluminum and soluble aluminum fluoride complexes in the treated water and a potential breach of the 0. 2 ppm Indian drinking water standard for aluminium. Concerns with the activated alumina filter method are that the process is pH dependent, with an optimum (pH) working range of 5 - 6. Further, the activated alumina column requires periodic recharge using caustic soda and acid solutions to rejuvenate the fluoride retention capacity of the column. After 3 - 4 regenerations the medium has to be replaced. If the pH is not readjusted to normal following the regeneration process, there is a possibility that the aluminum concentration in the treated water may exceed the 0. 2 ppm standard. Due to the aforementioned drawbacks of the currentde-fluoridation technologies in India that chiefly rely on aluminum based compounds, magnesia(magnesium oxide, MgO) is selected to develop an alternate sustainable de-fluoridation method. The potential of MgO for de-fluoridation has been examined owing to its very limited solubility(6. 2 mg/L), non-toxicity and excellent fluoride retention capacity. A review of the previous studies on fluoride removal using MgO reveals that the relevant information is essentially scattered. Though studies demonstrated the fluoride removing ability of MgO and brought into focus certain aspects of the fluoride removal mechanism and change in water quality upon MgO addition, vital issues necessary for efficient design and successful field implementation of the de-fluoridation processusing MgO were not addressed. The significant limitations in the earlier works include: influence of process variables(such as MgO dosage, initial fluoride concentration, contact time, temperature, initial solution pH, presence of co-ions and ionic strength) on fluoride retention characteristics (such as removal rate, equilibrium time, capacity) of MgO were not systematically determined, optimum operating parameters/conditions (such as MgO dosage, stirring and settling time) for effective de-fluoridation process applicable to a wide range of groundwater chemical composition and fluoride concentrations were not defined, mechanism of fluoride retention by MgO was not fully understood, issue of lowering the pH of MgO treated water within potable water limits was not comprehensively addressed, safe disposal methods of fluoride bearing sludge were not explored. Failure to address the above issues has impeded the adoption of the MgO treatment method for fluoride removal from water. Scope of the study Present study aims to develop a new sustainable de-fluoridation method, applicable to a wide range of groundwater chemical compositions and fluoride concentrations, based on co-precipitation/precipitation-sedimentation-filtration processes using light MgO. Efforts are made to implement the method at domestic level in a rural area with incidence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater and to understand the status and geochemistry of fluoride contamination in the area. The main objectives of the study include: To determine the fluoride retention characteristics of MgO viz.,rate, equilibrium time and capacity of fluoride retention. To examine the influence of process variables on fluoride retention characteristics of MgO and to determine the optimum operating parameters for effective de-fluoridation process. To understand the mechanism and rate limiting step of MgO de-fluoridation process. To propose methods and specifications to lower the pH of MgO treated water within permissible limits to ensure its potability. To design a simple to use, single-stage domestic de-fluoridation unit. To propose procedures for implementation of the new de-fluoridation method in field. To evaluate the efficiency of the new de-fluoridation method as a useful remedial measure in the fluoride affected areas. To understand the geochemical factors governing the quality of the fluoride rich groundwater and to ascertain the status and geochemistry of fluoride contamination in the area where felid implementation of de-fluoridation method is planned. To characterize the fluoride bearing sludge and propose methods for safe disposal and reuse of fluoride bearing sludge. Organization of the thesis Chapter 1 presents an overview of the various aspects of excess fluoride presence in groundwater, remedial measures, and emphasizes the need for a new sustainable de-fluoridation method and defines the scope of present study. Chapter 2 performs a detailed investigation to determine the fluoride retention characteristics of MgO under the influence of various process variables at transient and equilibrium conditions using batch studies. The process variables that have been considered are, contact time, initial fluoride concentration, dosage of MgO, temperature, initial pH, presence of co-ions and ionic strength. Studies to determine the optimum operating parameters for efficient de-fluoridation and to understand some basics of reaction mechanisms involved are also part of this chapter. Chapter 3 examines the true nature of the reaction mechanism between fluoride ions and MgO in aqueous media and the rate-limiting step of the de-fluoridation process by investigating the hydration process of MgO and its influence/relation on fluoride removal. Chapter 4 addresses issues that will assist applying the MgO treatment method for fluoride removal in field such as 1) methods and specifications for lowering the pH of the MgO treated water within permissible limits, 2) design of a simple to use, single-stage de-fluoridation unit, and 3) characterization of the resultant fluoride bearing sludge. Chapter 5 performs a detailed investigation to evaluate the efficiency of the new de-fluoridation method in laboratory and field, and to understand the origin and the geochemicall mechanisms driving the groundwater fluorine enrichment in the area where field implementation of the de-fluoridation unit was planned. Chapter 6 explores an environmentally safe route for the disposal and re-use of fluoride bearing sludge in soil based building materials such as, stabilized soil blocks (produced by cement stabilization of densely compacted soil mass) which are alternative to burnt bricks.
