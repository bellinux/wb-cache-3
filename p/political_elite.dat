5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> was divided between those who embraced the Arab {{nationalist}} movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E
40|$|In recent summers, rioting around Cronulla and {{throughout}} England has sparked debates about their causes. While {{there has been}} a concerted effort to analyse these, there has been less attention on the response of <b>political</b> <b>elites.</b> Ultimately, the response of <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> determines if public policy is used to address the causes of the rioting. This study seeks to remedy this omission by conducting a comparative study of the response of <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> and the media to the Cronulla Riots of 2005 and English Riots of 2011. It contends that <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> in Australia responded to the riots by framing the riots largely as a law and order problem. In contrast, British <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> offered a greater variety of explanations in their analysis of their rioting. Similarly, media outlets in both nations explored a variety of causes for the riots, including race, class, poverty and a culture of criminality. This study claims that the anomalous response of Australian <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> elucidates certain idiosyncrasies of Australia’s political culture, including its reluctance to discuss race, and tendency to respond to complex issues through a law and order framework...|$|R

5|$|The {{collapse}} of the Hananu Revolt marked a significant turning point in Aleppo's political configurations. Whereas prior to the revolt, many in Aleppo's <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> were aligned with Turkish national politics, the betrayal that Aleppo's leaders felt at the withdrawal of Turkish support prompted most of them to embrace and pursue a shared destiny {{with the rest of}} Syria. Many were also influenced by Hananu's support for Syrian unity and strengthening ties with Damascus. In the aftermath of the Franco-Turkish accords, Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, the major market for its goods and the supplier of its food and raw materials, was ceded to Turkey. This effectively severed commercial relations between Aleppo and Anatolia, harming the former's economy.|$|E

5|$|Rajoelina's {{business}} affairs gradually {{drew him}} into the political arena. Shortly after Ravalomanana won the presidential elections in 2001, Rajoelina befriended the new president's daughter and continued to expand {{his relationship with the}} capital's <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> {{over the course of the}} Ravalomanana presidency. He assumed an increasingly political role after the policies of Ravalomanana's Tiako I Madagasikara (TIM)-dominated government increasingly obstructed the expansion of his business activities, such as requiring the removal of Antananarivo's first LED advertising panels, which Rajoelina had installed at a major roundabout in the capital. In May 2007 he purchased the Ravinala television and radio stations, which he renamed Viva TV and Viva FM. The official launch of these newly acquired media channels on 27 May was attended by many of the capital's political and cultural elite, including Antananarivo mayor Hery Rafalimanana and Jacques Sylla, president of the TIM political party. Rajoelina used these media channels as outlets for voicing criticism of the Ravalomanana administration, quickly transforming his public image into that of an opposition leader.|$|E

40|$|When {{discussing}} democratic {{transitions in}} authoritarian or minority ruled countries, {{there are often}} {{a variety of factors}} analyzed in order {{to determine whether or not}} the transition will be successful. I argue that <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> are the key factor to a successful democratic transition, but that they must fulfill five principles in order to institute a successful democracy. 	The economy and civil society are the two other factors that have commonly been cited as pre-conditions for a democratic government. While both can play important roles in transitions, they are also inherently controlled by <b>political</b> <b>elites.</b> There are two sides to the economic argument. The first is that some believe that an economy in crisis can bring about political change through the mobilization of citizens. While mobilization can occur, it is the way in which <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> utilize the mass that forces a political transition. The second theory behind the economy argues that in order for transition to occur, the economy must already be established within the country. There are two problems with this premise. The first is that stable economies often arise out of a democratic transition, which would mean that it would not inherently be a pre-condition. The second issue is that many authoritarian regimes have had stable economies, so the pre-requisite does not automatically lend itself to the development of a democratic nation. 	Civil Society is an important part of a democracy, and aids in the stability of a democratic state. However it does not need to be present at the initial transition to democracy, as it is something that can be learned by citizens. It is also important to realize that the space for civil society to thrive is created by <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> outside of the state. Essentially, <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> control the creation of civil society by allowing for civil society to function autonomously. 	Once it was determined that <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> were the vital factor in creating a successful democratic transition, two case studies were examined which allowed us insight into how <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> work and what they must do in order to succeed. Through these case studies five key principles were determined that these elites must utilize to be successful. They must communicate throughout the process openly and honestly; come to the negotiating table willing to negotiate, as opposed to just demanding policies; negotiations must have been initiated by internal elites, not completely coerced by outside forces; be all inclusive to ensure no extremist group feels alienated causing backlash; and the <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> must maintain their power throughout the process to ensure negotiated settlements can be implemented and abided by within their own parties. 	Through the case study on South Africa we were able to observe successful implementation of these five principles by the two major <b>political</b> <b>elites,</b> Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk. When the rest of the world thought South Africa would erupt in civil war, these two <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> carefully and effectively negotiated a democratic government allowing for a relatively peaceful transition to occur. Rwanda, on the other hand, saw <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> who were not able to effectively implement these five principles. Instead of the peaceful transition the international community believed would occur through the Arusha Accords, President Habyarimana was killed and genocide spread throughout the country. In Rwanda the attempt at a democratic transition failed under ill equipped <b>political</b> <b>elites.</b> 	To conclude, this thesis attempted to argue two important points. The first is that <b>political</b> <b>elites,</b> as opposed to the economy or civil society, are the most vital factor in creating a successful democratic transition. The second, done through case studies of Rwanda and South Africa, examined five key principles <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> must utilize in order to create a democratic transition. In South Africa we saw these principles implemented effectively, while in Rwanda the <b>political</b> <b>elites</b> failed to implement them at all. <b>Political</b> <b>elites</b> are the most important factor in creating a successful democratic transition, but they must implement the five key principles in order for the new democracy to thrive...|$|R
