With due consideration of stationarity of the variables; selection criteria of optimal lag length; and assumptions of error structure such as normality, homoscedasticity and independence, both <b>parametric</b> and nonparametric <b>tests</b> are performed. The multiple rank F test is employed as a nonparametric test.

40|$|International audienceThe {{high cost}} of testing certain analog, mixed-signal, and RF {{circuits}} has driven {{in the recent years}} the development of alternative low-cost tests to replace the most costly or even all standard specification tests. However, {{there is a lack of}} solutions for evaluating the <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> error, that is, the test error for circuits with process variations, resulting from this replacement. For this reason, test engineers are often reluctant to adopt alternative tests since it is not guaranteed that test cost reduction is not achieved at the expense of sacrificing test quality. In this paper, we present a technique to estimate the <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> error fast and reliably with parts per million accuracy. The technique is based on extreme value theory and statistical blockade. Relying on a small number of targeted simulations, it is capable of providing accurate estimates of <b>parametric</b> <b>test</b> error in the general scenario where a set of alternative tests replaces all or a subset of standard specification tests...|$|R

Therefore, this study was conducted with the Wilcoxon two related samples <b>test</b> (non <b>parametric</b> <b>test)</b> instead of paired samples t <b>test</b> (<b>parametric</b> <b>test)</b> since the assumptions of the latter test were not met (Akdağ and Sümbüloğlu 2010).|$|R

5000|$|In statistics, canonical-correlation {{analysis}} (CCA) {{is a way}} of inferring {{information from}} cross-covariance matrices. If we have two vectors X = (X1, ..., Xn) and Y = (Y1, ..., Ym) of random variables, and there are correlations among the variables, then canonical-correlation analysis will find linear combinations of the Xi and Yj which have maximum correlation with each other. T. R. Knapp notes that [...] "virtually all of the commonly encountered <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> of significance can be treated as special cases of canonical-correlation analysis, which is the general procedure for investigating the relationships between two sets of variables." [...] The method was first introduced by Harold Hotelling in 1936.|$|E
50|$|So {{when the}} result of a {{statistical}} analysis is said to be an “exact test” or an “exact p-value”, it ought to imply that the test is defined without parametric assumptions and evaluated without using approximate algorithms. In principle however it could also mean that a parametric test has been employed in a situation where all parametric assumptions are fully met, but it is in most cases impossible to prove this completely in a real world situation. Exceptions when it is certain that <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> are exact include tests based on the binomial or Poisson distributions. Sometimes permutation test is used as a synonym for exact test, but although all permutation tests are exact tests, not all exact tests are permutation tests.|$|E
5000|$|In statistics, the Conover squared ranks test [...] is a {{non-parametric}} {{version of}} the parametric Levene's test for equality of variance. The only test {{that appears to be}} a non-parametric one is the Conover squared ranks test. Other tests of significance of difference of data dispersion are parametric (i.e., are difference of variance tests) whereas Conover's test is non-parametric. The squared ranks test is arguably a test of significance of difference of data dispersion not variance per se. This becomes important, for example, when the Levene's test fails to satisfy the rather generous conditions for normality associated with that test and is a default alternative under those conditions for certain statistical software programs like the VarianceEquivalenceTest routine in Mathematica. The <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> include the Bartlett, Brown-Forsythe, and Fisher Ratio tests.|$|E

The standard (default) procedure performs, first, automatic identification and forecasting of regression-ARIMA models (that includes adjusting for outliers and calendar effects) in the possible presence of missing observations.1 Then, the model is decomposed into models for the unobserved components (such as seasonal, trend, transitory, and cyclical components) and, from these models, filters are derived to estimate and forecast the components.234 The model-based structure provides the joint distribution of  the estimators, from which <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> and inferences (such as the standard errors of all estimators and forecasts) are derived.5a,b ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a general framework for weighted parametric multiple test procedures {{based on the}} closure principle. We utilize general weighting strategies that can reflect complex study objectives and include many procedures in the literature as special cases. The proposed weighted <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> {{bridge the gap between}} rejection rules using either adjusted significance levels or adjusted p-values. This connection is possible by allowing intersection hypotheses to be tested at level smaller than α, which may be needed for certain study considerations. For such cases we introduce a subclass of exact α-level <b>parametric</b> <b>tests</b> which satisfy the consonance property. When only subsets of test statistics are correlated, a new procedure is proposed to fully utilize the parametric assumptions within each subset.
