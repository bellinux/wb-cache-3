Based on the observed settlement data of foundation in Yangshan deepwater port <b>project,</b> <b>Logistic</b> growth model and modified Logistic growth model {{are used for}} nonlinear regression analysis of foundation settlement respectively. It is indicated that the fitting curves by using modified Logistic growth model agree better with the observed settlement values than those by using Logistic growth model and that the correlation coefficients by using modified Logistic growth model are also bigger. Model parameters of different geological conditions obtained by nonlinear regression analysis {{can be used for}} significant reference to foundation settlement prediction of similar geological condition in other deepwater port...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{co-occurrence of}} antisocial {{personality}} (ASP) and depression among drug dependent individuals was examined {{in a sample}} of federal inmates participating in residential or outpatient drug and alcohol treatment to increase our understanding of the co-occurrence of theses disorders. Methods. We examined drug dependence patterns both by the number of drugs of dependence as well as by type of drug, and separately studied men and women. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) was used to obtain DSM-III-R diagnostic information on a sample of 609 men and women participating in a multi-site drug treatment evaluation <b>project.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression results are reported which compared lifetime rates of ASP and major depression by number of drugs of dependency for men and women. ASP and major depression diagnostic rates were also examined by type of drug dependency pattern among men. Results. We found that both the number of drugs as well as the type of drug(s) are related to prevalence patterns for both diagnoses. The high rates of ASP and major depression among specific subgroups of drug dependent inmates highlight the need for thorough psychiatric assessment and the tailoring of treatment programs to the issues associated with these diagnoses. Implications. Our results suggest that although there are similarities in comorbidity between men and women, the differences point to the need to study men and women separately...|$|E

This paper presents results of research that assessed whether factors identified in the literature as likely to influence travel and activity generally, are also associated with participation and non-participation {{in community}} activities. The data set (N= 784) is from the Investigating transport disadvantage, social exclusion and wellbeing in metropolitan, regional and rural Victoria (TDSE) <b>project.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression was used to identify which of these factors have a significant association with participation or nonparticipation. The TDSE data was selected for this analysis because it differentiates between two groups. People who have not participated because they choose not to and those who have not participated because facilities are not available, or are insufficient for their needs. Analysis of this data provides the opportunity to consider different influences on participation and nonparticipation, either by choice or caused by constraints. Results indicate that social exclusion and low wellbeing are both associated with constrained non-participation in community activity. People reporting social exclusion or low wellbeing were unable to participate in the activities they wanted to due to the activity being unavailable or inadequate to their needs. However, reported transport problems are associated with choice non-participation in community activities. These results raise questions about the role of constraint in choice and the influence of structural barriers to participation and agency. These questions are examined and implications for policy are discussed. 1 ATRF 2011 Proceedings...|$|E

Objectives: We aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and pneumonia, croup, and otitis media in 10 European birth cohorts—BAMSE (Sweden), GASPII (Italy), GINIplus and LISAplus (Germany), MAAS (United Kingdom), PIAMA (the Netherlands), and four INMA cohorts (Spain) —and to derive combined effect estimates using meta-analysis. Methods: Parent report of physician-diagnosed pneumonia, otitis media, and croup during early childhood were assessed in relation to annual average pollutant levels [nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter ≤ 2. 5 μm (PM 2. 5), PM 2. 5 absorbance, PM 10, PM 2. 5 – 10 (coarse PM) ], which were estimated using land use regression models and assigned to children based on their residential address at birth. Identical protocols were used to develop regression models for each study area as part of the ESCAPE <b>project.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression was used to calculate adjusted effect estimates for each study, and random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate combined estimates. Results: For pneumonia, combined adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were elevated and statistically significant for all pollutants except PM 2. 5 (e. g., OR = 1. 30; 95 % CI: 1. 02, 1. 65 per 10 -μg/m 3 increase in NO 2 and OR = 1. 76; 95 % CI: 1. 00, 3. 09 per 10 -μg/m 3 PM 10).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to seek to shed light on the {{practice}} of incomplete corporate disclosure of quantitative Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and investigates whether external stakeholder pressure influences the existence, and separately, the completeness of voluntary GHG emissions disclosures by 431 European companies. Design/methodology/approach – A classification of reporting completeness is developed with respect to the scope, type and reporting boundary of GHG emissions based on the guidelines of the GHG Protocol, Global Reporting Initiative and the Carbon Disclosure <b>Project.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression analysis is applied to examine whether proxies for exposure to climate change concerns from different stakeholder groups influence the existence and/or completeness of quantitative GHG emissions disclosure. Findings – From 2005 to 2009, on average only 15 percent of companies that disclose GHG emissions report them in a manner that the authors consider complete. Results of regression analyses suggest that external stakeholder pressure is a determinant of the existence but not the completeness of emissions disclosure. Findings are consistent with stakeholder theory arguments that companies respond to external stakeholder pressure to report GHG emissions, but also with legitimacy theory claims that firms can use carbon disclosure, in this case the incomplete reporting of emissions, as a symbolic act to address legitimacy exposures. Practical implications – Bringing corporate GHG emissions disclosure in line with recommended guidelines will require either more direct stakeholder pressure or, perhaps, a mandated disclosure regime. In the meantime, users of the data will need to carefully consider the relevance of the reported data and develop the necessary competencies to detect and control for its incompleteness. A more troubling concern is that stakeholders may instead grow to accept less than complete disclosure. Originality/value – The paper represents the first large-scale empirical study into the completeness of companies’ disclosure of quantitative GHG emissions and is the first to analyze these disclosures in the context of stakeholder pressure and its relation to legitimation...|$|E

Spinnrocken is a construction project in the town center of Norrköping. The real estate company Fastighets AB L E Lundbergs is the client and the construction company Skanska is contracted as sole constructor for the project. Spinnrocken is planned to be finalized in the summer of 2014 and consists of several rental-apartments and some smaller businesses.

Perfect order fulfillment indicates the delivery performance to the construction site. The combined perfect order fulfillment for the three investigated materials is 18 %. A perfect order fulfillment of 18 % means that only one out of five inspected deliveries to Spinnrocken was considered having no faults at all. The effects of a low perfect order fulfillment are disruptions in the short-term time schedule, delayed operations, additional work and that the work space at the construction site is occupied by unnecessary construction material.

30|$|In recent years, the {{research}} of logistic risk management has focused on different areas [10]. Usually, logistic risk relationships are defined as “long-term relationships where participants generally cooperating, sharing the information, and working together to plan and even modify their business practices to improve joint performance.” The theoretical research on logistic risk management is accompanied by the formation {{and development of the}} international engineering construction market. At present, due to the investment and construction of <b>logistic</b> <b>project,</b> it is still a newborn thing in recent years, and a number of <b>logistic</b> construction <b>projects</b> have been successfully operated, but the geographical distribution is limited. This is because {{a long period of time}} is required for a <b>logistic</b> investment <b>project</b> from preliminary preparation to post-operation. Therefore, it causes limited findings in research literature regarding the quantitative analysis and evaluation of <b>logistic</b> construction <b>projects</b> [5]. The following is a summary of the collective risk researches related to logistic risk: Tranfield et al. [6] analyzed the main features and all kinds of risk factors existing in the construction of the logistic park. In the view of the actual situation of the construction of the logistic park, {{the research}} analyzed the obvious risks in the various stages of the construction of the logistic park and gave the corresponding risk management strategies and preventive measures. Fawcett et al. [7] considered the logistic relationship between city and city and the role of logistic parks in the urban logistic system, and it put forward the conditions to be considered in the construction of city logistic parks. There are problems in the construction of a logistic park, and it put forward corresponding countermeasures [7]. According to the characteristics of large-scale <b>logistic</b> <b>projects</b> such as large investment, high risk, and strong pertinence, Grawe evaluates the risks of logistic in the “Application of Risk Assessment in Logistic Projects” [8]. The first level considers the investment of <b>logistic</b> <b>projects</b> construction and operation of the various risk factors in the project as a whole part to assess the level of risk. The second level needs to combine the project overall risk assessment results and the core ability of profit forecast on <b>logistic</b> <b>project</b> investment and construction. The risk return method is used to analyze the economic risk of specific <b>logistic</b> <b>project</b> investment program and the range of project’s economic risk. In the document “Operation Management of Logistic Park Market,” Neuendorf [9] described the connotation of market operation risk in the logistic park; identified the market operation risk; divided the market operation risk into three categories: environmental risk, process risk, and regulatory risk and the possible consequences of the risk; and put forward the risk management measures. Cooper and Ellram analyzed the investment risk of logistic industry from four aspects which are return on investment, logistic solution, financial service, and product features in “Risk and Strategy of Logistic Investment” and put forward the investment risk response strategy in logistic industry [10]. Min et al. analyzed the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method applied to the virtual logistic organization risk assessment in the middle [11]. Jin et al. analyzed all kinds of risk factors in the port logistic park, using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the risk evaluation [12]. Chen et al. aimed on the current situation of the construction of logistic parks in our country, analyzing the common system risks in the construction of logistic parks from the perspective of the government and makes quantitative research [13].|$|R

Indeed, Bangladesh is the only one among the world’s twenty poorest countries where such a change has occurred. The paper examines the nature of fertility transition in Bangladesh, looks at the trends in contraceptive use and fertility, and identifies the major factors accounting for the fertility decline, despite poor socio-economic conditions. Two types of factors in the decline are: (a) positive factors which encourage eligible couples to contracept, and (b) negative factors which compel women to contracept, for spacing or limiting births.

METHODS: We re-examined the {{relationship between}} AAO and the clinical features of recurrent MD in Han Chinese women by analyzing the phase I (N= 1848), phase II (N= 4169) and total combined data (N= 6017) from the CONVERGE <b>project.</b> Linear, <b>logistic,</b> multiple linear and multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the association of AAO with continuous, binary and categorical variables. RESULTS: The effect size of the association between AAO and clinical features of MD was quite similar in the phase I and phase II samples. These results confirmed that MD patients with earlier AAO tended to suffer more severe, recurrent and chronic illness and cases of MD with earlier AAO showed increased neuroticism, greater family history and psychiatric comorbidity. In addition, we showed that earlier AAO of MD in Han Chinese women was associated with premenstrual symptoms, postnatal depression, a highly authoritarian or cold childhood parental rearing style and a reduced probability for having melancholia. LIMITATIONS: Data were collected retrospectively through interview and recall bias may have affected the results. CONCLUSIONS: MD with earlier AAO in Han Chinese women shows a distinct set of clinical features which are similar to those reported in Western populations...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{long-term}} (13 -year) dynamics of surface pCO 2 and its response to episodic eutrophication and acidification events in two contrasting tropical coastal lakes, one clear-water {{and the other}} humic. A short-term nutrient addition experiment was also conducted in mesocosms in the humic lake where in situ eutrophication was moderate. Our objective was to elucidate the response of pCO 2 to interannual changes in key limnological conditions, such as nutrient concentrations and pH. The humic waters showed a median pCO 2 almost ninefold higher across the 13 -year study than the clear waters, supporting pCO 2 values about tenfold above atmospheric equilibrium. Eutrophication of the clear-water lake resulted in a decrease in pCO 2 to median values below atmospheric equilibrium, producing a strong sink for atmospheric CO 2. In contrast, pCO 2 increased by over tenfold in both lakes during the acidification phase, resulting in very large CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. Experimental nutrient additions in the humic lake showed a strong persistence of high pCO 2. The extreme variability in pCO 2 observed here might be a characteristic of tropical lakes and may have important consequences for regional carbon budgets. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

30|$|There {{are various}} risks being {{involved}} in the investment and construction of <b>logistic</b> <b>projects.</b> It is an important basis for the decision-making process to analyze the source and level of risk factors through the whole system and assessment. The development of logistic business needs to be based on a strong logistic system to reflect the advantages of low cost and high efficiency of logistic services. The company’s logistic business needs to carry out large-scale logistic infrastructure construction and {{a lot of money on}} the basis of the original business and management experience, accompanied by a great risk in this process. Therefore, the scientific method of logistic risk comprehensive assessment may contribute to a better project development process by well prediction on the inevitable risks of the enterprise’s own ability and the proceeds of trade-offs. For a decision-maker, there is a very important reference value.|$|R
40|$|Early {{detection}} by screening {{is the key}} to {{colorectal cancer}} control. However, colorectal cancer screening and its determinants in rural areas have not been adequately studied. This goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the screening participation and determinants of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and/or fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in subjects of Project Frontier from the rural counties of Cochran, Bailey and Parmer, Texas. Subjects (n= 820 with 435 Hispanics, 355 Non-Hispanic Whites, 26 African Americans, and 4 unknown ethnicity; 255 males, 565 females, aged from 40 to 92 years) were from <b>Project</b> FRONTIER. Stepwise <b>logistic</b> regression analysis was performed. Explanatory variables included ethnicity (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic white and African American), gender, health insurance, smoking status, household income, education (years), physical activity, overweight, other health screenings, personal physicians, family history (first-degree relatives) of cancers, and preferred language (English vs. Spanish) for interview/testing. The screening percentage for ever having had a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy (51. 8...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, several {{research}} initiatives have investigated and proposed innovative solutions for transport logistics. However, {{the level of}} adoption in the transport industry has been low, in particular in comparison with other industry sectors. This is on one side related to the transport industry itself, facing issues like market fragmentation, price pressure and {{a high degree of}} outsourcing. The other reason for this is a lack in dissemination strategies towards relevant stakeholders being indentified in several logistics innovation projects. The EU-funded <b>project</b> LOGINN - <b>Logistic</b> Innovation Uptake - aims at coordinating and supporting RTD projects in the logistics area to improve their capabilities {{to bridge the gap between}} pilot implementation and marketable solutions. In addition, the project aims at disseminating innovative logistics practices, technologies and business models to the logistics community, thus establishing an information hub for logistics innovation and contributing to education and training of logistics enterprises’ employees.

40|$|Abstract: Complexity metrics {{have been}} intensively studied in {{predicting}} fault-prone software modules. However, little {{work is done}} in studying how to effectively use the complexity metrics and the prediction models under realistic conditions. In this paper, we present a study showing how to utilize the prediction models generated from existing projects to improve the fault detection on other <b>projects.</b> The binary <b>logistic</b> regression method is used in studying publicly available data of five commercial products. Our study shows (1) models generated using more datasets can improve the prediction accuracy but not the recall rate; (2) lowering the cut-off value can improve the recall rate, {{but the number of}} false positives will be increased, which will result in higher maintenance effort. We further suggest that in order to improve model prediction efficiency, the selection of source datasets and the determination of cut-off values should be based on specific properties of a project. So far, there are no general rules that have been found and reported to follow...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{logistics}} has its practical input {{in creating}} economical strategies {{as well as}} in creating modern economic environment. Processes of planning, designing and functioning of logistic systems must be based both on the theoretical knowledge covering various areas as well as practical experiences to provide the required support.  To provide logistic services in the rational way, it is necessary to learn the complicated set of implications resulting from three areas covering the theoretical knowledge, practical ones as well as the regulation by the law. 	Methods: The triad of three concepts: theory, practice and regulation is the main area of consideration in relation to tasks of the logistic support provided by any organization for any production process. The aim of this paper focuses on the necessity of taking into account implications among theory, practice and regulation during the process of analyzing, designing and implementation of systems of the logistic support. The lack of awareness of differences between various implications or ignoring them must lead to irrational behaviors. 	Results: The implications among theory, practice and legislative regulation of logistics presented differently than usually, broaden the logistic knowledge {{and at the same time}} provide the tool of the rationalization of logistic services in all kinds of activities. 	Conclusions: The correct identification of tasks and functions of the logistics leads to the recognition of its subject and tasks and correct identification of implications occurring among theory, practice and regulation. This knowledge is indispensable in the process of creation of <b>projects</b> of <b>logistic</b> services of each activity, both business and non-business one...|$|R
