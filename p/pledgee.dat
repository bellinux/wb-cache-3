500|$|The {{general rule}} was that anyone with an {{interest}} in the safety of the thing stolen may sue. It could be that the owner did not have a sufficient interest to bring an action. If one person had a positive right in a thing, such as a <b>pledgee,</b> usufructory, or good faith possessor, both he and the owner could sue. The unsecured creditor could not. Those obliged by contract to return the thing, and other forms of [...] "negative interest", had an action available at the expense of owner. This was only true so long as the person obliged was solvent [...] that is, under a real risk of losing out by a theft. If the person obliged was insolvent, the owner would have an action instead. The plaintiff with a negative interest was precluded from an action if it was by his own fault (dolus), or other dishonest. The lower standard of care required of a depositee meant he could not be sued by a depositor, and so had no action available for furtum. A vendor, who had agreed a price but not delivered his thing, retained legal ownership of the thing. Thus if the thing was stolen, the vendor had the action on the theft because he was liable to the purchaser.|$|E

This fact helps the <b>pledgees</b> to buy the former pledges in public auctions themselves at a price much lower than their fair market value.

40|$|Rather than {{providing}} {{incentives for}} the one-time purchase of technologies, behavior change programs rely on low- or no- cost actions {{to save energy}} and reduce demand. These actions must be sustained over {{time in order to}} be effective. Therefore, understanding the persistence of energy-saving actions is critical to incorporating behavior change programs into utility energy efficiency program portfolios. Unfortunately, there are few studies that have examined persistence of energy-saving actions over time. This paper provides new results from an evaluation of a community-based energy efficiency program showing sustained energy efficiency behaviors over an 18 -month time frame. Actions were sustained despite limited program follow-up and no financial incentives. The program, which is designed to encourage community members to commit to saving energy by signing a pledge form, uses a multi-pronged approach to reach out to as many community members as possible, and reinforces messages by relying on a variety of marketing efforts. These efforts include mass marketing, outreach at community events, and contests. Using a panel study with a random sample of <b>pledgees,</b> evaluators were able to ask <b>pledgees</b> about their energy-savings behaviors four times over the course of 18 months. Results showed that participants conducted low-cost and no-cost actions, and they sustained these actions over time. Participants most commonly reported taking the following actions since pledging: switching off lights, switching off electronics, installing energy efficient lights, using computer power management, changing thermostat settings, and using a clothesline rather than a clothes dryer. Respondents who could recall their pledge were more likely to conduct their pledged action(s) compared to those respondents who could not recall their pledge. Furthermore, “high recallers” completed a significantly greater proportion of pledged actions compared to “low recallers. ” This paper includes a description of the program model, detailed results related to sustained behaviors over time, and recommendations for encouraging persistence and implementing behavior change programs. The authors also offer recommendations for setting up tracking systems early in the program launch to facilitate a more detailed understanding of pathways to program participation and behavior change...|$|R

Addressing this deficiency, this study uses netnography to investigate boycott motivations and perceived boycott participation costs by analyzing consumer comments submitted to an online boycott petition. The results show that boycott <b>pledgees</b> explicitly express their desire for the target to abolish its egregious behavior, their anger about the behavior in question, and their desire for punitive actions. Signatories also pledge participation for moral reasons and identify with the cause reflected by the boycott. Boycott motivations also include the belief that consumers {{have the power to}} impact the boycott target's bottom line and/or behavior as well as the belief that the boycott will succeed in forcing the target to cease its egregious behavior.

50|$|The major flaw {{with the}} pledge {{is that it}} {{requires}} physical possession by the <b>pledgee,</b> which traps a business pledgor in a paradox. Unless the <b>pledgee</b> literally occupies the same premises as the pledger, the collateral once transferred is unavailable for the pledgor to operate its business and generate income to repay the <b>pledgee.</b> Lawyers in many jurisdictions tried to get around this problem with creative devices like conditional sales and trust receipts (see below) with varying results.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pledgee,</b> {{if he was}} in {{physical}} control of the object (as was usually the case) was required to safeguard the thing. Like the borrower, a <b>pledgee</b> was held to the culpa levis in abstracto standard; again, this may have developed from custodia. The pledgor was liable for damage done by his thing deposited, if he acted without the care of a bonus paterfamilias. If the <b>pledgee</b> fell short of the expected standard, the contract was terminated immediately. The <b>pledgee</b> could claim for expenses incurred in maintaining the thing (such as an animal or slave). The <b>pledgee</b> had to set any profits derived from the thing against the outstanding debt. The pledge was repaid when the debt was settled, along with any accretions. The pledgor had no action without repayment. The <b>pledgee</b> did not have ownership, and therefore could not sell or destroy the thing, which was restrictive. A right of sale was typically agreed between the parties, to come into effect after a set time. So common was this that it was often considered implied. The amount would be deducted from the debt, interest and expenses added, and this could then be sued for under whichever contract had formed the debt.|$|E
50|$|As {{the pledge}} {{is for the}} benefit of both parties, the <b>pledgee</b> is bound to {{exercise}} only ordinary care over the pledge. The <b>pledgee</b> has the right of selling the pledge if the pledgor fails to make payment at the stipulated time. No right is acquired by the wrongful sale of a pledge except in the case of property passing by delivery, such as money or negotiable securities. In the case of a wrongful sale by a <b>pledgee,</b> the pledgor cannot recover the value of the pledge without a tender of the amount due.|$|E
50|$|The {{disputes}} were solved in 1916 {{and both}} the plant and factories were completed by 1919, producing calcium carbide for a brief time. The village's population briefly rose by 500 workers, but most left shortly thereafter, as financial problems and an accident destroying the pipelines that supplied water from the hydroelectric reservoir brought production to a halt. This forced Bjølvefossen A/S to default on large loans. Large-scale production was only resumed in 1928, when, after the <b>pledgees</b> had established contact with C. Tennant's Sons & Co., Bjølvefossen A/S was given major sales contracts for ferrosilicon to the British steel industry, {{in an effort to}} open a price war with the European ferrosilicon syndicate. Production was briefly hit by the Great depression, but quickly rebounded and a production line for ferrochrome was established in 1934, the same year that the company saw its first profit.|$|R

50|$|A pledge (also {{sometimes}} called a pawn) {{is a form}} of possessory security, and accordingly, the assets which are being pledged need to be physically delivered to the beneficiary of the pledge (the <b>pledgee).</b> Pledges are in commercial contexts used in trading companies (especially, physically, commodity trading), and are still used by pawnbrokers, which, contrary to their old world image, remain a regulated credit industry.|$|E

50|$|Pledge is the pignus of Roman law, {{from which}} most of the modern European-based law on the subject is derived, but is {{generally}} a feature of even the most basic legal systems. It differs from hypothecation and from the more usual mortgage in that the pledge is in the possession of the <b>pledgee.</b> It is similar, however, in that all three can apply to personal and real property. A pledge of personal property is known as a pawn and that of real property is called an antichresis.|$|E
50|$|For {{a pledge}} to come into {{existence}} as a real security right, {{it is essential that}} delivery occur. Delivery can be actual or constructive, but the <b>pledgee</b> must retain possession of the pledged object. The transfer of possession is intended to publicise the fact that a real security right, {{in the form of a}} pledge, has been established over the pledged object. The transfer serves to protect the pledgee's real security right by preventing the pledgor from alienating the pledged object or pledging it to some other person. This is why constitutum possessorium is not permitted.|$|E

50|$|It {{developed}} {{later than}} the similar fiducia, where ownership was transferred as well as possession. Accordingly, the thing could be sold by the owner and deducted from the debt without recourse to the pledgor, and whilst it was owned by <b>pledgee</b> the pledgor had no right of use. It also required a formal conveyance. This {{is in contrast to}} the pignus, which could be carried out by traditio. Fiducia remained popular with lenders who enjoyed increased security, whereas a pignus was more useful to the pledger. Fiducia lasted until the late empire, but was increasingly eclipsed by pignus.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, the lex {{applied only}} where the aggrieved person was the dominus. The praetor {{provided}} an actio utilis, or one in factum, to persons with lesser property {{rights in the}} thing, e.g. the usufructuary, alongside the owner. Damages {{would be based on}} the value of the interest. A bona fide possessor had the action for the full value, but if ultimately sued by the owner, must give up what he had recovered. Under Justinian, but probably not before, a <b>pledgee</b> had it if the debtor was insolvent, or if he had from any cause lost his personal claim against the debtor. In all these cases it lay against the owner himself, as an actio in factum. Secondly, leges did not in themselves apply to persons who were not true Roman citizens but an actio ficticia was given in this case for others. Thirdly, the lex covered only cases of property. Injury of a freeman was thus not within it, as a man was not considered to own his body. The praetor gave an actio utilis to a freeman who, or whose filiusfamilias, had been injured, but not where a freeman was killed.|$|E
