40|$|The {{developing}} renal {{system has}} long been exploited to study the regulation of gene expression during mesenchymal-epithelial transitions. Several transcription factors, including WT 1 and PAX 8, are expressed early in nephrogenesis and {{play a key role}} in this process. The expression of PAX 8 occurs in the induced mesenchyme of the developing kidney prior to the upregulation of WT 1 levels in the same cells. In this report, we assessed whether the Pax- 8 gene <b>product</b> resides <b>upstream</b> <b>of</b> wt 1 in a common regulatory pathway. Transfection studies, as well as gel-shift assays, indicate that PAX 8 transactivates wt 1 through elements within a 38 bp conserved motif, present in human and murine promoters. Two PAX 8 isoforms, generated by alternative splicing at the C-terminus and previously thought to lack transactivation potential, were found to be capable of activating wt 1 expression. We also demonstrate that the endogenous wt 1 promoter can be upregulated by exogenously supplied PAX 8, suggesting that a function of PAX 8 during mesenchymal [...] epithelial cell transition in renal development is to induce wt 1 gene expression...|$|R
40|$|DEFECTS in the NF 1 gene {{have been}} implicated in the {{inherited}} disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by several developmental abnormalities including an increased frequency of benign and malignant tumours of neural crest origin (neurofibromas and neurofibrosarcomas respectively) 1. The NF 1 gene encodes a ubiquitous protein homologous to p 120 GAP, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for {{the products of the}} ras protooncogenes 2 - 6. When expressed in non-mammalian systems, the region of the NF 1 gene homologous to p 120 GAP produces a protein with GAP-like activity 7 - 9. Here we present evidence that the ras proteins in malignant tumour cell lines from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis are in a constitutively activated state, as judged by the guanine nucleotide bound to them, and are necessary for cellular proliferation. These cells contain p 21 ras and p 120 GAP that are both functionally wild type, but barely any functional NF 1 protein. Our results show that the NF 1 protein is normally essential for correct negative regulation of ras proteins in the cell, even in the presence of normal p 120 GAP, and they support the hypothesis that NF 1 is a tumour-suppressor gene whose <b>product</b> acts <b>upstream</b> <b>of</b> ras...|$|R

40|$|The CDC 25 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an {{essential}} component of the RAS-adenylate cyclase pathway. Genetic and biochemical evidence has led to the proposal that the gene <b>product</b> may act <b>upstream</b> <b>of</b> RAS, possibly as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. We report here the cloning, sequencing and characterization of four mutations in the CDC 25 gene. All four are missense mutations which reside within the carboxy-terminal quarter of the single open reading frame found within the gene. Three of the four are missense mutations in the same amino acid codon. A search of protein data bases reveals that the carboxy terminus of the putative CDC 25 gene product {{is similar to that of}} LTE 1, a gene required for growth at low temperature and SCD 25, a suppressor of cdc 25. Taken together these data indicate that the carboxy terminus of CDC 25 plays a critical role in the function of the CDC 25 gene product and that other proteins, such as LTE 1 or SCD 25, may have related activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—System {{reliability}} of a manufacturing process should address effects {{of both the}} manufacturing system (MS) component reliability, and the product quality. In a multi-station manufac-turing process (MMP), the degradation of MS components at an upstream station can cause {{the deterioration of the}} downstream product quality. At the same time, the system component relia-bility can be affected by the deterioration of the incoming <b>product</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>upstream</b> stations. This kind of quality & reliability in-teraction characteristics can be observed in many manufacturing processes such as machining, assembly, and stamping. However, there is no available model to describe this complex relationship be-tween product quality, and MS component reliability. This paper, considering the unique complex characteristics of MMP, proposes a new concept of quality & reliability chain (QR-Chain) effect to describe the complex propagation relationship of the interactio...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{acquired}} resistance (SAR) is a nonspecific defense {{response in}} plants that {{is associated with}} an increase in the endogenous level of salicylic acid (SA) and elevated expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. To identify mutants involved in the regulation of PR genes and the onset of SAR, we transformed Arabidopsis with a reporter gene containing the promoter of a beta- 1, 3 -glucanase-encoding PR gene (BGL 2) and the coding region of beta-glucuronidase (GUS). The resulting transgenic line (BGL 2 -GUS) was mutagenized, and the M 2 progeny were scored for constitutive GUS activity. We report the characterization of one mutant, cpr 1 (constitutive expressor of PR genes), that was identified in this screen and shown by RNA gel blot analysis also to have elevated expression of the endogenous PR genes BGL 2, PR- 1, and PR- 5. Genetic analyses indicated that the phenotype conferred by cpr 1 is caused by a single, recessive nuclear mutation and is suppressed in plants producing a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase, which inactivates SA. Furthermore, biochemical analysis showed that the endogenous level of SA is elevated in the mutant. Finally, the cpr 1 plants were found to be resistant to the fungal pathogen Peronospora parasitica NOCO 2 and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola ES 4326, which are virulent in wild-type BGL 2 -GUS plants. Because the cpr 1 mutation is recessive and associated with an elevated endogenous level of SA, we propose that the CPR 1 gene <b>product</b> acts <b>upstream</b> <b>of</b> SA as a negative regulator of SAR...|$|R

IER 3 was overexpressed in all cases of adenocarcinomas examined, but was not overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Phosphorylated ERK (pERK) was also overexpressed in almost all adenocarcinomas. EGFR and RAS, whose gene <b>product</b> is located <b>upstream</b> <b>of</b> ERK, were sequenced. Activating mutation of EGFR, which is a possible cause of overexpression of IER 3 and pERK, was found only in 5 adenocarcinomas (42 %). No mutation of RAS was found. We further examined the sequences of all exons of B 56 γ gene (PPP 2 R 5 C) and IER 3, but no mutation was found. Using a single nucleotide insertion in intron 1 of PPP 2 R 5 C, which was found in the process of sequencing, allelic deletion of PPP 2 R 5 C was examined. Eight cases were informative (67 %), and the deletion was found in 4 of them (50 %). Three cases having deletion of PPP 2 R 5 C did not have EGFR mutation. Finally, PPP 2 R 5 C deletion or EGFR mutation that could be responsible for IER 3 /pERK overexpression was found in at least 8 cases (67 % or more). This is the first report of a high incidence of deletion of PPP 2 R 5 C in human carcinomas. Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R
40|$|The Hippo {{signaling}} pathway is functionally conserved in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals, and its proposed function is to control tissue homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. The core components are composed of a kinase cascade that culminates with the phosphorylation and inhibition of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP 1). Phospho-YAP 1 is retained in the cytoplasm. In the absence of Hippo signaling, YAP 1 translocates to the nucleus, associates with co-activators TEAD 1 - 4, and functions as a transcriptional factor promoting the expression of key target genes. Components of the Hippo pathway are mutated in human cancers, and deregulation of this pathway {{plays a role in}} tumorigenesis. Loss of the NF 2 tumor suppressor gene is the most common genetic alteration in meningiomas, and the NF 2 gene <b>product,</b> Merlin, acts <b>upstream</b> <b>of</b> the Hippo pathway. Here, we show that primary meningioma tumors have high nuclear expression of YAP 1. In meningioma cells,Merlin expression is associatedwith phosphorylation of YAP 1. Using an siRNA transient knockdown of YAP 1 in NF 2 -mutant meningioma cells, we show that suppression of YAP 1 impaired cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, YAP 1 overexpression led to a strong augment of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth and restriction of cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In addition, expression of YAP 1 in nontransformed arachnoidal cells {{led to the development of}} tumors in nudemice. Together, these findings suggest that inmeningiomas, deregulation of the Hippo pathway is largely observed in primary tumors and that YAP 1 functions as an oncogene promoting meningioma tumorigenesis.
