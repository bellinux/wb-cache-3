40|$|Improving {{nitrogen}} content and enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis are key {{processes involved in}} cellulosic ethanol production. Steam explosion (SE) associated with NH 4 Cl <b>preimpregnation</b> was carried out to investigate effects of the pretreatment on {{nitrogen content}}, enzymatic digestibility, and ethanol production. Results showed that nitrogen content in pretreated samples increased, {{which can be used}} as nitrogen resource for ethanol fermentation. The highest glucose yield of sample pretreated by 1. 4 MPa SE with 90 g/l NH 4 Cl <b>preimpregnation</b> was 62. 64 %, which was 2. 1 and 0. 2 times higher than that of untreated sample and 1. 4 MPa SE pretreated sample, respectively. Ethanol yield of sample pretreated by 1. 1 MPa SE with 135 g/l NH 4 Cl <b>preimpregnation</b> resulted in 1. 93 and 0. 69 times higher than that of untreated sample and 1. 1 MPa SE pretreated sample, respectively. This novel pretreatment improved nitrogen content and enhanced enzymatic digestibility under mild conditions, and could be recommended to further industrial application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{need for}} a low-wear, lightweight, high {{strength}} bearing retainer material with a radiation degradation threshold of 10 to the 9 th power rads (C) prompted development of nonmetallic reinforced polymers of the following types: (1) polybenzimidazole, (2) polyimide, and (3) polyquinoxaline. Retainers were machined from tubular laminates (billets), including reinforcement by either glass or graphite fabric or filament. Fabrication of billets involves hot <b>preimpregnation</b> of the reinforcement fabric or filament with polymer followed by wrapping this prepreg over a heated mandrel to form a tube with the required thickness and length...|$|E
40|$|A {{process is}} {{described}} for constructing for a composite laminate structure which exhibits a high {{resistance to heat}} and flame provides safer interior structures for aircraft and submarine compartments. Composite laminate structures are prepared by the bismaleimide resin <b>preimpregnation</b> of a fiberglass cloth to form a face sheet which is bonded with a bismaleimide hot melt adhesive to a porous core structure selected from the group consisting of polyamide paper and bismaleimide-glass fabric which is filled with carbon microballoons. The carbon microballoons are prepared by pyrolyzing phenolic micro-balloons {{in the presence of}} nitrogen. A slurry of the carbon microballoons is prepared to fill the porous core structure. The porous core structure and face sheet are bonded to provide panel structures exhibiting increased mechanical capacities and lower oxygen limit values and smoke density values...|$|E
40|$|Recycled needle punched jute fiber mats {{as a first}} {{natural fiber}} {{reinforcement}} system and these jute mats used as a core needle punched with recycled jute fabric cloths as skin layers as a second natural fiber reinforcement system were used for unsaturated polyester matrix composites via modifying the hand lay-up technique with resin <b>preimpregnation</b> into the jute fiber in vacuum. The effect of skin jute fabric on the tensile and bending properties of jute mat composites was investigated for different fiber weight contents. Moreover, the notch sensitivity of these composites was also compared by using the characteristic distance do calculated by Finite Element Method (FEM). The {{results showed that the}} tensile and flexural properties of jute mat composites increased by increasing the fiber weight content and by adding the jute fabric as skin layers. On the other hand, by adding the skins, the characteristic distance decreased and, therefore, the notch sensitivity of the composites increased. The fracture behavior investigated by SEM showed that extensive fiber pull-out mechanism was revealed at the tension side of jute mat composites under the bending load and by adding the jute cloth, the failure mode of jute mat was changed to fiber bridge mechanism...|$|E
