5|$|According to {{the view}} that is {{widespread}} among the Russian music public, I am associated with the <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> antagonistic to the one living Russian composer I love and value above all others—Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.... In a word, despite our different musical identities, it would seem we are following a single path; and I, for my part, am proud to have such a fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E
5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} contract on his behalf with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E
5|$|The Hunting Party is {{the sixth}} studio album by American rock band Linkin Park. The album, {{produced}} by band members Mike Shinoda and Brad Delson, {{was released by}} Warner Bros. Records and Machine Shop on June 13, 2014. It is the first album since Meteora (2003) not to be produced with Rick Rubin, after producing the band's previous three studio albums. The title The Hunting Party is a contextual metaphor: Linkin Park is the <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hunting {{to bring back the}} energy and soul of rock.|$|E

25|$|The Alberta Liberal Party {{has a long}} {{heritage}} of adhering to liberalism, in both the classical sense {{and in terms of}} modern Liberalism (see social liberalism).

25|$|Mutual mistake {{occurs when}} both parties of a {{contract}} are mistaken as to the terms. Each believes they are contracting to something different. Courts usually try to uphold such mistakes if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgment does not cause the contract to be voidable by the <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> adversely affected. See Raffles v. Wichelhaus.|$|E
25|$|More {{recent case}} law from the UK tends {{to refer to}} a duty of public {{authorities}} to act fairly rather than to natural justice. One aspect of such a duty is the obligation on authorities in some cases to give effect to procedural legitimate expectations. These are underpinned by the notion that a <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> or will be affected by a decision can expect that he or she will be consulted by the decision-maker before the decision is taken.|$|E

25|$|A <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{aggrieved by}} a {{decision}} of the NLRB can seek review by petitioning in the Court of Appeals. The Act gives parties {{a good deal of}} latitude as to which court they want to hear their case: either the Circuit in which the hearing was held or the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or any Circuit in which one of the parties against whom the complaint was brought resides or does business. The NLRB, as a matter of policy, only petitions in the Circuit in which the hearing was held.|$|E
25|$|With video interpreting, sign {{language}} interpreters work remotely with live {{video and audio}} feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting {{can be used for}} situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> signing.|$|E
500|$|The {{appointment}} {{of the prime}} minister is also, theoretically, governed by the royal prerogative. Technically the monarch may appoint as prime minister anyone she wants to appoint, but in practice the appointee is always the person who commands a majority in the House of Commons. Usually, this {{is the leader of the}} political <b>party</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> returned to Parliament with a majority of seats after a general election. Difficulties may result with a so-called hung parliament, in which no party commands majority support, as last occurred in 2017. In this situation, constitutional convention is that the previous incumbent has the first right to form a coalition government and seek appointment. If the prime minister decides to retire in the middle of a parliamentary session, as Anthony Eden did in 1957, the monarch has no discretion. There is usually a [...] "prime minister-in-waiting" [...] who commands the support of the majority of the Commons; he or she will near-automatically be appointed.|$|E
