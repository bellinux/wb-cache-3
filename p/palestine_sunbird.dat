40|$|Nectarivorous birds feed on dilute sugar {{solutions}} containing trace {{amounts of}} amino acids and electrolytes. To meet their high mass-specific energy demands they must often deal with exceptionally high proportionate water fluxes. Despite nectar intake rates that may reach {{more than five}} times body mass per day, hummingbirds appear to absorb all ingested water. Here, we report the results of experiments designed {{to examine the relationship between}} nectar intake and water turnover in nectar-feeding <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Nectarinia osea). Like hummingbirds, sunbirds ingested large amounts of water. At the lowest sucrose concentration (292 mmol l(- 1)), food intake rates reached 2. 2 times body mass. Fractional and total water turnover increased linearly with water ingestion, but the fraction of ingested water absorbed by sunbirds decreased from 100 % to 36 % with increasing water intake rate. <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbirds</b> may therefore avoid absorbing, and thus having to eliminate, up to 64 % of their ingested water load when feeding on dilute nectars. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of regulation of water flux across the gastrointestinal tract to the body. Our data suggest that sunbirds regulate transepithelial water flux independently of sugar absorption. These intriguing results open the door to many questions about how water transport is regulated in the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract. We suggest that intestinal water and body water form two separate but interacting pools in nectar-feeding birds. Convergence in diet has led to the evolution of many similar traits in hummingbirds and sunbirds. The physiological traits of these two groups that allow the processing of a water and sugar diet, however, may be very different. Todd J. McWhorter, Carlos Martínez del Rio and Berry Pinsho...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2004 Company of BiologistsAlthough the renal {{responses}} of birds to dehydration have received significant attention, {{the consequences of}} ingesting and processing large quantities of water have been less studied. Nectar-feeding birds must often deal with exceptionally high water intake rates {{in order to meet}} their high mass-specific energy demands. Birds that ingest large volumes of water may either eliminate excess water in the kidney or regulate the volume of water absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Because water absorption in the gastrointestinal tract of <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Nectarinia osea) decreases with increasing water ingestion rate, we predicted that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in these birds would not be unusually high in spite of large ingested water loads. When feeding on dilute sucrose solutions, sunbirds ingested between 4 and 6 times their body mass in nectar per day, yet they were able to compensate for varying nectar energy density and increased thermoregulatory energy demands with no apparent difficulty. GFR was lower than predicted (1976. 22 ± 91. 95 µl h- 1), and was not exceptionally sensitive to water loading. Plasma glucose concentrations were high, and varied 1. 8 -fold between fasted (16. 08 ± 0. 75 mmol l- 1) and fed (28. 18 ± 0. 68 mmol l- 1) sunbirds, but because GFR was low, glucose filtered load also remained relatively low. Essentially the entire glucose filtered load (98 %) was recovered by the kidney. Renal fractional water reabsorption (FWR) decreased from 0. 98 to 0. 64 with increasing water intake. The ability of <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbirds</b> to reduce the absorption of ingested water in the gastrointestinal tract may resolve the potential conflict between filtering a large excess of absorbed water in the kidney and simultaneously retaining filtered metabolites.

40|$|Parent <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Nectarinia osea) feed on flower nectar {{that is not}} fed {{to their}} nestlings. This {{phenomenon}} provided {{a unique opportunity to}} manipulate self-feeding rates of parent birds independently of the rate at which they feed arthropod prey to their offspring. Based on provisioning models, we predicted that parents would invest more in their young as the energy content of their own food increased. From our earlier work, we also predicted that the levels of sex-specific activities of males and females would differ as the energy content of their food increased. Sunbird pairs with two or three nestlings were provided with feeders containing a low-, medium- or high-concentration sucrose solution. As the sugar concentration increased, the females delivered arthropods at a greater rate to their nestlings, removed proportionally more faecal sacs and spent longer at the nest, while the males increased their mobbing effort. Nestling food intake and body mass, but not tarsus length or bill size, were larger in small broods than in large broods, and increased with increasing feeder sugar concentration. These results imply that increasing the energy content of food consumed by parent sunbirds allows them to increase the rate at which other foods are delivered to their young and to increase other parental care activities as well. The results also add credence to the idea that behavioural decisions reflect life-history trade-offs between parental self-feeding and investment in current young...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbird</b> or {{northern}} {{orange-tufted sunbird}} (Cinnyris osea) {{is a small}} passerine bird of the sunbird family which is found {{in parts of the}} Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also known as orange-tufted sunbird, a name which is also used for the similar orange-tufted sunbird (Cinnyris bouvieri), found further south in Africa.

50|$|The <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbird</b> is 8 to 12 cm {{long with}} a {{wingspan}} of 14 to 16 cm. Males {{have an average}} weight of 7.6 g and females weigh around 6.8 g. The bill is fairly long, black and curves downwards. The plumage of breeding males is mostly dark but appears glossy blue or green in the light. There are orange tufts {{at the sides of}} the breast which are hard to see except at close range. Females and juveniles are grey-brown above with pale underparts. Non-breeding males are similar but may retain some dark feathers.|$|E
40|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between parents}} feeding {{themselves and their}} young is an important life history problem that can be considered in terms of optimal behavioral strategies. Recent studies on birds have tested how parents allocate the food between themselves and their young. Until now the effect of food consumption by parent birds on their food delivery to their young {{as well as other}} parental activities has rarely been studied. I have previously shown that parent <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Nectarinia osea) will consume nectar and liquidized arthropods from artificial feeders. However, they will only feed their young with whole arthropods. This provided a unique opportunity to experimentally manipulate the food eaten by parents independent of that fed to their offspring. Here, I hypothesized that parents invest in their current young according to the quality of food that they themselves consume. Breeding pairs with two or three nestlings were provided with feeders containing water (control), sucrose solution (0. 75 mol) or liquidized mealworms mixed with sucrose solution (0. 75 mol). As food quality in feeders increased (from water up to liquidized mealworms mixed with sucrose solution) : 1) Parents (especially females) increased their food delivery of whole arthropod prey to their young. 2) Only males increased their nest guarding effort. Nestling food intake and growth rate increased with increasing food quality of parents and decreasing brood size. These results imply that increasing the nutrient content of foods consumed by parent sunbirds allow them to increase the rate at which other foods are delivered to their young and to increase the time spent on other parental care activities...|$|R

40|$|Although most {{birds are}} {{accustomed}} to making short flights, particularly during foraging, the flight patterns during these short periods of activity differ between species. Nectarivorous birds, in particular, often spend time hovering, while non-nectarivorous birds do not. The cost of short flights is likely therefore to differ between nectarivorous and non-nectarivorous birds because of the different energetic contributions of different flight types to the behaviour. The 13 C-labelled bicarbonate technique {{was used to measure}} the energy cost of short flights in the nectarivorous <b>Palestine</b> <b>sunbird</b> Nectarinia osea (mean mass 6. 17 ± 0. 16 g, N= 8) and the non-nectarivorous starling Sturnus vulgaris (mean mass 70. 11 ± 1. 11 g, N= 9). The technique was initially calibrated in five individuals for each species at temperatures ranging from 1 to 35 °C, by comparing the isotope elimination rate to the metabolic rate measured simultaneously by indirect calorimetry. The cost for short intermittent flight was then measured by encouraging birds to fly between two perches at either end of a narrow corridor (perch distance for sunbirds, 6 m; for starlings, 5 m), and measuring the amount of isotope eliminated during the flight. The isotope elimination rate was interpolated onto the calibration equation to predict flight cost, as a direct calibration could not be performed during flight. Mean energy expenditure during flight was 1. 64 ± 0. 32 W in sunbirds, while in starlings the flight costs averaged 20. 6 ± 0. 78 W. Energy cost of flight relative to basal metabolic rate was substantially greater in the starling than the sunbird. Phylogenetic analysis of different modes of flight in these and additional species suggests that differences in flight behaviour may cause these elevated costs in slow flying non-nectarivores such as starlings, compared to birds that are more prone to short intermittent flights like the sunbirds. ...|$|E
