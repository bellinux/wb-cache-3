2500|$|A super bolus is {{a method}} of {{increasing}} the spike of the standard bolus.

[...] This facilitates the [...] "borrowing" [...] of the basal insulin and including it into the bolus spike to deliver the same total insulin with faster action than can be achieved with spike and basal rate together. [...] The super bolus is useful for certain foods (like sugary breakfast cereals) which cause a large <b>post-prandial</b> peak of blood sugar. [...] It attacks the blood sugar peak with the fastest delivery of insulin that can be practically achieved by pumping.|$|E
6000|$|Dear me! These {{reflections}} to-day {{are anything}} but <b>post-prandial.</b> The gnocchi and the olives must certainly have disagreed with me. But perhaps it may some of it be [...] "wrote sarcastic." [...] I have heard tell there is a thing called irony.|$|E
60|$|True to {{that promise}} {{and his own}} instinctive promptings the master {{endeavored}} to atone for his momentary disloyalty by greater solicitude for M'liss. But the child had noticed some change in the master's thoughtful manner, {{and in one of}} their long <b>post-prandial</b> walks she stopped suddenly, and mounting a stump, looked full in his face with big searching eyes.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} Mr. Silk's sudden and {{unexpected}} assertion of his marital rights Mr. Kybird {{stood in the}} doorway of his shop, basking in the sun. The High Street {{was in a state of}} <b>post-prandial</b> repose, and there was no likelihood of a customer to interfere with his confidential chat with Mr. Nathan Smith, who was listening with an aspect of great severity to his explanations.|$|E
60|$|Three days Alaric Tudor had now {{passed with}} Mr. Neverbend, {{and not only}} three days but three evenings also! A man may endure to be bored {{in the course of}} {{business}} through the day, but it becomes dreadful when the infliction is extended to <b>post-prandial</b> hours. It does not often occur that one is doomed to bear the same bore both by day and night; any change gives some ease; but poor Alaric for three days had had no change. He felt like a liberated convict as he stepped freely forth into the sweet evening air, and made his way through the town to the opposition inn.|$|E
60|$|We {{rose from}} table. Cigars went round. We adjourned to the smoking-room. It was a Moorish marvel, with Oriental hangings. There, Senator Wrengold and Charles {{exchanged}} reminiscences of bonanzas and ranches and other exciting <b>post-prandial</b> topics; while the magazine editor cut in {{now and again}} with a pertinent inquiry or a quaint and sarcastic parallel instance. It was clear he had an eye to future copy. Only Algernon Coleyard sat brooding and silent, with his chin on one hand, and his brow intent, musing and gazing at the embers in the fireplace. The hand, by the way, was remarkable for a curious, antique-looking ring, apparently of Egyptian or Etruscan workmanship, with a projecting gem of several large facets. Once only, {{in the midst of}} a game of whist, he broke out with a single comment.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the sake}} of peace and quiet Denis had retired earlier on this same {{afternoon}} to his bedroom. He wanted to work, but the hour was a drowsy one, and lunch, so recently eaten, weighed heavily on body and mind. The meridian demon was upon him; he was possessed by that bored and hopeless <b>post-prandial</b> melancholy which the coenobites of old knew and feared {{under the name of}} [...] "accidie." [...] He felt, like Ernest Dowson, [...] "a little weary." [...] He was in the mood to write something rather exquisite and gentle and quietist in tone; something a little droopy and at the same time--how should he put it?--a little infinite. He thought of Anne, of love hopeless and unattainable. Perhaps that was the ideal kind of love, the hopeless kind--the quiet, theoretical kind of love. In this sad mood of repletion he could well believe it. He began to write. One elegant quatrain had flowed from beneath his pen: ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{few weeks}} later, when Ernest's {{remarkable}} article on 'How to Improve the Homes of the Poor' appeared {{in one of}} the leading magazines, Mr. Herbert Le Breton of the Education Office looked up from his cup of <b>post-prandial</b> coffee in his comfortable dining-room at South Kensington, and said musingly to his young wife, 'Do you know, Ethel, {{it seems to me that}} my brother Ernest's going to score a success at last with this slum-hunting business that he's lately invented. There's an awful lot about it now in all the papers and reviews. Perhaps it might be as well, after all, to scrape an acquaintance with him again, especially as he's my own brother. There's no knowing, really, when a man of his peculiar ill-regulated mercurial temperament may be going to turn out famous. Don't you think you'd better find out where they're living now--they've left Holloway, no doubt, since this turn of the tide--and go and call upon Mrs. Ernest?' ...|$|E
60|$|And then {{he again}} {{repeated}} his question, asking for his father's advice {{under the present}} circumstances. The conversation was a very long one, as long as to disarrange all Lady Arabella's plans. She had determined to take her son most stringently to task that very evening; and with this object had ensconced herself in the small drawing-room which had formerly been used for a similar purpose by the august countess herself. Here she now sat, having desired Augusta and Beatrice, {{as well as the}} twins, to beg Frank to go to her as soon as he should come out of the dining-room. Poor lady! there she waited till ten o'clock,--tealess. There was not much of the Bluebeard about the squire; but he had succeeded in making it understood through the household that he was not to be interrupted by messages from his wife during the <b>post-prandial</b> hour, which, though no toper, he loved so well.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{what those}} {{proposals}} were does not concern {{the essentials of}} this story. Suffice it that they were designed {{in a spirit of}} infinite benevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be called <b>post-prandial.</b> Suffice it, too, that the problem of Winch remained unsolved. Nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment. There were astonishing changes. The small hours found Mr. Maydig and Mr. Fotheringay careering across the chilly market square under the still moon, in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr. Maydig all flap and gesture, Mr. Fotheringay short and bristling, and no longer abashed at his greatness. They had reformed every drunkard in the Parliamentary division, changed all the beer and alcohol to water (Mr. Maydig had overruled Mr. Fotheringay on this point); they had, further, greatly improved the railway communication of the place, drained Flinder's swamp, improved the soil of One Tree Hill, and cured the vicar's wart. And they were going to see what could be done with the injured pier at South Bridge. [...] "The place," [...] gasped Mr. Maydig, [...] "won't be the same place to-morrow. How surprised and thankful everyone will be!" [...] And just at that moment the church clock struck three.|$|E
6000|$|Why is this? [...] "Young people {{nowadays}} want {{to begin}} where their fathers left off." [...] "Men are made so comfortable at present in their clubs." [...] "College-bred girls have no taste for housekeeping." [...] "Rents are so high and manners so luxurious." [...] Good heavens, what silly trash, what puerile nonsense! Are we all little boys and girls, I ask you, that we are to put one another off with such transparent humbug? Here {{we have to deal}} with a primitive instinct--the profoundest and deepest-seated instinct of humanity, save only the instincts of food and drink and of self-preservation. Man, like all other animals, has two main functions: to feed his own organism, and to reproduce his species. Ancestral habit leads him, when mature, to choose himself a mate--because he loves her. It drives him, it urges him, it goads him irresistibly. If this profound impulse is really lacking to-day in any large part of our race, there must be some correspondingly profound and adequate reason for it. Don't let us deceive ourselves with shallow platitudes which may do for drawing-rooms. This is philosophy, even though <b>post-prandial.</b> Let us try to take a philosophic view of the question at issue, from the point of vantage of a biological outlook.|$|E
60|$|The {{court was}} roofed with glass; the April air was mild; {{the cry of}} women selling violets {{came in from the}} street and, {{mingling}} with the rich hum of Paris, seemed to bring with it faintly the odour of the flowers. There were other odours in the place, warm succulent and Parisian, which ranged from fried fish to burnt sugar; and there were many things besides: little tables for the <b>post-prandial</b> coffee; piles of luggage inscribed (after the initials or frequently the name) R. P. Scudamore or D. Jackson Hodge, Philadelphia Pa., or St. Louis Mo.; rattles of unregarded bells, flittings of tray-bearing waiters, conversations with the second-floor windows of admonitory landladies, arrivals of young women with coffinlike bandboxes covered with black oil-cloth and depending from a strap, sallyings-forth of persons staying and arrivals just afterwards of other persons to see them; together with vague prostrations on benches of tired heads of American families. It was to this last element that Mr. Dosson himself in some degree contributed, but it must be added that he had not the extremely bereft and exhausted appearance of certain of his fellows. There was an air of ruminant resignation, of habitual accommodation in him; but you would have guessed that he was enjoying a holiday rather than aching for a truce, and he was not so enfeebled but {{that he was able to}} get up from time to time and stroll through the porte cochere to have a look at the street.|$|E
6000|$|Botanists tell us {{that they}} are, or rather {{may have been in}} old times, akin to myrtles. If so, they have taken a grand and {{original}} line of their own, and persevered in it for ages, till they have specialised themselves to a condition far in advance of most myrtles, in size, beauty, and use. They may be known from all other trees by one mark--their large handsome flowers. A group of the innumerable stamens have grown together {{on one side of the}} flower into a hood, which bends over the stigma and the other stamens. [...] Tall trees they are, and glorious to behold, when in full flower; but they are notorious mostly for their huge fruits and delicious nuts. One of their finest forms, and the only one which the traveller is likely to see often in Trinidad, is the Cannon-ball tree. {227} There is a grand specimen in the Botanic Garden; and several may be met with in any day's ride through the high woods, and distinguished at once from any other tree. The stem rises, without a fork, for sixty feet or more, and rolls out at the top into a head very like that of an elm trimmed up, and like an elm too in its lateral water-boughs. For the whole of the stem, from the very ground to the forks, and the larger fork-branches likewise, are feathered all over with numberless short prickly pendent branchlets, which roll outward, and then down, and then up again in graceful curves, and carry large pale crimson flowers, each with a pink hood in the middle, looking like a new-born baby's fist. Those flowers, when torn, turn blue on exposure to the light; and when they fall, leave behind them the cannon-ball, a rough brown globe, as big as a thirty two pound shot, which you must get down with a certain caution, lest that befall you which befell a certain gallant officer on the mainland of America. For, fired with a <b>post-prandial</b> ambition to obtain a cannon ball, he took to himself a long bamboo, and poked at the tree. He succeeded: but not altogether as he had hoped. For the cannon ball, in coming down, avenged itself by dropping exactly on the bridge of his nose, felling him to the ground, and giving him such a pair of black eyes that he was not seen on parade for a fortnight.|$|E
6000|$|December 21st.--On Thursday evening I dined for {{the first}} time with the new Mayor at the Town Hall. I wish to {{preserve}} all the characteristic traits of such banquets, because, being peculiar to England, these municipal feasts may do well to picture in a novel. There was a big old silver tobacco-box, nearly or quite as large round as an ordinary plate, out of which the dignitaries of Liverpool used to fill their pipes, while sitting in council or after their dinners. The date [...] "1690" [...] was on the lid. It is now used as a snuff-box, and wends its way, from guest to guest, round the table. We had turtle, and, among other good things, American canvasback ducks. [...] . These dinners are certainly a good institution, and likely to be promotive of good feeling; the Mayor giving them often, and inviting, in their turn, all the respectable and eminent citizens of whatever political bias. About fifty gentlemen were present that evening. I had the post of honor at the Mayor's right hand; and France, Turkey, and Austria were toasted before the Republic, for, as the Mayor whispered me, he must first get his allies out of the way. The Turkish Consul and the Austrian both made better English speeches than any Englishman, during the evening; for it is inconceivable what shapeless and ragged utterances Englishmen are content to put forth, without attempting anything like a wholeness; but inserting a patch here and a patch there, and finally getting out what they wish to say, indeed, but in most disorganized guise. [...] . I can conceive of very high enjoyment in making a speech; one is in such a curious sympathy with his audience, feeling instantly how every sentence affects them, and wonderfully excited and encouraged by the sense that it has gone to the right spot. Then, too, the imminent emergency, when a man is overboard, and must sink or swim, sharpens, concentrates, and invigorates the mind, and causes matters of thought and sentiment to assume shape and expression, though, perhaps, it seemed hopeless to express them, just before you rose to speak. Yet I question much whether public speaking tends to elevate the orator, intellectually or morally; the effort, of course, being to say what is immediately received by the audience, and to produce an effect on the instant. I don't quite see how an honest man can be a good and successful orator; but I shall hardly undertake to decide the question on my merely <b>post-prandial</b> experience.|$|E
