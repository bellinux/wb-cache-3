5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's <b>propellor</b> and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Hagerstrom was {{credited}} with 14.5 victories: 6 in World War II and 8.5 in the Korean war. He is one of seven American pilots to achieve ace status flying <b>propellor</b> planes in World War II and jets in the Korean War. The others are George Andrew Davis Jr., Gabby Gabreski, Vermont Garrison, Harrison Thyng, and William T. Whisner Jr., all Air Force pilots, as well as John F. Bolt of the U.S. Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat when he did a U-turn that resulted in his teammate being thrown off his skis and into the water. The boat's <b>propellor</b> then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band {{received}} its record deal, the band underwent {{a series of}} misfortunes when Olander, Johnson, and Williams came down with health problems. On August 9, 1990, Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday, severely cutting his left thumb. Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the band's tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne. On September 6, four weeks after Johnson's accident, Williams was water skiing {{with his family in}} Cookeville, Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up. The <b>propellor</b> slashed Williams' legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries. Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg (Danny Gregg's brother, and a member of Restless Heart) substituted for Williams. Meanwhile, Olander discovered that he had a lemon-sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus. The tumor was never successfully diagnosed, although it ultimately vanished.|$|E
5|$|Following this duty, {{the ship}} sailed for Hawaii, {{where she was}} used as a prop in the movie Mister Roberts. The ship {{returned}} to San Diego in November. Remaining in the area for four months, Philippine Sea conducted several training operations off the California coast. She then began her fifth cruise of the Far East on 1 April 1955 en route to Yokosuka. She operated in waters of Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan for most of 1955, with Air Task Group 2 consisting of VF-123, VF-143 and VA-55, VF-123 flying the F9F-2 Panther jet fighter-bomber, VF-143 flying the Grumman F9F-6 Cougar jet fighter, and VA-55 flying the AD-6 Skyraider <b>propellor</b> attack bomber. During this time, she made trips to Hong Kong, Keelung and Formosa. On 23 November, she was redesignated as a CVS, or an anti-submarine warfare carrier. Her aircraft complement was replaced with several dozen S2F Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and HSS-1 Seabat helicopters. She returned to San Diego on 23 November 1955. Throughout 1956 she saw little activity as crew went on leave and she was docked for upkeep, and only conducted several routine training operations off the coast of southern California. In late 1956 she moved to Hawaii for more training operations.|$|E

25|$|As {{seen from}} the vantage point of the air stream (e.g. by a balloonist), the wheels impede the vehicle—decelerating the earth imperceptibly—and drive the rotor (acting like a <b>propellor),</b> which accelerates the air and propels the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Loss {{of engine}} power of wing mount <b>propellor</b> {{aircraft}} and blown lift aircraft affects the lift distribution over the wing, causing a roll toward the inoperative engine. In some aircraft roll authority is more limiting than rudder authority in determining VMCs.|$|E
