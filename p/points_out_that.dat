5|$|Franklin <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the {{technological}} nature of war requires states to conscript the {{resources needed to}} pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.|$|E

5|$|Treadgold's {{claim that}} Diocletian {{increased}} the army's numbers by over 50% is considered implausible by Heather, who <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> even 33% {{would have required}} a Herculean effort.|$|E
5000|$|The {{report was}} criticized by leading {{alternative}} medicine expert Edzard Ernst, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it was inaccurate, grossly misleading and <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> [...] "its conclusions were written before the authors had searched for evidence that might match them". The editor of The Lancet Richard Horton <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the report contained dangerous nonsense.|$|R
50|$|Other criticisms <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{these studies}} have been small scale, with conspicuously shallow {{participant}} pools and lopsided gender distributions.

50|$|Yanukovych {{was seen}} by opponents as {{representing}} the interests of Ukraine big business; they <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> his campaigns have benefited from backing by Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov. Supporters of Yanukovych <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Donetsk Oblast (province) secured unprecedented levels of investment during his governorship.|$|R

In the final scenes, Meredith reunites with her kids.|$|E
5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E

However, as the office leaves for the day, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) gives Erin a Dothraki farewell.|$|E

5000|$|The {{takedown}} sparked dialogue among opinion writers. The website's {{critics have}} defended their actions {{based on the}} fact that the intellectual property owners did not directly authorize the website. Its defenders <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the owners did authorize the loaning out of the ebooks and that ignorance of the terms and conditions would not exempt the authors from them. [...] One commentator <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the takedown was a direct side effect of Digital Rights Management. They <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> few people would have complained if people were swapping physical copies of books.|$|R

This interpretation is closely related to the ballistic annihilation view of rule 184: in Wolfram's interpretation, an open parenthesis corresponds to a left-moving particle while a close parenthesis corresponds to a right-moving particle.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Stegall later {{noted that}} the {{penultimate}} scene, which features federal agents raiding the religious compound and finding that everyone inside has committed suicide, bears similarities to the Waco siege. Stegall even <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the real name of the church leader in the episode, Vernon Warren, also resembles {{the name of the}} compound leader during the Waco siege: Vernon Wayne.|$|E
5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the {{painting}} depicts more figures {{than had been}} on the raft {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.|$|E

5|$|The {{case for}} {{excluding}} Oswiu from {{any role in}} Wighard's election {{is based on the}} theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection. The historian Nicholas Brooks <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian's letter, Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit's replacement, not least of which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid, who was in Kent and Mercia at the time, not be selected as the new archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu's involvement in Wighard's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo-Saxon church, and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric. Brooks <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium. As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy, Wighard's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Ted Johnson Smith <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Codicellus {{has strong}} parallels to the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto. The Historia {{was written in}} Durham in the mid-10th century, and {{is a history of}} the monastery of St. Cuthbert from foundation until about 945. Like the Codicellus, it is a narrative concerned mainly to defend the patrimony of the monks against depredations.|$|E
5|$|Violent crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims.

50|$|Some {{commentators}} have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the complex design of scissor section flats {{leads to a}} more complex, and costly, construction process while architects have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the use of so many flights of stairs and the half-storey design means that this form of layout would not meet modern building regulations around accessibility.|$|R
5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used {{to imply}} that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50years of neglect. Schiff <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach {{in the years after}} his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few more}} adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> {{during the}} Bronze Age {{the region was}} inhabited by populations that probably spoke a northwestern Greek dialect. Archaeologists have found pottery objects of the early Iron Age in Gjirokastër, which {{first appeared in the}} late Bronze Age in Pazhok, Elbasan County, and are found throughout Albania. The earliest recorded inhabitants of the area around Gjirokastër were the Greek-speaking tribe of the Chaonians, that belonged to the Epirote group.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and subpar games.

Following {{the release of}} Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Burton <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> many {{conservative}} {{critics and}} magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it {{only for its}} non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E
