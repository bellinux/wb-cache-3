5|$|In {{support of}} the album, the Furs {{launched}} a concert tour beginning in the UK, with their performance at the Hammersmith Odeon (10 October) broadcast live on BBC Radio One. The tour included the session players Gary Windo and Ann Sheldon, {{as well as the}} keyboard player Ed Buller. One <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not come with them was Vince Ely, whose long-simmering dissatisfaction with the band finally led to his departure, just after the album's recording was completed. Ely was replaced as drummer by Phill Calvert, formerly of The Birthday Party.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed at children, and {{tended to focus on}} her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E

25|$|During the Roman Republic, {{the term}} peregrinus simply denoted any <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not hold Roman citizenship, full or partial, whether {{that person was}} under Roman rule or not. Technically, this {{remained}} the case during the Imperial era. But in practice the term became limited to subjects of the Empire, with inhabitants of regions outside the Empire's borders denoted barbari (barbarians).|$|E

25|$|In western {{classical}} antiquity, theism was {{the fundamental}} belief {{that supported the}} legitimacy of the state (the polis, later the Roman Empire). Historically, any <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not believe in any deity supported by the state was fair game to accusations of atheism, a capital crime. For political reasons, Socrates in Athens (399 BCE) was accused of being atheos ("refusing to acknowledge the gods recognized by the state").|$|E
25|$|The {{appearances}} of former Australian cricketer Don Bradman {{in popular culture}} are many and varied. As a player, {{he first came to}} prominence during the 1928/29 season. His record-breaking performances on the 1930 tour of England made him a national hero in Australia. Ironically, Bradman was a private <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not enjoy the adulation associated with his fame. In cricket, a batsman who enjoys an exceptional run of form over an extended period is sometimes called Bradmanesque.|$|E
25|$|Hans Mayer, {{along with}} Walter Benjamin, {{who was also}} {{with him at the}} Collège de Sociologie, and some others, belongs to the most {{important}} literary critics of the 20th century. Perhaps there is some correlation to a former competitive situation, which Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote about in an obituary, which shows Mayer's life in an unflattering light. Reich-Ranicki describes the story of Hans Mayer's life as a tragic story, as the story of a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not find a home anywhere.|$|E

25|$|Qiao Xuan {{was known}} to be an {{impatient}} and impulsive <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not take the big picture into consideration. However, he led a humble and simple life, and treated people with respect. He did not abuse his status and power by helping any of his family members and relatives gain high-ranking positions in the civil service. When he died, his family did not own much property and no funeral was held for him. His humility earned him praise at the time.|$|E
25|$|To {{discourage}} Poles {{from giving}} shelter to Jews, the Germans often searched houses and introduced ruthless penalties. Poland {{was the only}} occupied country during World War II where the Nazis formally imposed {{the death penalty for}} anybody found sheltering and helping Jews. The penalty applied not only to the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the helping, but also extended to his or her family, neighbors and sometimes to entire villages. In this way Germans applied the principle of collective responsibility whose purpose was to encourage neighbors to inform on each other in order to avoid punishment. The nature of these policies was widely known and visibly publicized by the Nazis who sought to terrorize the Polish population.|$|E
25|$|The Mufti, Hajj Amin al-Husseini and his {{supporters}} directed a Jihad against any <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not obey the Mufti. Their national struggle was a religious holy war, and the incarnation of both the Palestinian Arab nation and Islam was Hajj Amin al-Husseini. Anyone who rejected his leadership was a heretic and his life was forfeit. After the Peel report publication, the murders of Arabs leaders who opposed the Mufti were accelerated. Pressed by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels {{at the behest of}} the Husseini leadership, the opposition had a security cooperation with the Jews. The flight of wealthy Arabs, which occurred during the revolt, was also replicated in 1947–49.|$|E

500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong {{would be the}} first person on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." [...] At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography.|$|E
500|$|Polish {{historian}} Henryk Samsonowicz echoes Michnik's {{essay in}} his introduction to a recent (2008) edition of Trzej kronikarze, describing Jasienica as a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> much to popularize Polish history. Hungarian historian Balázs Trencsényi notes that [...] "Jasienica's impact of the formation of the popular interpretation of Polish history is hard to overestimate". British historian Norman Davies, himself an author of a popular account of Polish history (God's Playground), notes that Jasienica, while more of [...] "a historical writer than an academic historian", had [...] "formidable talents", gained [...] "much popularity" [...] and that his works would find no equals in the time of communist Poland. Samsonowicz notes that Jasienica [...] "was a brave writer", going against prevailing system, and willing to propose new hypotheses and reinterpret history in innovative ways. Michnik notes how Jasienica was willing to write about Polish mistakes, for example in the treatment of Cossacks. Ukrainian historian Stephen Velychenko also positively commented on Jasienica's extensive coverage of the Polish-Ukrainian history. Both Michnik and Samsonowicz note how Jasienica's works contain hidden messages in which Jasienica discusses more contemporary history, such as in his Rozważania....|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{discussion}} after the match centred around referee Terje Hauge's decision to send off Lehmann. Football pundit Mark Lawrenson stated: [...] "The game changed when Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger agreed: [...] "When Jens Lehmann got sent off, that left us with 70 minutes to play with ten against eleven, against a team that retains the ball very well". He refused to openly criticise this decision, although he did criticise the decision to award Barcelona's first goal, as he felt that Samuel Eto'o was offside. Wenger was also adamant that his young side would bounce back from the defeat. One <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> criticise the referee was Thierry Henry, stating: [...] "I was kicked all over the place. I expected the referee to do his job. I don't think he did". There was much discussion after the match over whether Henry would remain with Arsenal or move to Barcelona, whom he had been linked with a move to over the past months. Arsène Wenger was asked post match if Henry would leave, to which the Arsenal manager replied: [...] "I don't know. I don't think so". However, on 19 May, Henry signed a new four-year contract with Arsenal, ending the speculation about a possible move to Barcelona.|$|E
