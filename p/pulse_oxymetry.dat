5000|$|A recent {{innovation}} by Kenneth Okereafor [...] and , {{presented an}} optimized and secure design of applying biometric liveness detection technique using a trait randomization approach. This novel concept potentially opens up {{new ways of}} mitigating biometric spoofing more accurately, and making impostor predictions intractable or very difficult in future biometric devices. A simulation of Kenneth Okereafor's biometric liveness detection algorithm using a 3D multi-biometric framework consisting of 15 liveness parameters from facial print, finger print and iris pattern traits resulted in a system efficiency of the 99.2% over a cardinality of 125 distinct randomization combinations.

40|$|The {{association}} of tiletamine with zolazepam (T/Z) {{is commonly used}} in dissociative anesthesia in household pets. This combination induces short-duration somatic analgesia, loss of voluntary movements and myorelaxation caused by the benzodiazepin, with stimulation of the ardiovascular system and maintenance of protective reflexes. Due to the large use of this association in elective neutering of felines and its anesthetic properties, we chose to monitorize and identify electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical changes during the anesthetic procedure, with and without oxygen supplementation. For this study, 20 female felines were recruited. All animals were young adults, healthy, no specific breed. The subjects underwent clinical, laboratorial and electrocardiographic evaluations prior to anesthesia. Tramadol hydrochloride was given as Preanesthetic medication followed by anesthesia with T/Z. The felines {{were randomly assigned to}} either Group 1 (n= 10), in which subjects received oxygen supplementation through mask during the anesthetic procedure, or Group 2 (n= 10), in which subjects were not supplemented with oxygen.

We used adult laboratory rats and mice that have been raised for more than 30 generations in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m), and compared their hematocrit levels, right ventricular hypertrophy (index of pulmonary hypertension) and alveolar surface area in the lungs. We also used whole-body plethysmography, indirect calorimetry and <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry</b> to measure ventilation, metabolic rate (O 2 consumption and CO 2 production), heart rate and <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry</b> oxygen saturation (pO 2,sat) under ambient conditions, and in response to exposure to sea level PO 2 (32 % O 2 = 160 mmHg for 10 min) and hypoxia (18 % and 15 % O 2 = 90 and 75 mmHg for 10 min each). The variables used for comparisons between species were corrected for body mass using standard allometric equations, and are termed mass-corrected variables. Under baseline, compared with rats, adult mice had similar levels of pO 2,sat, but lower hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, reduced right ventricular hypertrophy and higher mass-corrected alveolar surface area, tidal volume and metabolic rate. In response to sea level PO 2 and hypoxia, mice and rats had similar changes of ventilation, but metabolic rate decreased much more in hypoxia in mice, while pO 2,sat remained higher in mice. We conclude that laboratory mice and rats that have been raised at HA for> 30 generations have different physiological responses to altitude.

40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether reactive oxygen metabolite species (ROMs) correlated with lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to investigate whether ROMs could be used as an index of COPD severity. Methods. ROMs were evaluated in plasma by a colorimetric method (d-ROM-test) in 94 patients with COPD and in 31 healthy nonsmokers subjects. Spirometry, exhaled carbon monoxide and <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry</b> was performed in all patients. Results. Mean plasma ROMs were significantly increased (330. 38 Carratelli units) in patients with COPD. There was a negative correlation of ROMs with forced expiratory volume in the first second (r=- 0. 275, P < 0. 007), with forced vital capacity (r=- 0. 278, P < 0. 007), with forced expiratory flow (r=- 0. 226, P < 0. 029) and with oxygen saturation (r=- 0. 315, P < 0. 010). In addition a positive correlation was found between the age of the patients and the oxidative stress (r= 0. 366, P < 0. 000). Conclusions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) in steady state had pulmonary abnormalities seen on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and whether any abnormalities correlated with contemporaneously diagnosed lung function abnormalities. A subsidiary question was whether the results of a noninvasive measure of haemolysis (end-tidal carbon monoxide (ETCO) levels) correlated with pulmonary function abnormalities. Thirty three patients with SCD, median (range) age 36 yrs (17 – 67 yrs) were examined. The degree of lobar volume loss and ground-glass opacification and prominence of central vessels on HRCT were quantitatively assessed. Pulmonary function was assessed by measurements of lung volumes, spirometry, gas transfer and oxygen saturation. ETCO levels were measured using an end-tidal CO monitor. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity and total lung capacity significantly correlated with HRCT findings, particularly lobar volume loss. ETCO levels significantly negatively correlated with FEV 1, vital capacity measured using a plethysmograph, specific airway conductance and arterial oxygen saturation measured by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry.</b> In conclusion, the present results suggest that high-resolution computed tomography noninvasive assessment of haemolysis might be useful to identify sickle cell disease patients with respiratory function impairment...|$|E

Methods Cryoablations with 2 freeze-thaw cycles each were carried out in the epiphysis of the right tibia and the metaphysis of the left femur. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured. Throughout the intra- and perioperative phase, heart rate and oxygen saturation by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry,</b> blood gas and electrolytes were monitored regularly. Postoperative complications were examined up to 24 weeks postoperativ. Results As result, no significant increase of PAP, CVP or heart rate were observed. Blood gases were unremarkable, with pO 2 and pCO 2 remaining constant throughout the operation. Regarding pH, standard bicarbonate and base excess, only a non-significant shift towards a slight acidosis was seen. There was a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0. 5 g/dl. One animal showed postoperative wound infection and wound edge necrosis. No major peri- and postoperative complications associated with cryosurgery of bone were observed, especially regarding clinically relevant pulmonary embolism.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the differences in cerebral hemodynamic changes after introduction of isoflurane (a volatile anesthetic) and propofol (an i. v. anesthetic). Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients submitted to laparoscopic cholecystectomy were selected. After the induction, anesthesia was maintained by isoflurane (one minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration) during {{the first part of the}} surgical operation, and then by propofol (5 mg/kg/hour i. v.). Ventilation was adjusted to maintain a constant end-tidal CO 2. Middle artery flow velocity was assessed by means of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), capnometry, <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry,</b> inspired fraction of O 2, and body temperature, were monitored. Results: Cerebral artery velocity, HR, and mean arterial pressure all significantly increased from baseline after the introduction of isoflurane (p< 0. 05); the HR and mean arterial blood pressure showed no significant difference between the isoflurane and propofol phases. Isoflurane anesthesia induced a significant increase in cerebral blood velocity. Propofol introduction led to a significant decrease in cerebral artery velocity (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Cuffed {{pharyngeal}} tube is {{a device}} designed for ventilation of anesthetized patients. CPT has advantages over face mask including: maintaining of face mask {{can be difficult}} and boring after several minutes and mobility of the practitioner is reduced due to involvement of hands. Mask pressure can cause soft tissue and nerve damage around the nose. Anesthetic gas leakage from the mask adds to the operation room pollution. In difficult intubation CPT can be life-saving.

A scoring system for evaluating ventilation of patients was designed using symmetric chest wall motion during ventilation with anesthesia bag and sensing lung compliance through it, auscultation of breathing sounds, oscilation of bag with breathing and peripheral oxygen saturation by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry.</b> Respiratory complications (pulmonary aspiration, Iaryngospasm and bronchospasm, nausea and vomiting) were looked for during anesthesia. Results: The results showed that CPT was successful as ET in ventilation of spontaneously breathing patients and incidence of respiratory complications with CPT {{was no more than}} ET. Airway resistance was significantly greater with CPT than ET (P< 0. 05). Patients with ET had significantly greater incidence of sore throat than with CPT (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Thus we concluded that CPT can be used for ventilation of anesthetized patients not predisposed to pulmonary aspiration and whose peak airway pressure does not exceed 20 - 25 CmH 2 O...|$|E
40|$|Home {{hemodialysis}} (HD) for {{the treatment}} of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was first put into practice about 30 years ago. In this paper we describe the application of telematics monitoring services (TMS) for supporting patients who need home or satellite HD (SHD). For the clinical trials two modified HD machines were located in the renal unit and a central control station (UNIX workstation with multimedia PC-terminal) was located in another room of the hospital. Bi-directional communication between modified HD machines and central control station was managed via ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) links. Using these HD-machines 150 HD sessions were performed in nine patients over a period of five months. This system enabled on-line remote supervision of the HD machine-related functions (air in the blood, leak of blood, low conductivity etc.) and the clinical condition of patients through measurement of blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, PO 2 (<b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry)</b> and electrocardiogram (ECG) from the central control station (CCS). The user checked the type of alarm/warning, its appearance on HD machines and multimedia terminal units (MTU), the action of the protective system and the appearance of consultative messages from CCS on the remote terminal unit RTU. According to the data collected, the disturbances of HD machine function were visible and audible in the CCS and the user messages were always observed on the RTU. No unusual dialysis-associated complications were observed, all data and alarms/warnings were transmitted correctly and patients had adequate HD treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) {{is administered}} {{for a few}} days after lung transplantation (LTx) in recipients who are expected to have early graft dysfunction. Despite its life-saving potential, immediate postoperative ECMO has life-threatening complications such as postoperative bleeding. We investigated the risk factors related to the use of immediate postoperative ECMO. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of 60 LTx patients who were at our institution from October 2012 to May 2015. Perioperative variables associated with postoperative ECMO were compared between the two groups. Results There were 26 patients who received postoperative ECMO (ECMO group) and 34 patients who did not (control group). Multivariate regression analysis revealed preoperative ECMO (odds ratio [OR] 12. 55, 95 % confidence intervals [CI] 1. 34 – 117. 24, p = 0. 027) and lower peripheral <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry</b> saturation (SpO 2) at the end of surgery (OR 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 54 – 0. 95, p = 0. 019) were independent risk factors for postoperative ECMO in LTx patients. The incidences of complications, such as re-operation, tracheostomy, renal failure and postoperative atrial fibrillation, were higher in the ECMO group. There was no difference in the duration of postoperative intensive care unit stay or postoperative 30 -day mortality between the two groups. Conclusions The preoperative ECMO and lower SpO 2 at the end of surgery were associated with postoperative ECMO. Further, postoperative adverse events were higher in the ECMO group compared with the control group. This study suggests that determination of postoperative ECMO requires careful consideration because of the risks of postoperative ECMO in LTx patients...|$|E
40|$|Background Hypoxemia in {{neonates}} {{with clinical}} respiratory distress {{has a high}} mortality. Downes score is used {{as an alternative to}} evaluate clinical respiratory distress if blood gas analysis instrument or <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry</b> is not available. Objective To evaluate the validity of Downes score for assessing hypoxemia in neonates with clinical respiratory distress. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out on neonates with clinical respiratory distress hospitalized at level 2 and 3 Neonatal Care Unit and in Emergency Room of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta. Downes score and oxygen saturation measured by a pulse oximetry were compared. Hypoxemia was defined as oxygen saturation less than 90 % in term and post- term infants, less than 88 % in preterm neonates, or Downes score 2 : 5 according to Basic Emergency Service Training for Obstetry and Neonatology (PONED) in 2007. The accuracy of Downes score in predicting hypoxemia was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, negative-predictive value, and likelihood ratio. Results Eighty nine neonates were evaluated. Downes score had sensitivity of 88 %, specificity of 81 o/o, positive-predictive value of 72 %, negative- predictive value of 92 %, positive likelihood ratio 4. 53, negative likelihood ratio 0. 15, prevalence of 36 %, and post test probability of 72 %. Conclusion Downes score {{can be used as a}} clinical diagnostic means for assessing hypoxemia in clinical respiratory distressed neonates with 88 % sensitivity (95 % CI 79 to 99), and specificity 81 % sensitivity (95 % CI 70 to 91) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiac {{catheterization}} {{of children}} with congenital heart disease is increasingly being performed under general anesthesia. Haemodynamic stability during anesthesia and fast and adequate recovery after the procedure is crucial in these patients. We performed a pilot study to evaluate hemodynamic stability when using remifentanil for anesthesia during cardiac catheterization. We also evaluated extubation times and recovery characteristics. METHODS: In a randomized, prospective, double-blind study 30 children (aged 1. 5 - 20 months) received a continuous infusion of either 0. 2 (group 0. 2) or 0. 3 microg/kg/min remifentanil (group 0. 3) {{as part of a}} balanced anesthesia with 0. 6 MAC sevoflurane. Heart rate, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, end tidal CO 2 and <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry</b> were monitored throughout the procedure. Extubation times were noted, and recovery from anesthesia was evaluated using Aldrete scores. RESULTS: : Haemodynamic response to intubation was well blunted in both groups. No significant changes in hemodynamic variables were noted from induction of anesthesia until 10 min after intubation. From then on there was a decrease in HR and systolic arterial pressure, which remained significant throughout the procedure in both groups. Extubation times were similar in both groups: 7. 3 min (2, 1) in group 0. 2 vs. 6. 6 min (2, 1) in group 0. 3 (NS). The number of patients with an Aldrete score of nine or more was 14 (group 0. 2) vs. 15 (group 0. 3), 10 min after extubation (NS). CONCLUSION: Both dose regimens of remifentanil provided stable hemodynamic conditions during anesthesia for cardiac catheterization {{of children with}} congenital heart disease and allowed for rapid and adequate recovery...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: The {{subjectivity}} of pain causes enormous {{difficulties in}} evaluating neonatal pain with a single, practical and easy-to-apply tool. Pain evaluation in the neonatal period {{should be performed}} by valid, safe, useful and feasible methods. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate {{the validity of the}} Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS), Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), heart rate (HR) and O 2 saturation (O 2 sat) for neonatal pain assessment. DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind randomized trial. SETTING: A secondary level maternity hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 70 healthy neonates requiring bilirubin dosage were randomly assigned to receive a venous puncture (P: n= 33, BW 3. 2 kg, SD 0. 6; GA 39 wk, SD 1; 59 h of life, SD 25) or an alcohol swab friction (F: n= 37; BW 3. 1 kg, SD 0. 5; GA 39 wk, SD 1; 52 h of life, SD 17). INTERVENTION: All measurements were taken prior to (PRE), during (T 0), and 1 (T 1), 3 (T 3), 5 (T 5) and 10 (T 10) minutes after the procedure. MEASUREMENTS: A neonatologist evaluated NFCS, NIPS, HR and O 2 sat by <b>pulse</b> <b>oxymetry.</b> RESULTS: Median NFCS and NIPS results at T 0, T 1 and T 3 were higher in P group, compared to F. More P neonates presented NFCS > 2 and/or NIPS > 3 at T 0, T 1 and T 3. HR was lower in P group at T 1. Average O 2 sat was above 90 % during the whole study period in both groups. CONCLUSION: NFCS and NIPS are suitable instruments for neonatal pain evaluation. Heart rate and O 2 saturation can be used only as auxiliary methods...|$|E
