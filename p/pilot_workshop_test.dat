40|$|Applied user testing {{involves}} more usability evaluation methods than laboratory tests and is critically dependent upon {{a number of}} issues seldom treated in the literature. The development of the system described in this longitudinal, diary-based study evolved around five user tests: a laboratory <b>test,</b> a <b>workshop</b> <b>test,</b> and three field tests. The user tests had a substantial impact on the focus of the entire development effort in that 25 % of the primary developer's time was spent solving problems encountered during the tests. The laboratory test made use of set tasks and was biased toward how tasks were performed with the system, at the expense of what tasks could be performed. The <b>workshop</b> <b>test</b> was more informal and apparently led the users to adopt a more exploratory attitude. Careful arousal and management of the users' commitment to participate actively proved essential to effective user testing, especially during the field tests. 1 Introduction Slightly caricatured th [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The Lunar Workshops for Educators (LWE) {{series was}} {{developed}} by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) education team in 2010 to provide professional development on lunar science and exploration concepts for grades 6 - 9 science teachers. Over 300 educators have been trained to date. The LWE model incorporates best practices from pedagogical research of science education, thoughtful integration of scientists and engineer subject matter experts for both content presentations and informal networking with educators, access to NASA-unique facilities, hands-on and data-rich activities aligned with education standards, exposure to the practice of science, tools for addressing common misconceptions, follow-up with participants, and extensive evaluation. Evaluation of the LWE model via pre- and post-assessments, daily workshop surveys, and follow-up surveys at 6 -month and 1 -year intervals indicate that the LWE are extremely effective in increasing educators' content knowledge, confidence in incorporating content into the classroom, understanding of the practice of science, and ability to address common student misconceptions. In order to address the efficacy of the LWE model for other science content areas, the Dynamic Response of Environments at Asteroids, the Moon, and moons of Mars (DREAM 2) education team, funded by NASA's Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute, developed and ran a <b>pilot</b> <b>workshop</b> called Dream 2 Explore at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in June, 2015. Dream 2 Explore utilized the LWE model, but incorporated content related to the science and exploration of asteroids and the moons of Mars. Evaluation results indicate that the LWE model was effectively used for educator professional development on non-lunar content. We will present more detail on the LWE model, evaluation results from the Dream 2 Explore <b>pilot</b> <b>workshop,</b> and suggestions for the application of the model with other science content for robust educator professional development...|$|R
40|$|Many dance {{students}} {{suffer from}} low self-confidence and high anxiety {{as a result}} of cultural stressors present in the training environment. Particularly, the tradition of authoritarian-style teaching has been shown to hinder the psychological development of students. This thesis researches teaching methodologies that incorporate psychological skills training and aspects of the Franklin method (a somatic practice) into collegiate dance education.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that creative writing forms {{an important part of}} the recovery experience of people affected by severe mental illness. In this paper, we consider theoretical models that explain how creative writing might contribute to recovery, and we discuss the potential for creative writing in psychosocial rehabilitation. We argue that the rehabilitation benefits of creative writing might be optimized through focus on process and technique in writing, rather than content, and that consequently, the involvement of professional writers might be important. We describe a <b>pilot</b> <b>workshop</b> that deployed these principles and was well-received by participants. Finally, we make recommendations regarding the role of creative writing in psychosocial rehabilitation for people recovering from severe mental illness and suggest that the development of an evidence base regarding the effectiveness of creative writing is a priority...|$|R

50|$|According {{to several}} {{interviews}} with Nayar, {{the idea of}} creating a camera for experiential learning stemmed from the 2004 film Born into Brothels, an Academy Award-winning documentary by Ross Kauffman and Zana Briski that profiles several children living in the red light district of Kolkata. The filmmaker gave each child a camera and taught them photography so that they could begin to look at their world with a new set of eyes, unveiling hope and uncovering hidden talents from within themselves. As a result, many of them found the strength to break from their circumstances and begin charting out meaningful lives. Nayar launched the Bigshot project in 2006, and the first set of Bigshot cameras were produced for use in <b>pilot</b> <b>workshops</b> in 2009. In August 2013, EduScience, a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of toys and kits for learning, began distribution worldwide.|$|R
