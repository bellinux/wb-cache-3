In {{the present}} paper we report {{the results of a}} multicongurational {{computational}} study on potential-energy curves of azobenzene along the NN twisting to clarify the role of this coordinate in the decay of the S 2 (pp*) and S 1 (np*) states.

40|$|Bond {{stretching}} mimics {{different levels}} of electron correlation and provides a challenging testbed for approximate many-body computational methods. Using the recently developed phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AF QMC) method, we examine bond stretching in the well-studied molecules BH and N$_ 2 $, and in the H$_{ 50 }$ chain. To control the sign/phase problem, the phaseless AF QMC method constrains the paths in the auxiliary-field path integrals with an approximate phase condition that depends on a trial wave function. With single Slater determinants from unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) as trial wave function, the phaseless AF QMC method generally gives better overall accuracy and a more uniform behavior than the coupled cluster CCSD(T) method in mapping the <b>potential-energy</b> <b>curve.</b> In both BH and N$_ 2 $, we also study the use of multiple-determinant trial wave functions from multi-configuration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) calculations.

However, so far, {{the information about the}} driving forces for excited-state equilibrium is very limited. In this work, the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method was employed to investigate the nature of the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT).

Moreover, it is found that electron density swing between the proton acceptor and donor provides the driving forces for the forward and backward ESIPT, enabling the excited-state equilibrium to be established. Furthermore, we proposed that the photoexcitation and the interchange of position for electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups are the main reasons for the electron density swing.

We employ high-level ab initio calculations {{to compute the}} potential energy curves of the states involved in the RIXS process and simulate the measured RIXS spectra using the wave-packet-propagation formalism, including Coulomb coupling in the final-state manifold. The theoretical analysis allows us to explain all the key features of the experimental spectra, including some that were not seen before. First, we clearly show the interference effect between different RIXS channels corresponding to the transition via orthogonal Πx 1 and Πy 1 core-excited states of CO. Second, the RIXS region of 13 eV energy loss presents a triple structure, revealed only by the high-resolution measurement. In previous studies, this region was attributed solely to a valence state.

40|$|A {{treatment}} of van der Waals (vdW) interaction by density-matrix functional theory requires {{a description of}} this interaction in terms of natural orbitals (NOs) and their occupation numbers. From {{an analysis of the}} configuration-interaction (CI) wave function of the ∑u+ 3 state of H 2 and the exact NO expansion of the two-electron triplet wave function, we demonstrate that the construction of such a functional is straightforward in this case. A quantitative description of the vdW interaction is already obtained with, in addition to the standard part arising from the Hartree-Fock determinant ∫ 1 σg (r 1) 1 σu (r 2) ∫, only two additional terms in the two-electron density, one from the first "excited" determinant ∫ 2 σg (r 1) 2 σu (r 2) ∫ and one from the state of ∑u+ 3 symmetry belonging to the (1 π g) 1 (1 π u) 1 configuration. The <b>potential-energy</b> <b>curve</b> of the ∑u+ 3 state calculated around the vdW minimum with the exact density-matrix functional employing only these eight NOs and NO occupations is in excellent agreement with the full CI one and reproduces well the benchmark potential curve of Kolos and Wolniewicz [J. Chem. Phys. 43, 2429 (1965) ]. The corresponding terms in the two-electron density ρ 2 (r 1, r 2), containing specific products of NOs combined with prefactors that depend on the occupation numbers, can be shown to produce exchange-correlation holes that correspond precisely to the well-known intuitive picture of the dispersion interaction as an instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (higher multipole) effect. Indeed, (induced) higher multipoles account for almost 50 % of the total vdW bond energy.
