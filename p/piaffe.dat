At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the <b>piaffe</b> and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E
25|$|For their freestyles, {{riders and}} horses perform {{specially}} choreographed patterns to music. At this level, the freestyle tests may contain all the Grand Prix movements, {{as well as}} double canter pirouettes, pirouettes in <b>piaffe,</b> and half-pass in passage. For the freestyle, judges award technical marks for the various movements, as well as artistic marks. In {{the case of a}} tie, the ride with the higher artistic marks wins.|$|E
500|$|High-school dressage, the Haute école or Hohe Schule, which {{includes}} riding the horse with greater collection with {{increased use of}} the hindquarters, developing increased regularity, skill and finesse in all natural gaits. [...] In this period, the horse learns the most advanced movements such as the half-pass, counter-canter, flying change, pirouette, passage, and <b>piaffe.</b> This is also when the horse may be taught the [...] "Airs above the ground." [...] This level emphasizes performance {{with a high degree}} of perfection.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{variations}} of the trot are specially trained in advanced dressage horses: the <b>Piaffe</b> and the Passage. The <b>Piaffe</b> is essentially created by asking the horse to trot in place, with very little forward motion. The Passage (rhymes with [...] "massage") is an exaggerated slow motion trot. Both require tremendous collection, careful training and considerable physical conditioning for a horse to perform.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Piaffe</b> : A calm, composed, {{elevated}} trot {{in place}} (although minimal movement forward is allowed and not penalized in competitions {{as it is}} the natural way of performing the movement. In any case the horse should never move backwards and this is considered a serious fault): ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm, gait, tempo, and {{regularity}} {{should be}} the same on straight and bending lines, through lateral work, and through transitions. Rhythm refers to the sequence of the footfalls, which should only include the pure walk, pure trot, and pure canter. The regularity, or purity, of the gait includes the evenness and levelness of the stride. Once a rider can obtain pure gaits, or can avoid irregularity, the combination may be fit to do a more difficult exercise. Even in the very difficult <b>piaffe</b> there is still regularity: the horse [...] "trots on the spot" [...] in place, raising the front and hind legs in rhythm.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the present}} occasion, he {{witnessed}} with wonder and awe {{the approach of}} some half-score of riders, sober men upon sober palfreys, muffled in their long black garments, and only relieved by their white scapularies, showing more like a funeral procession than aught else, and not quickening their pace beyond that which permitted easy conversation and easy digestion. The sobriety of the scene was indeed somewhat enlivened {{by the presence of}} Sir Piercie Shafton, who, to show that his skill in the manege was not inferior to his other accomplishments, kept alternately pressing and checking his gay courser, forcing him to <b>piaffe,</b> to caracole, to passage, and to do all the other feats of the school, to the great annoyance of the Lord Abbot, the wonted sobriety of whose palfrey became at length discomposed by the vivacity of its companion, while the dignitary kept crying out in bodily alarm, [...] "I do pray you--Sir Knight--good now, Sir Piercie--Be quiet, Benedict, there is a good steed--soh, poor fellow" [...] and uttering all the other precatory and soothing exclamations by which a timid horseman usually bespeaks the favour of a frisky companion, or of his own unquiet nag, and concluding the bead-roll with a sincere Deo gratias so soon as he alighted in the court-yard of the Tower of Glendearg.|$|E

50|$|The <b>piaffe</b> was {{originally}} used in battle {{to keep the}} horse focused, warm, and moving, ready to move forward into battle. In modern times, the <b>piaffe</b> is mostly taught as an upper level movement in Classical dressage and as a Grand Prix level movement. Additionally, it is needed to develop the levade and from that, the airs above the ground.|$|E

50|$|The most {{significant}} {{change at the}} 1932 Los Angeles Games was {{the introduction of the}} <b>piaffe</b> and passage. Only 10 riders from 4 countries competed due to the aftermath of World War I.|$|E
5000|$|Impulsion {{occurs in}} all gaits: the walk, the trot, and the canter {{and even the}} ambling gaits of gaited horses. Because the walk has no moment of suspension, it is a {{difficult}} gait to perform with impulsion. Impulsion at various gaits may not always appear the same. In the walk, it is seen when the hindquarters are engaged and the gait is [...] "purposeful yet relaxed." [...] The USEF describes impulsion at the <b>piaffe</b> as follows: [...] "The <b>piaffe</b> must always be animated by a lively impulsion and characterized by a perfect balance. While giving the impression of being in place there may be a visible inclination to advance, this being displayed by the horse’s eager acceptance to move forward as soon as he is asked." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the highest}} level of competition, the {{dressage}} test is roughly equivalent to the United States Dressage Federation Third Level, and may ask for half-pass at trot, shoulder-in, travers, collected, medium and extended gaits, single flying changes and counter-canter. The tests may not ask for Grand Prix movements such as <b>piaffe</b> or passage.|$|E
5000|$|... 19 riders from 9 {{countries}} competed. Due to World War II, {{there was}} not sufficient time to prepare the dressage horses for the 1948 Games. Therefore, <b>piaffe</b> and passage were not placed on the tests. However, half-pass, renvers, canter pirouettes, and tempi changes were included, with the highest coefficient on the one-tempis.|$|E
50|$|Dressage {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} since the 1912 Olympics. The dressage horse no longer has to jump, but the test on the flat has become increasingly difficult, emphasizing the <b>piaffe</b> and the passage. Today's horses are specifically bred for dressage and have movement far more extravagant {{when compared to the}} horses of the early 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{horses were}} trained to perform a number of airs above the ground (or [...] "sauts d'école") movements, which could enable their riders to escape if surrounded, or to fight more easily. These {{included}} movements such as levade, capriole, courbette, and ballotade. Movements still seen today in competitive dressage include the <b>piaffe,</b> passage, and half-pass.|$|E
50|$|Donnerhall {{began his}} career in 1984, placing second out of 70 horses at his Stallion Performance Test held in Adelheidsdorf, with a score of 131.92.

He was especially known for his expressive passage, <b>piaffe,</b> and extended trot.|$|E
5000|$|Impulsion is {{particularly}} important in dressage. It not only makes the horse's gait more elastic, light, and expressive, but provides the animal with the power needed to perform the required movements. This {{is especially true for}} those requiring collection, such as passage, <b>piaffe,</b> pirouette, tempi changes. In jumping poor impulsion is often linked to horses failing to clear obstacles ...|$|E

5000|$|The test {{included}} an 8-second halt, half-turns on the haunches at the walk, riding with reins {{in one hand}} at the trot, [...] "ordinary" [...] and extended trot while posting, a 5-loop canter serpentine with each loop 8-meters in diameter, the canter pirouette, four-, three-, two-, and one-tempi changes, and the <b>piaffe</b> and passage. The highest coefficient for the test was bending on two-tracks at the collected trot and collected canter.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{dressage}} {{evolved from}} the classical school, although it now exists in a somewhat different form from its ancestor. Competitive dressage is an international sport ranging from beginner levels to the Olympics. Unlike classical dressage, competitive dressage {{does not require the}} airs above ground, which most horses cannot perform well even with correct training, due to physical limitations. Instead, competitive dressage focuses on movements such as the <b>piaffe,</b> passage, half-pass, extended trot, pirouette, and tempi changes.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2006 World Equestrian Games, {{riding the}} mare Matiné, Helgstrand {{came in second}} in the Individual {{freestyle}} and third in the individual special. Eurodressage's report of the tournament called him [...] "the favourite of the crowd" [...] and said he [...] "seemed to have redefined <b>piaffe</b> and passage". A video of this performance (to the hip-hop song [...] "No Mo" [...] by Red Astaire) has circulated widely on YouTube, being seen over 5 million times.|$|E

5000|$|Bending of {{the joints}} {{is not always}} a good {{indication}} of true collection (and therefore a correct <b>piaffe).</b> It is possible to perform a piaffe-like movement with good bend in the legs while the horse remains hollow and on the forehand. This can especially be seen in horses trained to trot in place by holding them back while asking the hindlegs to bend by applying the whip on the hocks. The horse will bend the hocks, but will not lower the hindquarters.|$|E
5000|$|The highest form of {{classical}} riding, {{as well as}} dressage, High School dressage, of Haute Ecole, takes years for both the horse and rider to master. When a horse is advanced in its training, it can perform not only Grand Prix dressage movements such as collected and extended gaits, passage and <b>piaffe,</b> but some can also perform certain [...] "Airs Above the Ground," [...] although usually a horse will only be trained in one air, and {{only if it is}} particularly able.|$|E
50|$|Doma menorquina {{is based}} on {{classical}} dressage and resembles a combination of Haute Ecole (dressage) ("High School") and Doma vaquera disciplines. Usually, stallions 3-4 years old are trained. From the three basic gaits, walk, trot and gallop, training progresses to the Spanish walk, half pass, flying changes and <b>piaffe</b> and culminates in the bot, or walking courbette. The remarkable ability of Menorcan horses in the bot is the most notable element of Menorcan riding; the rider sits effortlessly on the rigid back of the sella menorquina, the Menorcan saddle.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the format}} for the {{dressage}} competition {{begins with a}} Grand Prix test to determine {{the winners of the}} team competition. The top 25 competitors in the Grand Prix then perform a second test, the Grand Prix Special, which is shortened and emphasizes the <b>piaffe</b> and passage. The top 13 of this group then goes onto the Grand Prix Freestyle (first introduced at the 1996 Olympics), which is written by each individual rider according to strict guidelines, and set to music. These scores help determine the individual medalists.|$|E
5000|$|Collected gaits {{are asked}} for in {{dressage}} tests from the mid-levels upward, at the walk, trot, and canter. Additionally, {{a high degree}} of collection is required of the rider in more advanced dressage moves, such as the pirouette, <b>piaffe,</b> and passage. The ultimate level of collection is the levade, in which the horse carries 100% of his weight on his hindquarters. Unlike a rearing horse, the horse's rear legs are well under it, and it can safely support itself in an upright position for a time and then lower itself to the ground under control.|$|E
5000|$|Rhythm, gait, tempo, and {{regularity}} {{should be}} the same on straight and bending lines, through lateral work, and through transitions.

5000|$|The {{program today}} has expanded. It {{begins with the}} [...] "Young Stallions" [...] which have {{recently}} arrived from the stud farm at Piber. They demonstrate {{the first phase of}} training, in which the horse moves forward and accepts the aids. The next section is the [...] "All Steps and Movements of the High School" [...] where four fully trained stallions perform each of the movements seen in the Olympic Grand Prix Dressage test, including the flying change, passage, pirouette, and <b>piaffe.</b> The horses are ridden in double bridle, to demonstrate their high level of training. The [...] "Pas De Deux" [...] is then shown, with two horses demonstrating High School movements in mirror image.|$|E
