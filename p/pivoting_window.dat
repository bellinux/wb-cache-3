50|$|A {{small room}} {{adjacent}} to the staircase has an external door which is no longer used, and a <b>pivoting</b> <b>window</b> with coloured glass panels opening onto the southeast verandah. This room may have formed {{part of the original}} entrance foyer, but the original arrangement in unknown. The staircase is early, but not original, and consists of a narrow dog-leg with winders, narrow turned timber newel posts and slim timber balusters. The wall to the south of the staircase has fibrous cement sheeting. The rear kitchen area has been altered, with a small room forming a two-way pantry, and a door and window to the western addition being removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} {{focus of}} the Papaverhof design {{can be seen in}} the <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows,</b> intercom for the main door, automatically dimming lights and waste disposal chutes. This has made it a very prescient design.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two sets}} of four <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> on the {{northern}} and southern sides. These are placed opposite each other above the doors. There are three mullions in each set of windows and each window has three panes. In each set the windows are paired and attached together with a bar so that opening one opens its partner.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pivot</b> <b>window</b> is {{a window}} hung on one hinge on each of two {{opposite}} sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally <b>Pivoted).</b> The <b>window</b> will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} developed method for the airflow and the pollutant distribution of indoor-environment {{was applied to}} predict the obvious and detail situation in a dwelling bedroom. The purpose was to establish the predict chart to access ventilation characteristics and the indoor environment with the central horizontal <b>pivot</b> <b>window.</b> The method is capable to predict the carbon dioxide concentration and air exchange rate in variation of opening angles and the inlet velocity of outdoor environment. The opening area is a common size of 90 cm wide by 120 cm high in Taiwan. The inlet velocity is between 0 m/s and 2. 0 m/s. To validate the results of CFD numerical analysis, we utilized the full-scale experiment in an experiment room with a human heat source. Close congruence with the results shows the validity of CFD method we used in these cases. The result shows that the typical ventilation characteristics of central horizontal <b>pivot</b> <b>window</b> and inductive chart to predict the indoor environment {{with this kind of}} window. *...|$|R

50|$|Glen Burnie is a {{historic}} home located near Palmyra, Fluvanna County, Virginia. It was built in 1829, and is a two-story, three-bay, cruciform plan, gable-roofed brick structure with gable-end chimneys. The house was designed by General John Hartwell Cocke for Elizabeth Cary. The house has {{an eclectic mix of}} late Federal and Greek, Gothic, and Jacobean revival features. It has a mousetooth cornice, unusual <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows,</b> projecting towers and one-story porches on the south and north facade. Also on the property is the contributing Glen Burnie cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The western {{elevation}} {{has a large}} feature {{window with}} eight rectangular timber framed openings, divided into three levels by different types of windows. The bottom level has casements; the second level has <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> and the top level has fixed windows which slope in an easterly direction toward the main room of the building. At {{the top of the}} windows, between them and on the outer wall is a panel of mesh. The window is surmounted by a timber framed hood clad with corrugated iron.|$|R

50|$|By the 1880s the Waterford {{district}} was more established, and the Waterford State School population was expanding. In 1884 a 10 ft 3m wide verandah {{was added to}} the back of the school building, providing additional classroom space. By 1888 enrolment had risen to around 100, and in late 1888-early 1889 the building was extended to John Ferguson's design, with the addition of another classroom measuring 20 ft 6m by 16 ft at the south-east end of the building, and construction of front and rear verandahs along the full length of the extended building. At this time the front porch was removed, to accommodate the 7 ft 8in 2.3m wide verandah. The whole of the building was roofed with corrugated iron. Drawings show that the second classroom was of single-skin construction with studding exposed externally on the verandahs and internally on the new gable end. Walls were 12 ft 3.6m high. There was a high level vent in the gable and the ceiling was raked with a vent. There was a three bay window of tall, central <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> with a central sill and a hood on the gable end and 3 pairs of narrow, central <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> in the side walls. The double doors from the front verandah were off centre. The whole of the work, plus additions to the teacher's residence, was undertaken by John Fortune of Coomera, at a cost of Â£320.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the court room are {{rendered}} and scored up to a moulded plaster dado, and have painted brickwork above. The ceiling is lined with beaded tongue and groove boards divided by exposed stop-chamfered beams, with turned knobs at the intersections. The space has 4 pane, horizontally <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> to the upper section and large double hung windows with arched heads in the lower section. Centred on each long side of the court are pairs of four-panel entry doors. The furniture of the court room includes the bench, jury benches, press box and dock all constructed from beaded tongue and groove boarding, and a silky oak witness stand.|$|R
50|$|The {{repetitive}} {{quality of}} the front elevation, which addresses the river to the east, is interrupted {{by a series of}} green tinted <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> which are located on the third and fourth levels, immediately north of the fire wall. Below these windows, and {{at the southern end of}} the building are large arched openings, the latter of which aligns with a similar opening at the rear. A corrugated iron awning is suspended above the entrance and extends from the second to the sixth bay, where it steps to above the first floor level. It is tied back to the building and has a valance of timber vertical boards with a scalloped edge.|$|R
5000|$|This {{architectural}} {{description of}} the National building was written for its National Register nomination in 1982: [...] "The Western Avenue facade consists of eight bays encompassing storefronts at the ground story, and horizontal window bands in the upper five stories. The bays are defined by nine piers which are expressed externally as pilasters, and terminated at the sixth story by large ionic capitals. Wall planes within each bay are recessed behind the nine pilasters and enriched with molded back surrounds at the sides and top. Fenestration {{is characterized by a}} regular system of horizontal window groupings, each consisting of four <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms. The window bands are separated vertically by wide, unadorned brick spandrels. Two of the bays include fire escapes.|$|R
40|$|A Method for {{measuring}} the air exchange rate (ACH value) and distribution of pollutants in a bedroom has recently been developed. The purpose was to evaluate the natural ventilation efficiency to access ventilation characteristics and the indoor environment with the central horizontal <b>pivot</b> <b>window.</b> The developed method is able to conduct the required number of air change per hour when a certain indoor air quality needs to be maintained. This research was conducted by full-scale model experiments. The chamber experiment were carried out in a 3 m x 2. 4 m x 3 m(H) full-scale typical bedroom model with a single-bed of 0. 9 m x 1. 9 m x 0. 45 m(H). The opening angles we considered were between 0 degree to 180 degree. Tracer gas technology was applied in the measurements. Sulphur Hexafluoride(SF 6) as tracer gas was release with heat from an emulated human head in the full-scale model space, and the heat source was performed by a head model with the average heat flux at 58. 2 W/m 2. The location of the inlet opening characterized by the central horizontal <b>pivot</b> <b>window</b> was chosen for ventilation efficiency research. The concentration decay method and the constant concentration method of tracer gas technology were both used and compared to validate the results. The results showed that with the opening angle changed, the air exchange rate is also changed. The relationship between the opening angle and the ACH value can be conducted with an ellipse curve. The air exchange rate (ACH value) also can be conducted with two humps curve. We can evaluate the natural ventilation efficiency with combining these two factors, the ACH value and AEE value. Therefore, {{the results can be}} simplified by a diagnose chart. Hence, the natural ventilation efficiency in typical dwelling bedroom can be predicted by checking the diagnose chart...|$|R
50|$|In 1989 the Queensland Museum Sciencentre {{moved into}} the William Street building, and prior {{restoration}} and renovation work undertaken in 1986-88 included: the demolition of non-original dormer windows and restoration of the clerestory, reconstruction of the roof framing and replacement of the corrugated iron roofing with slate and galvanised steel sheeting, and reconstruction of the rear verandah. Removal, reconstruction or restoration of doors and windows took place, and some external openings were sealed, while some new windows and doors were inserted. The existing ground floor slab and flooring was replaced, along with sections of the front wing's timber flooring on {{the first and second}} floors. The rear wing's floors were replaced with reinforced concrete suspended slabs. Other strengthening of floors utilised steel beams and trusses, and all casements were replaced as <b>pivot</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the rear}} wing is also of {{rendered}} masonry construction and comprises two large rooms with plaster ceilings and cornices, and deep timber skirtings and a timber fireplace surround {{to the central}} room. Both rooms have non-original multi-paned doors opening onto the enclosed verandah/undercroft space of the two-storeyed rear wing. The northern end of this space houses a bathroom, and {{the northern end of}} the masonry rear wing has been extended {{with the addition of a}} kitchen (possibly a free-standing structure added prior to the construction of the second storey). This kitchen structure has a raked ceiling on either side to the underside of the collar-beam, two small centrally <b>pivoted</b> <b>windows</b> which open against the rear of the end wall of the masonry wing, and a door and sash window opening to the rear.|$|R

50|$|In April 1907, the Bellingham Herald {{announced}} that the Bellingham Bay Furniture Company, owned by T.S. Hamilton, had purchased the block for $15,000 cash and were rushing plans {{for the construction of}} the city's first skyscraper. Soon after the purchase, they dropped Teague's design in favor of one drawn by Frank C. Burns. These plans were for a largely unadorned seven-story building of all reinforced concrete crowned with false chimneys and a large wooden cornice (now gone). To maximize floor space, large <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> would cover all sides of the building, eliminating the need for a lightwell {{in the middle of the}} building. Two elevators, one for passengers and one for freight were included in the plans. Despite the buildings' size, it would actually only be 4000 sq ft larger than the company's previous quarters at Holly and Bay Streets.|$|R
50|$|The 1914 {{building}} {{is one of}} six that survive in Queensland, the others being located at Toowoomba (relocated), Albion, Kelvin Grove (ex-Toowong), Maryborough and Rockhampton (ex-Mt Morgan).

5000|$|The other wing of {{the nursery}} {{accommodates}} the misting house, a timber framed glasshouse with a concrete slab floor. The {{lower part of the}} walls is lined internally with fibre cement sheets. Above this on the side walls are clear glass operable louvres and on the end wall is a large timber-framed <b>pivot</b> <b>window</b> surrounded by fixed clear glass. The roof is clad with overlapping sheets of rippled, fixed glass and near the ridge are clear glass operable louvres. The roof is sheltered externally by a shade cloth mounted on a metal framing. This shade cloth is a later addition, replacing the original louvred panels. The room contains raised timber benches/boxes for plants that incorporate plastic irrigation pipes with misting nozzles. The floor retains spoon drains under the plant benches. The nursery yard retains four hardening bays. These are large timber [...] "boxes" [...] on legs that have a sheltering frame covered in shade cloth.|$|R
50|$|The Colman Building is a {{historic}} office building located in Seattle, Washington. It occupies a half of a block in downtown Seattle in proximity to Pioneer Square, bound by First Avenue, Marion and Columbia Streets. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places {{as well as being}} a City of Seattle landmark. The building was built in several stages with a change of design between 1889 and 1906. It was commissioned by Scottish immigrant and master machinist James Colman who arrived in Seattle in 1872. Architect Stephen Meany designed the original plans while the reconstruction that is visible today was designed by August Tidemand inspired by the Chicago School with less ornamentation and large <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows.</b> The cast iron elements from the original building remain on the first floor, while the second floor was rebuilt of rusticated stone. Four floors of red brick trimmed with marble were built on top of this. The building is crowned with a copper cornice.|$|R
50|$|The Heine-Velox V12 had a low-slung {{appearance}} {{because the}} body was mounted to the frame from the sides, instead of the top, which also provided more structural rigidity and a low center of gravity. The two headlights, mounted high on the fenders (giving a kind of bug-eyed look), contained both high and low beams, operated by a switch. Rather than roll up or down, Heine <b>windows</b> <b>pivoted</b> and could be locked in position. Luggage could be stored in lockable boxes on the running boards, {{as well as in}} places on all sides of the car. An easy to spot interior innovation was the tilting of the dashboard to 45 degrees, which was supposed to be more comfortable for the driver and would hide the steering column, as well as positioning of the handbrake and gear selector which did not require leaning. Heine demonstrated his car to Chevrolet and demanded to see the head engineer. He was pointed in his direction, leaving the car unattended, and the car was stolen. The following year Chevrolet released a car with <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows.</b> Heine's car had many other innovations, including an oil level automatically maintained by gravity, and a cold-weather start system operated from the dash. The Blackhawk Collection claims the cars were as powerful as the Duesenbergs of the day.|$|R
50|$|The hall is a {{single-storeyed}} timber {{building with}} a steep pitch gable roof with asbestos cement tiles laid in a diamond pattern, roof vents and terracotta ridges and front finial. The east and west sides have a lower pitch, and {{the front and rear}} sections have lower hips. The building has concrete stumps, weatherboard sheeting to balustrade height and chamferboard above, with twin centrally <b>pivoted</b> hopper <b>windows</b> and coloured glass fanlights.|$|R
50|$|The {{butter factory}} {{originally}} housed the laboratory, boiler house, engine room, vacuators and butter processing areas following which it accommodated the milk bottling plant. The factory {{is a large}} two-storey volume building of concrete frame and infill external wall construction supporting a steel framed roof. The building {{is divided into two}} bays with corrugated iron gabled roofs. Gabled roof clerestoreys running the length of each bay provide natural light and ventilation together with steel framed multipaned centrally <b>pivotting</b> <b>windows</b> in the eastern end elevation. A third ventilated gabled roof supported on a steel frame is attached along the northern end of the building providing protection for a receiving/loading area. The tops of the clerestoreys are visible from the west above the large concrete framed facade which faces the city and railway line and prominently displays the Port Curtis Co-Operative Dairy name and insignia. The infill panels are omitted at ground level on western facade providing access to a platform adjacent to which are remains of part of the railway siding.|$|R
40|$|Investigation of {{different}} facade systems regarding to their applicability for automated window ventilation in schools {{with a decision}} tree method. In classrooms, where ventilation is managed with windows two kinds of strategies can be used: short-term ventilation or exactly regulated continuous ventilation. Results of measurements {{of different}} institutions show that the necessary regular short-term airing in schools is not adhered to. For functional continuous ventilation in classrooms {{it is necessary to}} know, which type of window assures the required air change within comfortable thermal conditions and which opening width is necessary. In order to get this information the performance of <b>pivoting</b> <b>windows</b> and bottom-hung windows is investigated at an outdoor test facility at the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics. Because of the difficulties in descriptive analysis of natural ventilation with its various influencing factors a specific statistical method, a decision tree method, is used. This method has pretty positive characteristics regarding the choice of influencing factors and the overfitting of the statistical model. With this method there can be implied influencing factors with different scale levels in an adequate way. The result of this method is an interpretable system of rules, which delivers an illustrative insight into the context pattern of the investigated process...|$|R

The former powerhouse and the fuel store have reinforced concrete floors, fibro lining, double-hung sash windows and double timber framed doors.|$|R
50|$|The form of {{the church}} is very simple. It is a small building, {{rectangular}} in plan, about eight metres long and five and a half metres wide. The design is functional; there is an absence of external decorative features. The lack of any obvious Christian iconography is notable. Concrete stumps have been used to replace the original timber and elevate the building to a height of approximately one metre. The space between the floor of the church and the ground is in filled with horizontal planks. The structure is timber framed and clad with weatherboard. All of the <b>windows</b> are tall <b>pivoted</b> sash <b>windows.</b> Each of these is divided into two frames, {{one on top of the}} other. Each frame is divided into four lights made of clear glass. The bottom frame of each <b>window</b> <b>pivots</b> about a horizontal axis in the middle of the frame. Access at the front of the building is via a porch and a set of double, ledge and brace timber doors. At the rear access is via a simple wooden door.
