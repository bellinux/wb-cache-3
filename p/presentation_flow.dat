It is widely used in learning, business, and open talk. In order to attract audience, presenter must have a good presentation skills. But presenting by using manual controller such as mouse and keyboard will affect the <b>presentation</b> <b>flows.</b> Presenter need to control their own slideshow yet they need to communicate with the audience. Presenter need to move freely while doing a presentation otherwise the audience will get bored with the presentation or even worse the presenter will lose their attention. Controlling the slideshow without effecting their presentation skill is a very difficult things to do.

40|$|Abstract. MPML 3 D is {{our first}} {{candidate}} {{of the next generation}} of authoring languages aimed at supporting digital content creators in providing highly appealing and highly interactive content with little effort. The language is based on our previously developed family of Multimodal Presentation Markup Languages (MPML) that broadly followed the “sequential” and “parallel ” tagging structure scheme for generating presynchronized presentations featuring life-like characters and interactions with the user. The new markup language MPML 3 D deviates from this design framework and proposes a reactive model instead, which is apt to handle interaction-rich scenarios with highly realistic 3 D characters. Interaction in previous versions of MPML could be handled only at the cost of considerable scripting effort due to branching. By contrast, MPML 3 D advocates a reactive model that allows perceptions of other characters or the user interfere with the <b>presentation</b> <b>flow</b> at any time, and thus facilitates natural and unrestricted interaction. MPML 3 D is designed as a powerful and flexible language that is easy-to-use by non-experts, but it is also extensible as it allows content creators to add functionality such as a narrative model by using popular scripting languages. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} an interface {{consisting of a}} virtual showroom where a team of two highly realistic 3 D agents presents product items in an entertaining and attractive way. The <b>presentation</b> <b>flow</b> adapts to users ’ attentiveness, or lack thereof, and may thus provide a more personalized and userattractive experience of the presentation. In order to infer users ’ attention and visual interest regarding interface objects, our system analyzes eye movements in real-time. Interest detection algorithms used in previous research determine an object of interest based on the time that eye gaze dwells on that object. However, this kind of algorithm is not well suited for dynamic presentations where {{the goal is to}} assess the user’s focus of attention regarding a dynamically changing presentation. Here, the current context of the object of attention has to be considered, i. e., whether the visual object is part of (or contributes to) the current presentation content or not. Therefore, we propose a new approach that estimates the interest (or non-interest) of a user by means of dynamic Bayesian networks. Each of a predefined set of visual objects has a dynamic Bayesian network assigned to it, which calculates the current interest of the user in this object. The estimation takes into account (1) each new gaze point, (2) the current context of the object, and (3) preceding estimations of the object itself. Based on these estimations the presentation agents can provide timely and appropriate response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Rational {{energy use}} in {{industry}} decreases costs, environmental pollution and {{the depletion of}} resources. Since energy costs are often of the same magnitude as the profit, reduced energy use considerably affects the company results. Yet, systematic, profound analysis and optimization of energetic processes are seldom conducted. In {{order to reduce the}} effort and increase the quality of energy system analysis, a computer aided method is being developed in a research project called TOP-Energy (Toolkit for Optimization of Industrial Energy Systems). The main aim of TOP-Energy is to support energy consultants in analyzing and optimizing industrial energy supply systems by providing modules for documentation, simulation and evaluation of energy systems with respect to energetic, economic and environmental aspects. To ensure an integrated workflow, TOP-Energy reflects a business process model derived from the German guideline, VDI 3922.

(Business Management) The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to establish an alternative method in the <b>presentation</b> of cash <b>flow</b> information in order to provide management with a more effective technique to assist them in their decision making process. The <b>presentation</b> of cash <b>flow</b> information in accordance with current South African accounting standards, includes movements in working capital to maintain operations as part of deriving the amount of cash retained from operating activities. In this study it is suggested that movements in working capital should be treated similarly to that of fixed assets in the cash flow statements.

40|$|The area of {{multimedia}} applications keeps growing as more media become accessible and affordable on various computer platforms. Through {{the use of}} multiple information channels, more effective and expressive communication among people using computers is possible. However, {{due to the lack of}} a systematic authoring environment, multimedia documents are difficult to construct and their production is unnecessarily constrained in the ways that temporal and spatial relationships within the document can be expressed, and in the ways which user interactions can be employed. In this dissertation, a number of techniques to enhance the multimedia authoring environment are presented. A hierarchical framework is provided to form the basic multimedia document structure and to support various media materials uniformly, including regular media as well as user interactions. Based on this framework a set of algorithms for low-level analysis and synthesis are developed to support high level authoring tools. Error checking such as resource conflict detection and resolution, as well as better understanding of a multimedia document therefore become possible. A number of flow control primitives have also been identified to support flexible user interactivity. Finally, mechanisms to realize a novel multimedia authoring approach, the walk-through paradigm, are developed. All these techniques are implemented and tested in a multimedia authoring prototype environment following object-oriented design principles. Together, these techniques support more interesting multimedia documents, better authoring aids and more friendly authoring environment. Better user interaction is possible in multimedia documents with flexible scheduling and <b>presentation</b> <b>flow</b> control. Interactively analyzing and modifying the document provides useful authoring support, and the walk-through mechanism supports an easy-to-use authoring tool...|$|E

Starting with a requirement analysis done by use cases technique, it focuses on the design phase. The conceptual model of the application is used as guideline for modeling the navigation space. From the navigation space model we derive, in a next step, a navigation structure model which shows how to navigate through the navigation space using access elements like indexes, guided tours, queries and menus. Finally, a presentation model is constructed based on the navigation structure model. It provides an appropriate UML notation to support sketching and storyboarding. In addition, we suggest to use UML interaction diagrams to represent the <b>presentation</b> <b>flow.</b> During the whole development process we identify steps that can be performed in an automatic way thus providing the basis for a generation mechanism for Web application design. The different models of the design process are represented by using a UML conform extension of UML for Web applications (UML profile). The authoring process is illustrated with an example: a Web [...] based conference review system. The strength of the presented Web engineering approach is given by the fact that we use exclusively the UML notation and techniques.
