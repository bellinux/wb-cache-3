5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, <b>psychological</b> <b>health,</b> and social competence.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the relationship between personality and symptoms of <b>psychological</b> ill <b>health</b> in adult male offenders. Male offenders (N = 161) housed at two medium-high-risk institutions completed the Ten Item Personality Inventory and the Symptom Checklist Outpatient Rating Scale. Emotional stability emerged as the strongest individual predictor of <b>psychological</b> ill <b>health</b> and predicted each of the subscales measured (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism) and overall symptoms. Although agreeableness predicted depression and anger-hostility only, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience did not predict any aspect of <b>psychological</b> ill <b>health</b> investigated. The findings contribute to the current literature and provide further information {{about the relationship between}} personality and symptoms of <b>psychological</b> ill <b>health</b> in adult male offender...|$|R

5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and <b>psychological</b> <b>health</b> can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

A personality properties such as lively, positive, active, and brisk performances are one of an indicator for personal <b>psychological</b> positive <b>health.</b> We have developed a <b>psychological</b> positive <b>health</b> inventory, the <b>Psychological</b> Lively Scale(PLS). The PLS consisted of 20 -item positive health scale and 10 -item negative health scale. Later negative scale involved pathological items in order to clarify the meaning of positive scale. A total of 538 subjects (160 men and 378 women) participated in this study. Results of statistical analysis indicated that there were four subscales in the items of positive health, such as positiveness, stability of mood, self-acceptance and life satisfaction. In positive health scale, mean total score of all subjects was 53. 34 and mean total score of men was 54. 25 and of women was 54. 42. In negative health scale, mean total score of all subjects was 20. 61 and of men was 20. 47, of women was 20. 68. Total score of positive health increased with aging of subjects...|$|R

For most of the 19th century, Russia and Britain were not just geopolitical rivals in Asia, but also ideological opponents as many in both nations believed autocratic Russia and democratic Britain were destined to battle each for world domination. In Prussia, the Junkers tended to see much in common with the ordered society of Imperial Russia, and disliked British democracy.
