40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method to}} determine the infinite inhibition concentrations (IICs) of antimicrobial agents. This method was based on finding the relative effectiveness of an inhibitor at various concentrations. Benzoic acid and parabens were tested on Saccharomyces bayanus, Hansenula sp., and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The relative effectiveness values of these compounds were established. A plot of the inhibitor concentration versus the reciprocal of relative effectiveness was linear. The chi-axis intercept was the concentration of the inhibitor which gave infinite microbial inhibition. For S. bayanus the IICs were 330, 930, 480, and 220 ppm (330, 930, 480, and 220 ml/liter) for benzoic acid and methyl-, ethyl-, and <b>propylparabens,</b> respectively. For Hansenula sp. the IIC was 180 ppm for benzoic acid. For P. fluorescens the IICs were 1, 310, 960, and 670 ppm for methyl-, ethyl-, and <b>propylparabens,</b> respectively. Our {{results indicated that the}} IIC is affected by the growth medium. The advantages and applications of this method are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Butylparaben is weakly {{estrogen}}ic, {{meaning it}} mimics natural estrogen in the body. For example, parabens {{can bind to}} estrogen receptors and regulate estrogen responsive gene products in experimental cell systems. Long-chained parabens, like butylparaben, are more estrogenic than short-chained parabens, like methyl- or ethylparaben. This difference is attributed to the greater lipophilicity of the former. A scientific review found that butylparaben displayed the most competitive binding to rat estrogen receptors when tested along with methyl, ethyl, and <b>propylparabens.</b>|$|R
40|$|Parabens are {{commonly}} used as antimicrobial preservatives {{in a variety of}} personal care, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food products. It is a group of synthetic chemicals that person exposed every day. Parabens are ubiquitously present in waste water, river, soil and house dust. It has also been detected in human tissue and body fluids. It also acts as endocrine disrupter at high exposure levels. Studies in young male rats exposed during development have shown adverse effects on sperm production and testosterone levels following exposure to parabens with longer side chains i. e. butyl,-isobutyl and <b>propylparabens.</b> After dermal uptake, parabens are hydrolyzed, conjugated with protein and excreted in urine. Despite high total dermal uptake of parabens and its metabolites, little intact parabens can be recovered in blood and urine. Overall the estrogenic parabens and their metabolites in blood may exceed the action of endogenous estradiol. The interaction between parabens and mitochondrial function in the testis may be key in explaining the contribution of parabens for a decrease in reproductive potential. Thus Parabens which has been considered as a preservative in cosmetic may have harmful effects on Human skin. So it is important to assess the toxicological potential of parabens...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{controversy}} about whether methylparaben or propylparabens are harmful at concentrations typically used in body care or cosmetics. Methylparaben and <b>propylparaben</b> are considered {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) {{for food and}} cosmetic antibacterial preservation. [...] Methylparaben is readily metabolized by common soil bacteria, making it completely biodegradable.|$|E
5000|$|Parabens {{are active}} against a broad {{spectrum}} of microorganisms. However, their antibacterial mode of action is not well understood. They are thought to act by disrupting membrane transport processes [...] or by inhibiting synthesis of DNA and RNA [...] or of some key enzymes, such as ATPases and phosphotransferases, in some bacterial species. <b>Propylparaben</b> is considered more active against most bacteria than methylparaben. The stronger antibacterial action of <b>propylparaben</b> may be due to its greater solubility in the bacterial membrane, which may allow it to reach cytoplasmic targets in greater concentrations. However, since a majority of the studies on the mechanism of action of parabens suggest that their antibacterial action is linked to the membrane, it is possible that its greater lipid solubility disrupts the lipid bilayer, thereby interfering with bacterial membrane transport processes and perhaps causing the leakage of intracellular constituents.|$|E

40|$|Many active {{cosmetic}} ingredients formulated as medicated whitening products (quasi-drugs) {{achieve their}} effect through inhibition of tyrosinase activity, but no products can achieve this effect through degradation of intramelanosomal tyrosinase. Melanin is synthesized by tyrosinase, which is localized to the membrane of melanosomes in melanocytes. It {{has been reported}} that the optimal pH of tyrosinase activity is nearly neutral and decreases under acidic conditions. The environment in melanosomes that tyrosinase acts on has attracted attention from researchers. We found that tyrosinase was degraded by acidification of melanosomes, thereby decreasing its activity. We found that both inhibitors of aspartic protease and cysteine protease decreased the degradation of tyrosinase. It is thought that aspartic protease and cysteine protease are participating in the degradation of tyrosinase in acid melanosome. Melanosomal pH is regulated by Na+/H+ exchangers and V-ATPase. We investigated the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of melanin production of <b>propylparaben</b> using B 16 melanoma cells. The expression level of mRNA of tyrosinase and related proteins (Trp- 1 and Dct) was not affected by propylparaben; however, the protein levels in melanosomes decreased.

Five preservatives were selected including benzalkonium chloride, phenylethyl alcohol, methylparaben, <b>propylparaben</b> and chlorbutol. We {{were interested in the}} effect of these preservatives on CBF after single and repetitive exposure. Methylparaben (0. 0033 %), <b>propylparaben</b> (0. 0017 %) and chlorbutol (0. 005 %) did not impair CBF, neither after a single short-term exposure period, nor after a single long-term exposure period. Long-term exposure to benzalkonium chloride (0. 001 %), phenylethyl alcohol (0. 125 %) and a combination of methyl- and <b>propylparaben</b> (0. 0033 and 0. 0017 %) significantly decreased CBF. After a short-term exposure period, CBF recovered for phenylethyl alcohol and the combination of methyl- and <b>propylparaben.</b> Benzalkonium chloride decreased CBF non-reversibly. For two compounds, the effect on CBF was evaluated after repetitive exposure during 15 min for 5 consecutive days. Benzalkonium chloride resulted in ciliostasis for all concentrations tested after 5 days. Phenylethyl alcohol revealed a concentration-dependent effect on CBF, but no ciliostasis was observed. In conclusion, methylparaben, <b>propylparaben</b> and chlorbutol can be considered as cilio-friendly.

CASE REPORT: Serum from a D+ woman reacted in antiglobulin tests with RBCs stored (2 - 4 hours, 22 - 25 C) in C-LISS (L w and Messeter formulation, Immucor). Freshly prepared C-LISS-suspended RBCs did not react; nor did RBCs stored in LISS-additive reagents, PEG, saline, or homemade LISS. RESULTS: Studies using C-LISS-stored RBCs revealed an antibody that reacted with D+ and rrV+ RBCs, but not with r r, r r, or rrV-VS- RBCs. All partial D RBC phenotypes tested reacted, as did D+LW-, r G r, r G r, r y r, r s rV+VS+, and r s rV-VS+ RBCs. The active ingredient in C-LISS was <b>propylparaben.</b> Other LISS ingredients were not required; saline solutions of <b>propylparaben,</b> ethylparaben, methyl salicylate, 2 -phenoxyethanol, and butylparaben were active.
