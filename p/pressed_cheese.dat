An aging period of 21 days minimum is permitted for the black-crusted tomme and 45 days minimum for the gold-covered version.

40|$|Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a {{beneficial}} bacterium used as vitamin producer, bio-preservative, cheese ripening starter and probiotic. It adheres to intestinal epithelial cells and mucus and modulates the immune response. Interaction with the host is strain-dependent and relies on key surface proteins, still poorly investigated. We identified surface-exposed proteins in a strain previously selected for its probiotic properties. The role of these proteins in immunomodulatory properties was evidenced.

Pasteurized milk was inoculated with these more or less complex consortia and their effects on L. monocytogenes count, pH, acids and volatile compounds in the core of uncooked <b>pressed</b> <b>cheese</b> were evaluated. The growth of L. monocytogenes was the highest in cheeses prepared with pasteurized milk and only St. thermophilus. Inhibition in other cheeses was expressed by comparison with growth in these ones. All the consortia containing both lactic acid bacteria (group A) and Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (group B) - ABCD, ABD, ABC, AB - were more inhibitory than those containing lactic acid bacteria on its own (A) or associated only with yeasts (AD) or/and Gram negative (ADC). Consortia without lactic acid bacteria were weakly inhibitory or had no effect. Gram positive catalase positive bacteria alone were not inhibitory although most of the species became established in the cheeses. The Lactobacillus population (Lb. casei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. curvatus and Lb. farciminis) was predominant in cheeses (9 log CFU/g) with a higher count than Leuconostoc (7 log CFU/g) and Enterococcus (7 log CFU/g). Lactobacillus counts were negatively correlated with those of L. monocytogenes (r = - 0. 84 at 18 days) and with the level of D-lactic acid. There was no correlation between L. monocytogenes and Leuconostoc or Enterococcus counts. Complex consortium ABCD and AB not only had a stronger inhibitory power in cheeses than consortium AD, they were also associated with the highest levels of L-lactic and acetic acids. All cheeses inoculated with lactic acid bacteria differed from those without by higher levels of ethyl formiate, pentane and alcohols (2 -butanol, 2 -pentanol), and lower levels of ketones (2 -hexanone, 2, 3 -butanedione) and aldehydes (2 -methyl-butanal). Levels of 2 -methyl-butanal, 2 -butanol and 2 -pentanol were higher in ABCD and AB cheeses than in AD cheeses.

The {{aim of this}} study was to develop dairy ingredients with antifungal properties, active against a large diversity of spoilage fungi and to test their efficiency and organoleptic impact in real products. Materials and methods First, the biodiversity of spoilage fungi in a large variety of dairy products was investigated using molecular methods in order to select the most appropriate fungal targets. Then, the antifungal activity of fermentates obtained from 698 lactic acid bacteria, propionibacteria and fungal strains were screened in vitro using a novel high-throughput method in a cheese mimicking model. After optimizing fermentation conditions to improve antifungal activity, the best fermentates were tested at a pilot scale in uncooked <b>pressed</b> <b>cheese</b> (UPC) and sour cream to evaluate their antifungal activity using challenge and durability tests and their impact on organoleptic properties using sensorial analysis. Results The in vitro screening allowed selecting antifungal ingredients that were also active in situ. Durability tests revealed that a Lactobacillus rhamnosus fermentate had a promising activity in sour cream. For UPC, a Propionibacterium jensenii–based ingredient could be used instead of natamycin delaying Mucor racemosus and Penicillium commune for up to 16 days.
