So I’ve come to a quiet <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> in my family and my hometown. That’s why I called the album ‘Ithaca,’ which is the island Odysseus came home to in The Odyssey after 10 years of fighting and 10 years of trying to get back home. Rockport is my Ithaca, and coming home has been an Odyssean journey: enduring war and finding beautiful things in home. That’s the tone of the album, that there is both darkness and light to this story. My journey has healed me, and in that healing process I’ve been able to work again.” ...|$|E

Fueled by rage and anger, Eliza wants Kagenobu to teach her the necessary skills that would allow her to inflict pain and kill those who have ever hurt her. Seeing how similar the two are, Martinez tries to apologize for Eliza’s sudden outburst when Kagenobu proclaims he has heard enough and has come to the decision that Eliza will be allowed into the school, on probationary terms, which blinds and shocks Sasaki. Noticing that he has taken Sasaki by surprise, Kagenobu promises to discuss Eliza’s place in the school to him later and suggests they have a drink while discussing Eliza’s enrollment. All the while he and Eliza stare at one another.|$|E

This article complicates this understanding of violent space by highlighting the structural and institutional violence South Asian families experience as racialized immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) of Canada. This article illuminates circumstances in which the violent space of home and community become a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> shelter, <b>acceptance</b> and identity.

50|$|Kwon's first work Niche of Green {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{outstanding}} coming-of-age novels to emerge from the South Korean publishing world of the 1990s. Eight years after the publication of Niche of Green, Kwon published a short story collection called Maiden’s Skirt. This collection, a book that Kwon professes felt like publishing a love letter to herself, is about defeated individuals who, though troubled by their tragic fates, come to a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> resigned <b>acceptance.</b> The characters in this collection generally consist of people who are handicapped by relationships that society does not accept, such as extramarital affairs and gay relationships. Unable to overcome this sense of handicap, the characters witness their love collapse.In Kwon’s second short story collection The Days of Pink Ribbon, the characters are often people who have failed rather than succeeded. They are generally people with defects in their character or physique. In Kwon’s work, characters do not fail because of exterior causes but because of their own shortcomings or due to bad fate.|$|R
40|$|When {{a patient}} is {{extremely}} ill and/or dying, and the family expects a miraculous recovery, this situation can be very challenging to physicians, particularly when there is certainty that the miracle will occur through divine intervention. A practical approach is therefore provided to clinicians for engaging families that anticipate the miraculous healing of a sick patient. This strategy involves exploring the meaning and significance of a miracle, providing a balanced, nonargumentative response and negotiation of patient-centered compromises, while conveying respect for patient spirituality and practicing good medicine. Such an approach, tailored to the specifics of each family, can be effective in helping a family come to a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> about the impending death of their loved one...|$|E
40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen a surge of {{interest}} in the impact of working with trauma survivors on therapists’ psychological well-being. Existing literature assumes that therapists’ strong subjective responses to traumatic material adversely influence the therapeutic process. However, this has not yet been directly researched. Nine counselling psychologists were interviewed regarding the clinical impact of their responses to the disclosure of traumatic material. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis showed that significant challenges are experienced in the use of self in therapy with trauma survivors, including making sense of horrific human actions, negotiating complex interpersonal dynamics, and responding to ethical dilemmas in therapy. Results emphasised the importance that therapists attached to the development of their therapeutic use of self in therapy with trauma survivors, the value of learning from others and reaching a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and hope when working with trauma survivors.

40|$|Background. Rarely have women's {{experiences}} of {{admission to hospital}} during pre-term labor (PTL) been described from their own perspective. This study aimed {{to address this issue}} using qualitative methods. Methods. The views of 8 women admitted to hospital with PTL were obtained through semi-structured interviews. Issues explored included understanding of their condition, expectations concerning delivery, and their views about hospital admission. Results. A key aspect of women's experiences concerned their search for meaning to help them make sense of their sudden and unexpected hospital admission. Several women continued to feel anxious despite assurances from staff that everything was 'OK', whereas others had overcome initial anxiety and were excited about the imminent birth. There was consensus that the information received whilst in hospital was inconsistent, and some women believed that their concerns were being 'ignored'. Some women attributed PTL to daily stress, such as working long hours. Social support from women's mothers and other patients appeared important. Several women had been ambivalent about their pregnancy in the early stages, but were now in a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Two women reported previous childbirth experiences that were viewed as distressing. PTL had motivated some women to re-evaluate their lifestyle. Conclusions. Women admitted to hospital in PTL could be assisted in their search for meaning by provision of consistent information, having their views acknowledged, satisfactory social support, and dealing with any previous history of perceived traumatic birth experiences. ...|$|E

50|$|These {{municipalities}} are not {{the only}} ethnic enclaves in the GVRD. There are a variety of neighbourhoods within Vancouver proper that have formed based on lines of heritage. Chinatown, Little Italy, South Fraser and more are examples of such communities. These occur on a smaller scale than Richmond or Surrey. Mapping of ethnicity in Greater Vancouver shows that populations, although concentrated in some areas, disperse out on a gradient. Research on the subject depicts these landscapes as <b>places</b> <b>of</b> integration and <b>acceptance.</b> Increasing diversity has increased the liveability of this growing metropolis. There are, of course, challenges to multiculturalism. Nonetheless, these are communities with deep roots, unique traditions and shared social identities.|$|R
40|$|With {{the erosion}} of the {{rigidity}} of modern structures of social organization, identity issues are more than ever at the center of social life. The liquidity of the postmodern world (Bauman, 2000) broke many of the frames that lined the way we presented our-selves to the world, opening up formerly unthinkable possibilities. However, some social norms are rooted {{to such an extent that}} they do not allow this process to be carried out in its entirety. Gender is the most paradigmatic axis in this field. How can we arrive at a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> true <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> each human as such beyond gender identity? What if the idea of gender as a fixed phenomenon was undone and we accepted the narrative of each in-dividual as such? Would we not be closer to the humanization of each individual, of their recognition, if we looked at gender identity as performative? In the collection of essays “Undoing Gender ” (2004), Judith Butler suggests that the concept of gender be undone, transposing the essentialist, permanent and binary view, limited to male and female, which leads to the non-recognition of those who some-how challenge this standard. A crucial contribution to theories on identity and gender in the post-modern world, Butler notes that the humanity of those who do not fit the rigi...|$|R
40|$|The {{speaker of}} The Desert Survival Guide {{is seeking to}} {{reconcile}} his own disconnection, from the natural world, the cosmos, his family, and from his sense of his own humanity. The poems in The Desert Survival Guide are a healing ceremony, {{to come to a}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> regarding the loss of my father. The semi-autobiographical speaker of these poems has lost the immediate physical presence of his father in his life but still retains a deep memory imprint of the father and an unresolved need to process the absence of the father. He is gradually establishing a new connection to the land on which his father lived out his life and was buried. Impressions of his father bloom out from the geologic features of the landscape, the natural flora and fauna, all a realm of immediate waking dream. The speaker is something of an Orphean Shaman; he wanders the landscape howling his pain and loss, his love, his passions, as Orpheus did his songs. He seeks to pierce through the veil of death in order to reconcile the loss of his loved ones; he seeks to go beyond the human created world into the mystic experience of the desert through the power of utterance and by honoring virile animal familiars. He journey’s to the beyond, for much the same purposes as the shaman, a purpose common to poets, mystics, and scientists, to see beyond immediate knowing. He follows the most primal of human directives, the need to understand and communicate the experiences of his life which have struck him with great intensity...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I explore the {{reported}} experiences of children {{growing up in}} same-gendered families, with a specific focus on their experiences in their respective school settings. In this article {{the focus is on}} whether or not the children disclose their family structure, therefore focusing on disclosure and silence. I propose certain factors that might increase the possibility of open disclosure with positive outcomes, as well as investigate the factors that might encourage silence. In this article I argue that schools can be either <b>places</b> <b>of</b> tolerance and <b>acceptance</b> or <b>of</b> intolerance and prejudice. Those two standpoints are not, however, fixed but exist simultaneously in any given school. This article is structured by first offering an overview of how the children perceived different school climates/atmospheres, and is organised around the themes of tolerant and less tolerant school environments. Thereafter the focus is on individual narratives, to illuminate the way in which children in same-gendered families disclose and negotiate their lives in a school system.
