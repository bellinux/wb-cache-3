The rocket payload had a suite of instruments from Utah State University/Space Dynamic Lab (USU/SDL) and University of Texas, Dallas (UTD), for making in-situ electron density, wind and electric field measurements. The Sweeping Langmuir Probe or SLP was one of the instruments of the rocket payload and built by Utah State University. It operated in 2 modes: (1) Fixed mode, during which the bias voltage to the instrument was fixed at 3 V, (2) Sweeping mode, during which the bias voltage applied to the probe was swept through a voltage range periodically. There was 19 such sweeps made by the instrument through the entire trajectory of the rocket and during each of these 19 sweeps the bias voltage was swept from - 1 V to 3 V in 1024 steps. In this workbook, we present the current collected by the SLP during each of the 19 sweeps. The voltage measured by one of the four floating potential probes (FPP) is also included along with bias voltage and SLP current to aid in data analysis of the SLP current.

50|$|Now the fan {{favorites}} the Midnight Express {{soon had}} to contend with a blast from the <b>past,</b> The Original <b>Midnight</b> Express as it consisted of Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose, who had teamed up before Condrey and Eaton became a team. During the November 5 episode of WCW Saturday Night, Jim Cornette (kayfabe) received an anonymous phone call, as the caller ridiculed Cornette over Eaton and Lane's loss of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to The Road Warriors on October 29. Cornette recognized the caller and basically asked him to come say it to his face. At that point, Dangerously and the Original Midnight Express hit the ring and proceeded to pummel Cornette and Stan Lane, who was wrestling in a singles match. By the time Bobby Eaton showed up, it was three on one. Cornette showed up the next week on TBS carrying his blood stained suit jacket and the feud was on. The teams wrestled at Starrcade '88, but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in WCW for months, building up to a six-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per-view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, WCW (the former Jim Crockett Promotions) was under new ownership and in transition at the time and many wrestlers were coming and going. At the last minute, Condrey decided to leave WCW. Jack Victory was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward, but at this point no one really cared.|$|R
40|$|In 1988, we {{observed}} Venus with the millimeter interferometer at the Owens Valley Radio Astronomy Observatory at 115. 2712 GHz, the first rotational transition of ^(12) CO. The 33. " 4 diameter disk was spatially resolved by a synthesized beam with a full-width-half-maximum of 2. " 8. Local time ranged from {{afternoon on the}} planetary eastern limb, 2 PM, to just <b>past</b> local <b>midnight</b> on the western limb, 12 : 30 AM. Venus' millimeter continuum emission was measured in a 400 MHz broadband channel. More importantly, the CO absorption line was measured and finely resolved in frequency by two 32 -channel filterbanks having channel widths of 50 kHz and 1 MHz. The 400 MHz broadband channel visibility data yielded a continuum brightness map of Venus. Brightness variations across the disk were primarily caused by sidelobe beam effects associated with the incomplete (u,v) coverage of the OVRO array. However, after radial averaging, the continuum brightness map continued to show one significant trend - a nightside limb cooler than the dayside limb. The continuum channel has a weighting function which samples a wide layer in the atmosphere between 40 - 60 km at normal incidence and 55 - 75 km along the planet limb. A radiative transfer model roughly reproduced the increased nightside limb-darkening, when given a mesospheric temperature profile 40 K cooler than the nominal Pioneer Venus nightside temperature profile between 60 - 85 km. The strength of this result is undercut-by strong uncertainties associated with the continuum map's absolute intensity values due to {{the small number of}} baselines in the OVRO array. The 50 KHz filterbank resolved the inner core of the CO absorption line. This yielded the first measurement of doppler shifts across Venus due to strong winds in the upper mesosphere. It is the most important result presented in the thesis. Calculated weighting functions showed sampling of the mesosphere over a 12 km layer centered at roughly 99 km. The doppler shifts have a signature which matches westward, horizontal winds - being strongly "blue" on the east/dayside limb, zero near the center and strongly "red" on the west/nightside limb of the planet. Smoothed wind measurements were best fitted in a least squares sense for a mean zonal flow of 132 ± 10 ms^(- 1). A smaller (≤ 40 ms^(- 1)) subsolar-to-antisolar flow may have been superimposed on the dominant zonal flow in 1988. These measurements indicate either a reversal of the mesospheric cyclostrophic breakdown inferred by Pioneer Venus or the influence of uninvestigated dynamical forces. The 1 MHz and 50 kHz filter bank spectra were merged to look at the entire 115 GHz CO line. These 1988 CO spectra show a decided local time dependency, becoming progressively deeper from the afternoon to the evening hours. A constrained least-squares inversion algorithm was used to solve for the local CO mixing ratio profile over local time and latitude. The resultant CO mixing ratio remains constant with height at a value of several 10 ^(- 5) in the late afternoon hours but increases from 10 ^(- 4) at 80 km to 10 ^(- 3) at 100 km in the night hours. The highest CO abundances occurred after local 10 PM and centered about the equator between 40 °N and 40 °S. This distribution of CO abundance fulfills predictions from research based on disk-average CO spectra and photochemical models. Only the late afternoon profiles are surprising, showing essentially little CO rather than an expected moderate CO abundance from dayside photodissociation of CO_ 2. ...|$|R
