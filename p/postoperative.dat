5|$|Another {{study done}} {{investigating}} {{whether or not}} the viewing of natural scenery may influence the recoveries of people from undergoing surgeries, found that people who had a window with a scenic view had shorter <b>postoperative</b> hospital stays and fewer negative comments from nurses.|$|E
25|$|The first-generation Molteno {{and other}} nonvalved {{implants}} sometimes require the ligation {{of the tube}} until the bleb formed is mildly fibrosed and water-tight. This is done to reduce <b>postoperative</b> hypotony—sudden drops in <b>postoperative</b> intraocular pressure.|$|E
25|$|Complications due to LASIK {{have been}} {{classified}} {{as those that}} occur due to preoperative, intraoperative, early <b>postoperative,</b> or late <b>postoperative</b> sources: According to the UK National Health Service complications occur in fewer than 5% of cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Postoperative</b> wounds {{are those}} wounds {{acquired}} during surgical procedures. <b>Postoperative</b> wound healing occurs after surgery and normally follows distinct bodily reactions: the inflammatory response, {{the proliferation of}} cellular and tissues that initiate healing, and the final remodeling. <b>Postoperative</b> wounds are different from other wounds {{in that they are}} anticipated and treatment is usually standardized {{depending on the type of}} surgery performed. Since the wounds are 'predicted' actions can be taken beforehand and after surgery that can reduce complications and promote healing.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{decisions}} {{also take}} into account morbidities, particularly if cancer outcomes are comparable for instance surgery {{is associated with a}} risk of bleeding between 5–10%, and a 0.3% risk of fatal <b>postoperative</b> haemorrhage. Surgery may also be complicated by dysphagia, and while most patients can tolerate a diet on the first <b>postoperative</b> day, long term use of a feeding tube has been reported as high as 10%. Patients with larger tumours, involvement of base of tongue and requiring <b>postoperative</b> adjuvant therapy are more likely to require a long term feeding tube. Overall, function and quality of life appear relatively similar between surgery with <b>postoperative</b> radiation, and primary chemoradiation, but HPV+OPC patients tend to have better quality of life at diagnosis than HPV-OPC but may sustain greater loss following treatment.|$|E

25|$|AF often occurs after {{cardiac surgery}} {{and is usually}} self-limiting. It is {{strongly}} associated with age, preoperative hypertension, {{and the number of}} vessels grafted. Measures should be taken to control hypertension preoperatively {{to reduce the risk of}} AF. Also, people with a higher risk of AF, e.g., people with pre-operative hypertension, more than 3 vessels grafted, or greater than 70 years of age, should be considered for prophylactic treatment. <b>Postoperative</b> pericardial effusion is also suspected to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. Prophylaxis may include prophylactic <b>postoperative</b> rate and rhythm management. Some authors perform posterior pericardiotomy to reduce the incidence of <b>postoperative</b> AF. When AF occurs, management should primarily be rate and rhythm control. However, cardioversion may be employed if the person is hemodynamically unstable, highly symptomatic, or persists for 6 weeks after discharge. In persistent cases, anticoagulation should be used.|$|E
25|$|Although an {{effective}} antiemetic agent, {{the high cost}} of brand-name ondansetron initially limited its use to controlling <b>postoperative</b> nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{guidelines}} in both Canada and the United States recommend use of nasal irrigation for all causes of rhinosinusitis and for <b>postoperative</b> cleaning {{of the nasal}} cavity.|$|E
25|$|The body {{responds}} to <b>postoperative</b> wounds {{in the same}} manner as it does to tissue damage acquired in other circumstances. The inflammatory response is designed to create homeostasis. This first step is called the inflammatory stage. The next stage and wound healing is the infiltration of leukocytes and release of cytokines into the tissue. The inflammatory response and the infiltration of leukocytes occur simultaneously. The final stage of <b>postoperative</b> wound healing is called remodeling. Remodeling restores the structure of the tissue and that tissues ability to regain its function.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} including ondansetron {{appear to be}} effective in controlling <b>postoperative</b> nausea and vomiting. It is more effective than metoclopramide, and less sedating than cyclizine or droperidol.|$|E

25|$|In many countries, eye drops {{are sold}} to treat acute and chronic nonbacterial {{inflammation}} of the anterior part of the eyes (e.g., <b>postoperative</b> states). Diclofenac eye drops have also been used to manage pain for traumatic corneal abrasion.|$|E
25|$|If a {{dry socket}} occurs, the total healing time is increased. <b>Postoperative</b> pain is also {{worse than the}} normal {{discomfort}} which accompanies healing following any minor surgical procedure. The pain may last for seven to forty days.|$|E
25|$|Both {{implants}} (COI and MCOI) {{are composed}} of interconnecting channels that allow ingrowth of host connective tissue. Complete implant vascularization {{reduces the risk of}} infection, extrusion, and other complications associated with nonintegrated implants. And both implants produce superior motility and <b>postoperative</b> cosmesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} typically involves substantial <b>postoperative</b> pain, {{and includes}} vigorous physical rehabilitation. The recovery period may be 6 weeks or longer and may involve {{the use of}} mobility aids (e.g. walking frames, canes, crutches) to enable the patient's return to preoperative mobility.|$|E
25|$|Some 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, are {{important}} antiemetic agents. They {{are particularly important}} in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is {{in the treatment of}} <b>postoperative</b> nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|However, most {{surgeons}} prefer {{performing the}} bowel resection laparoscopically, mainly because the <b>postoperative</b> pain is reduced and the patient's recovery is faster.
