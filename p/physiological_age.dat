40|$|Ageing is {{a process}} that inevitably affects most living organisms and {{involves}} the accumulation of macromolecular damage, genomic instability and loss of heterochromatin.

40|$|Goal: The goal of {{the study}} is to find out whether {{increasing}} age is related to the level of spatial orientation disorder. The study summarizes a current knowledge about spatial orientation, both {{from the point of view}} of neurophysiology and aging, and its investigation. We research and compare two different age groups with the aid of three tests. The issue of <b>physiological</b> <b>aging</b> that potentialyl causes a disorder of spatial orientation is discussed in the experimental part of the thesis. Hypothesis: Increasing age affects spatial perception. Methods: We used Montreal cognitive test to select mentally healthy participants, and divided them into two different age groups. The group A is composed of 10 people aged from 75 to 85, their average age is 77 years. 10 people aged from 18 to 25 fall into the group B, their average age is 23 years.

40|$|Telomere {{shortening}} is a biomarker {{of cellular}} senescence and {{is associated with}} a wide range of age-related disease. Oxidative stress is also associated with <b>physiological</b> <b>aging</b> and several age-related diseases. Non-human studies suggest that variants in oxidative stress genes may contribute to both telomere shortening and biological aging. We sought to test whether oxidative stress-related gene polymorphisms contribute to variance in both telomere length and physical biomarkers of aging in humans. Telomere lengths were calculated for 190 (82 men, 108 women) participants aged 79 years and associations with 384 SNPs, from 141 oxidative stress genes, identified 9 significant SNPS, of which those from 5 genes (GSTZ 1, MSRA, NDUFA 3, NDUFA 8, VIM) had robust associations with physical aging biomarkers, respiratory function or grip strength. Replication of associations in a sample of 318 (120 males, 198 females) participants aged 50 years confirmed significant associations for two of the five SNPs (MSRA rs 4841322, p = 0. 008; NDUFA 8 rs 6822, p = 0. 048) on telomere length.

40|$|Seed tuber <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> {{is known}} to {{influence}} a range of important growth processes in potato including early vigour of the plant, stem number per plant, hence tuber size distribution, time to emergence and the rate and duration of canopy cover rate of the plant. There is also an indication in published {{evidence to suggest that}} the expression of the seed tuber <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> effects is modified by planting environment and varies with genotype. Furthermore, current process-based potato models do not capture the effect of the seed tuber <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> and the interaction with planting environment. This reflects the lack of understanding and quantification of the effect of <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> on potato growth. This thesis reports on physiology studies to investigate the effect of seed tuber <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> and planting environment on stem number and component processes of pre-emergent growth and canopy development for important commercial cultivars of potato. The resultant findings are incorporated into a process-based potato model. Investigation of a production dataset collected from commercial potato paddocks in northern Tasmania showed that tuber size distribution was correlated with stem number per plant. The investigation also showed that planting environment (i. e. location, sowing date and soil type) varied with stem number. A follow-up controlled-environment trial provided further confirmation of the interaction between seed tuber <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> and planting environment and that the response varies with genotype. Currently, the lack of any reliable measure of physiological seed age makes it difficult to develop response functions that can be incorporated into process-based models. With this in mind, a study was conducted to explore the possibility of using mitotic index as an indicator for tuber sprouting pattern as affected by seed tuber <b>physiological</b> <b>age.</b> Physiologically older tubers were found to have a higher mitotic index than younger tubers. However, mitotic index of the eye bud cannot be used to explain the sprouting pattern of the seed tuber having different physiological ages. Sprouting pattern was controlled by a correlative inhibition and availability of soil water. Pre-emergent growth of sprouts after planting was characterised by an initial period of slow growth (lag phase) followed by rapid linear growth. The duration of the lag phase was strongly influenced by temperature. Linear growth of the longest sprout was significantly affected by the interaction between temperature and water potential and varied significantly between cultivars. <b>Physiological</b> <b>age</b> of the seed tubers was found to have a significant influence on the canopy development of potato. Plants grown from physiologically older tubers were characterized by more branching on the main stem nodes and smaller individual leaf size. Leaf appearance rate was affected significantly by seed <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> with the response varying with cultivar. In Russet Burbank, leaves generated from physiologically older seed appeared at a faster rate (39. 5 °Cd per leaf or 0. 025 leaves per day degree) than leaves from physiologically younger seed tubers (51. 2 °Cd per leaf or 0. 02 leaves per day degree). No significant difference was found between treatments for Atlantic although the first leaf in plants from older seed reached full size earlier (46. 9 °Cd) than plants from younger seed tuber (75. 9 °Cd). Seed tuber <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> did not significantly affect the leaf senescence rate. However, senescence commenced earlier in plants derived from older seed tubers. The results from the physiology studies were incorporated into a new process-based growth and development model for potato for use within the APSIM modeling framework. A conceptual model was developed for the relationship between seed <b>physiological</b> <b>age,</b> soil moisture and temperature conditions at sowing and stem number. The complete potato model (APSIM Potato) was calibrated for leaf and stem biomass, tuber yield and phenology against a dataset collected from commercial paddocks in northern Tasmania and then validated against a larger independent dataset (48 paddocks) covering a wide range of growing environments. The model was found to adequately predict tuber yield (R 2 = 80...|$|E
40|$|The <b>{{physiological}}</b> <b>age</b> of seed {{potato tubers}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) modifies several morphological, physiological and agronomic {{characteristics of the}} crop. However, {{there is little evidence}} on the possible influence of <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> upon the mechanism involved in tuber initiation and starch accumulation. This study investigated the effects of the <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> of seed tubers on tuber initiation, starch synthase activity and dry matter accumulation and distribution. Physiologically aged seed potatoes promoted an early tuber initiation in the following crop. Early in the season the stolon tips of these plants showed an increase in starch synthase activity and an anticipated starch accumulation. During {{the rest of the season}} the starch synthase activity in the stolon tips of tubers grown from young seed was higher than those grown from the physiologically older ones, which decreased by day 70 after planting. Dry matter accumulation by leaves and stems did not differ between treatments, while tuber dry matter accumlation was higher in those plants originated from physiologically young tubers. These results confirmed that physiologically old seed anticipates tuber initiation and demonstrated that the pattern of starch synthase activity, starch accumulation and dry matter accumulation and distribution depends on hte <b>physiological</b> <b>age</b> of seed tubers. 199...|$|E

The preliminary results were consistent with other ageing markers such as the incubation period (IP) and desprouting sensitivity. Under our experimental conditions, the PAI allowed us to describe cultivar-specific and harvest year-specific age variations measured from the time the haulm (foliage) was killed and the mother plant's influence on the tubers was no longer present. By contrast, the IP data displayed a higher inherent variability that impaired their discrimination ability. Critical PAI values corresponding to the main postharvest developmental steps (e. g., dormancy, apical dominance, multiple sprouting) were then identified on the basis of emergence pattern data, allowing us to propose this index as a useful reference frame for future ageing studies.
