2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this <b>piezometer</b> data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E

5000|$|The first piezometers in {{geotechnical}} engineering {{were open}} wells or standpipes (sometimes called Casagrande piezometers) [...] installed into an aquifer. A Casagrande <b>piezometer</b> will typically {{have a solid}} casing down to the depth of interest, and a slotted or screened casing within the zone where water pressure is being measured. The casing is sealed into the drillhole with clay, bentonite or concrete to prevent surface water from contaminating the groundwater supply. In an unconfined aquifer, the water level in the <b>piezometer</b> would not be exactly coincident with the water table, especially when the vertical component of flow velocity is significant. In a confined aquifer under artesian conditions, the water level in the <b>piezometer</b> indicates the pressure in the aquifer, but not necessarily the water table. <b>Piezometer</b> wells can be much smaller in diameter than production wells, and a 5 cm diameter standpipe is common.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{understanding}} of the hydrogeological environment of the strata over and about an operating mine provides {{some insight into the}} effectiveness of gas drainage, the identification of potential difficult drainage areas and the behaviour of overlying aquifers during mining. Bore hole <b>piezometers</b> have been routinely installed in BHP Billiton’s exploration holes for many years. The instruments were developed as one of the outcome of NERDCC research grants completed in 1983 and 1986. <b>Piezometers</b> and geophones packaged to survive the difficult environments of the Southern Coalfield remain operational and are routinely read today, twenty years after their installation. The data acquired over the years present a view of the piezometric state of the selected target seams prior to, and during mining, that would be difficult to achieve by other means. The installation of <b>piezometers</b> is now a routine part of the borehole abandonment procedure. <b>Piezometers</b> are precisely placed against the target coal seam at depths in excess of 700 m with minimal tools and non specialist field technicians.

40|$|A {{harmonic}} analysis method {{was used to}} determine vertical hydraulic conductivities (Kv) in geologic media between vertically separated <b>piezometers</b> using water level measurements.

The method was applied to water level data collected from nested <b>piezometers</b> at two thick clay-rich till aquitards in Saskatchewan, Canada.

40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{hypothesized}} that overland flow from urbanizing and agricultural land uses will enhance stream-groundwater interactions. Near-channel groundwater chemistry and hydraulics were studied during runoff events {{to test this}} hypothesis and to increase the understanding of hyporheic processes important to stream chemistry and ecology. Twenty-four <b>piezometers</b> (0. 3 - to 1 -meter depth) were installed at two central Pennsylvania sites in active, channel sediments of an alluvial aquifer overlying carbonate bedrock, Measurements were taken in <b>piezometers</b> and the stream for five rainfall events between October 2001 and April 2002. This paper discusses the November 30, 2001 event. Surface water and groundwater samples were analyzed to find chemical parameters appropriate for tracing surface water-groundwater interactions. Regression analyses with '*O indicate that calcium may be an appropriate tracer in this watershed. Water chemistry and head varied significantly with time, depth and location in channel sediments during the event. Field data indicate that runoff can result in increased stream losses and an increase in shallow, subsurface flow downstream.

40|$|International audienceThe {{temporal}} {{variability of}} water-level {{fluctuations in the}} chalk aquifer of Upper Normandy, France is constrained by natural climate fluctuations and is {{closely linked to the}} regional geological patterns. The chalk plateaus are covered with 5 – 50 m thick semi-permeable surficial formations; the thickness of the underlying chalk aquifer varies from 50 to 300 m. The relationship among climate oscillations, piezometric levels, and geologic structure were investigated by correlation, Fourier spectral, and continuous wavelet analyses of selected piezometric time-series data. Analysis focused on two <b>piezometers</b> located on the uplifted side of a major fault and two <b>piezometers</b> on the downthrown side. After generalization to other <b>piezometers</b> in the region, it was deduced that, in the downthrown compartments, a substantial aquifer and surficial formations thickness would imply a strong attenuation of annual variability, while multi-year variability is clearly expressed. Conversely, in the uplifted compartments, a thin layer of surficial formations and small thickness of the chalk authorizes strong variations on the annual mode with respect to the contribution of long-term climatic oscillations (multi-year variability). The results then demonstrated—and proposed a spatial determination of—the differential influence of geological patterns on the filtering of climate-induced oscillations in piezometric variability...|$|R
