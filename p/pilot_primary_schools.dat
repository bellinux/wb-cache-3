40|$|The study {{attempts}} to descriptively evaluate {{the implementation of}} School-based Quality Improvement Management in nine <b>pilot</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>Schools</b> in the Bolaang Mongondow Regency. Con­ducted in two months, this exploratory research {{was carried out in}} two phases. The first phase was in the form of documenting school profiles, proposals for School-based Quality Im­provement Management, and reports on the implementation of School-based Quality Improvement Management. The second phase was data collection through interviews with respondents considered the key informants: school principals, teachers, and school committee members. The study demonstrates that with regard to five important issues, that is, transparency, cooperation, independence, accountability, and sustainability, the implementation of School-based Quality Improvement Management in nine Pri­mary Schools in the Bolaang Mongondow Regency has been, to some extent, a success. Two points however, need immediate actions: 1) active involvement of School Supervisory Council particularly to establish and sustain transparency, and 2) openness of the school principals to new ideas, innovations and paradigms...|$|E
40|$|This {{descriptive}} research aims {{to identify}} the relationship between Quality School Management System and teacher’s productivity and quality. A total of 56 school administrators consisting of Headmasters and Senior Assistant Teachers from 14 <b>pilot</b> <b>primary</b> <b>schools</b> in the Johor Bahru were involved. Data from the 2011 Verification Summary Report were {{used to examine the}} level of Quality School Management System, while the survey instrument developed by Rahmah (1997) was used to identify teacher’s level of productivity and quality. The finding of the pilot study indicated that the instrument’s coefficient alpha is 0. 966. Data from the survey were analysed using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14. 0, involving descriptive and inferential statistics of correlation only. Findings of the study show that the Quality School Management System is highly practised with five dominant aspects, which are Management of Timetable, Teaching and Learning, Student’s Work Review, Examination and Subject Panel. Meanwhile, the most dominant aspects of teacher’s productivity and quality are Personality, Knowledge, Leadership and Skills. The correlation analysis shows that there is no significant correlation between the level of Quality School Management System and teacher’s productivity and quality. Finally, the study proposed several suggestions to relevant agencies or parties for further actions and for future research...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the goals}} for Namibia’s Vision 2030, through ETSIP (2005 ‐ 2015), is to {{establish}} a preprimary year in primary schools for all children aged 5 ‐ 6 to be developed first in schools serving the poorest population and OVCs. ECD is widely recognised as having {{a significant impact on the}} subsequent learning of children. The high failure and dropout rate in grade 1 made this process an important one. In 2008 the integration of ECD became a reality in five schools in the Khomas region of Namibia. At present there are 29 pilot schools in the Khomas region 29 schools, and 504 in the whole of Namibia. According to the MoE all primary schools should have a preprimary class as ECD has been recognized as a key contributor to positive outcomes in schools. This study sought to investigate various stakeholders’ experiences and views of the integration of pre‐primary into mainstream pre‐primary schooling. The goal was to investigate the management and leadership implications of this integration. The study is an interpretive case study of three <b>pilot</b> <b>primary</b> <b>schools.</b> The research design made provision for data collection through semi‐structured interviews, focus groups and document analysis. The main finding was that, despite numerous challenges, principals are positive about the integration of pre‐primary. There is a sense of appreciation of the importance of pre‐primary. Principals adopt participative and collegial management approaches in leading their schools towards becoming learning organisations. The study also uncovered several significant challenges, such as the need for more training and the provision of infrastructure to make the process more effective...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an alternative approach}} to environmental education which focuses on children's ideas and action rather than scientific knowledge. The approach is based on children's willingness and ability to act and participate in their community and environment. The paper contributes {{to the development of}} an alternative pedagogical proposition for environmental education that is inspired by critical education. The proposed action model has emerged from a one-year qualitative, participatory research in a <b>pilot</b> <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> in Athens, with the active engagement of 60 children, aged 9 to 12. The action model describes a path from denial of action to willingness for action.

Within the context of declining access to, and engagement with, the natural environment Forest Schools can provide invaluable life experiences for our children.

30|$|The studies {{conducted}} in Dutch <b>primary</b> <b>schools</b> were meant to qualitatively investigate the feasibility of the CATs and experimentally {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the teachers’ use of the CATs. In two <b>pilot</b> studies, ten <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> teachers and over 200 students in Grade 3 were involved (Veldhuis and Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen 2014). Although the teachers were offered a collection of CATs, they were free in changing these CATs or making their own CATs in order to have them fit their classroom situation. Results from these pilot studies showed that teachers and students enjoyed using the CATs and found them useful. Moreover, the students whose teachers used the CATs improved considerably more in their mathematics achievement as measured by a standardized mathematics test than the students in a national reference sample did. Later on, the effectiveness of teachers’ use of the CATs on students’ achievement was further confirmed in a large-scale quasi-experimental study with 30 primary teachers and 616 students (Veldhuis and Van den Heuvel-Panhuizen 2016).|$|R

40|$|Casual-serious {{games in}} science are games dealing with science topics that require short playing time and {{relatively}} low budget to develop, while based on educational purposes.

The framework comprised a series of <b>pilots</b> in a <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> class, in which flow was evaluated using online questionnaires. We found significant changes in flow components between the three phases of the pilot. Students’ responses indicate assimilation of social practices, and understanding of the relation between parameters.

40|$|The Welsh Government's School-based Counselling Strategy (the Strategy), {{implemented}} from April 2008 {{in secondary}} schools across Wales and a <b>pilot</b> selection of <b>primary</b> <b>schools,</b> was evaluated. A range of research tools were used, including desk research, analysis of client outcomes, qualitative interviews and surveys of key stakeholders' views. Implementation of the Strategy and its counselling services was generally perceived as successful by all stakeholders, including counselling clients, with evidence that all key recommendations for its development were implemented. Across six terms, 11, 043 episodes of counselling were attended. Participation in counselling was associated with large reductions in psychological distress; with levels of improvement that, on average, were somewhat greater than those found in previous evaluations of UK school-based counselling. Key recommendations are that permanent funding mechanisms should be established to embed counselling in the Welsh secondary school sector, with consideration given to its roll-out into <b>primary</b> <b>schools.</b> Service managers and schools should also look to ensuring equal opportunities of participation in school-based counselling from all sectors of the community, that adequate accommodation is available in schools for the delivery of counselling, and that a system of regular outcome monitoring is established...|$|R

A number of the students in the early class, especially at Carlstrom Field, were naval officers not destined for Army squadrons. However neither of the <b>primary</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>schools</b> had executive officers and that Carlstrom did not even have an Officer in Charge of Flying.
