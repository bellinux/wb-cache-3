5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the <b>public</b> <b>finances,</b> with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on <b>public</b> <b>finances.</b> The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E
40|$|The essays that {{comprise}} this Handbook cover {{a wide variety}} of topics in the theory of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> As a field of systematic academic inquiry, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> arose before economics or political economy. For instance, more than 90 chairs in <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> had been established in Europe before the first chair was established in political economy (Backhaus 2002, p. 615). The first scholars of <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> were the Cameralists, who emerged in central Europe in the 16 th century. For a long time after its Cameralist founding, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> was conceived as a multi-disciplinary field of study, and most certainly not simply a subset of economic theory. The object that <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> scholarship examined, the public household, was examined in a manner that sought to integrate the economic, political, legal, and administrative elements of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> In the post-war period, a splintering of approaches has taken place, sufficiently so that it is meaningful to distinguish between the old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> and the new, recognizing that new is not a synonym for better. The old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> has not been replaced by the new. Both are practiced currently, and are competing for the affection and attention of scholars. If the old-style <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> is still called <b>public</b> <b>finance,</b> the new style is often called public economics instead. This distinction is found in contemporary texts and journals. Fo...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of <b>public</b> <b>finances,</b> and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger <b>public</b> <b>finances</b> which brought economic stability.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance <b>public</b> <b>finances.</b> Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{discipline of}} <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> {{had originally been}} the core of political econ-omy. Over the past three decades, however, it has been redefined by leading scholars as the new <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> or <b>public</b> economics. At the same time, economics as a scholarly discipline has experienced a precipitous decline in relevance, and this has prompted many university administrators to abolish programs in <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> Recent awards of the Nobel Prize in economics went to James M. Buchanan and William Vickrey, both in-novative professors of traditional <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> Although not ignoring the accomplish-ments of the new <b>public</b> <b>finance,</b> {{this article focuses on}} the traditional message of <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> as a discipline that allows scholars to communicatewith policymakers.

5|$|Greater {{problems}} arose over financial {{speculation and}} {{the management of the}} national debt. Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the bondholder and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on <b>public</b> <b>finances,</b> as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the South Sea Company proposed to take over £31million (three fifths) of the British national debt by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, Charles Stanhope, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the conversion scheme opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of a bogus nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and {{with the support of the}} Company, passed the Bubble Act. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.|$|E
