25|$|Performers {{are granted}} the {{exclusive}} rights to their performance, including a right to remuneration for any uses of a performance or a recording thereof. Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously unfixed performance. As in article 7(1)(c) of the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> and Broadcasting Organisations, performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only. For broadcasts of records made for commercial purposes, the performers, together with the phonogram producer, have only a remuneration right on this secondary use of phonograms.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{under the}} Copyright Act of Japan, {{right to make}} transmittable shall be exclusively attributed to authors of original works, and performers, <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> a <b>phonogram,</b> broadcasting organizations and wire-broadcasting organizations as well as authors. Accordingly, for example, as for phonograms, not only producers but also performers such as singers who performed in the phonograms exclusively shall {{have the right to}} make transmittable. As a result, to upload such phonograms on internet, it is necessary to obtain permission from all of the relevant parties who are provided with the right to make transmittable under the Copyright Act <b>of</b> Japan, including <b>producers</b> and performers who contributed to creation <b>of</b> the <b>phonograms.</b> However, it is practically very difficult since the number of such parties can be enormous. As a result, it is criticized that such legal system prevents Japanese online content business from further developing by making fewer works practically available for such business.|$|R

The mandate given by right holders, members of CREDIDAM, is thus extended to non-members, Romanian and foreign performers, that can benefit from equitable remuneration as required by art. 146 d) of Romanian Copyright Law and art. 12 of the Rome Convention – the latter article providing that “if a phonogram published for commercial purposes, or a reproduction <b>of</b> such <b>phonogram,</b> is used directly for broadcasting or for any communication to the public, a single equitable remuneration shall be paid by the user to the performers, or to the <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>phonograms,</b> or to both. ...|$|R

On May 17, 2005, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{certified}} Barrio Fino platinum for having shipped one million copies in the United States. On March 3, 2006, it was also certified platinum by the Mexican Association of <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> and Videograms (AMPROFON) for sales of one hundred thousand units in Mexico. The album also received a platinum certification by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF) on March 22, 2005, for sales of over forty thousand units. In Canada, sales for Barrio Fino were considerably lower. Despite Daddy Yankee {{being one of the}} first reggaeton artists to receive airplay there, the album had sold only 9,300 units as of September 2005, according to Nielsen SoundScan. According to The Record, Barrio Fino shipped five million copies worldwide as of June 2006. In the United States, Barrio Fino became the best-selling reggaeton album of 2004, the best- selling tropical recording of 2004, and the best-selling Latin album of 2005 and the 2000s decade.|$|E

40|$|The Chinese <b>phonograms</b> consist <b>of</b> a {{semantic}} radical and a phonetic radical. The {{two types of}} radicals have different functional contributions to their host phonogram. The semantic radical typically signifies the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>phonogram,</b> while the phonetic radical usually contains a phonological clue to the phonogram’s pronunciation. However, it is still unclear how they interplay with each other when we attempt to recognize a phonogram because previous studies rarely manipulated the functionality of {{the two types of}} radicals in a single design. Using a full factorial design, the present study aimed to probe this issue by directly manipulating the functional validity of the two types of radicals in a lexical decision task with both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements. The results showed that recognition <b>of</b> <b>phonograms</b> which were related to their semantic radicals in meaning took a shorter reaction time, showed a lower error rate, and elicited a smaller P 200 and a larger N 400 than did recognition of those which had no semantic relation with their semantic radicals. However, the validity of phonetic radicals did not show any main effect or interaction with that of semantic radicals on either behavioral or ERP measurements. These results indicated that semantic radicals played a dominant role in the recognition <b>of</b> <b>phonograms.</b> Transparent semantic radicals, which provide valid semantic cues to phonograms, can facilitate the recognition <b>of</b> <b>phonograms...</b>|$|R
