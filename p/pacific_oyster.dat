Additional specimens (also treated as C.acanthogaster or C. acanthogaster humboldtiensis) were recovered between 1976 and 1978 from the Oakland Estuary, Elkhorn Slough, and San Francisco Bay.

25|$|The larvae of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>oyster</b> are planktotrophic, and {{are about}} 70µm at the prodissoconch 1 stage.

Over these weeks, larvae can disperse great distances by water currents before they metamorphose and settle as small spat. Similar to other oyster species, once the <b>Pacific</b> <b>oyster</b> larvae find a suitable habitat, they attach to it permanently using cement secreted from a gland in their foot.

Histopathology showed that 6 out of 36 oysters had a suspected bacterial infection, including 4 Nocardia-like infections. Two bacterial species, Vibrio aestuarianus and Nocardia crassostreae, were isolated from haemolymph samples and identified using PCR and sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene.

The near full-length 16 S rRNA sequence of this Dutch Nocardia sp. isolate was identical to other known N. crassostreae isolates from the west coast of North America.

40|$|Since 2008, mass {{mortality}} outbreaks {{have been}} reported in all French regions producing <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters,</b> and in several Member States of the European Union. These mass mortality events of <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters</b> are related to OsHV- 1 infection. They occur during spring and summer periods leaving suspect the quality of the marine environment and the role of seasonal use of pesticides associated with the arrival of freshwater in oyster rearing areas. Pesticides have been also detected in French coastal waters, especially in areas of oyster production. Using PMA real-time PCR we showed that a mixture of 14 pesticides has no effect on the integrity of virus capsids from viral suspension in the conditions tested. A contact of oysters with this pesticide mixture was related to higher mortality rates among experimentally infected animals in comparison with control ones (no previous pesticide exposure before experimental infection). We therefore suggest that pesticides at realistic concentration can exert adverse effects on <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters</b> and causes an increased susceptibility to the viral infection in experimental conditions...|$|R
25|$|In many areas, {{non-native}} oysters {{have been}} introduced in attempts to prop up failing harvests of native varieties.

25|$|Oysters {{have been}} cultured {{for well over}} a century. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>oyster</b> (Magallana gigas) is {{presently}} the most widely grown bivalve around the world. Two methods are commonly used, release and bagging. In both cases, oysters are cultivated onshore to the size of spat, when they can attach themselves to a substrate. They may be allowed to mature further to form 'seed oysters'. In either case, they are then placed in the water to mature. The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters. Bagging has the cultivator putting spat in racks or bags and keeping them above the bottom. Harvesting involves simply lifting the bags or rack to the surface and removing the mature oysters. The latter method prevents losses to some predators, but is more expensive.|$|E

For this purpose, as an important degradation pathway autophagy was investigated in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters.</b> An in silico research of genes involved in autophagy using the C. gigas genome allowed identification of homologs of ATG 1 and ATG 8 /LC 3 (Microtubule-associated protein 1 A/ 1 B-light chain 3).

Western blot analysis showed an increase of LC 3 protein during the infection, suggesting an activation of autophagy.

500|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas) is {{cultivated}} {{by similar}} methods but in larger volumes {{and in many}} more regions of the world.

Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50–80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in [...] "upwelling culture" [...] in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the bottom, in plastic trays, in mesh bags, on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone. The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required.|$|E

As a consequence of rising global consumption of seafood and over-extraction of wild finand shell-fisheries, aquaculture is the fastest growing food production method in the world. Although in some instances aquaculture may benefit wild populations by deflecting harvest pressure away from these, in others it may have negative impacts {{as a consequence of}} facilitation of disease or biological invasion or where it results in genetic pollution of wild populations with selectively-bred genotypes. The oyster industry of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, is presently entirely dependent on aquaculture. Although the NSW industry historically cultured wild-caught native Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata), in recent years high mortality of cultured oysters from QX disease has led to a shift towards culture of Sydney rock oysters selectively bred for disease resistance and non-native <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea gigas) that are unaffected by the disease. It is unknown how QX disease or the resulting strategies of management that have been applied to the aquaculture industry (culture of disease resistant Sydney rock or <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters)</b> may impact wild populations of Sydney rock oysters, and their important ecosystem services, which include provision of habitat and food for associated communities of fish and invertebrates. This thesis determined: (1) how QX disease has impacted wild populations of Sydney rock oysters, both directly and indirectly as a result of any facilitation of <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters,</b> and (2) whether wild-stock Sydney rock oysters, disease resistant Sydney rock <b>oysters,</b> and <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters</b> are functionally equivalent in their provision of habitat and food to associated communities of invertebrates. [...] Sampling in the Hawkesbury River, NSW, where QX disease has produced aquaculture mortality of Sydney rock oysters of up to 90 %, revealed only a low (< 14 %) prevalence of the disease-causing parasite among wild Sydney rock oysters on rocky shores. Consequently, mortality rates of wild Sydney rock oysters remained low and {{there was no evidence of}} replacement of populations of Sydney rock <b>oysters</b> with disease-resistant <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters.</b> Field and laboratory experiments showed that even under the scenario that aquaculture facilitates invasion of <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters</b> or causes genetic modification of wild Sydney rock oyster populations, little change in the ecosystem services provided by oysters would be expected. Despite the more rapid growth and mortality rates of Pacific than Sydney rock oysters, the two produced habitat of similar complexity and supported similar communities of invertebrates, irrespective of genotype. Settlement of Sydney rock oyster larvae did not differ between Pacific and Sydney rock oysters in mixed species beds and when in mono-specific patches, the nonnative oyster enhanced larval settlement of Sydney rock oysters in high-flow environments, but decreased its settlement under low-flow, high-density conditions. The rapid growth of <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters</b> had little impact on investment in anti-predator defences, such as shell strength and thickness, relative to Sydney rock oysters. Consequently, native oyster-boring whelks were capable of consuming <b>Pacific</b> <b>oysters,</b> although they consumed more of the Sydney rock oyster when both species were available. These results suggest that changes to the oyster aquaculture industry of NSW Australia are at present having little impact on wild oyster populations and their ecosystem services. The findings are consistent with other studies done elsewhere, which suggest there is often a high degree of redundancy in the services provided by native and nonnative oyster.
