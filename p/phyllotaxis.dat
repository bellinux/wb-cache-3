5|$|In 1917, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) {{published}} his book On Growth and Form. His description of <b>phyllotaxis</b> and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical {{relationships in the}} spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E
5|$|Plant spirals {{can be seen}} in <b>phyllotaxis,</b> the {{arrangement}} of leaves on a stem, and in {{the arrangement}} (parastichy) of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like the sunflower or fruit structures like the pineapple and snake fruit, {{as well as in the}} pattern of scales in pine cones, where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together. <b>Phyllotaxis</b> spirals can be generated mathematically from Fibonacci ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In hazel the ratio is 1/3; in apricot it is 2/5; in pear it is 3/8; in almond it is 5/13. In disc <b>phyllotaxis</b> as in the sunflower and daisy, the florets are arranged in Fermat's spiral with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the golden angle, 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant <b>phyllotaxis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Using {{a mass of}} examples, Thompson {{pointed out}} {{correlations}} between biological forms and mechanical phenomena. He showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid, and between the internal supporting structures in the hollow bones of birds and well-known engineering truss designs. He described <b>phyllotaxis</b> (numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants) {{and its relationship to}} the Fibonacci sequence.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. <b>Phyllotaxis</b> is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Charles Bonnet (1720–1793) {{points out}} that in the spiral <b>phyllotaxis</b> of plants going {{clockwise}} and counter-clockwise were frequently two successive Fibonacci series.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Adler turned his {{attention}} to the question of <b>phyllotaxis,</b> specifically to the arrangement of plant spirals according to the Fibonacci sequence. His papers in the Journal of Theoretical Biology serve as the basis for a revival of interest in the subject. In 2012, a compilation of these papers were published in a book by World Scientific Publishing. The book's foreword is by Adler's son, Stephen L. Adler, and the diagrams by his daughter, Peggy Adler. Adler gave lectures about <b>phyllotaxis</b> at many universities and conferences in the United States and internationally, including the University of Kansas, The Institute for Advanced Study and West Point.|$|E
25|$|The golden ratio has the {{simplest}} expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see Alternate forms above). It is, for that reason, {{one of the}} worst cases of Lagrange's approximation theorem and it is an extremal case of the Hurwitz inequality for Diophantine approximations. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in <b>phyllotaxis</b> (the growth of plants).|$|E
25|$|First, {{there are}} several cases where the NKS book {{introduces}} what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal Turing Machine, and the shortest axiom for propositional calculus. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like phase transitions, conserved quantities, continuum behavior, and thermodynamics that are familiar from traditional science. Simple computational models of natural systems like shell growth, fluid turbulence, and <b>phyllotaxis</b> are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) <b>phyllotaxis,</b> that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{analyses}} <b>phyllotaxis,</b> {{the arrangement}} of plant parts around an axis. He notes that such parts include leaves around a stem; fir cones made of scales; sunflower florets forming an elaborate crisscrossing pattern of different spirals (parastichies). He recognises their beauty but dismisses any mystical notions; instead he remarks that ...|$|E
2500|$|Fibonacci numbers appear {{unexpectedly}} {{often in}} mathematics, {{so much so}} that there is an entire journal dedicated to their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly. Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and distributed systems. [...] They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, <b>phyllotaxis</b> (the arrangement of leaves on a stem), the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern and the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts.|$|E
2500|$|Grimshaw {{developed}} {{the geometry of}} the copper-clad roof in collaboration with a sculptor, Peter Randall-Page, and Mike Purvis of structural engineers SKM Anthony Hunts. It is derived from <b>phyllotaxis,</b> which is the mathematical basis for nearly all plant growth; the [...] "opposing spirals" [...] found in many plants such as the seeds in a sunflower's head, pine cones and pineapples. The copper was obtained from traceable sources, and the Eden Project is working with Rio Tinto Group to explore the possibility of encouraging further traceable supply routes for metals, which would enable users to avoid metals mined unethically. The services and acoustic, mechanical and electrical engineering design {{was carried out by}} Buro Happold.|$|E
2500|$|According to Theodore Andrea Cook, Barr {{gave the}} golden ratio {{the name of}} phi (ϕ) in about 1909; Cook wrote that Barr chose ϕ by analogy {{to the use of}} [...] for the ratio of a circle's {{circumference}} to its diameter, and because it is the first Greek letter {{in the name of the}} ancient sculptor Phidias. (Although Martin Gardner later wrote that Phidias was chosen because he was [...] "believed to have used the golden proportion frequently in his sculpture", Barr himself denied this, writing in his paper [...] "Parameters of beauty" [...] that he doubted Phidias used the golden ratio.) Schooling communicated some of his discoveries with Barr to Cook after seeing an article by Cook about <b>phyllotaxis,</b> the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, which often approximates the golden ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Cedrus trees {{can grow}} up to 30–40m (occasionally 60m) tall with spicy-resinous scented wood, thick ridged or square-cracked bark, and broad, level branches. [...] The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots, which form the {{framework}} of the branches, and short shoots, which carry most of the leaves. [...] The leaves are evergreen and needle-like, 8–60mm long, arranged in an open spiral <b>phyllotaxis</b> on long shoots, and in dense spiral clusters of 15–45 together on short shoots; they vary from bright grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green, depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from desiccation. [...] The seed cones are barrel-shaped, 6–12cm long and 3–8cm broad, green maturing grey-brown, and, as in Abies, disintegrate at maturity to release the winged seeds. [...] The seeds are 10–15mm long, with a 20–30mm wing; as in Abies, the seeds have two or three resin blisters, containing an unpleasant-tasting resin, thought to be a defence against squirrel predation. [...] Cone maturation takes one year, with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing the same time a year later. [...] The pollen cones are slender ovoid, 3–8cm long, produced in late summer, and shedding pollen in autumn.|$|E

5000|$|In disc <b>phyllotaxis,</b> {{as in the}} {{sunflower}} and daisy, {{the mesh}} of spirals occurs in Fibonacci numbers because divergence (angle of succession in a single spiral arrangement) approaches the golden ratio.

In mature-disc <b>phyllotaxis,</b> when all the elements are the same size, the shape of the spirals is that of Fermat spirals - ideally.
