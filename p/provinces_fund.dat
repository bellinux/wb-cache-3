The model can reproduce the three-phase development, i. e., the acute period, the asymptotic period and the AIDS period, observed in the HIV-infected patients in a clinic. We show that the 3 D HIV model performs a better robustness on the model parameters than the 2 D cellular automata. Furthermore, we reveal that the occurrence of a perpetual source to successively generate infectious waves to spread to the whole system drives the model from the asymptotic state to the AIDS state.

In April 1990 the Peterson government announced their [...] "Let's Move" [...] program of $6.2 billion in transportation spending across the GTA {{over the next ten}} years. Let's Move added several components to the Network 2011 plan: a northern connection along Finch between the Yonge and Spadina Lines, extension of the Bloor Subway to Sherway Gardens, SRT extension to Sheppard, building an LRT along Eglinton into Mississauga. Missing from the plan was the Downtown Relief Line. It also deprioritized Sheppard, offering to fund it only if the private sector contributed a significant amount.|$|R

50|$|Vallerand {{served as}} tourism {{minister}} during {{the economic downturn}} of the early 1990s, a time when tourism revenues were further weakened by a strong Canadian dollar and strong promotional efforts from Quebec's regional competitors. He secured {{one of the few}} funding increases in Quebec's 1990 austerity budget, increasing the <b>province's</b> <b>funds</b> for tourism advertising from fourteen to twenty million dollars. In the same period, he worked with other provincial ministers to request that the Canadian government exempt tourism packages from Canada's new Goods and Services Tax (GST), a tax that Vallerand opposed in principle. In September 1990, he announced that Quebec would issue a GST rebate on lodging for tourists travelling from outside the province. Vallerand and federal minister Benoît Bouchard agreed on a one hundred million dollar plan to boost the tourism sector in January 1992, though revenues remained low throughout the year.|$|R
