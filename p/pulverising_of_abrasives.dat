40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was aimed at the {{evaluation}} of the mechanism of magnetic finishing with gel abrasive (MFGA), during which the performance of MFGA was compared to that <b>of</b> magnetic <b>abrasive</b> finishing (MAF). <b>Of</b> importance is that MFGA performs better than MAF based on the polishing-efficiency criterion. Silicone gels, however, are semisolid polymer gels with deforming properties that are temperature dependent, ultimately influencing significantly the polishing efficiency in MFGA. Therefore, taking as examples cylindrical rods which were polished using silicone gels with different plasticities to determine the corresponding temperatures <b>of</b> <b>abrasive</b> media in the working area, this study evaluated the MFGA mechanism to elucidate the properties of silicone gels and attain both the finished effect and effective gel abrasives in MFGA to produce a highly efficient polished surface. Next, circulating effects <b>of</b> <b>abrasive</b> media were identified to ensure the efficiency in MFGA and establish the relation between the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>abrasive</b> media and circulating effects in the working area.

40|$|Surface {{quality is}} an {{important}} characteristic commonly assessed in wooden products. Sanding relies on coated abrasives as tooling for both dimensioning and surface finishing but their performance is dependent on chip loading and grit wear. Traditionally, the useful life <b>of</b> <b>abrasive</b> belts in sanding operation has been manually assessed. This type of inspection is highly subjective and dependent upon individual expertise, consequently leading to under utilization or over utilization <b>of</b> the <b>abrasive.</b> This, in turn, affects the production costs {{and quality of the}} product. In this work, an intelligent classification method that determines the optimal replacement policy for a belt exposed to known manufacturing parameters is developed. Controlled experiments were conducted to develop <b>abrasive</b> belts <b>of</b> known exposure, followed with digital microscopy to capture images and process them with pattern recognition and classification algorithms. Grit size and machining time were the parameters of interest while response of the experiments included image information from the abrasive sheets after every experimental run.
