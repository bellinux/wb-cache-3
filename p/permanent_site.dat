5|$|The {{national}} Scout jamboree is {{a gathering}} of Boy Scouts from across the US. It is usually held every four years, with some adjustment for special years such as the 2010 National Scout Jamboree that celebrated the BSA centennial. The first jamboree was held in 1937 at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. Since then, jamborees have been held in varying locations. Beginning in 1981, the jamboree has been held at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. A permanent location owned by the BSA was sought in 2008 for future jamborees, high adventure programs and training. The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve near Beckley, West Virginia is now the <b>permanent</b> <b>site</b> beginning with the 2013 National Scout Jamboree.|$|E
5|$|Kingston {{lost its}} most {{influential}} advocate as <b>permanent</b> <b>site</b> of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds {{to construct a}} permanent building in Kingston. Clarence Campbell, then President of the NHL, grew tired {{of waiting for the}} construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support to situate the hall in Kingston. In the same year, the NHL and the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame located at Exhibition Place. The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair. Due {{to the success of the}} exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the Exhibition Place was needed. The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960. The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year. Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, a {{committee}} {{was put together}} by the Minnesota State Agricultural Society to select a <b>permanent</b> <b>site.</b> One site that was considered was an area around Minnehaha Falls, but the final site chosen was the Ramsey County Poor Farm, the fair's current site. It was a politically neutral site, being about halfway between Minneapolis and St. Paul. The fair first opened its doors there on September 7, 1885. The site was then 210 acres (0.8km²), but now stands at 320 acres (1.3km²).|$|E

In 2004, his widow, Margaret Pethick, took over the project. It was submerged in sea water for two years while connected to an electrical source to accelerate barnacle and mineral accretion on its surface for an aged look. In August 2006, the sculpture was installed on its <b>permanent</b> <b>site</b> at False Creek, Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|The academy {{operated}} as a day-school {{for some}} time after its inception till it began accommodating students in Claremont House, a single-storey building adjoining Ellen House. Accommodation was limited and therefore was only offered to students in special circumstances. Due to a steady {{increase in the number}} of applicants applying for enrolment in the academy, the academy's administrators began preparations to relocate the academy to a larger and <b>permanent</b> <b>site.</b> The initial site that was acquired to relocate the school was situated at Kokomlemle; however, this site had to be abandoned as a result of a prolonged litigation concerning the ownership of the land. A second site, which was located at Korle Gonno, was also given up because of its remote location.|$|E

The Rev. Ezra Fisher was asked to start the school, but {{when he went to the}} planned site it was not available, and instead he started to teach school inside the Oregon City Baptist Church while leaders contemplated what to do for a <b>permanent</b> <b>site.</b> Meanwhile, the Rev.

25|$|The first {{international}} Baha'i Youth Conference held in Costa Rica came about in 1972 {{two days after}} the Managua earthquake. However a minibus full of young people came through Honduras with only minor difficulties and two Nicaraguan youth got through. Total attendance was about seventy-five. 1977 also saw the first time a Bahá'í float was entered in one of the annualfestivals in Santa Cruz. A larger conference of about 200 gathered in January 1978. Some of the attendees, together with various adults, then took a trip into Guanacaste province where over a short time 14 new assemblies were founded and then they extended work into Meseta province (see San Ramón for mention of this remote province) where several groups were re-contacted and a new assembly elected. In 1983 the Universal House of Justice recognized the twin youth conferences of Honduras and Costa Rica held in early March - a challenge representing a substantial {{increase in the number of}} youth Bahá'ís - and called on them to consider the example of `Abdu'l-Bahá in civilizing influences they should undertake individually and collectively. In the fall of 1984 a <b>permanent</b> <b>site</b> for the National Youth Institute was chosen and plans were developed for it to serve as a center for the arts and performance, agriculture and outreach programs. A television crew made up of two youth from EI Salvador, a Bahá'í from Venezuela, and two non-Baha'i volunteers filmed Costa Rica's 1988 international youth conference which was attended by 120 people for a program to be aired in El Salvador.|$|E

40|$|Using Global Positioning System (GPS) {{data from}} <b>permanent</b> <b>sites</b> and U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) {{campaign}} data we have estimated co-seismic displacements and secular background crustal deformation patterns {{associated with the}} 21 February 2008 Wells Nevada earthquake. Estimated displacements at nearby <b>permanent</b> GPS <b>sites</b> ELKO (84 km distant) and GOSH (81 km distant) are 1. 0 ± 0. 2 mm and 1. 1 ± 0. 3 mm, respectively. The magnitude and direction are in agreement with those predicted from a rupture model based on InSAR measurements of the near-field co-seismic surface displacement. Analysis of long GPS time series (> 10 years) from the <b>permanent</b> <b>sites</b> within 250 km of the epicenter indicate the eastern Nevada Basin and Range undergoes steady tectonic transtension with rates {{on the order of}} 1 mm/year over approximately 250 km. The azimuth of maximum horizontal crustal extension is consistent with the azimuth of the Wells earthquake co-seismic slip vector. The orientation of crustal shear is consistent with deformation associated with Pacific/North America plate boundary relative motion seen elsewhere in the Basin and Range. In response to the event, we deployed a new GPS site with the capability to telemeter high rate, low latency data that will in the future allow for rapid estimation of surface displacement should aftershocks or postseismic deformations occur. We estimated co-seismic displacements using campaign GPS data collected before and after the event, however in most cases their uncertainties were larger than the offsets. Better precision in co-seismic displacement could have been achieved for the campaign sites if they had been surveyed more times or over a longer interval to better estimate their pre-event velocity...|$|R
