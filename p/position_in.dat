The Australians quickly captured the island's harbour and main airfield. The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the interior of Labuan, and offered little resistance to the landing. The initial Australian attempts to penetrate the Japanese <b>position</b> <b>in</b> {{the days after the}} invasion were not successful, and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment. A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June, but was defeated. Later that day, Australian forces assaulted the Japanese <b>position.</b> <b>In</b> the following days, Australian patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island. A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured. Australian casualties included 34 killed.|$|E

James identified that marketing definitions of positioning, which primarily relate to the four “P’s” of marketing – product, price, placement and promotion, are insufficient to define <b>positioning</b> <b>in</b> the context of public relations practice and has put forward a provisional conceptual framework for intentional <b>positioning</b> <b>in</b> public relations...|$|R
