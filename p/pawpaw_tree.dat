40|$|Growing {{medicines}} in home gardens Cue: Many common {{plants and}} trees found in Africa have recognised medicinal properties. Many others contain {{high levels of}} vitamins and minerals which can protect people?s health against disease. But there is also scepticism and doubt {{about the value of}} such plants. Can they really cure sickness, or is it better to buy a medicine from a shop or a clinic? The organisation Action for Natural Medicine was originally set up in the Congo, where health services and provision of medicines in rural areas were seriously affected by the civil war. Commonly known as ANAMED, the organisation trained people in how to use locally available plants to treat common illnesses. There are now ANAMED representatives in numerous countries, not only in Africa. One strategy used to promote the use of medicinal plants is setting up medicinal gardens. These provide planting materials and a venue for training courses, so that local people can reduce their dependence on pharmaceutical drugs and may be able to gain a source of income from growing medicinal plants. Nelson Moyo, head of ANAMED?s medicinal garden in Malawi, spoke to Excello Zidana about the work being done. IN:		?We have got pawpaws, neem, moringa ? OUT:		? thing is for them to be healthy. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 41 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Nelson Moyo, head of Action for Natural Medicine in Malawi, speaking about the benefits of growing medicinal plants in home gardens. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Moyo	We have got pawpaws, neem, moringa which is called chamwamba in our vernacular and then we have got Artemisia annua. ANAMED would like to get this plant given to {{as many people as possible}} to be used for the healing of malaria and again other diseases, because it is an immune booster. We can also use this plant for HIV infection as of today. So what we are doing is we sometimes have the planting materials here and make more of them and we distribute through the organisations that we are working with after seminars; they can get these plants and then they open their own medicinal gardens. Zidana	Many people think that using medicines obtained from stores, groceries is more effective than medicines from plants. How do you look at that? Moyo	It is not totally true, both sides have got weaknesses and strengths. People should also respect what God is giving them through nature. For example Artemisia, when we use it for malaria people get well after taking Artemisia for 7 days, most people they get well. But I also believe that no two bodies are the same. Somebody may take the same plants and use them, it may not work well for such bodies but it does not mean that the plants cannot be used. Lemongrass, for example; if I have got a fever I take lemongrass tea, I get relieved. So I do not think that is the truth to say that it is only the pharmaceutical medicines that can do better. Zidana	You also talked about moringa, the plant that is mostly found along the lakeshores. How good is this tree? Moyo	This plant is more nutritional. What we are doing is to tell the people that you have got a lot of worth by having moringa, chamwamba, and then what we are telling them is that they should harvest the leaves, dry them in the shade, pound them and then they can be using these leaves, the powder, they add it to porridge or they add it to their meat during lunch or supper and then they get a lot of vitamins from this plant: vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, there is again vitamin K, iron, magnesium, zinc and the like; a lot of mineral salts. So by just taking those leaves you are getting a lot of nutrients. Zidana	And you also said about pawpaws being very good in terms of treating or curing these common diseases. Tell us more about the <b>pawpaw</b> <b>tree.</b> Moyo	Yes the pawpaw plant is really wonderful because the pawpaw leaves can be used for asthma. Let?s say I have got asthma, I would take the young leaves of pawpaw and then I would dry them up. I either make like a cigarette, I smoke and then I feel better now in the air pipes. And then if I do not want to smoke a cigarette, I may just burn these leaves and then when I will be inhaling the smoke I will feel better, if I am asthmatic that is. And if I have got diarrhoea I would also use these same leaves of pawpaw and I just boil one handful of the leaves in 1 litre of water and drink. And the roots of this plant you can use when you have got rheumatism. You take fresh roots and then you just rub on the place that you have got a problem and then it helps. Zidana		As a liniment? Moyo	Yes it would go that way. And of course the sap from the green pawpaw fruit is good for, if I have got worm infection I would take maybe two tablespoons of the sap, the milk that we have from the green pawpaw. Zidana		The white stuff? Moyo	Yes of course I do not take off the fruit from the plant I leave it there. I just make incisions and then I get the sap, maybe two tablespoons and I drink this once and I can check again maybe after two weeks I can just drink again. But the worms are going to be paralysed and when I go to the toilet I may pass them out. Zidana	Now let?s focus on the environmental aspect. Many traditional healers go out to cut down trees maybe looking for leaves and barks. How do you think this garden will help in terms of conservation of the environment? Moyo	This garden, demonstration garden, we tell them how best they can harvest the leaves without cutting the branches off. And again if they wanted the roots, they take the side roots not the tap root because if they take the whole tree down then tomorrow we will not have medication. Like for example again the bark, if they just take the bark from the trunk you know then this plant is not going to live well. Zidana		It will die? Moyo	It will die. So we say for the bark it would be better to get from the branches because then the food is still going to go to the other branches. So they just take maybe a branch or two branches and then take the bark from there, it could be better. Zidana	How are you helping in this epidemic that has come in, the HIV/AIDS pandemic? Moyo	We try to get the plants that we know that they are immune boosters and the plants that we know they are nutritional. For example we just talked of chamwamba, Moringa oleifera. This plant, if it would be used in the right way? for example if I am HIV positive I would be getting like 3 tablespoons in the morning, 3 tablespoons afternoon, 3 tablespoons in the evening. If I do that for a month, two months or so I would get most of the nutritional values that I need for my body. And then we have got plants like Artemisia, Aloe vera, these plants they help quite a lot in keeping our immunity well. Zidana	Lastly, what would you want Malawi to be in future in terms of the availability of medicinal plants in Malawi and even in the whole region? Moyo	Just in general I would like to see that each and every family is having medicinal plants and then know how best can you use this plant and when can you use it. Because there are some plants that we are not supposed to use for example aloe, Aloe vera is not supposed to be used by expectant women but maybe people in the villages may be using that plant and then they may cause a lot of abortions and the like. So organisations should be willing to train these people on how best they can use the plants. In that way their lives are going to be developed. Zidana	And what advice can you give to those people in communities where these plants are available but they do not use them? Moyo	What I would say is that we should work together, get them trained and then even some of them they can make IGAs, income generating activities. For example chamwamba, they can sell that leaf. With this HIV infection people need a lot of that, so they may sell. Or they can be using it, because the first thing is for them to be healthy. End of track. There are many plants which can be grown in home gardens which can boost the health of families, and provide income...|$|E

50|$|Though {{settlement}} in present-day Paw Paw began during the 1830s, by 1847 {{there were probably}} no more than 50 people in the village. The name Paw Paw was derived from a nearby grove of <b>Pawpaw</b> <b>trees</b> {{on the edge of}} a 2000 acre forest. American general Winfield Scott is credited with being the first person of European ancestry to discover the area. The area that Paw Paw is located in was home to more than one stand of Paw Paw trees, thus more than one settlement took the name Paw Paw. To avoid confusion the townspeople renamed the village Wyoming Township. The new name came from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, where many of Paw Paw's earliest settlers originated. The Wyoming Valley was the scene of a massacre during the American Revolution in which over 300 American settlers were killed by Native Americans allied with the British. Many of Paw Paw's early settlers shared surnames with those who are listed as having been involved in the fighting and massacre.|$|R

The system affected the northern Vanuatu Islands between 25-27 February and 2-3 March, with heavy rain and strong winds {{of up to}} 80 km/h but caused no damage. Esau produced gale force winds on the Solomon Islands of Rennell and Bellona and knocked down several banana, coconut and <b>pawpaw</b> <b>trees.</b> The system also destroyed several houses and severely flooded various taro gardens and food crops. Esau produced hurricane-force winds on New Caledonia, while extensive flooding {{was reported in the}} territory. Several roads were blocked as the system blew down trees and damaged buildings, while power and communications were also knocked out over the island. One person drowned as she tried to cross a river near Hienghene, while a young child went missing on the island of Lifou but was later found safe by local residents. The extra-tropical remnants of Esau made landfall on New Zealand's North Island during 8 March, where hail and a tornado were reported to have occurred. The name Esau was subsequently retired from the list of tropical cyclone names for the South Pacific basin.|$|R
50|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Esau caused minimal damage as it {{affected}} the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and New Zealand, while {{the name was}} retired from the Lists of tropical cyclone names for the region due {{to the impact of}} this system. Esau first affected the northern Vanuatu Islands between 25-27 February, with heavy rain and strong winds of up to 80 km/h. The system subsequently affected the southern islands of Vanautu between 2-3 March, when it was considered to be as powerful and potentially damaging as Cyclone Uma. However, there was no damage or any gale force winds reported in Vanautu, after the system had become the fourth tropical cyclone to affect the island nation during the 1991-92 season. The system subsequently became the fourth tropical cyclone to affect the Solomon Islands, during the 1991-92 season between 27 February - 4 March. At its closest point of approach to the island nation between 28-29 February, Esau produced gale force winds on the islands of Bellona and Rennell and knocked down several banana, coconut and <b>pawpaw</b> <b>trees.</b> The system also destroyed several houses and severely flooded various taro gardens and food crops. It was subsequently estimated that relief workers, would need to provide aid for around 5000 people on the two islands.|$|R
40|$|Carica papaya L fruit (pawpaw) is {{a growing}} export crop due to its high demand. Success of this crop in the global market {{requires}} extended shelf-life of the fruit. This study assessed fruit firmness and colour change as time-related factors for harvesting {{in conjunction with the}} effects of pre-treatment with heat, chlorine or salt solution and storage conditions on the shelf-life of pawpaw. Two hundred and fifty <b>pawpaw</b> <b>trees</b> were studied from bloom to harvest in two fruiting seasons. Number of fruits per tree at peak fruiting, proportion of matured to immature fruits and number of harvest visits were recorded. Fruits were handpicked and only certified healthy fruits were studied for quality and acceptability. Range of matured fruits on trees was 8 - 25 with average per harvest of 5 fruits per tree. The proportion of matured to immature fruits at each harvest visit was 2 : 3. Harvested fruits that have not attained full maturity indicated by first colour break either failed to ripe or ripen unevenly. Matured fruits with early sign of ripening preserved for 3 - 7 and 9 - 12 days at 27 - 32 ° C and 19 - 230 C respectively. Treatments with salt solution prior storage produced poorly ripe and disfigured fruits and encouraged the growth of moulds (Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Mucor spp., Colletotrichum gloeosporoides, Alternaria spp., Rhizopus stolonifer). Heat treatment and dip in chlorine water gave the upper range of shelf-life. Timing of harvest, post-harvest handling and storage at low temperature are critical in determining the post-harvest shelf-life of C. papaya fruits...|$|R
