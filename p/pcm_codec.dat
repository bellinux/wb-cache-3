However, in non-deterministic environment or different transmission message signal, bit error rate of PCM encoding methodologies maybe be varied according to different working condition or different signal source.

40|$|As {{a popular}} {{real-time}} {{service on the}} Internet, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communication attracts more and more attention from the researchers in the information security field. In this study, we proposed a VoIP steganographic algorithm with variable embedding capacities, incorporating AES and key distribution, to realize a real-time covert VoIP communication. The covert communication system was implemented by embedding a secret message encrypted with symmetric cryptography AES- 128 into audio signals encoded by <b>PCM</b> <b>codec.</b> At {{the beginning of each}} VoIP call, a symmetric session key (SK) was assigned to the receiver with a Session Initiation Protocol-based authentication method. The secret message was encrypted and then embedded into audio packets with different embedding algorithms before sending them, so as to meet the real-time requirements of VoIP communications. For each audio packet, the embedding capacity was calculated according to the specific embedding algorithm used. The encryption and embedding processes were almost synchronized. The time cost of encryption was so short that it could be ignored. As a result of AES-based steganography, observers could not detect the hidden message using simple statistical analysis. At the receiving end, the corresponding algorithm along with the SK was employed to retrieve the original secret message from the audio signals. Performance evaluation with state-of-the-art network equipment and security tests conducted using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon method indicated that the proposed steganographic algorithm is secure, effective, and robust...|$|E
40|$|In today's modern {{telephony}} network, VoIP is fast {{emerging as}} one of the main communication techniques. However, the performance and the quality of VoIP are affected by echo. Packet Based Echo Canceller (PBEC) is introduced, as a solution to cancel echo in the VoIP network. PBEC can replace the current echo cancellers, which are located in the Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN) central switches. The operating principle of the PBEC is explained and its advantages are highlighted. The performance of the PBEC using different speech codecs is also studied. Using the PBEC, a maximum Echo Return Loss Enhancement (ERLE) of 37. 39 dB has been achieved when used with the Pulse Code Modulation (<b>PCM)</b> based speech <b>codec.</b> From the simulation results, {{it can be seen that}} the performance of the Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) clearly matches the performance of the <b>PCM</b> based speech <b>codec.</b> The other major problem affecting the VolP network is the issue of packet loss. This issue of Packet loss has been successfully addressed in this paper by the insertion of random values. With the insertion of random values, the ERLE increases by 4. 81 dB compared to when there is no insertion of random value.

40|$|Current {{best-effort}} packet-switched Internet is not {{a perfect}} environment for real-time applications such as transmitting voice-over the network (Voice Over Internet Protocol or VOIP). Due to the unlimited concurrent access to the Internet by users, the packet loss problem cannot be avoided. Therefore, the VOIP based applications encompass problems such as "voice quality degradation caused by lost packets". The effects of lost packets are fundamental issues in real-time voice transmission over the current unreliable Internet. The dropped packets {{have a negative impact}} on voice quality and concealing their effects at the receiver does not deal with all of the drop consequences. It has been observed that in a very lossy network, the receiver cannot cope with all the effects of lost packets and thereby the voice will have poor quality. At this point the Active Networks, a relatively new concept in networking, which allows users to execute a program on the packets in active nodes, can help VOIP regenerate the lost packets, and improve the quality of the received voice. Therefore, VOIP needs special voice-packing methods. Based on the measured packet loss rates, many new methods are introduced that can pack voice packets in such a way that the lost packets can be regenerated both within the network and at the receiver. The proposed voice-packing methods could help regenerate lost packets in the active nodes within the network to improve the perceptual quality of the received sound. The packing methods include schemes for packing samples from low and medium compressed sample-based <b>codecs</b> (<b>PCM,</b> ADPCM) and also include schemes for packing samples from high compressed frame-based codecs (G. 729). Using these packing schemes, the received voice has good quality even under very high loss rates. Simulating a very lossy network using NS- 2 and testing the regenerated voice quality by an audience showed that significant voice quality improvement is achievable by employing these packing schemes.

40|$|Best effort" packet-switched networks, {{like the}} Internet, {{do not offer}} a {{reliable}} transmission of packets to applications with real-time constraints such as voice. Thus, the loss of packets impairs the application-level utility. For voice this utility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly {{the ability of the}} receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal play-out is interrupted. On the other hand, some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets. We first develop an end-to-end model based on loss run-lengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow. The packet-level metrics derived from the model are then linked to user-level objective speech quality metrics. Using this framework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based <b>codecs</b> (<b>PCM)</b> with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher negative perceptual impact. For high-compressing frame-based codecs (G. 729) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state. Contrary to samplebased codecs we show that the concealment performance may "break" at transitions within the speech signal however. We then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss. We designate these methods as "intra-flow" loss recovery and control. At the end-to-end level, identification of packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss concealment (receiver) takes place. Hop-by-hop support schemes then allow trading the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance. As both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission, a gain in perceived quality is obtainable. We show that significant speech quality improvements can be achieved while still maintaining a network service which is virtually identical to best effort in the long term...|$|R
40|$|Packet {{communication}} {{is considered one}} of the key technologies to transport various kinds of information over the networks because of its effective and flexible transporting capability. However, they have issues to be solved to apply to multimedia communications, especially real-time communications. The issues include how to measure/estimate transmission characteristics such as transmission delays (variations), losses, which are experienced in packet communications networks, implementation of high-speed protocol processing, and so on. The thesis consists of four study subjects aiming at realization of real-time packet communications. First, a scheme to estimate one-way delay variations is described. The one-way delay variations (OWDV), which is a key item for evaluating communications quality but is hard to be measured without external clock synchronization function. The new approach to estimate OWDV is proposed so that it is able to easily estimate OWDV anywhere in IP networks. Second, the study about a practical scheme that can estimate ADSL link rates is depicted. The proposed scheme allows us to estimate ADSL link rate measurements from the network operation center (NOC) using existing communications protocols and network node facilities. It is applied to estimate ADSL link rates in actual IP network, and shown that the down- and up-link rates can be obtained in a simple manner. Third, an experimental study of speech quality of conversational packetized voice communications is presented. There are many degradation factors such as transmission delays, packet losses to be considered. Since speech quality is affected by combination of plural factors, the experiment of speech quality of packetized voice communications was carried out under the condition of packet length, voice <b>codec</b> (<b>PCM</b> and ADM), and compensatory methods when packets are lost, in addition to transmission delays and packet losses. Fourth, protocol processing for high-speed packet switching systems is presented. Packet switching networks were required to process packet switching functions at higher speed for applying packet switching networks to multimedia communications. The communications protocol processing based on parallelism of transmission and receipt, layers 2 and 3 are proposed. Employing 1. 5 μm VLSI technology, the data rates are estimated one hundred times as much as the previous X. 25 data packet switching systems, which could process at most 64 kb/s. These research works contribute to improve real-time packet communications services and network facilities. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
