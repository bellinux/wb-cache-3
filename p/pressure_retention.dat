Design A prospective hospital based descriptive study. Setting A urology {{unit at the}} National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo. Patients Forty seven consecutive new {{patients with}} HPCR evaluated during a 2 -year period. Results Of the 47 (39 male) patients, 15 (32 %) were below 50 years of age. Nocturnal enuresis was encountered in 32 (68 %) patients, and a tense, non-tender distended bladder found in all 47 patients. Hypertension was recorded in 25. 5 % of the patients. Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis was detected on ultrasonography in nearly 80 % of the patients, and renal impairment was found in 20 (42. 5 %). The mean retained volume was 968 mL. Seven (15 %) patients developed post-obstructive diuresis. Eight women (mean age 47. 5 years, range 30 – 70 years) had HPCR. Four had no obvious cause. Six (75 %) had adult onset nocturnal enuresis. Renal impairment was found in four (50 %) patients. Post-obstructive diuresis was recorded in two women. Conclusions HPCR, a clinical entity known to affect the elderly in the West, was found to affect a relatively young patient group in Sri Lanka.

40|$|Ten {{nanofiltration}} flat-sheet membranes {{and eight}} tight ultrafiltration membranes with nominal MWCOs ranging from 0. 2 to 150 kDa were tested to concentrate anthocyanin extract from roselle. A pilot system was used, which featured a membrane cell with an effective area of 0. 0155 m 2. Permeate fluxes were recorded for transmembrane pressures between 0. 5 and 3. 0 MPa, while keeping all other operating conditions constant (volumetric reduction ratio 1, 35 °C). Retention values of total soluble solids, acidity and anthocyanins increased with transmembrane pressure. With similar permeate fluxes at average transmembrane <b>pressure,</b> <b>retention</b> of anthocyanins is significantly higher for nanofiltration membranes than for ultrafiltration membranes.

40|$|Flexible laminates, {{customized}} {{for specific}} performance parameters, {{are of interest}} to aerospace programs such as lighter-than-air vehicles, balloon systems, decelerator systems, flexible inflatable structures and pressure vessels. The material requirements for these applications include high strength-to-weight ratio and modulus, low gas permeability, <b>pressure</b> <b>retention</b> and the capability to survive in harsh atmospheric, marine and/or stratospheric environments for extended periods of time. Non-woven multidirectional oriented composite laminates using high performance engineering fibers are produced by Cubic Tech to meet these requirements. These flexible laminates achieve a significant weight savings over woven fabrics of similar strengths by eliminating strength and modulus loss and other structural deficiencies caused by crimping of yarns during the weaving process. The absence of crimp in non-woven fabrics results in a linear elastic response that allows for ease in predicting material properties and simplification of structural models. These flexible composites afford the ability to specify structural properties, oriented to meet any design requirement. Parts can be manufactured with complex 2 D and 3 D geometries with integrated structures, load patches and attachment points. Structures fabricated from these laminates can be joined using standard industry seaming techniques to produce seams stronger than the base laminates. Properly designed seams hold structural loads for extended periods without failure, slip or creep...|$|E

After modelling X 46 and X 52 grades of pipes, the Pb estimated was compared with those determined experimentally and with industry standard models—ASME B 31 G (modified), RSTRENG, DNV F 101, SHELL 92 and FITNET FFS. The comparison specified a Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) that ranged from 7. 06 % to 20. 4 % and a coefficient of determination (R 2) that varied from 0. 7932 to 0. 9813. Multivariate regression was also used to compute a general linear relationship between the burst pressure (Pb) and (d/t), (L/D) and (L/√Dt). The resulting FEM burst-pressure model, developed with multivariate regression, was later used to estimate the expected allowable operating pressure of a corroded X 46 grade pipeline over the lifecycle duration, for low, mild, high and severe corrosion categories. It was observed that the burst <b>pressure</b> <b>retention</b> ratio (Rr), which is an indicator of the reliability of the pipeline, decreased with the increase in (d) but did not show distinctive changes with the increase in (L).

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} (MD) is {{an emerging}} separation technology, mainly used for desalination [1]. The membrane used in membrane distillation should be hydrophobic with sufficiently small pore size to avoid wetting. The microporous structure and membrane thickness greatly affects flux and energy efficiency. In this contribution, a benchmark study is performed {{for more than}} 20 different (semi-) commercial hydrophobic membranes. The membranes were evaluated based on flux, energy efficiency, liquid entry <b>pressure,</b> <b>retention,</b> stability and costs. No membrane was available showing {{a combination of the}} optimal performance of all these parameters. Most important factor is the high cost of almost all membranes. One way to reduce the cost of the membranes is the hydrophobization of a cheap hydrophilic membrane with different hydrophobic coatings. Overall treatment of a hydrophilic membrane with a hydrophobic coating results in a single layer hydrophobic membrane structure, while the treatment of only one side of membrane results in a dual layer hydrophilic/hydrophobic membrane structure. The coated membranes have the same membrane morphology as the commercial hydrophilic membrane enabling a comparison between one layer and dual layer membranes. All membranes have a water contact angle above 110 ° and a liquid entry pressure above 2 bar, indicating excellent wetting resistance. DCMD-experiments are carried out in counter-current, with a flow velocity of 0. 13 m/s and feed and permeate temperature of 60 °C and 45 °C respectively. These experiments reveal an increase of flux and energy efficiency of the dual layer membranes compared to the single layer membranes for all combinations of coating materials and supports. For the best performing combination, the flux increases from 12 kg/m 2. h for a single layer membrane to 22 kg/m 2. h for a dual layer membrane, while energy efficiency increases from 34 % to 68 %. Moreover, the flux of the best performing dual layer membrane is 20 % higher compared to the benchmark, while energy efficiency is comparable. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCatastrophic dense {{granular}} flows, such as {{occur in}} rock avalanches, debris flows and pyroclastic flows, move as fully shearing mixtures that have approximately 60 vol. % solids {{and tend to}} segregate to form coarse-grained fronts and leveed channels. Levees restrict spreading of unconfined flows and form as coarse particles that become concentrated {{in the top of}} the flow are transported to the front and then advect to the sides in the flow head. Channels from which most material has drained away down slope are commonly lined with fine-grained deposit, widely thought to remain from the tail of the waning flow. We show how segregation in experimental dense flows of carborundum or sand (300 – 425 μm) mixed with spherical fine ballotini (150 – 250 μm), on rough slopes of 27 – 29 °, produces fine-grained channel linings that are deposited with the levees, into which they grade laterally. Maximum runout distance is attained with mixtures containing 30 – 40 % sand, just sufficient to segregate and form levees that are adequately robust to restrict the spreading attributable to the low-friction fines. Resin impregnation and serial sectioning of deliberately arrested experimental flows shows how fines-lined levees form from the flow head; the flows create their own stable ‘conduit’ entirely from the front, which in a geophysical context can play an important mechanistic role in facilitating runout. The flow self-organization ensures that low-friction fines at the base of the segregated channel flow shear over fine-grained substrate in the channel, thus reducing frictional energy losses. We propose that in pyroclastic flows and debris flows, which have considerable mobility attributable to pore-fluid pressures, such fine-grained flow-contact zones form similarly and not only reduce frictional energy losses but also reduce flow–substrate permeability so as to enhance pore-fluid <b>pressure</b> <b>retention.</b> Thus the granular flow self-organization that produces fine-grained channel linings can be an important factor in facilitating long runout of catastrophic geophysical flows on the low slopes (few degrees) of depositional fans and aprons around mountains and volcanoes...|$|E
