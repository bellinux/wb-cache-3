40|$|Research {{has shown}} that <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> {{residents}} have the worst health of any population in the USA. However, {{it is unclear what}} the cause of that poor health is among this population. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the association between <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> and health conditions: specifically, we ask if residents entered <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> already ill or if <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> may cause the poor health of its residents. The data used for this study come from the GSU Urban Health Initiative, which is a prospective, mixed-methods study of seven <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> communities earmarked for demolition and relocation (N[*]=[*] 385). We used the pre-relocation, baseline survey. We found that, while health was not the main reason residents gave for entering <b>public</b> <b>housing,</b> the majority of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> residents entered <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> already ill. Substandard housing conditions, long tenure in <b>public</b> <b>housing,</b> and having had a worse living situation prior to <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> were not associated with an increased risk of a health condition diagnosed after entry into <b>public</b> <b>housing.</b> Our findings suggest that <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> may have provided a safety net for the very unhealthy poor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> subsidies on employment outcomes using the 1999 - 2005 <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> administrative data from Western Australia. The existing <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> literature presents two opposing arguments on the impacts of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> on employment. <b>Public</b> <b>housing</b> can {{have a positive impact}} by providing security of tenure. On the other hand, neighbourhood and stigma effects and the withdrawal of housing subsidies as income increases can depress work effort. It is often difficult to accurately measure the impact of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> on employment because <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> is correlated with unobservable factors that may discourage employment. This study addresses this issue by using a quasi-experimental approach in which individuals who entered <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> within the timeframe form a treatment group that can be compared to a control group consisting of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> applicants who did not enter <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> within the timeframe. We find that transition into <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> has a positive net impact on employment outcomes, and the impact is twice as high for males as it is for females. We attempt to unbundle this positive impact into a welfare trap effect and a housing stability effect. Where a welfare trap exists, individuals depress their labour supply while on the <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> wait list in order to maintain eligibility for <b>public</b> <b>housing.</b> A housing stability effect improves the employment outcomes of individuals once they hav...|$|R

40|$|Despite popular {{accounts}} that link <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> demolitions to spatial redistribution of crime, and possible increases in crime, little systematic research has analyzed the neighborhood or city-wide impact of demolitions on crime.

Despite this shift, there is relatively little evidence on the impact of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> or housing vouchers on educational outcomes. This paper utilizes a plausibly exogenous source of variation in housing assistance generated by <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> demolitions in Chicago to examine the impact of high-rise <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> on student outcomes. I find that children in households affected by the demolitions do no better or worse than their peers {{on a wide variety of}} achievement measures. Because the majority of households that leave <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> in response to the demolitions move to neighborhoods and schools that closely resemble those they left, the zero effect of the demolitions may be interpreted as the independent impact of <b>public</b> <b>housing.</b> These findings suggest that eliminating high-rise <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> will not necessarily lead to the benefits documented in housing mobility experiments such as Gautreaux or Moving to Opportunity...|$|R
