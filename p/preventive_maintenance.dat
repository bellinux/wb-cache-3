It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E

25|$|Until the B.E.S.T. {{company was}} taken over by the municipality, only the Colaba depot was {{available}} for the maintenance of buses and minor repairs. As the fleet grew, the need for more depots was felt. In 1961 the fleet comprised 1045 buses. Six new depots were constructed for their maintenance. The Wadala depot was equipped for the maintenance of 300 buses. At this time it was the largest depot in Asia. After this, taking long maintenance experience into account, the authorities decided that no depot should be called on to look after more than 125 to 150 buses. Accordingly, small depots were built at convenient spots in the city and its suburbs. Every depot is another work center, which provides bus services effectively on every day, carries out <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> as well as repairs on buses. Depots carry out maintenance practices such as <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance,</b> unit replacement, RTO passing, body damage repairs of buses. BEST buses are operated out of the 26 bus depot located in four zones viz. City, Central, Western, Eastern & Suburban zones.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{stochastic}} {{point processes}} {{to model the}} reliability of repairable systems has been a regular approach to establish survival measures in failure versus repair scenarios. However, the traditional processes do not consider the actual state in which an item returns to operational condition. The traditional renewal process considers an "as-good-as-new" philosophy, while a non-homogeneous Poisson process {{is based on the}} minimal repair concept. In this work, an approach based on the concept of Generalized Renewal Process (GRP) is presented, which is a generalization of the renewal process and the non-homogeneous Poisson process. A stochastic modeling is presented for systems availability analysis, including testing and/or <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenances</b> scheduling. To validate the proposed approach, it was performed a case study of a hypothetical auxiliary feed-water system of a nuclear power plant, using genetic algorithm as optimization tool...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{societies}} are risk societies. Together with the formidable development of complex technologies (chemical industry, energy production, mass transportation, etc), new hazards have emerged. Sharing danger is {{the hallmark of}} modernity, as large industrial accidents can now have countrywide, or even, worldwide consequences. The Chernobyl explosion for example, has smeared large European surfaces with radioactive materials, across borders and nations, without any regard for who was responsible and who was the victim. Complex technologies should therefore be managed with great foresightness, particularly focusing on preventive management. A sound understanding of the (minor) role of human errors of operators and the (major) role of process design is a pre-requisite for appropriate management. This also applies to the complex business of radiotherapy, as the same organisational principles apply than in the heavy industry: restrict the role of operators, expect their mistakes, design in a mistake-proof way, accept the burden of <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenances,</b> supervise maintenance carefully and, above all, invest in safety...|$|R

Os dados foram analisados pelos testes qui-quadrado e t Student, e os valores de p OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the occurrence and causes of unplanned interruption of radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study {{developed in the}} Division of Radiotherapy of Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz in São Paulo, SP, Brazil, with data collected from 560 dossiers of patients submitted to radiotherapy in the period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2005. Chi-squared and Student t tests were utilized in the data analysis, and p < 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Interruption of treatment was identified in 350 cases, corresponding to 62. 5 % of the patients. The reasons for treatment interruption were the following: <b>preventive</b> device <b>maintenance</b> (55 %), patient's own private reasons (13 %), adverse reactions to the treatment or to combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy (6 %), clinical worsening (3 %), two or more combined reasons (23 %). The interruption time interval ranged between 1 and 24 days (mean 1. 4 day). One-day interruption was mostly due to <b>preventive</b> device <b>maintenance</b> (84. 4 %); two-five-day interruption was due to combined reasons (48. 28 %). CONCLUSION: The most frequent cause of interruption was <b>preventive</b> device <b>maintenance,</b> with maximum two-day time interval...|$|R

25|$|Virtually all roads {{require some}} form of {{maintenance}} before {{they come to the}} end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture.

25|$|GS-X (1999) – Incorporated {{a setting}} table and ball {{accelerator}} redesign that reduced {{the amount of}} parts, the number of adjustments, {{and the amount of}} <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative maintenance required.|$|E

25|$|Capacitors may catastrophically fail when {{subjected}} to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life. Dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid, resulting in case bulging, rupture, {{or even an}} explosion. Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially {{in the center of}} the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation. Proper containment, fusing, and <b>preventive</b> <b>maintenance</b> can help to minimize these hazards.|$|E

In this context, different methods (maximum likelihood, moment estimation, and expectation-maximization algorithm) are considered in order to estimate jointly the PM efficiency parameter p and the parameters of the first time to failure distribution corresponding to the new unmaintained system. A method to individually assess the effect of each PM is also proposed.
