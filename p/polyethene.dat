25|$|The name {{polyethylene}} {{comes from}} the ingredient and not the resulting chemical compound, which contains no double bonds. The scientific name <b>polyethene</b> is systematically derived from the scientific name of the monomer.

In certain circumstances {{it is useful to}} use a structure-based nomenclature; in such cases IUPAC recommends poly(methylene) (poly(methanediyl) is a non-preferred alternative). The difference in names between the two systems is due to the opening up of the monomer's double bond upon polymerization. The name is abbreviated to PE. In a similar manner polypropylene and polystyrene are shortened to PP and PS, respectively. In the United Kingdom the polymer is commonly called polythene, from the ICI trade name, although this is not recognized scientifically.|$|E

The bulk amount of PFW was taken onto the <b>polyethene</b> paper and covered with the <b>polyethene</b> which kept the PFW separated from the soil.

The pit was opened at every 10  days interval of time to see the status of PFW decomposition and to control the temperature of feather pile buried into the soil. After 3  months, finally, the pit was opened and the decomposed material was brought out from the pit and was sun dried for 7  days to get final TPFW which was brown in color.

40|$|Hypothesis The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of slip agents, erucamide, and behenamide, {{on the surface of}} high-density <b>polyethene,</b> is determined by integral characteristics of slip agent structure and polymer morphology. A suite of surface analysis techniques was applied to correlate physicochemical properties with slip-additive migration behaviour and their surface morphology. The migration, surface morphology and physicochemical properties of the slip additives, crystallinity and orientation of <b>polyethene</b> spherulites and interaction between slip additives and high-density <b>polyethene</b> influence the surface characteristics. Experimental The high-density <b>polyethene</b> closures were produced with erucamide and behenamide separately and stored until they produced required torque. Surface composition was determined employing spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The distribution of additives was observed under optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. The surface energy, crystallinity and application torque were measured using contact angle, differential scanning calorimeter and a torque force tester respectively. Results and discussion Each slip additive produced a characteristic amide peak at 1645 cm - 1 in infrared spectroscopy and peaks of oxygen and nitrogen in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, suggesting their presence on the surface. The erucamide produced placoid scale-like structures and behenamide formed denticulate structures.

40|$|Long-chain {{branches}} and narrow {{molecular weight distribution}} is a novel structure combination in <b>polyethene,</b> which has only been possible to achieve with single-center catalysis. Long-chain branches, even at very low concentrations, have a strong effect on the polymer melt behavior and, thereby, the processing properties. This work deals with ethene polymerization using group IV metallocene catalysts and the examination of long-chain branching in <b>polyethene.</b> Long-chain branching in metallocene catalysis is believed to take place via a copolymerization route, in which a vinyl terminated <b>polyethene</b> chain is incorporated into a growing polymer chain. Understanding the chain transfer mechanisms (vinyl end-group formation) and copolymerization abilities of metallocene catalysts have been important issues in this work. The examination of the polymerization behavior of several metallocene compounds revealed that chain transfer mechanisms were catalyst specific. Depending on the catalyst structure, the termination of chain growth occurred via β-H elimination, chain transfer to the monomer, or chain transfer to the cocatalyst. The vinyl selectivities were between 20 and 100 %. Comonomer response in ethene and 1 -olefin copolymerization also depended on the catalyst structure. 10 -fold differences in comonomer reactivity ratios were observed. Long-chain branching analysis of homopolyethenes produced with different metallocene catalysts indicated that the catalysts with high vinyl selectivity and good copolymerization ability were the most prominent in producing a polymer with modified rheological properties. In addition to rheological measurements, 13 C NMR spectroscopy also showed the presence of long-chain branches. Besides the choice of catalyst, the polymerization conditions had {{a major impact on}} long-chain branch contents. Adjusting the ethene, hydrogen, or comonomer (1 -olefin or nonconjugated α,ω-diene) concentration changed the rheological properties of the polymers. reviewe...|$|E

The introduction of metal ions depended on the degree of grafting of 4 -vinylpyridine and it was found to be from 0. 03 to 14. 96 and from 0. 11 to 34. 48 mg metal ions per g of polymer carrier for polytetrafluoroethene and <b>polyethene,</b> respectively. The influence of the metal ion nature on the electrochemical characteristics of nitrogen-containing copolymers was studied. The specific electric resistance of the polymer metal complexes was found to depend on the nature of the metal ion and its content in the complex. The metal complexes obtained had lower electric resistance than the initial copolymers. This can be explained with the fact that the chelate agents (salts of metals with variable valence) have free ions and electron mobility which improve the electric conductivity of the materials obtained and have a good prospect in many fields as functional polymer. The tensile characteristics of the polymer complexes of heavy metals were also affected by the nature and contents of the ions introduced...|$|E
