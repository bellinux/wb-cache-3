5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began {{refining}} iron from {{pig iron}} to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others, including Joseph Hall.|$|E
5|$|Puddling process: The <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> {{was known}} the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The {{improvement}} of steelmaking processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated forging, folding, and stacking of wrought iron from pig iron to make swords.|$|E
5|$|In 1827 {{a rolling}} mill capable of 100 tons of bar iron per week was {{installed}} at the Walker Ironworks; in the same year, Losh, Wilson and Bell's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White's gazetteer of Durham and Northumberland as a steam engine manufacturer. In 1833, the iron <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> was installed at Walker. In 1835, while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway, Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont, and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby. In that year, {{at the age of}} nineteen, Thomas Bell's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm's Newcastle office under his father. In 1836 he joined his father at the firm's ironworks at Walker.|$|E
50|$|Shingling was a {{stage in}} the {{production}} of bar iron or steel, in the finery and <b>puddling</b> <b>processes.</b> As with many ironmaking terms, this is derived from the French - cinglage.|$|R
50|$|From {{the medieval}} period, {{the process of}} direct {{reduction}} in bloomeries began {{to be replaced by}} an indirect process. In this, a blast furnace was used to make pig iron, which then had to undergo a further process to make forgeable bar iron. Processes for the second stage include fining in a finery forge and, from the Industrial Revolution, <b>puddling.</b> However both <b>processes</b> are now obsolete, and wrought iron is now hardly made. Instead, mild steel is produced from a bessemer converter or by other means including smelting reduction processes such as the Corex Process.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Puddling</b> is the <b>process</b> of {{stirring}} {{pig iron}} with iron bars, exposing {{it to the}} air so that the carbon in the pig iron is oxidized and burns off. [...] This process creates steel. As practiced in the early and mid-19th century, puddling required great strength as well as skill. Because chemical testing of the molten iron {{had not yet been}} developed, puddlers relied on their long experience with steelmaking to determine whether {{too much or too little}} carbon had been oxidized. Puddling was also an extremely dangerous trade, as some steel processes required the molten metal to boil and bubble as the puddler stirred in scrap iron and puddlers were required to physically remove slag and drain pure steel out of furnaces for additional processing.|$|R
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Hall {{discovered}} that the addition of iron oxide {{to the charge of}} the puddling furnace caused a violent reaction, in which the pig iron was decarburised, this became known as 'wet puddling'. It was also found possible to produce steel by stopping the <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> before decarburisation was complete.|$|E
500|$|Although Chinese civilization {{lacked the}} bloomery, the Han Chinese {{were able to}} make wrought iron when they {{injected}} too much oxygen into the cupola furnace, causing decarburization. The Han-era Chinese were also able to convert cast iron and pig iron into wrought iron and steel by using the finery forge and <b>puddling</b> <b>process,</b> the earliest specimens of such dating to the 2nd century BCE and found at Tieshengguo near Mount Song of Henan province. The semisubterranean walls of these furnaces were lined with refractory bricks and had bottoms made of refractory clay. Besides charcoal made of wood, Wang Zhongshu states that another furnace fuel used during the Han were [...] "coal cakes", a mixture of coal powder, clay, and quartz.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of urea in wetland rice cultivation {{is known to}} be increased by placement below the soil surface. The penetration of broadcast urea into puddled soil might be a way to achieve placement of urea in soil. This paper combines an analysis of the free fall of urea granules in the atmosphere and a layer of water on the soil surface with measurements of granule penetration into <b>puddled</b> soils. The <b>process</b> of free fall can be described in terms of the height of fall in air, the depth of the water layer, and the terminal velocities and characteristic distances for free fall in air and water. The penetration depth of a particular granule with a particular velocity at the water/soil interface depends on the type of soil and its physical condition. Granule mass ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 5 g, granule velocity from 1 to 10 m s- 1, depth of the water layer from 0 to 30 mm and penetration depth from 0 to 35 mm. There is some indication that the penetration depth is proportional to the square root of the kinetic energy at the water/soil interface...|$|R
40|$|Source-level {{sampling}} methods were adopted {{in this study}} to sample six iron and steel plants referring four main manufacturing processes, with over 150 samples collected and measured in this study, the latest data for {{iron and steel industry}} in China has been demonstrated. The emission factors of CO 2, CO, SO 2, NOx, TSP, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 were calculated, and the majority of pollutants were emitted from the sintering process. The virtual impactor divided the PM sample into three size fractions for chemical profiles and the profiles indicate that SO 24 -, NH 4 + and OC distribute more into fine particles. The elements in PM from the sintering, pelletizing, <b>puddling</b> and steelmaking <b>processes</b> were measured and compared using the coefficient of divergence. The divergence between PM 2. 5 and PM 10 for the same process is not obvious, with CD values ranging from 0. 1697 to 0. 2578. PM 2. 5 profiles of four process were notably different from one another, with CD values ranging from 0. 4802 to 0. 7500. More efforts are needed to update the PM profiles in China. PAHs in PM were investigated, and most of the PAHs in PM are from the sintering process. The total PAH concentration in PM 2. 5 from the sintering process is 73. 28 +/- 1. 45 mu g/m(3) with a BaPE value calculated at 9. 92 mu g/m(3). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Paddy is {{commonly}} grown under flooded or submerged {{condition in which}} substantial amount of water is lost by different <b>processes.</b> <b>Puddling</b> is traditionally done to reduce water loss from lowland rice fields. Since the very step of puddling, rice root zone undergoes structural changes leading {{to the formation of}} a layered profile having a hydraulically less-conductive plow sole below the root zone. However, studies have shown that soil cracking and the presence of preferential flow paths in puddle fields defeat this purpose. Description of soil water regime in such a dynamic soil requires an in situ measurement method for soil hydraulic properties. A field experiment was conducted in twelve 30 m 2 plots during the rainy seasons (June to October) of 2004 and 2005 to evaluate a suitable method for estimating soil hydraulic properties of lowland paddy soil. Results showed that piezometric (pressure) heads installed in different soil layers responded to the drying and wetting cycles typically followed in transplanted rice and are observed as a part of monsoon climate in eastern India. The Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm built in the HYDRUS- 1 D simulation environment was used to inversely estimate soil hydraulic parameters. Estimated parameters revealed larger hydraulic conductivity for the compacted plow sole than those published in literature, which may have resulted from alternate wetting and drying typically observed under monsoon climate and earthworm burrows observed in our experimental field. Results from simulation studies suggest that both the single- and dual-porosity models could simulate water flow considerably well in lowland paddy field although the latter described pressure head time series data slightly better in about 50 % of simulations. Similar performance of the single- vs. dual-porosity model may have resulted from estimating a seasonally mean soil hydraulic properties which include the effect of both preferential flow and matrix flow as the specific soil and boundary conditions prevailed. While water may have preferentially transported through the macropores during the wetting cycles in a near-saturated soil, it would have dominantly moved through soil matrix during the drying cycles. This study shows that simple piezometers may be combined with a simulation model to estimate hydraulic properties of different soil layers in a lowland paddy field.

500|$|There {{were great}} {{innovations}} in metallurgy. In addition to Zhou-dynasty China's (c. 1050 BCE– 256 BCE) previous inventions {{of the blast}} furnace and cupola furnace to make [...] pig iron and cast iron, respectively, the Han period saw the development of steel and wrought iron by use of the finery forge and <b>puddling</b> <b>process.</b> With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine {{up to the surface}} to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted pipeline transport systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel-powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron seed drill were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical chain pump powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating trip hammers in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere around the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The Bessemer {{and open}} hearth {{processes}} {{were much more}} efficient than making steel by the <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> because they used the carbon in the pig iron {{as a source of}} heat. [...] The Bessemer (patented in 1855) and the Siemens-Martin (c. 1865) processes greatly reduced the cost of steel. By the end of the 19th century, Gilchirst-Thomas “basic” process had reduced production costs by 90% compared to the <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> of the mid-century.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was only}} after this that {{economically}} viable means of converting pig iron to bar iron began to be devised. [...] A process known as potting and stamping was devised in the 1760s and improved in the 1770s, and {{seems to have been}} widely adopted in the West Midlands from about 1785. However, this was largely replaced by Henry Cort's <b>puddling</b> <b>process,</b> patented in 1784, but probably only made to work with grey pig iron in about 1790. These processes permitted the great expansion in the production of iron that constitutes the Industrial Revolution for the iron industry.|$|E
2500|$|Iron making – the {{substitution}} of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production. [...] Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces, resulting in economies of scale. [...] The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760. [...] It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures. [...] The <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> produced a structural grade iron {{at a lower cost}} than the finery forge. [...] The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. Hot blast (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.|$|E
2500|$|Wrought iron for smiths {{to forge}} into {{consumer}} goods was still made in finery forges, as it long had been. However, new processes were {{adopted in the}} ensuing years. The first is referred to today as potting and stamping, but this was superseded by Henry Cort's <b>puddling</b> <b>process.</b> Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: rolling in 1783 and puddling in 1784. [...] Rolling replaced hammering for consolidating wrought iron and expelling some of the dross. [...] Rolling was 15 times faster than hammering with a trip hammer. Roller mills were first used for making sheets, but later were developed for rolling structural shapes such as angles and rails.|$|E
2500|$|Puddling {{produced}} a structural grade iron {{at a relatively}} low cost. Puddling was a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation as the iron was manually stirred using a long rod. [...] The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler. [...] When the glob was large enough the puddler would remove it. [...] Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work. [...] Few puddlers lived to be 40. [...] Puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, allowing coal or coke {{to be used as}} fuel. [...] The <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel. [...] Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised.|$|E
2500|$|Cast iron used in rails proved {{unsatisfactory}} {{because it}} was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The wrought iron invented by John Birkinshaw in 1820 replaced cast iron. Wrought iron (usually simply referred to as [...] "iron") was a ductile material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But iron was expensive to produce until Henry Cort patented the <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the rolling process, which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering. These processes greatly lowered the cost of producing iron and rails. The next important development in iron production was hot blast developed by James Beaumont Neilson (patented 1828), which considerably reduced the amount of coke (fuel) or charcoal needed to produce pig iron. Wrought iron was a soft material that contained included slag or dross. The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments {{in the production of}} iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.|$|E

For comparison, an average size charge for a puddling furnace was 800 - 900 lb while a Bessemer converter charge was 15 short tons (13,600 kg). The <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> could not be scaled up, being limited by the amount that the puddler could handle. It could only be expanded by building more furnaces.|$|E

5000|$|Puddled iron—the <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} process to produce wrought iron. In the <b>puddling</b> <b>process,</b> pig iron is refined in a reverberatory furnace to prevent harmful sulphur from the coal or coke from contaminating the iron. The molten pig iron is manually stirred and iron ore, an oxygen source, is added, which decarburizes the iron. As the iron is stirred, globs of wrought iron are collected into balls by the stirring rod (rabble arm or rod) and those are periodically removed by the puddler. Puddling was patented in 1784 and became widely used after 1800. By 1876, annual production of puddled iron in the UK alone was over 4 million tons. Around that time, the open hearth furnace was able to produce steel of suitable quality for structural purposes, and wrought iron production went into decline.|$|E

5000|$|In 1786, {{following}} the death of Anthony Bacon, he took over the whole Cyfarthfa Ironworks, in partnership with William Stevens (a London merchant) and James Cockshutt, who had previously managed the forge and boring mill for David Tanner. In May 1787 he took out a licence from Henry Cort for his <b>puddling</b> <b>process,</b> but the rolling mill needed was not completed until 1789. He solved the problems of the <b>puddling</b> <b>process</b> by using an iron plate for the furnace ceiling and sea-washed sand for the floor. In 1791 he terminated the partnership, which had made little profit. He continued the business alone, and had two blast furnaces, 8 puddling furnaces, 3 melting fineries, 3 balling furnaces, and a rolling mill in 1794. A blast furnace was built by 1796, and a fourth in 1796. [...] There were 6 by 1810. [...] He thus developed Cyfarthfa {{into one of the most}} important ironworks in South Wales.|$|E

50|$|Joseph Hall 1789 - 1862, the {{inventor}} of 'Wet Puddling', was born in 1789 and apprenticed in 1806 as a puddler to use Henry Cort's <b>puddling</b> <b>process.</b> He tried adding old iron {{to the charge of}} the puddling furnace and later puddler's bosh cinder (iron scale, that is rust) to the charge. This caused the charge (to his surprise) to boil violently. When this subsided he gathered the iron into a puddle ball in the usual way, and this proved to be good iron.|$|E
50|$|A finery forge is a hearth used to fine (i.e., produce, refine) wrought iron, {{through the}} {{decarburization}} of the pig iron.
