25|$|Other {{critics of}} the Mudawana point out that {{irrespective}} {{of the value of}} the reforms themselves, the process by which they were achieved is flawed, creates difficulties for their implementation, and can even be considered counter-productive to the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>democratization.</b> It can be argued that while the reforms do represent a significant transformation of women’s rights, they also serve to solidify and expand the authority of the monarch as the defender or insurer of those rights. In the end, the civil society associations that lobbied for the reforms had to work within the existing authoritarian system, appealing directly to the king for change rather than working through a democratic political process. Ultimately, the credit for the reforms' successful enactment has been given to the monarchy. Finally, some characterize the high degree of debate and deliberation over the issue as a dividing influence in the end; a representative from one Moroccan women’s organization described the women’s movement in Morocco not as a movement, but an uncoordinated group of different organizations.|$|E

Thus, to adopt them as public policy is vital to democracy and to the Rule of Law. Although it is a new area of knowledge, its field of action has been facilitating important experiences. In the State of Pernambuco, the insertion of HRE in the public school system was a process that started its systematic development as of 2007. This paper aims to analyze whether the practices of HRE in formal schooling are articulated and if they encourage <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> in the schools of Pernambuco. It was possible, based on the data provided by this study, to assume that the adopted actions and methodologies of HRE motivate participation, autonomy and the establishment of horizontal relations in the collective construction of knowledge. Therefore, they contribute in some of the transformations that are happening in the space of school, that tend to propitiate better conditions so that <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> may pervade this atmosphere. ...|$|R
