40|$|An optimally {{cross-linked}} peptidoglycan requires both transglycosylation and transpeptidation, {{provided by}} class A and class B penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Streptococcus gordonii possesses three class A PBPs (PBPs 1 A, 1 B, and 2 A) and two class B PBPs (PBPs 2 B and 2 X) {{that are important}} for penicillin resistance. High-level resistance (MIC, > or = 2 microg/ml) requires mutations in class B PBPs. However, although unmutated, class A PBPs are critical to facilitate resistance development (M. Haenni and P. Moreillon, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 50 : 4053 - 4061, 2006). Thus, their overexpression might be important to sustain the drug. Here, we determined the promoter regions of the S. gordonii PBPs and compared them {{to those of other}} streptococci. The extended - 10 box was highly conserved and complied with a sigma(A) -type promoter consensus sequence. In contrast, the - 35 box was poorly conserved, leaving the possibility of differential PBP regulation. Gene expression in a penicillin-susceptible <b>parent</b> (<b>MIC,</b> 0. 008 microg/ml) and a high-level-resistant mutant (MIC, 2 microg/ml) was monitored using luciferase fusions. In the absence of penicillin, all PBPs were constitutively expressed, but their expression was globally increased (1. 5 to 2 times) in the resistant mutant. In the presence of penicillin, class A PBPs were specifically overexpressed both in the parent (PBP 2 A) and in the resistant mutant (PBPs 1 A and 2 A). By increasing transglycosylation, class A PBPs could promote peptidoglycan stability when transpeptidase is inhibited by penicillin. Since penicillin-related induction of class A PBPs occurred in both susceptible and resistant cells, such a mutation-independent facilitating mechanism could be operative at each step of resistance development...|$|E

After 20 daily subcultures, razupenem yielded only clones with MICs of > 4 μg/ml in one strain (8 μg/ml) whose <b>parent's</b> <b>MIC</b> was already 4 μg/ml. After 18 to 49 passages in 6 / 10 strains, razupenem MICs rose from 0. 016 to 2 μg/ml (parents) to 0. 125 to 8 μg/ml (with clones stable after 10 drug-free subcultures). Single-step mutant selection frequencies were similarly low for razupenem and comparators...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} {{clinical}} trials of teicoplanin therapy of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, {{at least one}} instance {{of the emergence of}} teicoplanin-resistant strains during therapy has been reported (G. W. Kaatz, S. M. Seo, N. J. Dorman, and S. A. Lerner, J. Infect. Dis 162 : 103 - 108, 1990). We have confirmed, using conventional electrophoresis of EcoRI-digested chromosomal DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA, that the resistant strain (12873) (MIC, 16 p,g/ml) is genetically very similar to the susceptible <b>parent</b> (12871) (<b>MIC,</b> 4,ug/ml). Kaatz et al. were able to select spontaneous teicoplanin-resistant mutants (10 - 9), suggesting that a single gene might be involved. We have shown that the mutation is highly stable during growth in the absence of teicoplanin. Using TnSS 5, we have selected insertion mutants of 12873 that become teicoplanin susceptible. We have examined a number of aspects of cell wall physiology i...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{analysis}} {{of a series of}} five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (Plc) sequence identified a l 2 -amino acid fragment from the C-terminus of Plc, designated Plc- 2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the <b>parent</b> compound. <b>MIC</b> tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that Plc- 2 has potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but not against Enterococcus faecalis. The antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus niger and Alternaria sp., also identified Plc- 2 as a biologically active peptide. Microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with Plc- 2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. Together, these results identify Plc- 2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. In addition, it demonstrated that the KHVGKAALTHYL residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin...|$|R
40|$|All {{clinical}} {{strains of}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) examined so far contain the mec gene and its product, the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 A. Yet the same strains show tremendous {{variation in the}} phenotypic expression of antibiotic resistance (MIC), which is {{under the control of}} a set of additional, auxiliary genes. Thus, the quantitative contribution of the mec gene to the resistance phenotype of MRSA is not known, and no mutants with the lesion located within the mec gene have been described. We subjected a highly resistant MRSA strain to transposon mutagenesis with the erythromycin resistance transposon Tn 551, and a mutant expressing greatly decreased methicillin resistance (RUSA 4) was selected to characterize the transposon insertion site. The results indicate that the Tn 551 insertion site in mutant RUSA 4 is between base pairs 1000 and 1400 of the sequence encoding PBP 2 A. Thus, the uniform and greater than 200 -fold drop in the methicillin MIC (4 micrograms/ml) for this mutant relative to that for the <b>parent</b> strain (<b>MIC</b> {{greater than or equal to}} 800 micrograms/ml) must be related to the inactivation of the PBP 2 A gene. The results provide the first unequivocal evidence for the importance of PBP 2 A as a quantitative contributor to the MIC for MRSA...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To gain {{further insight}} into the defence {{mechanisms}} against triclosan in a mutant derived from an Escherichia coli strain carrying the triclosan-resistant target enzyme, FabI(G 93 V). Methods: An E. coli imp 4231 FabI(G 93 V) strain was constructed by replacing intact fabI with a linear DNA cas-sette, fabI(G 93 V) -CmR, that contains a single mutation, GGT to GTT, at codon 93 of fabI(G 93 V) and a chloram-phenicol resistance gene (CmR) as a marker for the mutant allele by a Red-mediated recombination system. Using this E. coli imp 4231 FabI(G 93 V) strain, nitrosoguanidine (NTG) mutagenesis was performed to generate E. coli IFNs [imp 4231 FabI(G 93 V) treated with NTG] displaying higher MICs of triclosan than its parent strain. The genes overexpressed in E. coli IFN 4 were identified by DNA microarray analysis. Results: An E. coli imp 4231 FabI(G 93 V) strain displays 400 -fold increased MICs of triclosan (MIC 8 mg/L) compared with the <b>parent</b> strain (<b>MIC</b> 0. 02 mg/L). Furthermore, E. coli IFN 4 has the highest MIC of triclosan (MIC 80 mg/L). DNA microarray analysis of E. coli IFN 4 shows that many genes involved in the biosynthesis of membrane proteins, including transporters, reductases/dehydrogenases and stress response regulators, were highly expressed in the mutant. Conclusions: These results strongly indicate that E. coli IFN cells might protect themselves from triclosan by activating various defence mechanisms, such as (i) changing efflux activities; (ii) capturing the triclosan; and (iii) increasing the expression of important regulators or metabolic enzymes...|$|R
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{activity of}} daptomycin was {{compared with that}} of vancomycin in a rat model of subcutaneously implanted tissue cages chronically infected with strain Rev 1, a spontaneous methicillin-susceptible revertant of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain MRGR 3, showing equivalent virulence to its <b>parent.</b> The <b>MIC</b> and MBC of daptomycin (in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 50 mg/L Ca 2 +) or vancomycin for strain Rev 1 were 1 - 2 and 2 - 4 or 1 and 2 mg/L, respectively. In vitro elimination of strain Rev 1 in the presence of 50 % tissue cage fluid was more rapid with daptomycin 4 mg/L compared with vancomycin. After 2 weeks of infection, viable counts of strain Rev 1 averaged 6. 49 log 10 cfu/mL of tissue cage fluid (n = 87). Intraperitoneal administration of daptomycin 30 mg/kg once daily, or vancomycin 50 mg/kg twice daily, produced antibiotic levels continuously above MBC. After 7 days of therapy with daptomycin or vancomycin, mean +/- S. E. M. counts of Rev 1 decreased (P < 0. 05) by 1. 11 +/- 0. 25 (n = 28) or 0. 80 +/- 0. 31 (n = 35) log 10 cfu/mL, respectively, compared with cages of untreated animals, but were not significantly different from each other. In daptomycin-treated rats, three cages yielded subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. In conclusion, a low dose regimen of daptomycin was at least equivalent to vancomycin against chronic foreign body infections due to S. aureus. Drug dosage should be adapted to obtain inflammatory fluid levels of daptomycin minimizing emergence of resistant subpopulations...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms of {{resistance}} to pefloxacin were investigated in four isogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains: S (<b>parent</b> isolate; <b>MIC,</b> 2 micrograms/ml), PT 1 and PT 2 (posttherapy isolates obtained in animals; MICs, 32 and 128 micrograms/ml, respectively), and PT 2 -r (posttherapy isolate obtained after six in vitro subpassages of PT 2; MIC, 32 micrograms/ml). [2 - 3 H]adenine incorporation (indirect evidence of DNA gyrase activity) in EDTA-permeabilized cells was less affected by pefloxacin in PT 2 and PT 2 -r (50 % inhibitory concentration, 0. 27 and 0. 26 microgram/ml, respectively) {{than it was in}} S and PT 1 (50 % inhibitory concentration, 0. 04 and 0. 05 microgram/ml, respectively). Reduced [14 C]pefloxacin labeling of intact cells in strains PT 1 and PT 2 correlated with more susceptibility to EDTA and the presence of more calcium (P less than 0. 05) and phosphorus in the outer membrane fractions. Outer membrane protein analysis showed reduced expression of protein D 2 (47 kDa) in strains PT 1 and PT 2. Other proteins were apparently similar in all strains. The addition of calcium chloride (2 mM) to the sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized samples of outer membrane proteins, before heating and Western blotting, probed with monoclonal antibody anti-OmpF showed electrophoretic mobility changes of OmpF in strains PT 1 and PT 2 which were not seen in strain S. Calcium-induced changes were reversed with ethyleneglycoltetraacetate. Decreased [14 C]pefloxacin labeling was further correlated with an altered lipopolysaccharide pattern and increased 3 -deoxy-D-mannooctulosonic acid concentration (P less than 0. 01). These findings suggested that resistance to pefloxacin is associated with altered DNA gyrase in strain PT 2 -r, with altered permeability in PT 1, and with both mechanisms in PT 2. The decreased expression of protein D 2 and the higher calcium and lipopolysaccharide contents of the outer membrane could be responsible for the permeability deficiency in P. aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} trimethoprim is antagonized by thymidine in in vitro susceptibility tests. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to determine whether this antagonism also occurred during experimental infection in mice, which have high serum thymidine concentrations. We derived a mutant strain of Escherichia coli, TT- 48, incapable of utilizing exogenous thymidine from parent strain E. coli KC- 14 and then investigated the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, cefdinir, and ofloxacin against these strains. E. coli TT- 48 lacked the activity of thymidine kinase, which catalyzes the conversion of thymidine to thymidylate, but its growth curve remained close to that of the <b>parent</b> strain. The <b>MICs</b> of all of the antimicrobial agents tested, except cefdinir, for the mutant strain were slightly inferior to those for the parent strain. The bactericidal effect of trimethoprim against the parent strain was antagonized by thymidine at concentrations of more than 1 microg/ml, while that against the mutant strain was not affected by thymidine even at the highest concentration (10 microg/ml). The therapeutic efficacy of trimethoprim in experimental murine infections was significantly higher when the mutant rather than the parent strain was used, whereas the therapeutic efficacy of cefdinir or ofloxacin, whose antimicrobial action is independent of folic acid synthesis, was the same with both strains. Unexpectedly, sulfamethoxazole also had similar efficacy against both strains. Thus, high thymidine concentrations antagonized the antimicrobial activity of trimethoprim in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Syn 2190, a monobactam {{derivative}} containing 1, 5 -dihydroxy- 4 -pyridone as the C- 3 side chain, is {{a potent}} inhibitor of group 1 β-lactamase. The concentrations of inhibitor needed to reduce the initial rate of hydrolysis of substrate by 50 % for Syn 2190 against these enzymes were {{in the range of}} 0. 002 to 0. 01 μM. These values were 220 - to 850 -fold lower than those of tazobactam. Syn 2190 showed in vitro synergy with ceftazidime and cefpirome. This synergy was dependent on the concentration of the inhibitor against group 1 β-lactamase-producing strains, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Morganella morganii. However, against β-lactamase-derepressed mutants of P. aeruginosa, the MICs of ceftazidime plus Syn 2190 were not affected by the amount of β-lactamase, and the values were the same for the <b>parent</b> strains. The <b>MICs</b> at which 50 % of isolates are inhibited (MIC 50 s) of ceftazidime plus Syn 2190 were 2 - to 16 -fold lower than those of ceftazidime alone for ceftazidime-resistant, clinically isolated gram-negative bacteria. Similarly, the MIC 50 s of cefpirome plus Syn 2190 were two- to eightfold lower for cefpirome-resistant clinical isolates. The synergies of Syn 2190 plus ceftazidime or cefpirome observed in vitro were also reflected in vivo.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gonococcal {{fluoroquinolone}} {{resistance is}} now a significant problem in Japan. We generated gonococcal mutants resistant to norfloxacin in vitro from norfloxacin sensitive isolates and analysed the contribution of three known mechanisms of quinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three clinical isolates of N gonorrhoeae susceptible to norfloxacin were exposed to increasing concentrations of norfloxacin. To identify mutations in the gyrA and parC genes of the gonococcal mutants, the quinolone resistance determining regions of the gyrA and parC genes were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Norfloxacin accumulation in the gonococcal cells was also measured. RESULTS: The MICs of norfloxacin for three variants containing a single GyrA mutation were 16 -fold higher than that for their parent isolates. A variant showing reduced norfloxacin accumulation in the cells, without mutations in the GyrA or ParC proteins, was also less sensitive to norfloxacin, with a 16 -fold increase in the MIC, compared with the <b>parent</b> strain. The <b>MIC</b> of norfloxacin for a variant which contained a single GyrA mutation with reduced norfloxacin accumulation in the cells was 128 -fold higher than for the parent strain. A variant containing mutations in both GyrA and ParC proteins with reduced accumulation of norfloxacin in the cells showed a 256 -fold increase in the norfloxacin MIC compared with the parent strain. There was no variant containing a ParC mutation without the simultaneous presence of a GyrA mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results from this study}} suggest that not only a mutation in the gyrA gene but also reduced drug accumulation in cells contributes to the development of fluoroquinolone a mutation in the gyrA gene contributes to a high level of fluoroquinolone resistance in gonococci with decreases in accumulation in cells having an additional but lesser effect. ...|$|R
