40|$|The Center/TRACON Automation System (CTAS), under {{development}} at NASA Ames Research Center, {{is designed to}} assist controllers with the management and control of air traffic transitioning to/from congested airspace. This paper focuses on {{the transition from the}} en route environment, to high-density terminal airspace, under a time-based arrival-metering constraint. Two flight tests were conducted at the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) to study trajectory-prediction accuracy, the key to accurate Decision Support Tool advisories such as conflict detection/resolution and fuel-efficient metering conformance. In collaboration with NASA Langley Research Center, these test were part of an overall effort to research systems and procedures for the integration of CTAS and flight management systems (FMS). The Langley Transport Systems Research Vehicle Boeing 737 airplane flew a combined total of 58 cruise-arrival trajectory runs while following CTAS clearance advisories. Actual trajectories of the airplane were compared to CTAS and FMS predictions to measure trajectory-prediction accuracy and identify the primary sources of error for both. The research airplane was used to evaluate several levels of cockpit automation ranging from conventional avionics to a <b>performance-based</b> vertical <b>navigation</b> (VNAV) FMS. Trajectory prediction accuracy was analyzed with respect to both ARTCC radar tracking and GPS-based aircraft measurements. This paper presents detailed results describing the trajectory accuracy and error sources. Although differences were found in both accuracy and error sources, CTAS accuracy was comparable to the FMS in terms of both meter-fix arrival-time performance (in support of metering) and 4 D-trajectory prediction (key to conflict prediction). Overall arrival time errors (mean plus standard deviation) were measured to be approximately 24 seconds during the first flight test (23 runs) and 15 seconds during the second flight test (25 runs). The major source of error during these tests was found to be the predicted winds aloft used by CTAS. Position and velocity estimates of the airplane provided to CTAS by the ATC Host radar tracker were found to be a relatively insignificant error source for the trajectory conditions evaluated. Airplane performance modeling errors within CTAS were found to not significantly affect arrival time errors when the constrained descent procedures were used. The most significant effect related to the flight guidance was observed to be the cross-track and turn-overshoot errors associated with conventional VOR guidance.

50|$|RNAV systems {{evolved in}} a manner similar to {{conventional}} ground-based routes and procedures. A specific RNAV system was identified and its performance was evaluated through a combination of analysis and flight testing. For land-based operations, the initial systems used very high frequency omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) for estimating position; for oceanic operations, inertial navigation systems (INS) were employed. Airspace and obstacle clearance criteria were developed based on the performance of available equipment, and specifications for requirements were based on available capabilities. Such prescriptive requirements resulted in delays to the introduction of new RNAV system capabilities and higher costs for maintaining appropriate certification. To avoid such prescriptive specifications of requirements, an alternative method for defining equipment requirements has been introduced. This enables the specification of performance requirements, independent of available equipment capabilities, and is termed <b>performance-based</b> <b>navigation</b> (PBN). Thus, RNAV is now one of the navigation techniques of PBN; currently the only other is required navigation performance (RNP).|$|E

Resilience is defined as an ability to return to nominal operations following a schedule perturbation. Results from a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiment that included off-nominal events to perturb the schedule are described. The schedule comes from a precision trajectory-based arrival manager. The experiment collected data regarding the response to perturbed schedules in three conditions, where: 1) a disturbance rejection algorithm made schedule adjustments automatically, 2) a Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) participant made schedule adjustments manually, or 3) no schedule adjustments were made. Analyses showed that the simulation’s scheduled PBN operations have inherent resilience, recovering from {{more than half of}} the perturbed schedules even with no schedule adjustments. Resilience to the same off-nominal events improved with schedule adjustments; an increased proportion of perturbed schedules recovered within the length of operation run, and the average duration of the schedule’s perturbed state decreased. Compared to the manual schedule adjustments condition, a greater number of schedule adjustments occurred for the same off-nominal events in the automated condition. However, perturbed schedules were recovered more frequently and perturbations were less severe in the automated condition. Subjective and objective workload in the manual and the automated schedule adjustment conditions were similar to the no schedule adjustment condition.

Predložene {{procedure}} konstruisane su primenom savremenih koncepcija i rešenja u civilnoj avijaciji: <b>Performance-Based</b> <b>Navigation,</b> Baro-VNAV i CDA, koja se vrlo uspešno već primenjuju širom sveta. / Introduction Numerous {{advantages of}} <b>Performance-Based</b> <b>Navigation</b> {{should be applied}} in reorganizing the terminal airspace around Belgrade after the opening of 'Batajnica' airport for civil operations. The concept of <b>Performance-Based</b> <b>Navigation</b> Contrary to conventional navigation which relies on navigation signals from ground navaids, PBN is predominantly based upon satellite navigation. RNP - Required Navigation Performance RNP {{is defined as a}} set of standards which specify required navigation performance accuracy of an aircraft in certain airspace. Some of its key features are monitoring of actually achieved navigational performances and navigation containment. Benefits and possible issues with RNP implementation Implementation of RNP leads to significant savings in fuel and time, it increases the efficiency of airspace and capacity, reduces ATC workload while on the other hand {{there are a number of}} issues that still should be addressed. Barometric Vertical Navigation (Baro-VNAV) The essence of Baro-VNAV is calculation of the vertical component of a 3 D flight path that aircraft should follow based on measured static pressure. CDA - Continuous Descent Approach By CDA, approach is flown with a constant gradient at minimal thrust instead of alternating descent and level flight with increased thrust as it is flown in a conventional approach. The airports Both of the airports have their own TMA, but currently there are conventional SID and STAR flows for 'Nikola Tesla' running through TMA 'Batajnica' while procedures for 'Batajnica' are issued only as temporary for special flights. Procedure design A detailed overview of procedure design includes general considerations, the principles on which the design is based, design of turns, maps of inbound flows featuring holdings and missed approach segments. Holdings All holdings, including both in approach and in missed approach for both airports are defined in accordance with RNP holding criteria and in a way that aircraft inbound from as many as possible flows could use them. Final approaches All final approaches consist of a single TF leg (Track to Fix). Containment areas are linear and all their elements are determined by RNP 0. 3. Baro-VNAV is used for vertical guidance. Missed approach segments with MAP holdings In design of missed approach segment only TF legs were used for a straight flight and RF legs for turns. The priority was minimization of total complexity in the segment which is why the minimal number of legs was used and turn amplitude was limited. Conclusion Implementation of RNP AR APCH in combination with Baro- VNAV and CDA at 'Nikola Tesla' and 'Batajnica' would bring many benefits without any observed negative side effects.

Increasing the reliability requirements to estimate the accuracy characteristics quality of flight operations requires the development and improvement of methods for their evaluation. First of all, the application of methods based on more accurate representations of error models with more correct models of the error probability density distribution is required, especially in the field of large, rare errors.

This indicates that this threshold does not sufficiently capture areas that experience annoyance related to more concentrated, lower level overflight noise at distances farther from the airport. This thesis assesses the effectiveness by which different noise analysis methods capture the locations of these airport noise complaints through examination of the noise exposure for three representative scenarios at Boston Logan International Airport using DNL and number of overflights above a noise threshold (Nabove) metrics. The three scenarios examined include the standard noise analysis methodology scenario (annual average day) as well as a day of heavy usage of a noise-sensitive runway (33 L for departures), and a scenario representing a peak hour of departures on this runway. The results indicate that the 33 L peak day scenario does a better job of capturing a substantial fraction of the complainants sensitive to the 33 L departure trajectories (66 %- 87 % at the 45 dB- 5 OdB DNL thresholds) than the standard annual average day scenario. Results for the 33 L peak day scenario indicate that the Nabove metric is also effective at capturing noise complaints at the 60 dB day/ 50 dB night noise threshold at exposure rates in the 25 - 50 overflight range (78 %- 84 % complainant capture). by Morrisa Adelle Brenner.

40|$|A {{publication}} {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an abstract that begins "This testimony discusses the current progress toward implementing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will impact nearly every aspect of air transportation and will transform {{the way in which}} the air transportation system operates today. It will do so, in part, by (1) using satellite-based surveillance as opposed to ground-based radars, (2) using <b>performance-based</b> <b>navigation</b> instead of cumbersome step-by-step procedures, (3) replacing routine voice communications with data transmissions, and (4) organizing and merging the disjointed data that pilots, controllers, airports, airlines, and others currently rely on to operate the system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been planning and developing NextGen since 2003, and is now implementing near-term (through 2012) and mid-term (through 2018) capabilities. Over the years, concerns have been raised by the Congress and other stakeholders that despite years of effort and billions of dollars spent, FAA has not made sufficient progress in deploying systems and producing benefits. In past reports, we have made a number of recommendations to FAA to address delays in development and acquisitions, improve its processes, and focus on accountability and performance. Others have also made recommendations to FAA to improve its implementation of NextGen. For example, the Department of Transportation's Office of the Inspector General recently made recommendations regarding specific NextGen programs, and the NextGen Midterm Implementation Task Force [...] whose creation was requested by FAA [...] resulted in consensus recommendations from industry on specific capabilities FAA should prioritize. Over the last 2 years, FAA has taken several steps and instituted many changes to address several of these issues. This statement today discusses (1) the results of NextGen programs and improvements to date and (2) ongoing issues that will affect NextGen implementation. This statement today is based on our NextGen-related reports and testimonies over the last 2 years; ongoing work for this subcommittee that includes our analysis of selected NextGen acquisitions and our analysis of FAA's efforts to harmonize NextGen with air traffic control modernization efforts in Europe; our review of FAA's 2025 Strategic Plan, 2011 NextGen Implementation Plan, 2012 Budget Submission, and other documents; and selected program updates from FAA officials. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} global demand for air {{transportation}} has put increasing {{strain on the}} nation's air traffic management system. To relieve this strain, the International Civil Aviation Organization has urged all nations to adopt <b>Performance-Based</b> <b>Navigation</b> (PBN), which can help to reduce air traffic congestion, decrease aviation fuel consumption, and protect the environment. NASA has developed a Terminal Area Precision Scheduling and Spacing (TAPSS) system that can support increased use of PBN during periods of high traffic, while supporting fuel-efficient, continuous descent approaches. In the original development of this system, arrival aircraft are assigned fuel-efficient Area Navigation (RNAV) Standard Terminal Arrival Routes before their initial descent from cruise, with routing defined to a specific runway. The system also determines precise schedules for these aircraft that facilitate continuous descent through the assigned routes. To meet these schedules, controllers are given a set of advisory tools to precisely control aircraft. The TAPSS system has been evaluated {{in a series of}} human-in-the-loop (HITL) air traffic simulations during 2010 and 2011. Results indicated increased airport arrival throughput up to 10 over current operations, and maintained fuel-efficient aircraft decent profiles from the initial descent to landing with reduced controller workload. This paper focuses on results from a joint NASA and FAA HITL simulation conducted in 2012. Due to the FAA rollout of the advance terminal area PBN procedures at mid-sized airports first, the TAPSS system was modified to manage arrival aircraft as they entered Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON). Dallas-Love Field airport (DAL) was selected by the FAA as a representative mid-sized airport within a constrained TRACON airspace due to the close proximity of a major airport, in this case Dallas-Ft Worth International Airport, one of the busiest in the world. To address this constraint, RNAV routes and Required Navigation Performance with the particular capability known as Radius-to-Fix (RNP-RF) approaches to a short final were used. The purpose of this simulation was to get feedback on how current operations could benefit with the TAPSS system and also to evaluate the efficacy of the advisory tools to support the broader use of PBN in the US National Airspace System. For this NASA-FAA joint experiment, an Air Traffic Control laboratory at NASA Ames was arranged to simulate arrivals into DAL in Instrument Meteorological Conditions utilizing parallel dependent approaches, with two feeder positions that handed off traffic to one final position. Four FAA controllers participated, alternately covering these three positions. All participants were Full-Performance Level terminal controllers and members of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. During the simulation, PBN arrival operations were compared and contrasted in three conditions. They were the Baseline, where none of the TAPSS systems TRACON controller decision support advisories were provided, the Limited Advisories, reflecting the existing but dormant capabilities of the current terminal automation equipment with providing a subset of the TAPSS systems advisories; numerical delay, landing sequence, and runway assignment information, and the Full Advisories, with providing the following in addition to the ones in the Limited condition; trajectory slot markers, timelines of estimated times of arrivals and sche...|$|E
