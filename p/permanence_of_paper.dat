50|$|The company Hercules Incorporated {{developed}} the first alkaline sizing in the 1950s that made acid-free paper possible. Despite the advances in paper making and {{the identification of}} and concern around the brittle book problem, it took decades before the adoption of ANSI NISO Standard Z39.48-1984 - <b>Permanence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paper</b> for Publications and Documents in Libraries in 1984. This voluntary standard covered pH value, tear resistance, alkaline reserve, and lignin thresholds for paper to last thousands of years and was developed to {{encourage the use of}} acid-free paper in library materials. The development of the initial standard was a result of the work of the Council on Library Resources, which effectively lobbied ANSI to adopt the guidelines.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{national}} and international documentary heritage are on paper. From industrialization in the manufacture <b>of</b> such material, <b>paper</b> with acidity levels has been produced which, together with other factors, has been causing the deterioration {{of this type of}} documentary heritage. In recent decades, with the incorporation <b>of</b> new <b>paper</b> production processes this problem has been partly solved. The international standards organism ISO has drafted two rules in this connection: ISO 9706 and ISO 11108. With the spread and recommendation for the use <b>of</b> permanent <b>paper</b> for preservation <b>of</b> documentary heritage in the long term, it is essential to know the standards and be well informed.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of conservation interventions such as Payments for Environmental Services (PES) is often evaluated [...] {{if it is}} evaluated at all [...] only {{at the completion of}} the intervention. Since gains achieved by the intervention may be lost after it ends, even apparently successful interventions may not result in long-term conservation benefits, a problem known as that <b>of</b> <b>permanence.</b> This <b>paper</b> uses a unique dataset to examine the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> land use change induced by a short-term, asset-building PES program implemented in Quindío, Colombia, between 2003 and 2008. This the first PES program to have a control group for comparison. Under this program, PES had been found to have a positive and highly significant impact on land use. To assess the long-term <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> these changes, both PES recipients and control households were re-surveyed in 2011, four years after the last payment was made. We find that the land use changes that had been induced by PES were broadly sustained in intervening years, with minor differences across specific practices and sub-groups of participants, indicating that these changes were in fact permanent. The patterns of change in the period after the PES program was completed also help better understand the reasons for the program's success. These results suggest that, at least in the case of productive land uses such as silvopastoral practices under conditions such as those at the study site, asset-building PES programs can be effective at encouraging land owners to adopt environmentally-beneficial land management practices and that the benefits will persist after payments cease...|$|R

40|$|We study two {{discrete}} predator-prey {{models in}} patchy environment, one without dispersal corridors {{and one with}} dispersal corridors. Dispersal corridors are passes that allow the migration of species from one patch to another and their existence may influence the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the model. We will offer sufficient conditions to guarantee the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the two predator-prey models. By comparing the two permanence criteria, we discuss the effects of dispersal corridors on the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the predator-prey model. It is found that the dispersion of the prey from one patch to another is helpful to the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the prey if the population growth of the prey is density dependent; however, this dispersion of the prey could be disadvantageous or advantageous to the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the predator.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Heifer International-Mexico (HI-M), a hunger-relieving non-profit organization, collaborates with the Direccin? General de Educacin? Tecnolg?ica Agropecuaria-Durango (DGETA) to establish livestock projects involving resource-poor families in the state of Durango, Mexico. This study identified and analyzed the factors affecting the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> hog and dairy cow projects in four communities in the state of Durango, Mexico. The researcher interviewed seven project managers and 35 beneficiaries to identify the factors affecting the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> livestock projects. From their responses, the researcher developed a list of 22 factors that promoted the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the livestock projects. Key points included personal interaction between beneficiaries in the group(s) and project manager(s), knowledge and skills obtained from workshops, and household economics. The researcher developed a separate list of 20 factors that inhibited the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the livestock projects. Key points included difficulties in livestock production and poor personal interaction and communication between beneficiaries and project managers. Two diagrams illustrate the commonalities and differences advocated by the two groups for both lists. Beneficiaries and project managers shared eight of the 14 factors advocated to promote the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> livestock projects. Beneficiaries had four factors unique to their group and the project managers had two factors unique to their group. Beneficiaries and project managers shared seven of the 13 factors advocated to inhibit the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> livestock projects. Four factors were unique to beneficiaries while two factors were unique to project managers. The researcher used a force field analysis based concept labeled the "line of permanence," to illustrate the factors affecting the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> HI-M's livestock projects in the communities. Community A was the only location where the interviewees identified more factors inhibiting the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> a livestock project. Community A was also the only community that no longer had animals HI-M donated to the community. In contrast to Community A, project managers and beneficiaries in Communities A, B, and C each identified more factors that promoted the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the livestock projects. The author made recommendations based on the findings of the study for HI-M and DGETA to improve the manner by which they undertake livestock projects...|$|R
