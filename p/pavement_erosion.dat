40|$|Concrete {{pavement}} {{systems have}} great capacity to provide long service lives; however, if the subbase layer is improperly designed or mismanaged, service {{life would be}} diminished significantly since the subbase layer performs many important roles in a concrete <b>pavement</b> system. The <b>erosion</b> of material beneath a concrete slab is an important performance-related factor that if applied to the selection of base materials can enhance the overall design process for concrete <b>pavement</b> systems. However, <b>erosion</b> of the subbase has not been included explicitly in analysis and design procedures since {{there is not a}} well accepted laboratory test and related erosion model suitable for design. Previous erosion test methods and erosion models are evaluated in terms of their utility to characterize subbase materials for erosion resistance. With this information, a new test configuration was devised that uses a Hamburg wheel-tracking device for evaluating erodibility with respect to the degree of stabilization and base type. Test devices, procedures, and results are explained and summarized for application in mechanistic design processes. A proposed erosion model is calibrated by comparing erosion to lab test results and LTPP field performance data. Subbase design guidelines are provided with a decision flowchart and a design assistant spread sheet for the economical and sustainable design of concrete pavement subbase layers by considering many design factors that affect the performance of the subbase...|$|R

40|$|Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSM) are {{cementitious}} self-compacting materials, {{comprised of}} low cement content, supplementary cementing materials, fine aggregates, and water. CLSM is typically {{used as an}} alternative to conventional compacted granular backfill in applications, such as <b>pavement</b> bases, <b>erosion</b> control, bridge abutments, retaining walls, bedding and backfilling of pipelines. This dissertation presents the findings of an extensive study carried out to determine the corrosivity of CLSM on ductile iron and galvanized steel pipelines. The study was performed in two phases and evaluated more than 40 different CLSM mixture proportions for their corrosivity. An extensive literature survey was performed on corrosion of metals in soils and corrosion of reinforcement in concrete environments to determine possible influential factors. These factors were used as explanatory variables with multiple levels to identify the statistically significant factors. Empirical models were developed for percent mass loss of metals embedded in CLSM and exposed to different environments. The first and only service life models for ductile iron and galvanized steel pipes embedded in CLSM mixtures were developed. Models indicated that properly designed CLSM mixtures can provide an equal or longer service life for completely embedded ductile iron pipes. However, the service life of galvanized pipes embedded in CLSM should not be expected to be more than the service life provided by corrosive soils...|$|R

High quality aerial images were processed using commercial software specifically designed for the creation of 3 D models and orthomosaics from aerial photos. This information, along with ground-level panoramas communicated the current condition of assets and roads.

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} the effect of applying several parameters: different axle load configuration, concrete properties, subgrade properties, slab thickness, joint characteristics, shoulder construction, bounded HMA overlay on concrete pavement, and bounded and unbounded CTB foundation over subgrade on the fatigue and erosion related distresses in concrete pavements. KENSLAB, an elaborate finite element program is {{used to determine the}} concrete pavement responses: stresses and deflection under the defined parameters. The results obtained using this software is relatively close to known theoretical Westergaard solutions. Several other findings related to pavement performance and behavior are made through this study. Multiple axle configurations is less damaging than single axle configuration in terms of fatigue life. Increasing the thickness is very effective in reducing the edge stress. Using concrete with higher modulus of elasticity brings only a small increase to the edge stress. Increasing the slab thickness is {{the most effective way to}} increase the fatigue life. Increasing subgrade modulus is more effective in reducing corner deflection than decreasing edge stress. The availability of tied shoulder construction gives significant impact in both reducing edge stress and corner deflection. The debonding condition between layers has a significant effect on pavement responses. Keywords: Concrete <b>pavement,</b> fatigue failure, <b>erosion</b> failure, finite element, KENSLAB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Qarham to Golmud {{expressway}} is {{the first}} high-grade road in Qarham salt lake, which {{is regarded as the}} most enormous inland salt lake in China, moreover, it {{is the first}} expressway built on the inland salt lake in China. There is high and excessive saline soil distributed over this area whose thickness is no less than 20 m, but the average subgrade height of the expressway is only 2 m. A great many of measures are taken for the construction of the subgrade to prevent salt migrating from foundation to roadbed and pavement, which will cause disasters of secondary salinization in roadbed and pavement. By paving testing road at the site and detecting the efficiency of the measures in preventing salt, the paper put forward the technique of preventing subgrade from salinization for Qarham to Golmud expressway. The results of testing and detecting demonstrate that the height of salt migration is only 45 cm in subgrade under the condition of brine supply, which is less than the height of subgrade. So it is efficient to keep the roadbed and <b>pavement</b> from the <b>erosion</b> of salt; The settlement of road surface was about 0 ~ 2 mm among 3 months since the highways had been opened to traffic for two years, and uneven settlement and other diseases caused by the secondary salinization were not appeared, which showed that the measures of salinization prevention (salt resistance) were taken well to achieve the design purposes...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 23 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 12 - 15 July 2004 "Getting recognition {{for the importance of}} transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Soil properties and climatic effects all contribute to erosion of subbase material, which leads to rigid <b>pavement</b> failure. The <b>erosion</b> takes the form of pumping of material and water, subsequently creating voids. The formation of voids can lead to a rapid decline in the durability and serviceability of the pavement. At present {{there is not a single}} laboratory test, which could identify materials resistant to pumping. Thus there is a need to develop a laboratory test, which could predict erosion of material in a pavement. The aim of this paper is to present the initial results of a Rotational Shear Device (RSD) constructed to simulate erosion of subbase layers under a concrete slab. A review is given of existing tests, which are used to test for erosion. Motivation for the adoption of the RSD is given. Details of the device as well as pilot laboratory tests are also presented. Pilot laboratory tests were preformed on a G 2 material stabilised with 2 % and 4 % Cem I 42. 5 cement. Duplicate samples were tested at the CSIR with the mechanical wet-dry brushing test. As expected, the 4 % stabilised samples eroded less than the 2 % stabilised samples under the conditions in the RSD and thus was confirmed by results from the mechanical wet-dry brushing tests.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess the impact of trampling by sheep on the downslope movement of rock fragments on steep, degraded rangeland slopes in the western part of Lesvos (Greece). Marked rock fragments were used as tracers which were monitored over a one-year period. It was shown that the slope gradient and the development of a fast encroaching shrub Sarcopoterium spinosum appeared to be major controlling factors of the rock fragment displacement distances. In this paper, downslope transport fluxes of rock fragments were calculated for different combinations of surface rock fragment mass and Sarcopoterium cover (%). The rock fragment displacement was also described as a diffusion type process. The diffusion constants (0. 1 to 121 kg m(- 1)) were strongly influenced by the Sarcopoterium cover. The highest transport rate, using regression equations for the displacement distance, was estimated to be 33. 8 kg(- 1) y(- 1) or 3. 4 ton ha(- 1) for high rock fragment covers (34 kg m(- 2)) and low Sarcopoterium cover (0 %, after burning) on a 100 in long and 20 % steep slope. Locally, measured values indicated a maximum flux of 61. 2 kg(- 1) y(- 1) on a 50 % slope with a Sarcopoterium cover of 1 %. The results show that the rock fragment fluxes are significant when compared to other processes of hillslope erosion, in extreme cases comparable to (but still lower than) published rates for tillage erosion. An exponential decrease in rock fragment loss with increasing Sarcopterium cover was found, similar to such relationships between soil loss and vegetation cover for water erosion. The disturbance of the rock fragment pavement by trampling also results in exposure of fine earth to erosion by water, as indicated by <b>erosion</b> <b>pavements</b> and gullies on neighbouring slopes, especially after burning of the Sarcopoterium cover. Rock fragment movement by trampling therefore significantly contributes to soil degradation in these Mediterranean environments. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although, in {{semi-arid}} environments, rock fragments at {{the soil}} surface and within the topsoil {{play an important role}} in desertification control, little is known about their spatial distribution. Therefore, this study analyses spatial patterns of rock fragment cover along catenas, and the vertical variations in volumetric rock fragment content in soil profiles in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Natural and anthropogenic processes inducing these patterns are assessed. Volumetric rock fragment content (R-V) was analysed in 10 soil pits. All rock fragments were extracted, and their volumes determined by pedo-stratigraphic unit, size and lithology. The rock fragment cover (R-C) was determined by the point-count method using vertical photographs of {{the soil surface}}. The following processes contribute to the vertical variability of R-V: (1) in Vertisols, upsqueezing as a consequence of swell-shrink cycles (argillipedoturbation) is responsible for high R-C at the soil surface; (2) large rock fragments (> 7. 5 cm) are rapidly brought to the soil surface by kinetic sieving through tillage, even in the case of continuous fine sediment deposition, what may result in a rock fragment rich subsoil, underlying a thick soil layer (up to 80 cm) without large rock fragments and a topsoil with a high R-C at the surface; (3) Skeletic Regosols at the foot of cliffs show no systematic vertical rock fragment distributions. As to rock fragment cover along the catena, some fundamental differences appear between the basalt and limestone substrate. On the basalt catena with slope gradients between 0. 06 and 0. 42 m m(- 1), R-C is high everywhere (57 - 85 %) and is unrelated to slope gradient. Vertical processes such as kinetic sieving through ploughing and argillipedoturbation determine the rock fragment distribution at the soil surface. In limestone areas, argillipedoturbation is less active and R-C is positively correlated with slope gradient (R- 2 = 0. 74; n = 6; P 2 cm) and more kinetic sieving sensitive rock fragments lowers R- 2 to 0. 46 (n = 6; n. s.). Preconditions for the present spatial distribution of rock fragments at the soil surface in the study area are the occurrence of two geomorphic processes in the past: (1) mudflows depositing diamictons including much coarse debris and (2) intense water erosion, which occurred after deforestation and exposed rock fragments at or near to the soil surface. Generally, the balance between lateral and vertical movements of rock fragments now, controls the spatial distribution of R-C. With respect to the lateral displacement processes: (1) lateral transport over the soil surface by trampling, tillage and concentrated runoff, especially on steep slopes, and (2) rockfall from the cliffs. Vertical supply of rock fragments to the soil surface is caused by (1) selective runoff erosion and the development of <b>erosion</b> <b>pavements,</b> (2) tillage induced kinetic sieving, bringing preferentially large rock fragments (> 7. 5 cm) to the soil surface, and (3) argillipedoturbation in Vertisol areas.

40|$|CSIRO Land and Water Science Report seriesSoil surface crusts in rangelands {{and their}} role in runoff and erosion have long been {{recognized}} in tropical Australia. However, these crusts are much less documented than the crusts developed in southern and central arid and semi-arid Australia. The {{aim of this study}} was (i) to gain more information about the morphology, genesis and behaviour of soil surface crusts in North-Eastern Australian rangelands, (ii) to test the relevance of the crust typology suggested by Valentin and Bresson (1992), (iii) to investigate the possible relationships between crust type and plot infiltration rate and sediment concentration and (iv) to discuss the relevance of integrating crust typology within a soil surface assessment framework such as suggested by Roth (2004). Two degraded rangeland sites were selected for the micro-morphological studies, about 80 km west of Townsville. Rainfall simulation was used to simultaneously determine rainfall infiltration (as an indicator of runoff incidence) and sediment detachment for 26 mini-plots that reflected a range of soil surface conditions at each site, {{while at the same time}} providing rainfall impacted plots for micromorphological sampling. Undisturbed samples of the top 15 cm of the soil were taken from each plot after rainfall simulation. These undisturbed samples were dried prior to impregnation with epoxy resin in which an ultraviolet fluorescent dye was incorporated. One vertical cross section cut from each impregnated block was photographed under UV light using a digital camera. One 6 x 13 cm vertical thin section was prepared from each impregnated block and observed using a polarizing stereomicroscope. The samples were classified after the typology suggested by Valentin and Bresson (1992, 2002) and Bresson and Moran (2004). Overall, the micromorphology of the soil surface crusts is in good agreement with the typology suggested by Valentin and Bresson (1992, 2002). Structural crusts developed on these soils through compaction by raindrop impact (packing crusts) as well as through vertical sorting of soil particles by winnowing and sieving (sieving crusts and also <b>pavement</b> crusts). Most <b>erosion</b> crusts formed through erosion of the top sandy layer of sieving crusts, but some erosion crusts were transitional with packing crusts, as evidenced by a surface plasmic layer very thin and without any vesicles. Below the crusted layers, the soil matrix showed signs of an intense bioturbation, as evidenced by the abundance of channels, either empty or filled in with pellets and/or microaggregates. However, there appears to be no clear relationship between bioturbation intensity and crust type. Even though there is no clear evidence of the relict or active character of the empty and filled in channels, the high degree of bioturbation points to ability of degraded grazed surfaces to recover and regain hydrological function. Sediment concentration appears to be more related to crust types than infiltration rate, especially when the ground cover was low. In such conditions, erosion crusts generated a sediment concentration much higher than sieving crusts and pavement crusts did. The crust micromorphology is also in good agreement with the soil surface conditions suggested by Roth (2004) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to document the analysis that was conducted to evaluate {{the effect of a}} potential change to the TSPA-VA base case design that could improve long-term repository performance. The design feature evaluated in this report is a modification of the topographic surface of Yucca Mountain. The modification consists of covering the land surface immediately above the repository foot-print with a thick layer of unconsolidated material utilizing rip-rap and plants to mitigate erosion. This surface modification is designated as Feature 23 a or simply abbreviated as F 23 a. The fundamental aim of F 23 a is to reduce the net infiltration into the unsaturated zone by enhancing the potential for evapotranspiratiration at the surface; such a change would, in turn, reduce the seepage flux and the rate of radionuclide releases from the repository. Field and modeling studies of water movement in the unsaturated zone have indicated that shallow infiltration at the surface is almost negligible in locations where the bedrock is covered by a sufficiently thick soil layer. In addition to providing storage for meteoric water, a thick soil layer would slow the downward movement of soil moisture {{to such an extent that}} evaporation and transpiration could easily transfer most of the soil-water back to the atmosphere. Generic requirements for the effectiveness of this design feature are two-fold. First, the soil layer above the repository foot-print must be thick enough to provide sufficient storage of meteoric water (from episodic precipitation events) and accommodate plant roots. Second, the added soil layer must be engineered so as to mitigate thinning by erosional processes and have sufficient thickness to accommodate the roots of common desert plants. Under these two conditions, it is reasonable to expect that modification would be effective for a significant time period and the net infiltration and deep percolation flux would be reduced by orders of magnitude lower than the present levels. Conceptually, the topographic surface above the repository foot-print would be re-contoured to make it more suitable for placement of unconsolidated materials (e. g., alluvium). Figure 1 shows the region of the surface modification in relation to the location of the repository foot-print. The surface contours in this region after modification are shown in the plot presented in Figure 2. Basically, the surface modification would be accomplished by applying cuts to the ridges slopes on the east flank of Yucca Mountain to produce a relatively uniform slope of about 10 %. The alluvium would be covered with rock fragments (to imitate the desert <b>pavement)</b> to reduce <b>erosion.</b> This report documents the modeling assumptions and performance analysis conducted to estimate the long-term performance for Feature 23 a. The performance measure for this evaluation is dose-rate. Results are presented that compare the dose-rate time histories for the new design feature to those of the TSPA-VA base case calculation (CRWMS M&O 1998 a) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{ecological}} {{study on the}} Morgan Creek and the East Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho, Bighorn Sheep herds was conducted from July 1, 1966 to February 28, 1970. The Morgan Creek population numbered about 100 animals upon termination of the study. The trend of this population was downward. The East Fork population numbered about 50 animals and the trend appeared to be stable or slightly downward. Productivity of both herds was low. Lamb mortality was high and recruitment to the breeding herd low. Low recruitment rates coupled with hunting pressure caused a decl ine in the ram component of both herds. The lungworm-pneumonia complex and scabies mites localized in the ears were common disease-parasite problems for bighorns on the Morgan Creek and East Fork ranges. Poor nutrition was postulated {{as the reason for}} endemic disease and parasite problems. Cougars, coyotes, bobcats and eagles were evaluated as mortaility factors. Evidence did not indicate that any of these were a serious limiting factor. Accidents and poaching also were evaluated as mortal ity factors, but {{it was not possible to}} determine the extent to which they contributed to mortality. Food habits of bighorns and deer were studied on the Morgan Creek winter range. Bighorns were found to use 69 percent grasses, 27 percent browse and 4 percent forbs. The primary grass utilized was Agropyron spicatum 11 anditfie primary browse was Cercocarpus ledifollus. Considerable competition for forage existed between deer and bighorns. Competition did not occur between bighorns and elk or antelope. Domestic livestock use has converted most of the range in the vicinity of Challis to sagebrush, which is not quality bighorn habitat. Deer numbers have greatly increased because of the habitat change. Livestock now compete with bighorns for the limited amount of remaining grass and deer compete by decimating the mountain mahogany (C. ledifolius. Shortage of protein during the winter is a serious problem for bighorns. Winter range rehabilitation, consisting of sagebrush eradication and accompanied by reduction of deer and domestic livestock usage, is suggested to restore ranges for the benefit of bighorns. Transplanting of bighorns to suitable areas historically inhabited by bighorns is suggested to increase bighorn distribution in Idaho and to stabilize current statewide downward trends In bighorn numbers until winter range rehabilitation problems can be solved. Breeding occurred in November and December, and lambing in May and June. Twinning did not occur. Several trapping methods were evaluated and a total of 43 bighorns were trapped, Of these, 7 were transplanted, 7 were instrumented with radio transmitters, 23 were neckbanded and 6 accidently killed. Morgan Creek bighorn sheep migrated an average of 22. 4 airline miles to summer ranges. The shortest migration was 19 miles and the longest 28. 5 miles. East Fork bighorns were found to migrate about 17 airline mi les to summer range. Analysis of winter range indicated a canopy coverage of 34 percent for shrubs, forbs and grasses, 42 percent bare soll and <b>erosion</b> <b>pavement</b> and 24 percent natural rock. Forage production was low at 128 to 669 pounds/acre green weight, Big sagebrush contributed 40 percent of the herbage production. Usage on all sites was moderate to excessive. Erosion was very evident, and range condition trend estimated to be downward. Only about 805 percent of the 16, 676 acres of winter range within the Morgan Creek study area was quality habitat avai lable to bighorns during most winters. Sagebrush, little used by bighorns, dominated 56 percent of the winter range. Grasses, indicative of quality bighorn habitat, dominated only 17 percent of the winter range. Idaho 2 ̆ 7 s statewide bighorn sheep populations have decreased approximately 50 percent since 1960. Ram components have decreased about 85 percent since 1960. Increased numbers of hunters have harvested fewer rams under the two-week open season 3 / 4 -curl regulation and the point of diminishing returns has begun to operate. Depresslng the ram component below an undetermined level may interfere with reproduction.
