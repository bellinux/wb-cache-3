The results of the test demonstrate differences in the ignitability factors of the standard primers and time peak pressures of less than 100 microseconds.

These adjustments do not alter {{the strength of the}} main spring, ensuring reliable <b>primer</b> <b>ignition.</b> This is due to the use of roller bearings in the trigger mechanism along with extensive hand fitting and polishing of components during assembly.

5000|$|Fouling {{difficulties}} {{increased as}} military loadings {{shifted from the}} [...]303 British and 7.62 NATO to the 5.56×45mm NATO. Some propellant lots clogged the gas tube of M16 rifles until concentrations of calcium carbonate stabilizers were reduced in 1970 as reformulated WC844 for the 5.56mm NATO cartridge. Civilian handloaders experienced similar fouling problems with smaller bore diameters. Some attributed the problem to residues of unburned deterrent coatings and suggested using magnum <b>primers</b> to improve <b>ignition</b> and burning at lower pressures. Ignition was ultimately improved by blending in {{a small percentage of}} uncoated propellant granules to improve the performance of standard primers.|$|R
5000|$|Civilian {{ammunition}} manufacturers {{began offering}} non-corrosive primers in the 1920s, but most military ammunition {{continued to use}} corrosive priming mixtures of established reliability. [...] The various proprietary priming formulations used by different manufacturers produced some significantly different ignition properties until the United States issued military specifications for non-corrosive primers for 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge production. The PA-101 primers developed at Picatinny Arsenal used about 50% lead styphnate with lesser amounts of barium nitrate, antimony trisulfide, powdered aluminum and tetrazene. [...] Most United States manufacturers adopted the PA-101 military standard for their civilian production of Boxer primers. [...] Manufacturers subsequently offered more powerful magnum <b>primers</b> for uniform <b>ignition</b> of civilian long-range or big-game cartridges with significantly greater powder capacity than required for standard infantry weapons.|$|R
50|$|In an Advanced <b>Primer</b> <b>Ignition</b> Blowback design {{such as the}} MK 108, {{this problem}} is {{prevented}} by using a longer chamber, which allows the cartridge {{to enter into the}} chamber a small distance past the breech face. When the trigger is pressed, the bolt is moved forward by expansion of the buffer spring. It chambers the cartridge, but instead of coming to rest against the breech face, it follows the case a small distance into the chamber. A cartridge case with a rebated rim is used, so that the extractor claw can hook over the rim and still fit within the chamber. <b>Primer</b> <b>ignition</b> is timed so that the bolt is still moving forward when the propellant is ignited. The expanding gases from the fired round stop the forward motion of the bolt, then reverse its motion, expelling it from the chamber, along with the spent cartridge case, which, as the bolt moves rearward, strikes the ejector, throwing it from the mechanism. The heavy bolt continues rearward, compressing the buffer spring, which then expands, pushing the bolt forward again, picking up a fresh cartridge from the magazine (or belt in a belt-fed weapon) and chambering it. This cycle of events continues until the trigger is released. Before this sequence of events occurs, the projectile has already left the muzzle, allowing the propellant gas to escape, reducing the chamber pressure to a safe level.|$|E
50|$|The Type M2 was a slim weapon {{working on}} the {{principle}} of advanced <b>primer</b> <b>ignition</b> blowback. It weighed only 30 kg. It was fed by a somewhat awkward, curved box magazine, available in versions that held 10 or 15 rounds; the latter weighed another 5 kg. As the rate of fire was 325 rounds per minute, this magazine could be emptied very quickly. The muzzle velocity was 490 m/s, which was low compared to the rifle-calibre machine guns of the period such as the German MG 08, but a respectable performance compared to other automatic cannon of the period, such as the Vickers QF 1 pounder pom-pom.|$|E
5000|$|According to Anthony G. Williams, the [...] "API {{blowback}} {{principle is}} used virtually in all open bolt sub-machine guns" [...] (technically, although generally these {{are known as}} [...] "simple blowback" [...] weapons due to the very late ignition of the cartridge compared to specially designed API blowback guns like the MK 108), although [...] "the relatively low pressures and velocities mean that extended chambers and rebated-rim cartridges are not required" [...] for sub-machine guns. In heavier weapons, advanced <b>primer</b> <b>ignition</b> (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker for use on the Becker 20-mm automatic cannon. It became a feature {{of a wide range}} of designs that can be traced back to Becker's, including the Oerlikon cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The next {{evolution}} of the cylinder did not occur until the 1830s. While chemistry was still in its infancy, the development of fulminates as <b>primers</b> for firearm <b>ignition</b> contributed to {{the invention of the}} percussion cap. This, in turn, {{led to the development of}} the percussion cylinder. As with the earlier flintlock cylinders, the chambers within the percussion cylinders were not bored completely through. Percussion caps replaced the flintlock pans as primers and the drilled touch holes were incorporated within nipples. The nipples were inserted into a recess at the rear of each chamber. The percussion cap was placed over the nipple. These arms quickly incorporated mechanisms that automatically rotated the cylinder, aligning the chamber with the barrel, and locking it in place. Each chamber was loaded in a similar manner as the previous flintlocks, that is, from the front of the cylinder, powder was poured into the chamber and then a bullet was inserted and pressed into place with a ramrod.|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{frequency}} of electrically initiated, 20 mm munition hangfires (delayed ignitions), a joint Army/NASA investigation was conducted to recommend quality evaluation improvements for acceptance of both primers and gun propellant. This effort focused only on evaluating ignition and combustion performance as potential causes of hangfires: poor electrical initiation of the primer, low output performance of the <b>primer,</b> low <b>ignition</b> sensitivity of the gun propellant, {{and the effects of}} cold temperature. The goal was to determine the "best" of the Army and NASA test methods to assess the functional performance of primers and gun propellants. The approach was to evaluate the performance of both high-quality and deliberately defective primers to challenge the sensitivity of test methods. In addition, the ignition sensitivity of different manufacturing batches of gun propellants was evaluated. The results of the investigation revealed that improvements can be made in functional evaluations that can assist in identifying and reducing ignition and performance variations. The "best" functional evaluation of primers and propellant is achieved through a combination of both Army and NASA test methods. Incorporating the recommendations offered in this report may provide for considerable savings in reducing the number of cartridge firings, while significantly lowering the rejection rate of primer, propellant and cartridge lots. The most probable causes for ignition and combustion-related hangfires were the lack of calcium silicide in the primer mix, a low output performance of primers, and finally, poor ignition sensitivity of gun propellant. Cold temperatures further reduce propellant ignition sensitivity, as well as reducing burn rate and chamber pressures...|$|R
5000|$|The primer size {{is based}} on the primer pocket of the cartridge, with {{standard}} types available in large or small diameters. The primer's explosive charge {{is based on}} the amount of ignition energy required by the cartridge design; a standard primer would be used for smaller charges or faster-burning powders, while a magnum primer would be used for the larger charges or slower-burning powders used with large cartridges or heavy charges. Rifle, large and magnum <b>primers</b> increase the <b>ignition</b> energy delivered to the powder, by supplying a hotter, stronger and/or longer-lasting flame. Pistol cartridges often are smaller than modern rifle cartridges, so they may need less primer flame than rifles require. A physical difference between pistol and rifle primers is the thickness of the primer's case; since pistol cartridges usually operate at lower pressure levels than rifles, their primer cups are thinner, softer, and easier to ignite, while rifle primers are thicker and stronger, requiring a harder impact from the firing pin. [...] (Despite the names pistol and rifle, the primer used depends on the cartridge, not the firearm; a few high-pressure pistol cartridges like the [...]221 Fireball and [...]454 Casull use rifle primers, while lower-pressure pistol and revolver cartridges like the [...]32 and [...]380 Autos, 9mm Luger, [...]38 Special, [...]357 Magnum, [...]44 Magnum and [...]45 ACP and traditional revolver cartridges like [...]32-20, [...]44-40 and [...]45 Colt, also used in lever action rifles, still would be loaded with pistol primers. Virtually all cartridges used solely in rifles do, however, use rifle primers.) ...|$|R

50|$|A semi or fully {{automatic}} firearm {{is said to}} fire from an open bolt if, when ready to fire, the bolt and working parts are held to the rear. When the trigger is pulled the bolt goes forward, feeding a round from the magazine into the chamber and firing it. Like any other self-loading design without an external power supply, the action is cycled by {{the energy of the}} shot; this sends the bolt back to the rear, ejecting the empty cartridge case and preparing for the next shot (or continuing forward again, if the trigger is held down and the weapon is an automatic). Generally, an open-bolt firing cycle is used for {{fully automatic}} weapons and not for semi-automatic weapons (except some semi-automatic conversions of automatic designs). Firearms using Advanced <b>Primer</b> <b>Ignition</b> blowback inherently fire from open bolt only.|$|E
5000|$|The Sterling {{employs a}} degree {{of what is known}} as Advanced <b>Primer</b> <b>Ignition,</b> in that the {{cartridge}} is fired while the bolt is still moving forward, {{a fraction of a second}} before the round is fully chambered. The firing of the round thus not only sends the bullet flying down the barrel but simultaneously resists the forwards movement of the bolt. By this means it is possible to employ a lighter bolt than if the cartridge was fired after the bolt had already stopped, as in Simple Blowback, since the energy of the expanding gases would then only have to overcome the bolt's static inertia ( [...] plus spring resistance [...] ) to push it backwards again and cycle the weapon; whereas in this arrangement it fights its forwards momentum as well, and thus some of it is used up. The lighter bolt makes not only for a lighter gun, but a more controllable one since there is less mass moving to and fro within it as it fires.|$|E
40|$|Enabling {{hybrid rocket}} {{propulsion}} {{to compete with}} solid and liquid propulsion is {{the target of the}} renewed international interest in hybrid rockets. From the performances standpoint, conventional hybrids may compete with conventional liquids such as LOX Kerosene and could be much better than solids but they have 2 major drawbacks; A low burning rate of current solid fuels represents the main one to overcome for successful operations of hybrid propulsion on large scale. Combustion problems with a low combustion efficiency, instabilities and a high level of residuals (difficult mastering of the combustion with a multiport motor) Moreover, to be really attractive, new formulations have to bring a decisive advantage with a much higher specific impulse. nevertheless these new formulations have to keep the 3 major ones of hybrids; a safe operating mode due to a very high level of mechanical properties, a cheap manufacturing process due to a pure fuel solid grain and the capability to be stopped on demand. Some formulations appears really attractive with a high burning rate and a good combustion with or without a large increase of the specific impulse The present paper describes the efforts, by a joint team of investigators, to reach this objective by promoting the use of novel energetic ingredients in hybrid solid fuels and will give an example of application. A variety of new formulations was tested keeping in mind that both combustion behavior and mechanical properties of solid fuel grains are important for applications. Thus, a systematic experimental investigation was planned to determine the relevant properties of several candidate formulations. For this purpose, a micro-sized hybrid rocket motor test bench was implemented for quasi-steady solid grain regression rate measurements, CO 2 laser for radiative <b>primer</b> charge <b>ignition,</b> and exhaust gases dump system. The solid grain is shaped as a traditional fuel cylinder with one central perforation. Air or mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen, injected at the head-end of the motor, were used as gaseous oxidizer. This apparatus allows, on a relative scale, a quick classification of fuel regression rates and their sensitivity to operating conditions. Three main directions were explored for developing advanced solid fuel compositions. The first one resorts to nano-sized energetic particles cast in HTPB solid fuel grains. The second direction resorts to fuels characterized by the presence of a liquid surface, resulting in droplets entrainment. Paraffin-based fuels were investigated revealing, for the investigated compositions, severe structural problems due to poor mechanical properties. The third investigated direction specifically addresses to metal hydrides compositions. In particular magnesium and aluminum hydrides formulations were analyzed, showing increases in the solid fuel regression rates depending on the hydride mass fraction. The incorporation of metal hydride in HTPB-based fuel induces also an energetic increase. For aluminum hydride, the expected specific impulse (vacuum, Îµ= 40) augmentation is 32 s...|$|R
5000|$|On August 24, 2004, SIG Sauer and Heckler & Koch/HK Defense won major pistol {{contracts}} with the United States Department of Homeland Security. The contract was valued at $26.2 million. The HK pistol models chosen were the HK P2000 US, HK P2000 SK Subcompact, and the USP Compact/LEM (Law Enforcement Modification). The LEM trigger is basically HK's version of SIG's DAK trigger and vice versa. According to the company, the LEM trigger allows for faster follow-up shots (repeat shots) on target than a standard double-action-only system, due to a lighter trigger pull (7.3-8.5 lbf) and shorter trigger reset than standard DAO trigger systems. The LEM trigger utilizes a two-piece [...] "pre-cocked hammer" [...] composed of a cocking piece and an external hammer. The hammer is pre-cocked when a round is chambered (slide is cycled). The LEM system supposedly also provides for more reliable <b>primer</b> <b>ignition,</b> since it utilizes a stronger hammer spring.|$|E
5000|$|What {{is common}} to all {{blowback}} systems is that the cartridge case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked and permitted to move while there remains powder pressure in the chamber will undergo a degree of blowback action. The energy from the expansion of gases on firing appears {{in the form of}} kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm's operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation. How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where blowback systems differ. Blowback operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: simple blowback (often just [...] "blowback"), delayed/retarded blowback, and advanced <b>primer</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon is}} {{more prone to}} fire when dropped, and the open {{mechanism}} is more subject to picking up dirt when in the ready position, and so may require an additional ejector door or similar mechanism to exclude dust and dirt. Some open-bolt designs can suffer from {{a condition in which}} bolt retention fails and the weapon discharges even with no trigger input. Open-bolt machine guns could not be synchronized to fire through the arc of a propeller due to the relatively long period between sear disengagement and the ignition of the cartridge, making them harder to use as forward-firing weapons on tractor configuration fighter aircraft. Accuracy can suffer somewhat in an open-bolt design, again due to the longer delay between pulling the trigger and <b>primer</b> <b>ignition,</b> but this is generally less of a concern in automatic weapons, since after the first shot, the operation is indistinguishable from a firearm that fires from a closed bolt. It is only when the trigger is released that the bolt is caught in the rearward position; during automatic fire, both types of bolts are free to operate at full rate, without hindrance. As most open-bolt guns are automatics, generally only weapons, such as submachine guns, converted to semi-automatic operation suffer from this.|$|E
50|$|The Oerlikon cannon and its {{derivatives}} feature blowback operation: {{the bolt}} is not locked to the breech {{of the gun}} on the moment of fire, but instead moves back freely while the propellant gases propel the projectile forward. Advanced <b>primer</b> <b>ignition</b> (API) is used so that the projectile has left the muzzle and the gas pressure in the barrel is down to a safe level before the breech opens. Whereas in simple blowback guns, the gas pressure only has to overcome the inertia of the bolt, which has stopped moving, in order to push it back and open the breech, in API operation the firing pin strikes the primer while the bolt is still traveling forward so that the gas pressure has to overcome the forward momentum of the bolt as well, to push it to the rear. This permits blowback {{to be used in}} far more powerful weapons. Nevertheless, compared to guns with a locking mechanism a fairly heavy bolt must be employed, which limits the rate of fire unless other steps are taken, as in {{the final version of the}} Japanese 99 Mark 2. To give the heavy bolt sufficient forward speed, a large spring is required, which is wrapped around the barrel of the gun. Also, the Oerlikon's chamber is longer than needed to contain the case, and the end of the bolt, which is the same diameter as the case, actually enters this extended chamber as it fires the cartridge. As a result, after firing the bolt and case must recoil a small distance to the rear before the bolt has fully re-emerged and the case in turn begins to leave the chamber. This is unnecessary in simple blowback weapons which use relatively low-power ammunition, but if a significant portion of the cartridge case of an auto-cannon emerged from the chamber, thus losing the support of the chamber walls, before the gas pressure had fallen far it would burst.|$|E
