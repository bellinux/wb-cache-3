40|$|Abstract Male orchid bees collect volatiles, {{from both}} floral and non-floral sources, that they expose as phero-mone analogues (<b>perfumes)</b> during {{courtship}} display. The chemical profile of these <b>perfumes,</b> which includes terpenes and aromatic compounds, is both species-specific and divergent among closely related lineages. Thus, fragrance composition {{is thought to}} play an important role in prezygotic reproductive isolation in euglossine bees. How-ever, because orchid bees acquire fragrances entirely from exogenous sources, the chemical composition of male <b>perfumes</b> is prone to variation due to environmental heterogeneity across habitats. We used Gas Chromatog-raphy/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to characterize the <b>perfumes</b> of 114 individuals of the green orchid bee (Euglossa aff. viridissima) sampled from five nativ...|$|R
