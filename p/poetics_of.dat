25|$|In 2004, Trevor's {{first book}} appeared. The <b>Poetics</b> <b>of</b> Melancholy in Early Modern England {{was a study}} of how writers such as John Donne, Edmund Spenser, and John Milton {{utilized}} the term melancholic to enhance their reputations as learned writers. In 2005, Trevor published his first collection of stories, The Thin Tear in the Fabric of Space. Each of these nine stories circles around a different experience of grief {{following the death of}} a loved one. The collection is dedicated to the writer's sister, Jolee, who died unexpectedly in 1998.|$|E

40|$|On first glance, Wolfgang Iser {{seems to}} share little ground with pioneers <b>of</b> <b>poetics</b> like Tzvetan Todorov and Benjamin Harshav, who {{explicitly}} excluded interpretation from the province <b>of</b> <b>poetics.</b> Indeed, if Iser has any connection with poetics, and this article argues that he does, it is via the critical fringes <b>of</b> <b>poetics,</b> where excluding interpretation from systematic study of literature was never {{seen as an}} option one could choose. Although poetics versus hermeneutics {{was one of the}} major theoretical themes of the late 1970 ’s, Iser is better understood in the context of critical thought aiming to avoid the strict opposition between the two. Delving in turn into Iser’s theory, his analytical practice, and theory <b>of</b> <b>poetics,</b> this essay points out several points where dialogue between Iser’s work and the endeavor <b>of</b> systematic <b>poetics</b> can be productive...|$|R

500|$|Murasaki {{may have}} died in 1014. Her father made a hasty return to Kyoto from his post at Echigo Province that year, {{possibly}} because of her death. Writing in A Bridge of Dreams: A <b>Poetics</b> <b>of</b> [...] "The Tale of Genji", Shirane mentions that 1014 is generally accepted as the date of Murasaki Shikibu's death and 973 as the date of her birth, making her 41 when she died. Bowring considers 1014 to be speculative, and believes she may have lived with Shōshi until as late as 1025. Waley agrees given that Murasaki may have attended ceremonies with Shōshi held for her son, Emperor Go-Ichijō around 1025.|$|E
40|$|This paper compares two {{creation}} narratives from {{indigenous peoples}} {{on either side}} of the Pacific Ocean, the relationships between which catalyse the theorisation of a transcultural approach to ecological <b>poetics.</b> The comparison <b>of</b> these narratives reveals important, rhizomatic similarities, and also unmistakable regional differences, concerning the origins of language and culture in Yanomami (Venezuela) and MakMak (Australia) communities. Concomitant with the centrality of indigenous thought in this theorisation of ecopoetics is the de­centrality of human-only conceptions <b>of</b> <b>poetics.</b> Accordingly, the paper considers non-semantic forms <b>of</b> <b>poetics</b> such as birdsong in order to de-centre classically Western, humanist conceptions of language and ecology...|$|R

40|$|Beginning {{from the}} {{formative}} influence of Marshall McLuhan on the discourses of communication studies and media studies, this essay argues for a re-examination {{of the importance}} <b>of</b> <b>poetics</b> to these discourses.

500|$|Guitarist The Edge {{explained}} {{that some of}} the sounds in the introduction that resemble keyboards were actually created by him on guitar. Of the song's introduction, bassist Adam Clayton says, [...] "When people put on the record, we wanted their first reaction to be either 'this record is broken' or 'this can't be the new U2 record, there's been a mistake.' So there is quite a dramatic extended intro where you just don't know what you are listening to." [...] Author Albin Zak, in his book The <b>Poetics</b> <b>of</b> Rock, says of the introduction, [...] "Before any words are sung, the sounds alone alert the listener that the band has moved into new expressive territory." ...|$|E
500|$|The Good Terrorist {{has also}} been called a satire. In her book Doris Lessing: The <b>Poetics</b> <b>of</b> Change, Gayle Greene called it a [...] "satire {{of a group of}} revolutionaries", and Susan Watkins, writing in Doris Lessing: Border Crossings, {{described}} it as a [...] "dry and satirical examination of a woman's involvement with a left-wing splinter group". A biography of Lessing for the Swedish Academy on the occasion of her being awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature called it [...] "a satirical picture of the need of the contemporary left for total control and the female protagonist's misdirected martyrdom and subjugation". Yelin said the novel [...] "oscillat between satire and nostalgia". Academic Robert E. Kuehn felt that it is not satire at all and that while the book could have been a [...] "satire of the blackest and most hilarious kind", in his opinion Lessing [...] "has no sense of humor, and instead of lashing [...] with the satirist's whip, she treats them with unremitting and belittling irony".|$|E
500|$|Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. It {{was called a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] by several reviewers who viewed it as {{a departure from the}} mainstream, hip hop-oriented R of the time. Maxwell was also compared to soul singers of the 1960s and 1970s. Writing for Vibe, OJ Lima said the record was a [...] "refreshing detour from hump-bouncin' '90s R", while Dimitri Ehrlich from Entertainment Weekly wrote that Maxwell [...] "smooths hip-hop's and soul's edges, proving that black dance music doesn't automatically mean ghetto culture." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News called it [...] "one of the few modern sex albums to offer a sense of succor", and Urban Latino hailed it as [...] "one of the most soulful releases of the year", writing that Maxwell exhibited [...] "the soul of Curtis Mayfield, the <b>poetics</b> <b>of</b> Beni More and the stage presence of Michael Jackson, pre-Thriller". In American Visions, Michael George wrote, [...] "In an age where young, black artists are criticized (often rightly so) for misogynistic lyrics, Maxwell's focus on commitment is refreshing. But more important, he can flat-out sing." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Arion Berger later said, [...] " [...] laid-back romanticism has heat at its core and a powerful groove that grounds the music: By varying the push of the beat but retaining the central mellow vibe, Maxwell creates a sound as felicitous on headphones {{as it is in the}} bedroom." [...] Peter Shapiro was more critical, panning Maxwell's lyrics and calling the album an [...] "overly mannered pastiche of early 70s soul ... all style and no substance". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau jokingly accused Maxwell of [...] "expiring of Afrocentric texturitis", while rating the album a [...] "dud", which indicated [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".|$|E
