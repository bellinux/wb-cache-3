2500|$|This {{prompted}} a significant restart of Yang–Mills theory studies that proved {{successful in the}} formulation of both electroweak unification and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The electroweak interaction is described by SU(2) × U(1) group while QCD is an SU(3) Yang–Mills theory. The electroweak theory is obtained by combining SU(2) with U(1), where quantum electrodynamics (QED) is described by a U(1) group, and is replaced in the unified electroweak theory by a U(1) group representing a weak hypercharge rather than electric charge.

We explore the effects of varying the contribution of (1) a thermal Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk, (2) a spherically symmetric shell of broad-line clouds, the broad-line region (BLR), and (3) a hot infrared emitting dusty torus (DT), on the resultant seed <b>photon</b> <b>fields.</b> We let the system evolve to beyond the BLR and within the DT and study the manifestation of the varying target <b>photon</b> <b>fields</b> on the simulated SED and light curves of a typical blazar.

5000|$|External energy pumping (e.g. a {{light beam}} or voltage) {{can help to}} the {{excitation}} of an electron. Relaxation of an electron {{from one of the}} upper states may occur by emission of either a photon or a phonon. This is determined by the density of states of phonons and photons. Density of states is the number of states per volume unit in an interval of energy (E, E+dE) that are available to be occupied by electrons. Both phonons and photons are bosons and thus, they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. This means that, since bosons with the same energy can occupy the same place in space, phonons and photons are force carrier particles and they have integer spins. There are more allowed states available for occupancy in a phonon field than in a <b>photon</b> <b>field.</b> Therefore, since the density of terminal states in the phonon field exceeds that in a <b>photon</b> <b>field</b> (by up to ~105), phonon emission is by far the more likely event. We could also imagine a concept where the excitation of an electron briefly leads to vibration of the lattice and thus to phonon generation. The vibration energy of the lattice can take discrete values for every excitation. Every one of this [...] "excitation packages" [...] is called phonon. An electron does not stay in an excited state for too long. It readily releases energy to return to its stable low energy state. The electrons release energy in any random direction and at any time (after their excitation). At some particular times, some electrons get excited while others lose energy {{in a way that the}} average energy of system is the lowest possible.|$|E
50|$|In physics, a {{coupling}} constant or gauge coupling parameter {{is a number}} that determines {{the strength of the}} force exerted in an interaction. Usually, the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian of a system describing an interaction can be separated into a kinetic part and an interaction part. The coupling constant determines the strength of the interaction part with respect to the kinetic part, or between two sectors of the interaction part. For example, the electric charge of a particle is {{a coupling}} constant that characterizes an interaction with two charge-carrying fields and one <b>photon</b> <b>field</b> (hence the common Feynman diagram with two arrows and one wavy line). Since photons carry electromagnetism, this coupling constant determines how strongly electrons feel such a force and has its value fixed by experiment.|$|E
