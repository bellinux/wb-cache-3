40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of microwave power intensity and <b>pulsing</b> <b>ratio</b> on drying behavior of fig fruit in a laboratory scale microwave dryer. During experiments, weight and temperature of the samples were recorded at regular intervals (10 s). The results showed that drying time of products increased by approximately 200 % under <b>pulsing</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 5 to 4. In contrast drying time decreased by approximately 500 % under microwave power intensity of 0. 5 to 2. 5 W/g. Furthermore, 11 different thin layer drying models were analyzed for investigation of moisture variation of fig fruit. The performance of these mathematical models were compared based on the three statistical criteria, such as coefficient of determination (R 2), standard error of estimate (SEE) and residual sum of square (RSS). According to the results, Quadratic and Logarithmic models described the drying kinetics of fig with the mean coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 9984. Additionally, microwave power intensity resulted in the raised sample temperature leading to better removal of moisture.

40|$|In this paper, a <b>pulse</b> energy {{distribution}} <b>ratio</b> determination method for micro-EDM is presented.

40|$|Molybdenum-containing {{amorphous}} carbon (a-C:Mo) thin films were prepared using a dual-cathode filtered cathodic arc plasma source with a molybdenum and a carbon (graphite) cathode. The Mo {{content in the}} films was controlled by varying the deposition <b>pulse</b> <b>ratio</b> of Mo and C. Film sheet resistance was measured in situ at process temperature, which was close to room temperature, as well as ex situ {{as a function of}} temperature (300 - 515 K) in ambient air. Film resistivity and electrical activation energy were derived for different Mo and C ratios and substrate bias. Film thickness was in the range 8 - 28 nm. Film resistivity varied from 3. 55 x 10 - 4 Omega m to 2. 27 x 10 - 6 Omega m when the Mo/C <b>pulse</b> <b>ratio</b> was increased from 0. 05 to 0. 4, with no substrate bias applied. With carbon-selective bias, the film resistivity was in the range of 4. 59 x 10 - 2 and 4. 05 Omega m at a Mo/C <b>pulse</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 05. The electrical activation energy decreased from 3. 80 x 10 - 2 to 3. 36 x 10 - 4 eV when the Mo/C <b>pulse</b> <b>ratio</b> was increased in the absence of bias, and from 0. 19 to 0. 14 eV for carbon-selective bias conditions.

The O 1 s spectrum was fitted with three peaks (indicated by dashed line) after {{the application of a}} Smart background for samples A, B, and C. The dotted lines indicate the binding energy of La-O-La, La-Si-O, and La-OH peaks with the increasing binding energy [22 - 24]. La-O-La peak becomes larger with the increasing La/Al precursor <b>pulse</b> <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, smaller La-OH peaks with red curves are obtained. These phenomena are attributed to more combination of La-Al-O bonds and less La-hydroxide, which could make films with good quality. La-Si-O peaks with blue curves become smaller with the increasing La/Al precursor <b>pulse</b> <b>ratio.</b> The formation of La-Si-O peak is caused by the interdiffusion of atoms in Si substrate and as-deposited nanolaminate films. On the other hand, sample D has large La-OH and La-Si-O peaks, and this is caused by the hygroscopic characteristics of pure La 2 O 3 film and interdiffusion of atoms, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of different <b>pulse</b> ON/OFF <b>ratio</b> on a-SiNx:H films were studied and {{the method of}} “totally wet etch” were used to fabricate a-Si:H TFT. Six different <b>pulse</b> ON/OFF <b>ratio</b> were used to deposite a-SiNx:H film. The effective deposition rate, refractive index and bonding ratio were measured using N & K analyzer and FTIR spectrometer. With the <b>pulse</b> ON/OFF <b>ratio</b> increasing from 1 / 3 to CW, the effective deposition rate of a-SiNx:H films reduced about 1. 7 times, while the etching rate, Si-N/Si-H and N-H/Si-H of those increased about 1. 4, 4. 6, and 6. 6 times, respectively. The increasing of Si-N/Si-H and N-H/Si-H with increasing <b>pulse</b> ON/OFF <b>ratio</b> {{was caused by the}} increasing of Si-H bond with increasing <b>pulse</b> ON/OFF <b>ratio.</b> The high <b>pulse</b> ON/OFF <b>ratio</b> is corresponding to N-rich a-SiNx:H film.

40|$|The {{electroplating}} {{method has}} been widely used to synthesize Bi 2 Te 3 thin films due to many advantages including low cost, non-vacuum operation, and compatibility with microfabrication processes. However, the structure-property correlation of the electroplated Bi 2 Te 3 thin films has not been well studied yet {{due to a lack}} of systematic properties characterization. In this work, we systematically studied the dependence of the composition, microstructure, and thermoelectric properties on the deposition parameters for the Bi 2 Te 3 thin films prepared by the pulsed electroplating method. It is shown that a deposition pulse potential of 0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) and a large <b>pulse</b> off-to-on <b>ratio</b> are advantageous to improve the stoichiometry and morphology of the deposited films. We demonstrated that the thermoelectric figure of merit of the electroplated Bi 2 Te 3 films can be enhanced by increasing the <b>pulse</b> off-to-on <b>ratio,</b> which is mainly due to the reduced thermal conductivity and the increased Seebeck coefficient.

Using multi-neuronal whole-cell voltage recordings, we characterized {{the development of}} synaptic dynamics at excitatory connections between layer 5 pyramidal neurons in visual cortex during the first 4 postnatal weeks (n = 158 pairs). In young (P 11 - 15) cortex, unitary EPSPs were large and reliable, with a median amplitude of ~ 570 uV and a median failure rate of only 9 %. In animals P 25 - 29, the median uEPSP amplitude had decreased markedly to ~ 135 uV, accompanied by an increased coefficient of variation and uEPSP failure rate (34 %). Some of these developmental changes in synaptic properties (i. e. increased uEPSP failures) were temporally associated with postnatal eye opening. Mature layer 5 connections showed strong, frequency-dependent paired pulse facilitation across the range of stimulation frequencies tested (10 - 50 Hz, mean paired <b>pulse</b> <b>ratios</b> between 1. 3 and 1. 95). In younger cortex, paired pulse depression was observed across the frequency range (mean paired <b>pulse</b> <b>ratios</b> between 0. 53 and 0. 8) and less variability in paired pulse dynamics was observed. Developmental modification of synaptic dynamics was also manifest during complex action potential trains; P 25 - 29 synapses effectively maintained transmission during prolonged spike trains {{across a range of}} frequencies, whereas synaptic potentials in P 11 - 15 cortex depressed rapidly within a few action potentials, except at very low stimulation frequencies (0. 2 Hz). Thus, the first postnatal month sees a reduction in the efficacy of transmission of single action potential signals between Layer 5 pyramidal cells in visual cortex, accompanied by improved dynamic range and capacity for transmission of complex spike trains...|$|R

Thalamic slices, oriented so that both corticogeniculate and retinogeniculate axons could be stimulated, were cut from young (16 - to 37 -day-old) DA-HAN rats. Corticogeniculate EPSCs displayed pronounced paired pulse facilitation at stimulus intervals up to 400 ms. The facilitation had a fast and a slow component of decay with time constants of 12 ± 7 and 164 ± 47 ms (means ± s. d.), respectively. Maximum paired <b>pulse</b> <b>ratio</b> (EPSC 2 × EPSC 1 − 1) was 3. 7 ± 1. 1 at the 20 - 30 ms interval. Similar to other systems, the facilitation was presynaptic.

The axons of FS cells ramified preferentially around pyramidal cell somata, while BF cell axons ramified predominately around pyramidal cell dendrites. Synapses between pyramidal cells and FS cells displayed brief train depression (n 5 12). Bath application of v-Agatoxin IVA (0. 5 mM), blocking P/Q-type calcium channels, decreased mean peak amplitudes of the EPSPs to 40 % of control EPSPs (n 5 8).
