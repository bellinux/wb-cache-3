It is also {{distinguished from the}} Lepus oiostolus pallipes, by its lack of grey at the rump. It is also smaller in size and has thinner legs, than both the desert hare and the Lepus oiostolus pallipes.|$|E
5|$|It prefers basins {{and desert}} areas vegetated with Chinese {{tamarisk}} (Tamarix chinensis), brush, or poplar (Populus), along the <b>peripheries</b> of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for shelter, and tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th {{century the}} Polish lands {{were still on}} the <b>peripheries</b> of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of {{progress}} did take place in levels of civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the Carolingian Empire; objects crafted there have occasionally been found. Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes. The names of some of them, mostly from {{the western part of the}} country, are known from written sources, especially a Latin document written in the mid-9th century by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer. During this period, smaller tribal structures were disintegrating while larger ones were being established in their place.|$|E
40|$|Many {{questions}} regarding economic development {{should be viewed}} in a regional core-periphery framework. A core-periphery input-output model of the Washington state economy was constructed. The core region supplied the <b>periphery</b> with higher-order services while the <b>periphery</b> furnished the core with natural resource-based commodities. Weak backward linkages from major core industries to the <b>periphery</b> lead to rejection of the growth-pole theory tenet that core growth supports <b>periphery</b> growth. Economic growth in the <b>periphery</b> was felt more strongly in the core because <b>periphery</b> sectors with strong within-region effects generally had strong impacts in the core. ...|$|R
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons that <b>periphery</b> {{countries}} remain the way they are. One important factor that keeps countries in the <b>periphery</b> is the lack of development of technology. Another way <b>periphery</b> countries come to be is either the lack of a central government or the <b>periphery</b> country is under the control of another country. <b>Periphery</b> countries are known for exporting raw goods to core countries. What tends to happen is the maximum gain a <b>periphery</b> nation could earn is less than needed to maintain an equilibrium between costs and revenues. One thing <b>periphery</b> nations could do is to stop the increase of exports. At the beginning of the 19th century, Asia and Africa were considered <b>periphery</b> and their lack of development enabled the United States and Germany to remain successful core nations.|$|R
30|$|Realist, {{liberal and}} Marxist {{theory in the}} {{international}} relations discipline tend to simplify the world system in differentiating in core and <b>periphery.</b> The core consists {{of the rich and}} most developed and powerful states, while the <b>periphery</b> are the developing and poor states. The <b>periphery</b> would export their raw materials cheaply and provide cheap labor costs, while the core would exploit the <b>periphery</b> and dominate with ther power. Immanuel Wallerstein’s world system theory added the semi-periphery to core and <b>periphery,</b> which has certain features different to the core and to the <b>periphery.</b> 4 The semi-periphery would act as a core for the <b>periphery,</b> while it was a buffer between the core and the <b>periphery.</b> Although this theoretical strand belongs to Marxist theory of dependency, I argue that it also adds {{to a better understanding of}} the refugee crisis in Europe and Asia. I argue that in a world system or refugees, there is also a semi-periphery, which acts as a core for the <b>periphery.</b> Moreover, the semi-periphery acts as a harbor for refugees, which is financed by the core to stop or at least manipulate migration from there to the core. Therefore, also in a world system of refugees with core, semi-periphery, and <b>periphery,</b> the semi-periphery acts as a buffer.|$|R
5|$|Lenin tasked Trotsky with {{establishing}} a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, {{and with his}} support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, {{as well as most}} of Great Russia, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's <b>peripheries.</b> The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of anti-Semitism, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Mac Scelling (fl. 11541173/1174), {{also known}} as Mac Scilling, was a {{prominent}} twelfth-century military commander engaged in conflicts throughout Ireland. He is first recorded in 1154 commanding the maritime forces of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain in a bloody encounter against Toirrdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. Muirchertach's naval forces were drawn from the western <b>peripheries</b> of Scotland and the Isles. He next appears on record in 1173/1174, supporting the cause of Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht against the English colonisation of Mide. An early modern Scottish source claims that {{a man of the}} same name was a bastard son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles. If Mac Scelling was indeed related to Somairle, this relationship could cast light on the latter's conflict with Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles, a man who appears to have opposed Muirchertach at some point in his career. Although not termed so in contemporary sources, Mac Scelling may be regarded as an early archetype of later gallowglasses, heavily-armed Scottish mercenaries recruited by Irish rulers in centuries that followed.|$|E

The band consists of vocalist Spencer Sotelo, guitarists Misha Mansoor, Mark Holcomb, and Jake Bowen, and drummer Matt Halpern. <b>Periphery</b> released their self-titled debut in 2010, followed by <b>Periphery</b> II: This Time It's Personal on July 3, 2012. On December 3, 2013 they released a teaser for their EP Clear, which was subsequently released on January 28, 2014. <b>Periphery's</b> third and fourth studio albums, entitled Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega respectively, were released on January 15, 2015.

25|$|The {{upper classes}} of Russia {{put more money}} into manufacturing, which grew during Catherine's reign. The number of {{enterprises}} increased from 600–700 in 1762 to over 2,000 when her reign ended. Russian agriculture grew during Catherine's reign due to the economic pressure put upon the gentry that needed more wealth in order to indulge in Western European tastes. The gentry used potentially arable land in old areas {{as well as new}} land on the <b>peripheries</b> of the empire. This expansion occurred during the 1780s and 90s.|$|E
25|$|Some {{fifty years}} ago, the city began to grow/expand beyond its <b>peripheries</b> and ancient gates and ramparts. In 1963, {{the city was}} the largest urban centre in present Ondo and Ekiti States and its {{population}} of 158,000 at the census of that year represented it as the most populous urban centre in Eastern Yorubaland. The 1991 population count confirmed {{the primacy of the}} city, at least in Ekiti. The creation of Ekiti State in October 1996 and the establishment of state capital at Ado-Ekiti will further enhance the city's physical development.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Khaldun {{argues that}} each dynasty has within itself {{the seeds of}} its own downfall. He {{explains}} that ruling houses tend to emerge on the <b>peripheries</b> of great empires and use the unity presented by those areas to their advantage {{in order to bring}} about a change in leadership. As the new rulers establish themselves at the center of their empire, they become increasingly lax and more concerned with maintaining their lifestyles. Thus, a new dynasty can emerge at the periphery of their control and effect a change in leadership, beginning the cycle anew.|$|E
2500|$|Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber have {{referred}} to the monetary system of today as Bretton Woods II. They argue {{that in the early}} 2000s the international system is composed of a core issuing the dominant international currency, and a <b>periphery.</b> The <b>periphery</b> is committed to export-led growth based on the maintenance of an undervalued exchange rate. In the 1960s, the core was the United States and the <b>periphery</b> was Europe and Japan. This old <b>periphery</b> has since graduated, and the new <b>periphery</b> is Asia. The core remains the same, the United States. [...] The argument is that a system of pegged currencies—in which the <b>periphery</b> exports capital to the core, which serves an intermediary financial role—is both stable and desirable, although this notion is controversial.|$|R

40|$|Between 1810 and 1940, a large GDP {{per capita}} gap {{appeared}} between the industrial core {{and the poor}} <b>periphery,</b> the latter producing, increasingly, primary products. Over the same period, the terms of trade facing the <b>periphery</b> underwent a secular boom then bust, peaking in the 1870 s or 1890 s. These terms of trade trends {{appear to have been}} exogenous to the <b>periphery.</b> Additionally, the terms of trade facing the <b>periphery</b> exhibited relatively high volatility. Are these correlations spurious, or are they causal? This Figuerola Lecture, to be given at Carlos III University (Madrid), argues that they are causal, that secular growth and volatility in the terms of trade had asymmetric effects on core and <b>periphery.</b> On the upswing, the secular rise in its terms of trade had powerful de - industrialization effects in the <b>periphery.</b> Over the full cycle 1810 - 1940, terms of trade volatility suppressed accumulation and growth in the <b>periphery</b> as well. ...|$|R
25|$|Clusters {{are often}} built in an oval shape {{starting}} from the center. The center is the most coveted space, so the nests {{tend to be more}} concentrated and often smaller and older in these areas. These central nests {{are also more likely to}} have completely closed rings rather than open rings. Many nests on the periphery are larger, younger, and contain more cells, and foundations are also mainly found near the <b>peripheries.</b> Also, because clusters last for more than one year and some nests are destroyed during that time, signs of older nests are also more concentrated near the middle.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previously}} fought wars, which had affected mostly the <b>peripheries</b> {{of the huge}} state, from the mid-17th century onward central Poland was being ravaged by warfare as well. The two Northern Wars turned out particularly destructive. Several massive foreign armies traversed the Commonwealth {{in the course of}} the Second Northern War. The protracted role of the country as a battlefield, the quartering of troops and armies, combined with the policy of exacting contributions and pillage during the Great Northern War, greatly deteriorated the economy of the country which had not yet recovered from the damage incurred two generations earlier. Internal warfare and looting by unpaid Commonwealth troops added to the damage.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the influx of {{immigrants}} to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area are communities of Levantine Arabs who are mostly Christian or Irreligious, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese, Jews, and people from other parts of Brazil. The main waves of internal migration came from people of African, mixed or older Portuguese (as descendants of early settlers) descent from Minas Gerais and people of Eastern European, Swiss, Italian, German, Portuguese and older Portuguese-Brazilian heritage from Espírito Santo in the early and mid-20th century, together with people with origins in Northeastern Brazil, in the mid-to-late and late 20th century, as well some in the early 21st century (the latter more directed to <b>peripheries</b> than the city's core).|$|E

50|$|Cultural {{elements}} diffuse {{outward from}} a civilization's core to its <b>periphery.</b> Physical aspects of culture (e.g. tools and technologies) diffuse quicker than nonphysical aspects (e.g. beliefs, arts).

50|$|Locational <b>periphery</b> in {{contrast}} {{is used to}} describe places physically distant {{from the heart of}} the city.

25|$|For a given {{species in}} a given environment, {{available}} resources will {{limit the number of}} individuals that can survive indefinitely. This is the carrying capacity. Upon reaching this threshold, individuals may find it easier to gather resources in the poorer yet less exploited peripheral environment than in the preferred habitat. Homo habilis could have developed some baseline behavioural flexibility prior to its expansion into the <b>peripheries</b> (such as encroaching into the predatory guild). This flexibility could then have been positively selected and amplified, leading to Homo erectus adaptation to the peripheral open habitats. A new and environmentally flexible hominin population could have come back to the old niche and replace the ancestral population. Moreover, some step-wise shrinking of the woodland and the associated reduction of hominin carrying capacity in the woods around 1.8 Ma, 1.2 Ma, and 0.6 Ma would have stressed the carrying capacity's pressure for adapting to the open grounds.|$|E
25|$|Slum {{relocation}} strategies rely on {{removing the}} slums and relocating the slum poor to free semi-rural <b>peripheries</b> of cities, sometimes in free housing. This strategy ignores several dimensions of a slum life. The strategy sees slum {{as merely a}} place where the poor lives. In reality, slums are often integrated with every aspect of a slum resident's life, including sources of employment, distance from work and social life. Slum relocation that displaces the poor from opportunities to earn a livelihood, generates economic insecurity in the poor. In some cases, the slum residents oppose relocation even if the replacement land and housing to the outskirts of cities is free and of better quality than their current house. Examples include Zone One Tondo Organization of Manila, Philippines and Abahlali baseMjondolo of Durban, South Africa. In other cases, such as Ennakhil slum relocation project in Morocco, systematic social mediation has worked. The slum residents have been convinced that their current location is a health hazard, prone to natural disaster, or that the alternative location is well connected to employment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Ekiti {{country is}} {{generally}} an upland zone, with elevations being generally above 450m throughout. Around Akure, elevations drop to around 360m. It lies on an area underlain by metamorphic rock, and is generally an undulating {{country with a}} characteristic landscape that consists of old plains broken by steep-sided outcrops that may occur singularly or in groups or ridges. Such outcrops {{can be seen in}} places at Aramoko, Efon-Alaaye, Ikere-Ekiti, Igbara-odo and Okemesi-Ekiti among others. Rugged hills dot the landscape, notable among which are the Olosunta hills of Ikere-Ekiti in the south, Effon ridge which runs longitudinally around Efon Alaaye on the western boundary, and Ado Hills in the centre. The topography was perhaps the single strongest reason why the Ekitis never became a single unit politically. The area enjoys a tropical climate with two distinct seasons. These are the rainy season which lasts from (April–October) and the dry season which commences in late November and ends in March. Temperature ranges between 21° and 28°C with high humidity. In the South, the vegetation is primarily Tropical hardwood forest, while a mixed / derived type savannah can be observed in the northern <b>peripheries.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The genome is nonrandomly {{organized}} {{within the}} nucleus, {{but it remains}} unclear how gene position affects gene expression. Silenced genes have frequently been found as-sociated with the nuclear <b>periphery,</b> and the environment at the <b>periphery</b> {{is believed to be}} refractory to transcriptional activation. However, in budding yeast, several highly regulated classes of genes, including the GAL 7 - 10 - 1 gene cluster, are known to translocate to the nu-clear <b>periphery</b> concurrent with their activation. To investigate the role of gene positioning on GAL gene expression, we monitored the effects of mutations that disrupt the interaction between the GAL locus and the <b>periphery</b> or synthetically tethered the locus to the <b>periphery.</b> Localization to the nuclear <b>periphery</b> was found to dampen initial GAL gene induction and was required for rapid repression after gene inactivation, revealing a function for the nuclear <b>periphery</b> in repressing endogenous GAL gene expression. Our results do not support a gene-gating model in which GAL gene interaction with the nuclear pore ensures rapid gene expression, but instead they suggest that a repressive environment at the nuclear <b>periphery</b> establishes a negative feedback loop that enables the GAL locus to respond rapidly to chang-es in environmental conditions...|$|R
