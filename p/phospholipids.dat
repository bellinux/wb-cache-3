5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} <b>phospholipids,</b> glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. <b>Phospholipids</b> make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total <b>phospholipids.</b> <b>Phospholipids</b> and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain.

Following o-xylene exposure, P. putida MW 1200 exhibited a decrease in total <b>phospholipid</b> content. In contrast, P. putida Idaho demonstrated an increase in <b>phospholipid</b> content 1 to 6 h after exposure.

In the presence of xylene, both strains showed increased <b>phospholipid</b> turnover. The rate of turnover was significantly greater in P. putida Idaho than in P. putida MW 1200.

40|$|AbstractIf {{phospholipase}} catalyzed hydrolysis of <b>phospholipid</b> {{dissolved in}} a detergent mixed micelle {{is limited to}} the <b>phospholipid</b> carried by a single micelle, then hydrolysis ceases upon exhaustion of that pool. However, if the rate of <b>phospholipid</b> exchange between micelles exceeds the catalytic rate then all of the <b>phospholipid</b> is available for hydrolysis. To determine <b>phospholipid</b> availability we studied the exchange of 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine between mixed micelles of <b>phospholipid</b> and non-ionic Triton detergents by both stopped-flow fluorescence-recovery and nuclear magnetic resonance-relaxation techniques. Stopped-flow analysis was performed by combining mixed micelles of Triton and <b>phospholipid</b> with mixed micelles that contained the fluorescent <b>phospholipid</b> 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -(12 -[{ 7 -nitro- 2 - 1, 3 -benzoxadiazo- 4 -yl}amino]dodecanoyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (P- 2 -NBD-PC). The concentration dependence of fluorescence recovery suggested a second-order exchange mechanism that was saturable. The true second-order rate constant depends on the specific mechanism for exchange, which was not determined in this study, but the rate constant will be on the order of 106 to 107 M− 1  s− 1. Incorporation of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -(16 -doxylstearoyl) phosphatidylcholine into micelles increased the rate of proton relaxation and gave a limiting relaxation time of 1. 3 ms.

5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers.

The archaeal <b>phospholipids</b> are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes.

Methods We carried out a long-term field experiment at Jilin Agriculture University that used <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acid analysis method to {{study the effects of}} three planting patterns of corn: continuous cropping, non-continuous cropping and uncultivated. Important findings Different planting patterns affected soil microbial community structure. Continuous cropping of corn had the lowest total <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids and bacterial <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids (33. 12 nmol·g– 1 and 18. 09 nmol·g– 1, respectively). Fungal <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids and fungi/bacteria with non-continuous cropping were 0. 61 nmol. g– 1 and 3. 06 %, respectively, and were significantly lower than with uncultivated and continuous cropping (p < 0. 05). But the ratio of gram positive <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids/gram negative <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids was greater with non-continuous cropping. The uncultivated treatment had greater total and bacterial <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids (42. 98 nmol·g– 1 and 24. 68 nmol·g– 1, respectively), higher contents of gram positive <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids and gram negative <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids, and a lower ratio of gram positive <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids/gram negative <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acids. Principal component analysis showed that soil microbial community structure with cropping was significant different (p < 0. 05) with that of uncultured in first principal component. Non-continuous cropping and continuous cropping were negatively positioned in first principal component with principal component scores of – 2. 48 and – 1. 84, respectively.
