30|$|The {{significance}} of the biodiversity and ES of Inle Lake to the local communities is important for livelihood and has been recognized by the UNESCO’s man and Biosphere <b>Reserve</b> <b>programme</b> by notifying it as the first Biosphere Reserve in Myanmar. The study reiterated that LULCC is happening and it has implication to the sustained flow of ES for human wellbeing. The main drivers seem to be expansion of cropland manifested by increased siltation from the catchment area and chemical leeching that has affected the world’s threatened floral, faunal and endemic species in the lake. Similarly, the rate of deforestation and forest degradation is increasing. As a result, the local communities are exploring adaptive measures to tackle the challenges. Interestingly, the people’s perceptions are also supportive to the observed analysis of LULCC with some exceptions.|$|R

A {{statistically}} {{significant increase in}} awareness of conservation issues has been found for South African residents who stayed overnight in Hluhluwe Game Reserve, in Giant's Castle Game Reserve, or in Londolozi Private Game Reserve. Despite these increases, the levels of awareness of conservation issues in respondents leaving the reserves are considered low. These findings, using a longitudinal survey design, were verified using a cross-sectional survey design. Approximately 150 respondents were interviewed in each reserve, and for both approaches. Respondents were found to represent a most privileged sector of the South African public, {{both in terms of}} educational and socio-economic status. Interest in nature, and use of interpretative services, are shown to be limited by a generally narrow perspective of nature conservation. Interpretative facilities and <b>programmes</b> in the <b>reserves</b> were not found to be structured in a manner whereby the various mediums complemented one another to provoke an holistic consideration of nature and the conservation thereof...|$|R

The effects of tillage on soil loss from erosion and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) change were determined. The No-Till (NT) system had significantly less soil loss from erosion and maintained more SOC than the Mouldboard Plough (MP) and Chisel Plough (CP) tillage systems. The 10 year average maize yields were slightly higher for MP than NT and CP systems {{as a result of a}} significantly higher maize yield in the first year. The 10 year average NT soybean yield was slightly higher than for the MP and CP tillage systems. Crop yields for 10 years maize and 10 years soybean appear to show long-term productivity of NT compared favorably with that of MP and CP tillage systems...|$|R

40|$|China {{will soon}} {{initiate}} its strategic oil <b>reserves</b> <b>programme.</b> This programme {{will be of}} great significance, politically and economically, in offsetting the risks of the world oil market and in guaranteeing the speedy development of China's economy. In the implementation phase of the programme however, large amounts of oil {{will have to be}} imported by sea. While promoting prosperity of the domestic marine transportation sector, this will certainly enhance the risk of environmental pollution in coastal waters. This paper analyses the relationship between strategic reserves, transportation of oil, and the environment of China's coastal waters. In view of the existing problems in the contingency management of China's marine transportation, the paper brings forward ideas and approaches towards building up and improving China's contingency system for marine transport oil spillages. The paper proposes an organisational structure; a coordination and control mechanism; and concrete preventive measures against oil spillage. It draws upon experiences from other countries, while taking into account China's existing marine management system.
