50|$|The report {{suggests}} that non-tariff barriers to economic activity such as <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> <b>licences,</b> long delays in getting approvals from government agencies are {{an incentive to}} proceed with underground economy and hide black money.

Any queries to umer-enquiries@unimelb. edu. auISBN 978 - 0 - 7325 - 1620 - 8 Moving towards spatially enabled societies, {{governments have}} turned to best preserve, develop, allocate and use land, incorporating all interests in land. Generally, land registries contribute to recording the important interests in land such as ownership, land use, covenants, caveats, leases, easements, and mortgages in land parcels (Williamson 2002). At the same time land mapping agencies are responsible for recording land parcel dimensions to identify {{the extent of the}} interests. In a theoretical framework, Bennett et al. (2006) analysed the problem of management of interests in land and classified them into three categories. Firstly, some interests have been poorly designed. They may be unenforceable by authorities or may provide little incentive for those who are supposed to adhere to them. Secondly, some interests are poorly administered. The administration system may offer limited public information access, have slow <b>permit</b> <b>and</b> <b>licence</b> processing times, or might be administered in isolation from other related interests. Finally, some interests do not exist where they ought to exist. In a practical context, the parcel based organization of interests mentioned above encounters two problems: the interests in land are not necessarily limited to those mentioned earlier, and the interests are not necessarily restricted to specific parcels. In other words, the interests in land are diverse and some of the interests can not be defined by boundaries. An efficient technical solution for organizing the growing number of interests in land information systems remains a challenge. The solution suggested in this chapter redefines the relationship between land and interests in the context of modern land administration systems.

25|$|In 1980, the fee was {{increased}} to S$5, but in 1989 it was reduced back to S$3, {{due to the}} fact that now more vehicles were paying. In 1994, two levels of licence fees were established, to differentiate between daily <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> inter-peak <b>licences.</b> The paper licences vary in shape depending on the class of vehicle, and their colours varied from one month to another to deter fraud. The colour-coded licences also made it easier for the enforcement personnel to identify the vehicles during the restricted hours. For reason of traffic management, violating vehicles were not stopped at the gantries, but their number plates were taken down and their owner would receive an order to appear in court to pay the fine. The control was made only at the gantries, therefore, vehicles were free to move around or leave the RZ without having to pay the fee.|$|R

40|$|Overcapacity is {{probably}} the most fundamental challenge to fisheries management as it can lead to both overfishing and to low profitability. Most of the Norwegian fisheries have limited entry, through the use of annual <b>permits</b> (coastal fleet) <b>and</b> <b>licences</b> (ocean going fleet) in combination with individual vessel quotas (IVQ). Limited entry is necessary in order to secure a stable resource basis for the participants. This can also ensure profitability and future investments in the fishing fleet, without using fisheries subsidies. The shares of the overall Norwegian TAC is allocated to different vessel groups, and then distributed between the vessels within the different groups. This allows for several ways of reducing overcapacity, where marked based instruments have aimed at reducing the overall number of operating vessels, while simultaneously protecting the small-scale fleet, maintaining coastal settlements and encompassing regional considerations. The two primary structural instruments that have been employed are decommissioning and various systems for consolidating vessel quotas. In 2007 the current structural system was introduced in the White Paper Norwegian structural policy, which among other alterations put a time limitation on 20 to 25 years on the use of consolidated quotas, and the system was extended to include the vessel group between 11 and 15 meters.
