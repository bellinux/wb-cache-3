40|$|The paper-making {{process can}} produce {{large amounts of}} {{wastewater}} (WW) with high particulate and dissolved organic loads. Generally, in developed countries, stringent international regulations for environmental <b>protection</b> <b>require</b> pulp and paper mill WW to be treated to reduce the organic load prior to discharge into the receiving environment. This {{can be achieved by}} primary and secondary treatments involving both chemical and biological processes. These processes result in complex changes {{in the nature of the}} organic material, as some components are mineralised and others are transformed. In this study, changes in the nature of organics through different stages of secondary treatment of pulp and paper mill WW were followed using three advanced characterisation techniques: solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (py-GCMS) and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Each technique provided a different perspective on the changes that occurred. To compare the different chemical perspectives in terms of the degree of similarity/difference between samples, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling. Results indicate that NMR and HPSEC provided strongly correlated perspectives, with 86 % of the discrimination between the organic samples common to both techniques. Conversely, py-GCMS was found to provide a unique, and thus complementary, perspective. ...|$|E

40|$|Changing climatic {{conditions}} in Germany mainly affect hydromorphic soils formed by groundwater. They offer comparatively high carbon contents and, {{as the only}} soil group, also accumulate C in the subsoil. The assessment of the storage capacity of these soils is essential to assign 'risk areas' according to national (German Federal Soil Protection Act, 1998) and international (EU Soil Protection Strategy, 2006) soil protection requirements. An appropriate water management enables preservation and protection of the soil organic matter in hydromorphic soils. Both aims, {{as a part of}} resource <b>protection,</b> <b>require</b> knowledge of the carbon stock of the soils and the transformation of area restricted results to a regional scale. Assessments comprise of two steps: in the first step, the carbon content of so-called horizon-substrate-combinations (HSC) for profiles of the dominant soil of a soil mapping unit is determined. This method is based on the hypothesis, that comparable soil properties are formed by equal soil substrates and pedogenetic processes. In the second step, the results are assigned to the profiles of the dominant soil of the soil mapping unit and extended to spatial polygons of functional maps. Carbon stock of hydromorphic soils is determined for the federal state Brandenburg, located in the northeast of Germany. Brandenburg is characterised by a percentage of 40...|$|E

40|$|Manned space {{missions}} to Mars require {{consideration of the}} effects of high radiation doses produced by solar particle events (SPE). Without some provision for protection, the radiation doses from such events can exceed standards for maximum exposure and may be life threatening. Several alternative ways of providing <b>protection</b> <b>require</b> a capability for predicting SPE in time to take some protective actions. The SPE may occur {{at any time during the}} eleven year solar cycle so that two year missions cannot be scheduled to insure avoiding them although they are less likely to occur at solar minimum. The present forecasts are sufficiently accurate to use for setting alert modes but are not accurate enough to make yes/no decisions that have major mission operational impacts. Forecasts made for one to two year periods can only be done as probabilistic forecasts where there is a chance of SPE occurring. These are current capabilities but are not likely to change significantly by the year 2000 with the exception of some improvement in the one to ten day forecasts. The effects of SPE are concentrated in solar longitudes near where their parent solar flares occur, which will require a manned Mars mission to carry its own small solar telescope to monitor the development of potentially dangerous solar activity. The preferred telescope complement includes a solar X-ray imager, a hydrogen-alpha scanner, and a solar magnetograph...|$|E
40|$|Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a {{significant}} and potentially expanding problem around the world. Resource management and public health <b>protection</b> <b>require</b> sufficient information to reduce the impacts of HABs by response strategies and through warnings and advisories. To be effective, these programs can best be served by an integration of improved detection methods with both evolving monitoring systems and new communications capabilities. Data sets are typically collected {{from a variety of}} sources, these can be considered as several types: point data, such as water samples; transects, such as from shipboard continuous sampling; and synoptic, such as from satellite imagery. Generation of a field of the HAB distribution requires all of these sampling approaches. This means that the data sets need to be interpreted and analyzed with each other to create the field or distribution of the HAB. The HAB field is also a necessary input into models that forecast blooms. Several systems have developed strategies that demonstrate these approaches. These range from data sets collected at key sites, such as swimming beaches, to automated collection systems, to integration of interpreted satellite data. Improved data collection, particularly in speed and cost, {{will be one of the}} advances of the next few years.

40|$|Background & Objective: In {{the recent}} years, nuclear {{medicine}} has enjoyed remarkable growth thanks to such novel technologies as SPECT-CT and PET, which are utilized for {{the recognition of}} new detectable molecules and radiopharmaceutical medicines. Therefore, the current regulations on radiation <b>protection</b> <b>require</b> revision. Namazi Hospital of Shiraz {{is one of the}} first nuclear medicine centers in Iran. Many patients visit this hospital every year; consequently, radiation protection must be screened and evaluated regularly. Radiation protection in the nuclear medicine department has not been assessed in detail yet, so we sought to conduct the first general radiation protection study. Materials & Methods: The radiation dose in each zone was measured and regulated according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection. To this end, measurements were performed over a three-day period, five times a day. Results: The maximum and minimum doses in the nuclear medicine center in Namazi Hospital were 25 µSv/h and 0. 13 µSv/h, respectively. The maximum dose was measured in the SPECT room next to the patient's bed during infusion. The minimum dose was measured behind the SPECT room wall next to the reception. In terms of quality assessment, there are several major environmental problems such as lack of suitable warning signs and sufficient ventilation; however, the main problem is the absence of routine periodical radiation protection studies. Conclusion: The results of these experiments revealed that the radiation protection in the nuclear department of Namazi Hospital met the international standards...|$|E

40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} epidemics recur due to {{antigenic drift}} of envelope glycoprotein antigens and immune evasion of circulating viruses. Additionally, antigenic shift {{can lead to}} influenza pandemics. Thus, a universal vaccine that protects against multiple influenza virus strains could alleviate the continuing impact of this virus on human health. In mice, accelerated clearance of a new viral strain (cross-protection) can be elicited by prior infection (heterosubtypic immunity) or by immunization with the highly conserved internal nucleoprotein (NP). Both heterosubtypic immunity and NP-immune <b>protection</b> <b>require</b> antibody production. Here, we show that systemic immunization with NP readily accelerated clearance of a 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza virus isolate in an antibody-dependent manner. However, human immunization with trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TIV) only rarely and modestly boosted existing levels of anti-NP IgG. Similar results were observed in mice, although the reaction could be enhanced with adjuvants, by adjusting the stoichiometry among NP and other vaccine components, and by increasing the interval between TIV prime and boost. Importantly, mouse heterosubtypic immunity that had waned over several months could be enhanced by injecting purified anti-NP IgG or by boosting with NP protein, correlating with a long-lived increase in anti-NP antibody titers. Thus, current immunization strategies poorly induce NP-immune antibody that is nonetheless capable of contributing to long-lived cross-protection. The high conservation of NP antigen and the known longevity of antibody responses suggest that the antiviral activity of anti-NP IgG may provide a critically needed component of a universal influenza vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Improvements in {{biological}} {{research and the}} development of new techniques for human health <b>protection</b> <b>require</b> animal experimentation of various species. In particular, animal models are always necessary to test new therapies for the treatment of various human diseases. The latest advances in molecular biology involving genetic modification are aimed at developing new animal models of human diseases that are not present in spontaneous murine broods or obtainable with other experimental manipulations. Transgenic techniques and, in particular, the possibility to directly modify specific genetic information in the experimental animal have led to the acquisition of important knowledge on the physiologic functions of many proteins and their function in the course of various diseases. The advent of new transgenic animals is opening up new and interesting frontiers, full of hope and opportunity, for the research into pulmonary diseases. New advances in cystic fibrosis, emphysema, and pulmonary fibrosis have been made through the study {{of a large number of}} proteins implicated in the complex of acute and chronic inflammatory processes of lung parenchyma, which are responsible for permanent changes in organ structure and function. Recent studies carried out on murine inbred strains have yielded significant new data on the multifactor origin of pulmonary disease, because of their correlation with the major histocompatibility complex (H 2 in mice) or through the different genetic map of the strains. Today it is possible to outweigh or potentiate the function and expression of some genes, obtaining a deficit or abundance, respectively, of specific proteins. These techniques have permitted and will continue to permit the development of new models of human disease, leading to further therapeutic advances as a consequence...|$|E
40|$|It is an {{integral}} part of rights protection that "adequate" remedies exist. This thesis examines the present functioning of human rights legislations in Canada and articulates fundamental problems with the current Canadian regimes in the enforcement of rights against private actors. The possibility of using tort action as an alternative in the protection of human rights in Canada is then discussed, with particular attention given to the potential for increased damage awards and for wider grounds of prohibition of discriminatory practices. The thesis revisits the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Bhadauria v. Seneca College and anaylzes the basis on which human rights legislation was seen as a creating barrier to a collateral tort action. In contrast with the decision in Bhadauria, the thesis concludes that the present state of tort law is capable of handling this new category of compensable damage. It is further suggested that the realities of human rights <b>protection</b> <b>require</b> reconsideration of alternatives to the present schemes in order to give effect to "adequate" remedies. Drawing on the philosophy of A. J. M. Milne, the thesis addresses the role of judiciary as actively protecting the rights rather than simply enforcing what already exists. Referring specifically to a nominate tort of discrimination, the thesis provides a framework for the consideration of such a tort, relying on a standard of care equivalent to "negligence" in which the private actor has failed to live up to a universal or "community" standard of reasonable behaviour. In part, because any group can narrowly focus and prioritize issues and concerns that are of primary importance to them as a group, this "community" can not be a localized body. A well functioning "community", instead, is characterized as utilizing and applying universal standards and principles such the principle to fair treatment. This principle entails that there be a "sufficient connection" between the ground of distinction and and the treatment involved. These become the standard by which the private actor is to be judged...|$|E
