30|$|One problem {{encountered}} with integral imaging is the <b>pseudoscopic</b> <b>effect</b> of the 3 D {{reconstructed image}} when the captured elemental images used for display {{do not receive}} pre-processing. There is no direct relationship between the viewing angle and the <b>pseudoscopic</b> <b>effect,</b> and this paper cannot eliminate the <b>pseudoscopic</b> <b>effect.</b> Moreover, the imaging depth of integral imaging is different in real/virtual display mode and focused display mode, which {{is determined by the}} light wavelength, object distance, and the size of each lenslet [22]. Thus, the method proposed does not affect the imaging depth.|$|E
30|$|Integral imaging, {{proposed}} by Lippman in 1908, is a promising three-dimensional (3 D) technique for its full-parallax, continuous-viewing 3 D images {{and without any}} special glasses [1 – 3]. Integral imaging uses lens array to collect and reproduce the light field of the three-dimensional scene, affording full color, full parallax and quasi-continuous viewing points within the viewing angle, working with incoherent light and can be viewed with the naked eye. Despite its many advantages, integral imaging suffers from the inherent drawbacks such as <b>pseudoscopic</b> <b>effect</b> [4], limited viewing angle [5 – 10], low viewing resolution [11 – 15] and small image depth [16, 17]. Focusing on the improvement method of field of view, the researchers have proposed a variety of solutions.|$|E
