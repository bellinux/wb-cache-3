40|$|Green tea is a {{beverage}} {{that contributes}} to good health. Consumers gain nutritional benefits from the antioxidant propeliies associated with the chemical composition of a green tea infusion. Although, once prepared the quality of tea may deteriorate during storage as the infusion's chemical composition is altered. This research investigated the degradation of some polyphenol catechin compounds in Lipton ® green tea with and without added fmit juice. The analytes of interest ine 1 uded gallic acid, caffeine and some green tea catechins: epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate. Lipton ® green tea samples were prepared in triplicate according to <b>package</b> <b>directions,</b> stored for 6 days at 25 °C in a water bath and shaken uncovered at 60 revolutions per minute. The analytes were measured every 24 hours 3 using reverse-phase high perfonnance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with gradient elution and a photodiode array detector. During storage epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate appeared to be enzymatically hydrolyzed releasing gallic acid, epicatechin and epigallocatechin. Aerobi...|$|E

This study aimed to assess the {{health literacy}} skills of parents and caregivers of preschool-aged children, using a progressive scenario describing a child with fever and presenting tasks relating to selection of a medicine and hypothetical dosing of their child. Participants (n = 417) from 33 childcare- and health-related sites in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Auckland completed the study. Participants' responses were largely appropriate regarding actions in response to worsening symptoms, selection of an appropriate product (from a limited range), whereby 84. 5 % of responses were for a single-ingredient paracetamol product and use of the <b>package</b> <b>directions</b> to state the frequency of dosing (93. 1 % of frequencies appropriate for paracetamol and 66. 7 % for ibuprofen). However, in only 50. 8 % of cases was an appropriate weight-based dose calculated, and doses were not measured to within 10 % of the stated dose in 16. 7 % of cases. Future studies should focus on skill development via educational campaigns for parents and caregivers. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: The present review {{provides}} an overview of insect pest species associated with packaged-food products, potential mechanisms leading to infestation of packaged products, and strategies to prevent such infestation. Findings: There are two possible reasons that may explain the presence of insects in packaged products: (1) insects are present in the product before packaging, or (2) insects invaded the product after packaging from already existing openings or from insects creating an entry point. Control strategies include the correct identification of the species found in the packaged product, mechanical or thermal methods for eliminating infestations in raw and processed products, use of repellents or insecticides outside packages, and application of modified or controlled atmospheres inside <b>packages.</b> <b>Directions</b> for future research: Further research is required on the above topics focusing on all stages of food manufacture and distribution for successful prevention of insect presence in packaged products. © 2011 Stewart Postharvest Solutions (UK) Ltd...|$|R

Super critical water offers a relatively simple route which is inherently scaleable and chemically benign.

40|$|Abstract The {{grouping}} of correlated classes into a package helps in better organization of modern object-oriented software. The quality of such packages {{needs to be}} measured so as to estimate their utilization. In this paper, new package coupling metrics are proposed, which also {{take into consideration the}} hierarchical structure of <b>packages</b> and <b>direction</b> of connections among package elements. The proposed measures have been validated theoretically as well as empirically using 18 packages taken from two open source software systems. The results obtained from this study show strong correlation between package coupling and understandability of the package which suggests that proposed metrics could be further used to represent other external software quality factors...|$|R

5000|$|Droid is a 1988 direct {{to video}} science fiction film. Its origins are {{intentionally}} obscured on its <b>packaging,</b> crediting <b>direction</b> {{of the film}} to [...] "British director Peter Williams" [...] and the starring roles of Taylor to [...] "Kevin Jean" [...] and his ex-wife Nicola to [...] "Raquel Rios" [...] on the front cover and Rebecca Lynn on the back cover. The end credits reveal that these roles are played by Greg Derek and Krista Lane. The film is, in fact, an edited version of a hardcore pornographic film called Cabaret Sin (originally released July 1, 1987) marketed to a science fiction audience, and its director is actually Philip O'Toole, from a screenplay with Nacada O'Toole and Christopher Saint. The film was released on VHS by Even Steven Productions and bore a stamped decal warning of sexual situations, nudity, violence, and adult language, although the film has no MPAA rating. The storyline is an imitation of Blade Runner, while one character is blatantly modeled on Anthony Daniels as C-3PO. The executive producer is Kirdy Stevens.|$|R
50|$|Nicotine {{toxicity}} is {{of concern}} when e-cigarette solutions are swallowed intentionally by adults as a suicidal overdose. Six people attempted suicide by injecting e-liquid. One adolescent attempted suicide by swallowing the e-liquid. Three deaths {{were reported to have}} resulted from swallowing or injecting e-liquid containing nicotine. An excessive amount of nicotine for an adult that is capable of being fatal is 0.5-1 mg/kg of body weight. An oral lethal dose for adults is about 30-60 mg. However the widely used human LD50 estimate of around 0.8 mg/kg was questioned in a 2013 review, in light of several documented cases of humans surviving much higher doses; the 2013 review suggests that the lower limit resulting in fatal events is 500-1000 mg of ingested nicotine, which is equivalent to 6.5-13 mg/kg orally. Reports of serious adverse effects associated with acute nicotine toxicity that resulting in hospitalization were very uncommon. Death from intentional nicotine poisoning is very uncommon. Clear labeling of devices and e-liquid could reduce unintentional exposures. Child-proof <b>packaging</b> and <b>directions</b> for safe handling of e-liquids could minimize some of the risks. In January 2016, the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015 was passed into law in the US, which requires child-proof packaging.|$|R
