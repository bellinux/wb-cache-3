5|$|Historically, the {{terrestrial}} locomotion of Pteranodon, especially {{whether it was}} bipedal or quadrupedal, {{has been the subject}} of debate. Today, most <b>pterosaur</b> researchers agree that pterosaurs were quadrupedal, thanks largely to the discovery of <b>pterosaur</b> trackways.|$|E
5|$|More {{recent studies}} on basal <b>pterosaur</b> hindlimb {{morphology}} seem to vindicate {{a connection to}} Scleromochlus. Like this archosaur, basal <b>pterosaur</b> lineages have plantigrade hindlimbs that show adaptations for saltation.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared {{the sky with}} the giant-crested <b>pterosaur</b> Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, which was a very common species, Nyctosaurus was rare, making up only 3% of <b>pterosaur</b> fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early toothed bird, Ichthyornis.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of pycnofibers (and {{the demands of}} flight) imply that pterosaurs were endothermic (warm-blooded). The absence of pycnofibers on <b>pterosaur</b> wings suggests that the coat {{did not have an}} aerodynamic function, lending support to the idea that pycnofibers evolved to aid <b>pterosaur</b> thermoregulation, as is common in warm-blooded animals, insulation being necessary to conserve the heat created by an endothermic metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about <b>pterosaur</b> reproduction, and <b>pterosaur</b> eggs are very rare. The first known <b>pterosaur</b> egg was found in the {{quarries}} of Liaoning, the same place that yielded feathered dinosaurs. The egg was squashed flat with no signs of cracking, so evidently the eggs had leathery shells, as in modern lizards. This was supported by the description of an additional <b>pterosaur</b> egg belonging to the genus Darwinopterus, described in 2011, which also had a leathery shell and, also like modern reptiles but unlike birds, was fairly small compared {{to the size of the}} mother. In 2014 five unflattened eggs from the species Hamipterus tianshanensis were found in an Early Cretaceous deposit in northwest China. Examination of the shells by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of a thin calcareous eggshell layer with a membrane underneath. A study of <b>pterosaur</b> eggshell structure and chemistry published in 2007 indicated that it is likely pterosaurs buried their eggs, like modern crocodiles and turtles. Egg-burying would have been beneficial to the early evolution of pterosaurs, as it allows for more weight-reducing adaptations, but this method of reproduction would also have put limits on the variety of environments pterosaurs could live in, and may have disadvantaged them when they began to face ecological competition from birds.|$|E
40|$|The {{taxonomy}} and locomotory {{methods of}} <b>pterosaurs</b> have been extensively scrutinised {{for as long}} as <b>pterosaurs</b> themselves have been known, but comparatively little research has been conducted into their lifestyles and habits. <b>Pterosaurs</b> have largely been interpreted as Mesozoic equivalents of modem marine birds, principally foraging through flight-based methods of dip- or skim-feeding. Here, several lines of enquiry suggest that <b>pterosaurs</b> were considerably more;ologically diverse that previously anticipated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5|$|At {{least some}} non-pterodactylod pterosaurs survived into the Late Cretaceous, {{postulating}} a lazarus taxa situation for late Cretaceous <b>pterosaur</b> faunas.|$|E
5|$|One {{family of}} pterosaurs, Azhdarchidae, was {{definitely}} {{present in the}} Maastrichtian, and it likely became extinct at the Kâ€“Pg boundary. These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during the mid-Cretaceous. Several other <b>pterosaur</b> lineages may have been present during the Maastrichtian, such as the ornithocheirids, pteranodontids, nyctosaurids, as well as, a possible tapejarid, though they are represented by fragmentary remains {{that are difficult to}} assign to any given group. While this was occurring, modern birds were undergoing diversification; traditionally it was thought that they replaced archaic birds and <b>pterosaur</b> groups, possibly due to direct competition, or they simply filled empty niches, but there is no correlation between <b>pterosaur</b> and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis, and small pterosaurs were present in the Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|An X-ray {{study of}} <b>pterosaur</b> brain {{cavities}} {{revealed that the}} animals (Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Anhanguera santanae) had massive flocculi. The flocculus is a brain region that integrates signals from joints, muscles, skin and balance organs.|$|E
25|$|Peter Wellnhofer {{published}} The Illustrated Encyclopedia of <b>Pterosaurs.</b> Wellnhofer's {{book was}} only the second serious book about <b>pterosaurs</b> ever published. In it, he argued that Othniel Charles Marsh was correct to reconstruct the tail vane of Rhamphorhynchus with a vertical orientation based on its asymmetry and also provided additional evidence for this orientation based on the shape of its tail vertebrae. Wellnhofer also observed that <b>pterosaurs</b> had large, birdlike brains. Wellnhofer also argued in favor of quadrupedal <b>pterosaurs.</b>|$|R

40|$|Patterns of postcranial {{skeletal}} pneumatization (PSP) {{indicate that}} <b>pterosaurs</b> possessed {{components of a}} bird-like respiratory system, including a series of ventilatory air-sacs. However, the presence of PSP in the oldest known <b>pterosaurs</b> has not been unambiguously demonstrated by previous studies. Here we provide the first unequivocal documentation of PSP in Late Triassic and earliest Jurassic <b>pterosaurs.</b> This demonstrates that PSP and, by inference, air-sacs were probably present in the common ancestor of almost all known <b>pterosaurs,</b> and has broader implications {{for the evolution of}} respiratory systems in bird-line archosaurs, including dinosaurs...|$|R
5|$|It was {{the first}} <b>pterosaur</b> {{skeleton}} found outside Germany, and it created a public sensation when displayed at the British Museum. In December 1829 she found a fossil fish, Squaloraja, which attracted attention because it had characteristics intermediate between sharks and rays.|$|E
5|$|One Velociratoptor mongoliensis skull bears two {{parallel}} rows of small punctures that match the spacing {{and size of}} Velociraptor teeth. Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another Velociraptor during a fight. Further, because the fossil bone {{shows no sign of}} healing near the bite wounds, the injury probably killed it. Another specimen, found with the bones of an azhdarchid <b>pterosaur</b> within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs. From evidence on the <b>pterosaur</b> bones, which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion, the Velociraptor died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury.|$|E

25|$|Georg Wagler {{argued that}} <b>pterosaurs</b> {{represented}} a distinct class of aquatic vertebrates {{that he called}} Gryphi. Like Collini, Wagler thought that <b>pterosaurs</b> swam underwater using their forelimbs as flippers.|$|R

25|$|<b>Pterosaurs</b> (flying). <b>Pterosaurs</b> {{were the}} first flying vertebrates, and are {{generally}} agreed to have been sophisticated flyers. They had large wings formed by a patagium stretching from the torso to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. There were hundreds of species, {{most of which are}} thought to have been intermittent flappers, and many soarers. The largest known flying animals are <b>pterosaurs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Similarly, the extinct <b>pterosaur</b> {{also shows}} an {{independent}} evolution of vertebrate fore- and hindlimbs to wing. An even more distantly related group, the insects, have wings that evolved separately from different organs.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} argument among paleontologists {{about whether the}} main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) attached to the hind limbs, and if so, where. Fossils of the rhamphorhynchoid Sordes, the anurognathid Jeholopterus, and a pterodactyloid from the Santana Formation seem {{to demonstrate that the}} wing membrane did attach to the hindlimbs, at least in some species. However, modern bats and flying squirrels show considerable variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of <b>pterosaur</b> had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of <b>pterosaur</b> limb proportions shows that there was considerable variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>pterosaur</b> anatomy {{has been}} so heavily {{modified}} for flight, and immediate transitional fossil predecessors have not so far been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E
500|$|Like the dinosaurs, {{and unlike}} these other reptiles, <b>pterosaurs</b> are {{more closely related}} to birds than to {{crocodiles}} or any other living reptile. <b>Pterosaurs</b> are also colloquially referred to as pterodactyls, particularly in fiction and by journalists.

50|$|His popular book on <b>Pterosaurs,</b> Dragons of the Air (1901), {{found that}} the {{development}} of birds and <b>pterosaurs</b> paralleled each other. His belief that they had a common origin has been proved, for both are archosaurs, just not as close as he thought. He upset Richard Owen's characterization of the <b>pterosaurs</b> as cold-blooded, sluggish gliders, and recognized them as warm-blooded active fliers.|$|R

5|$|Because the key {{distinguishing}} characteristic Marsh {{noted for}} Pteranodon was {{its lack of}} teeth, any toothless <b>pterosaur</b> jaw fragment, wherever it {{was found in the}} world, tended to be attributed to Pteranodon during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. This resulted in a plethora of species and a great deal of confusion. The name became a wastebasket taxon, rather like the dinosaur Megalosaurus, to label any <b>pterosaur</b> remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence of teeth. Species (often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters) have been reclassified a number of times, and several subgenera have in the 1970s been erected by Halsey Wilkinson Miller to hold them in various combinations, further confusing the taxonomy (subgenera include Longicepia, Occidentalia, and Geosternbergia). Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of Pteranodon include Bennett, Padian, Unwin, Kellner, and Wellnhofer. Two species, P. orogensis and P. orientalis, are not pteranodontids and have been renamed Bennettazhia oregonensis and Bogolubovia orientalis respectively.|$|E
5|$|Mary Anning (1799â€“1847) {{lived in}} Lyme Regis and {{followed}} in her father's footsteps as a collector.

5|$|Most <b>pterosaur</b> skulls had {{elongated}} jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{almost all}} <b>pterosaurs</b> {{were seen as}} surface-feeding piscivores, a view that still dominates popular culture. In reality, however, the {{majority}} of <b>pterosaurs</b> are now {{thought to have been}} terrestrial carnivores or insectivores.|$|R
5|$|The {{relative}} size of {{the hands}} and feet in <b>pterosaurs</b> (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle <b>pterosaurs</b> led on the ground. Azhdarchid <b>pterosaurs</b> had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg length, with foot length only about 25%â€“30% {{the length of the}} lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively solid ground. Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% the length of the tibia), while filter-feeding <b>pterosaurs</b> like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|R
