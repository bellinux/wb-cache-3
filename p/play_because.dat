5|$|In {{contrast}} to the novella, in which the physical transformation of Jekyll into Hyde is revealed near the end, most dramatic adaptations show it early in the <b>play,</b> <b>because</b> the audience {{is familiar with the}} story. As one of its first adapters, Sullivan worked in an environment where the transformation would still shock the audience, and he held the reveal until the third act.|$|E
5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest {{that the lack of}} female companionship for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder to apply to the <b>play</b> <b>because</b> of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during <b>play</b> <b>because</b> numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E

5|$|At the {{testimonial}} dinner, Heikkinen’s six-year-old brother, Donald Heikkinen, {{was asked}} to name the greatest football {{player in the world}} and responded, “Ralph.” Donald offered that Ralph was best because he used “proper technique,” and found it difficult to choose his older brother’s greatest <b>play</b> <b>because</b> “there were so many of them.” Referring to the Ohio State game, Donald noted, “Ralph crushed through and smeared ‘em.” Heikkinen, or “Hike” as he was known to Yoopers, was presented with a purse of $36 representing the No. 36 he wore for Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2009 International Bowl following a 7–5 regular season where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No.12 and undefeated Ball State in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from the university to be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two African-American members of the team {{would not be allowed to}} <b>play</b> <b>because</b> of segregation, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50years later.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{also participated}} in the first {{integrated}} bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt {{should be allowed to}} <b>play</b> <b>because</b> he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.|$|E

5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} <b>play.</b> <b>Because</b> the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E
5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the <b>play.</b> <b>Because</b> {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
5|$|England {{currently}} {{hold the}} trophy. They held the trophy for nine years, after beating the West Indies 3–1 to regain it in 2000; they successfully defended the trophy three times. West Indies regained the trophy in the 2009 {{series in the}} West Indies, winning 1–0. It was originally planned to consist of four Test matches. However an extra match was arranged when the second Test had to be abandoned {{after only a few}} overs <b>play</b> <b>because</b> the ground was unfit. England regained the trophy in May 2009, winning a two Test series 2–0. The tour, coming uncommonly soon after England toured the West Indies, replaced the previously announced tour by Sri Lanka, which in turn was arranged to replace the originally scheduled tour by Zimbabwe.. Since then England have held onto the trophy up to and including the 2017 series in England, which they won to retain the Trophy.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his four}} {{consecutive}} championships with Simeon, Parker (and Chicago's Simeon) {{were compared to}} McClain (and Peoria's Manual). Peoria's Journal Star emphasized that McClain was 32–0 as a starter in IHSA <b>play</b> <b>because</b> in the 1994–97 time period the IHSA was only divided into two classes. Thus, Manual had to wade through an 8-round tournament instead of the 7-round modern 4-class format. However, Simeon won 6 of its 7 games in its final championship by more than 10 points, while Manual only won 3 of its 8 by such a margin. In the postgame press conference, Simeon Coach Smith emphasized that his team had to endure the pressure of playing a national schedule that included games against elite teams in distant venues. Note, that with the 4-class system rather than the 2-class system of the past, the 2013 Class 3A IHSA champion was CPL runner-up Morgan Park, who split 2 neutral court 2013 games with Simeon. As noted above, Rose-era Simeon teams only won 2 championships in the 2-class era. Adding Parker's 55-11 start to a 33–1 junior year and a 30–3 senior season gives him a 118–15 legacy compared to Rose's 120–12.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, {{there was}} a full reading of the one-act version of the play. Despite an {{unfinished}} script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate of Burnt Thicket Theatre, asked to read the script of She Has a Name, and later {{said he could not}} put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the <b>play</b> <b>because</b> of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play with an extra hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company.|$|E

He signed a contract with the Avalanche before the 2006–07 NHL season, scored 78 points in 82 games in his rookie season and was nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy. In 2007–08 he was named to his first NHL All-Star Game, but didn't <b>play</b> <b>because</b> of an appendectomy. As a dual citizen, Stastny has chosen to play for the U.S. in international hockey competitions, which have included the 2004 Viking Cup, the 2007 IIHF World Championship, and the 2010, 2014 Winter Olympics.|$|E

25|$|Bowling a yorker {{requires}} {{pinpoint accuracy}} since bowling it slightly too long {{will result in}} a full toss or full pitched delivery that is easy for the batsman to <b>play</b> <b>because</b> the ball has not deviated by bouncing off the pitch.
