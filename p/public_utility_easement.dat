It is opinioned sic that upon the relinquishment of the [...] "City's Interests only", in these [...] "patent roadway easements", that these roadway and <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>easements,</b> now revert back to [...] "private roadway easements".We believe, if approved, this legal action taken by the Scottsdale City Council, with this recorded abandonment Resolution, [...] "will now 'exclude' the public" [...] from the [...] "use of these now private roadways".

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee. Both the {{calculation}} and allocation of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee for certain areas are analysed. The <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation, {{which is in}} accordance with the ordinance on equipping the building plots in areas of the municipal spatial plan of the Municipality of Kamnik (example 1), is presented within the thesis. The actual costs of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping which are based on the physical indicators of the ordinance on the equipping programme and the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee following the instruction for the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation (Official Gazette No. 4 / 99) are both calculated and strictly comply with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution (example 2). Activities in the areas of municipal elaborated spatial plans show different consumption of potable water, therefore, based on an assumption on potable water consumption in <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, we have calculated the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee according to estimated or actual potable water consumption (example 3). We have determined that the existing calculation and distribution of the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee method and distribution of the urban contribution (example 1) complies the least with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution. The results in the other two examples are similar, since both take into account the principle of contribution and counter - contribution, as demonstrated by the structural fractions of the distributed <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee among taxpayers. ...|$|R
