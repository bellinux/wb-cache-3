40|$|In fiber-reinforced polymer <b>pressure-retaining</b> structures, such as {{pipes and}} vessels, micro-level failure {{commonly}} causes fluid permeation due to matrix cracking. This study explores {{the effect of}} nano-reinforcements on matrix cracking in filament-wound basalt fiber/epoxy composite structures. The microstructure and mechanical properties of bulk epoxy nanocomposites and hybrid fiber-reinforced composite pipes modified with acrylic tri-block-copolymer and organophilic layered silicate clay were investigated. In cured epoxy, the tri-block-copolymer phase separated into disordered spherical micelle inclusions; an exfoliated and intercalated structure was observed for the nano-clay. Block-copolymer addition significantly enhanced epoxy fracture toughness by a mechanism of particle cavitation and matrix shear yielding, whereas toughness remained unchanged in nano-clay filled nanocomposites due to the occurrence of lower energy resistance phenomena such as crack deflection and branching. Tensile stiffness increased with nano-clay content, while it decreased slightly for block-copolymer modified epoxy. Composite pipes modified with either the organic and inorganic nanoparticles exhibited moderate improvements in leakage failure strain (i. e. matrix cracking strain); however, reductions in functional and structural failure strength were observed...|$|E

40|$|Deep subseafloor sediments {{may contain}} depressurization-sensitive, anaerobic, piezophilic prokaryotes. To test this we {{developed}} the DeepIsoBUG system, which when {{coupled with the}} HYACINTH <b>pressure-retaining</b> drilling and core storage system and the PRESS core cutting and processing system, enables deep sediments to be handled without depressurization (up to 25 MPa) and anaerobic prokaryotic enrichments and isolation to be conducted up to 100 MPa.

40|$|Corrosion {{resistant}} alloys (CRAs) used in subsea <b>pressure-retaining</b> components must {{be compatible}} with production fluids and resistant to pitting and crevice corrosion in seawater. Whereas materials selection in production environments is governed by well-established international standards such as ISO 15156, much debate still exists as of how to determine the seawater localized corrosion resistance of higher grade CRAs such as duplex super duplex stainless steels (DSS and SDSS, respectively). While most industry specifications rely on the ASTM G 48 standard to determine localized corrosion resistance, for duplex and super-duplex stainless steels {{there is no consensus}} on surface finish prior testing (e. g. polishing or pickling) and test temperature (e. g. 50 &# 176;C in NORSOK 630 versus 40 &# 176;C in ASTM A 923). Moreover, it is unclear whether existing procedures are sensitive enough to determine the onset of deleterious phases such as &# 963;-phase and chromium nitrides. The objective of this investigation was to quantify the seawater pitting corrosion resistance of a type 25 Cr SDSS (UNS S 32750) and its correlation with microstructure and surface finish before testing. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) testing was used to determine the effect &# 963;-phase on the corrosion response of the system. CPP results were then compared against industry standard practices based on the ASTM G 48 Method A test. In addition, CPP tests were conducted at various temperatures, ranging from 25 to 90 &# 176;C, to determine the effect of deleterious phases on critical pitting temperature (CPT) and overall localized corrosion resistance. The results from this project indicate that the Critical Pitting temperature for standard solution annealed Super Duplex Stainless Steel is 60 - 70 &# 176;C. It is also shown that the corrosion resistance is reduced for material that contains sigma phase showing a Critical Pitting Temperature of 40 - 50 &# 176;C. The surface treatments seem to have less effect on the values, but pickled surfaces gave a more repeatable result. </p...|$|E
