40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theoretical framework}} to explain why governments seek restrictions on IPR protection and allow R&D subsidies through multilateral trade agreements such as the TRIPS Agreement and the Agreement on Subsidies and <b>Countervailing</b> <b>Measures.</b> After 7 years of discussion, the Uruguay Round extends GATT’s trade-liberalizing philosophy to worldwide use of subsidies as a secondary means to intervene in international trade. Through the Agreement on Subsidies and <b>Countervailing</b> <b>Measures</b> the WTO tries to preserve one of basic principles of GATT’s philosophy: Fair Competition. The principle of Fair Competition is of particular importance in understanding the WTO. To harness GATT’s trade liberalizing philosophy, the WTO as a successor of GATT takes this principle as objectives that are pursued through the enforcement and implementation of other principles, for instance the nondiscrimination and reciprocity. As {{an example of the}} fair competition principle, the WTO prohibited any type of export subsidies through the Agreement on Subsidies and <b>Countervailing</b> <b>Measures,</b> but allowed R&D subsidies. The allowance of R&D subsidies by the WTO is a puzzle because {{it is well known that}} R&D subsidization forms the prisoners’ dilemma when governments are active to set R&D policy. In order to find any reasonable logic to explain this puzzle, we focus on the interaction between strategic trade policy tools: R&D subsidization and IPR protection. Indeed, at an international level IPR protection has been a major focus of negotiations along with R&D subsidies. The WTO also requires member countries to strongly enforce patent protection through the TRIPS Agreement. In our analysis, it turns out that it is globally optimal to perfectly disseminate knowledge without IPR protection and to subsidize inventive firms by solving a problem that the weak IPR protection damages firms’ incentive to invest in R&D activities. However, current trade agreements do not match with our global optimum. We show that exporting countries may benefit – at the expense of importers – from a trade agreement to demand stronger enforcement on IPR protection because exporting countries experience the prisoner’s dilemma problem when both countries free ride on the rival firm’s R&D outcome. Therefore we conclude that it is possible to understand the TRIPS Agreement as an inefficient victory of the interests of northern exporting countries over those of southern importing countries.

40|$|Until the {{creation}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the international community had no formal definition of subsidies. The passing of the Subsidies and <b>Countervailing</b> <b>Measures</b> (SCM) Agreement by the WTO created a formal definition of a subsidy, as well as providing a formal dispute settlement process to resolve subsidy conflicts for the first time. Known as multilateral disciplines, the SCM Agreement outlined rules for the use of subsidies, including what subsidies are prohibited and allowed, how to challenge the use of subsidies, and creates rules regarding the use of <b>countervailing</b> <b>measures.</b> All members of the WTO automatically become parties to the SCM Agreement with the single undertaking clause upon WTO membership. General Background Key to any discussions is the definition of a subsidy. According to the SCM Agreement, a subsidy is (a) a financial contribution (b) by a government or any public body (c) which confers a benefit. This definition can be easily broken down into three parts and all three parts must be present for the action to be a subsidy. First, only actions that are taken in the form of financial contributions or forms of income or price support can apply. This includes measures such as the direct transfer of funds to...|$|R

40|$|There are {{competing}} demands for fresh water. Farms look {{to it as}} an irrigation source, cities rely on it for drinking water, and fisheries (and fishermen) depend on it for instream flow. When the United States Bureau of Reclamation (“Reclamation”) subsidizes the costs of providing fresh water for irrigation in agricultural production, such subsidization can result in tiered water pricing. With tiered pricing, farms pay the government less per unit than other water users. This tiered pricing can distort the water marketplace {{in a manner that}} encourages wasteful irrigation practices and leaves insufficient water instream for fisheries. The dispute over Reclamation irrigation subsidies may now be moving from the domestic to the international arena. The 1994 World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and <b>Countervailing</b> <b>Measures</b> (“WTO Subsidies Agreement”) provides that one WTO member country may impose <b>countervailing</b> <b>measures</b> against another WTO member country that makes a “financial contribution” that is specific to “certain enterprises. ” The WTO Subsidies Agreement further provides that “government revenue... otherwise due [that] is forgone” can qualify as a “financial contribution” and that governments must be paid “adequate remuneration” for goods provided.

40|$|Currently, the {{subsidies}} {{are one of}} the main sources of restrictions in international trade, and a disturbance factor of liberalization process in that field, which is particularly emphasized in the times of economic crises. Due to its economic impact, such behavior causes unavoidably the implementation of <b>countervailing</b> <b>measures.</b> However, as its extensive use has the potential to turn them into the instrument of protectionism, it is necessary to deploy the appropriate legal rules in order to determine precisely the conditions and regime for the use of such subsidies, as well as the implementation of <b>countervailing</b> <b>measures</b> in the case of violation of that regime. The processes of liberalization of our foreign trade system and constant foreign trade deficit make the need for protection of our own economy and creating of appropriate set of defense instruments against non-permitted/illegal subsidies in our law more and more relevant. The reply to that need in new economic circumstances was the enactment of a new Law on Foreign Trade Operations in 2009 and, in particular the enactment of the accompanying bylaws. Its rules in the field of subsidies have been largely harmonized with the requirements of the World Trade Organizations, and consequently with the European Union standards, in both the conceptual aspect and aspect of individual solutions.
