5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{clippers}} can be utilized {{to achieve a}} regular haircut: taper clippers, rotary clippers and outliner/edger clippers. Taper clippers are powered by a linear or <b>pivot</b> <b>motor.</b> The blades are not readily interchangeable. The taper lever allows adjustment of the cutting length within a certain range, usually from #000 blade length, 1/50" [...] (0.5 mm) on the fine side to #1 length, 3/32" [...] (2.4 mm) on the coarse side. For longer lengths, clipper guards are attached. The guard will cut at the numbered guard length when the taper lever is in the shortest cutting position. Clipper guards are also known as clipper guide combs. Fade clippers are identical to taper clippers {{with the exception of}} the range of cutting lengths which is entirely within the fine blade range. Most fade clippers cut between #00000 blade length, 1/125" [...] (0.2 mm) and #000 blade length, 1/50" [...] (0.5 mm). As with regular taper clippers, clipper guards can be attached for longer cutting lengths.|$|R

Here, {{we consider the}} inverse effect in which a transport current drives a periodic variation of an adiabatic degree of freedom. This provides a general operating principle for adiabatic quantum motors which we discuss here in general terms. We relate the work performed per cycle on the motor degree of freedom to characteristics of the underlying quantum pump and discuss the motors’ efficiency. Quantum <b>motors</b> <b>based</b> on chaotic quantum dots operate solely due to quantum interference, and <b>motors</b> <b>based</b> on Thouless pumps have ideal efficiency...|$|R
