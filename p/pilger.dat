5|$|Andy Harries {{was born}} in Inverness, Scotland on 7 April 1954 {{and grew up in}} Peterborough, England, {{receiving}} primary education at West Town Primary School until 1961, and secondary education at the public Oakham School. He grew up aspiring to be a war correspondent in Vietnam, or an investigative journalist; his idols were Harold Evans, Jon Swain and John <b>Pilger.</b> He left college at the age of 17 with poor A Level results and became a trainee reporter on the Peterborough Evening Telegraph newspaper. His time on the newspaper raised his awareness of politics, and he sought to further his understanding of it by studying at university. He applied to various northern universities to break away from his southern middle-class lifestyle, and was accepted at Hull University.|$|E

40|$|Cold <b>pilgering</b> is a {{challenging}} tube forming process {{in terms of}} modeling due to the complexity in kinematic of tools, friction condition and material behavior. The process development has mostly been based on simple formulas and costly full-scale tryouts. The aim {{in this study is}} to develop validated Finite element models of cold <b>pilgering</b> to increase the understanding of influence of the process parameters on the produced tubes. In the course of this thesis, three-dimensional mechanical and thermo-mechanical Finite element models of cold <b>pilgering</b> were developed. The commercial code MSC. Marc was used in the simulations. General 3 D models are needed to be able to capture asymmetric deformation in cold <b>pilgering.</b> It was found that tool deflections together with elastic deformation of roll dies have considerable influence on the rolling force. Furthermore, the strain rate and temperature effects on the response of the material and thereby on the rolling force were evaluated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pilgering</b> is {{a complex}} {{incremental}} manufacturing process for seamless tubes. In this work, a miniature physical simulator for <b>pilgering</b> was designed and fabricated. This miniature simulator employs a grooved roll-die and a mandrel and can impose controlled reductions in both tube diameter and wall thickness. <b>Pilgering</b> deformation over a range of ratios of reductions in wall thickness and in tube diameter, known as the Q-factor, was imposed on hemi-cylindrical zirconium alloy specimens. The influence of the Q-factor on the microstructure and deformation texture of the deformed specimens was quantified. A polycrystal plasticity calculation based on the binary tree model was used to simulate texture evolution during the simulated <b>pilgering</b> process. The computer model quantitatively captured the variation with Q of the Kearns factors, as measured in the physically simulated specimen. The small differences noticed between the predicted and experimental final textures point to unaccounted transverse components of the flow field. These observations suggest that physical and/or computer simulations can {{form the basis of}} a rapid methodology for tool selection to realize prescribed post-pilgering textures.

The Daily Mirror then adopted a more critical stance, and journalist John <b>Pilger</b> published several articles on the violence directed against strike-breakers.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of microstructure and crystallographic texture with effective strain at three through-thickness locations (near rolls, center, and near mandrel) in a partly <b>pilgered</b> Zircaloy- 4 tube is described. <b>Pilgering</b> {{is found to}} eliminate through-thickness variation in grain size in the starting hot-extruded material and to generate location-dependent asymmetries in crystallographic texture. Deformation texture development during <b>pilgering</b> is modeled with polycrystal plasticity by idealizing the metal flow pattern as axisymmetric flow through a convergent channel. Good qualitative comparison of the predicted and experimental post-pilgering textures is obtained, provided location-dependent transverse shear component is superposed on the gross flow field, and localized deformation at grain boundaries is allowed. Frictional forces between tube and die are deduced from these observations. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 201...|$|R

25|$|In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced {{political}} activism {{to a greater}} degree than before. Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue {{at the behest of the}} East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance. The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as Powers and Prospects in 1996. As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John <b>Pilger.</b> After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.|$|E

The present study makes an effort to systematically characterize the textural changes during the fabrication stages. The starting single-phase hcp martensitic structure was textured to start with and it also went through strong texture developments during hot extrusion. First and especially the second <b>pilgering</b> modified the texture. Such modifications were related to local discontinuity of the softer second phase, as an apparent continuity restricted lattice rotation in the primary hcp phase. Annealing caused discontinuity or spherodization of the bcc phase, but did not create recrystallization in the hcp matrix. The combination of two <b>pilgering</b> plus annealing operations, though the latter did not cause noticeable texture changes, however, reverted the final texture close to the parent hot-extruded texture.

40|$|A {{problem with}} cold <b>pilgered</b> tubes for OCTG {{applications}} {{is that they}} can get anisotropic properties with regard to yield strength. One source of anisotropy is texture that is developed during the cold deformation. EBSD measurements have been made on several austenitic stainless steels with different deformations to see what influence the composition has on the texture formation. The same measurements were used to study the influence of grain size on texture formation. The conclusion was that the composition can {{have an impact on the}} texture and hence has potential to also affect the anisotropy. The differences in texture cannot be associated with a specific alloying element, but is rather a synergetic effect. It was also concluded that grain structure has no strong influence on texture formation. An evaluation of three different tool designs used for cold <b>pilgering</b> was made. The designs evaluated are referred to as design A, B and C. EBSD measurements showed large deviations in texture in the middle of the wall compared to close to the surface of <b>pilgered</b> OCTG. However, the measurements showed no large differences between the three designs and the texture could not be coupled to the anisotropy...|$|R

It aims at finding the trajectory of a material point along the ca. 70 strokes it takes to move from the upstream, preform zone to the formed tube area. By cumulating the single-stroke displacements and the rigid body motions (advance and rotation) between the strokes, the successive positions of any material point are computed. Then, the mechanical fields are interpolated, giving the complete mechanical history (stresses and strains). The results show the alternations of tension and compression in all the strain and stress components, typical of the <b>pilgering</b> process-to be used as the input of low-cycle fatigue model...|$|R
