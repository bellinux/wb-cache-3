5|$|After filming ended, {{one of the}} {{original}} Minis was sold to Kariker Kars to be hired for various events, whereupon it was then temporarily displayed as a major attraction at the Rover Group's museum. In 1997, it was purchased by the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum and displayed for a while, later being sold on to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer</b> in the United States. One other is privately owned and nearing the end of a restoration in the south of England. A replica— the one used to promote the animated series— is on display at National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, Blair {{resigned}} {{as the leader}} of the Labour Party and Gordon Brown, previously the Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeded him following the 2007 Labour Party conference. Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, though never officially announced. On 18th February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank, Northern Rock, would be nationalised, supporting it with loans and guarantees of £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the US subprime mortgage crisis the previous year, and a <b>private</b> <b>buyer</b> of the bank could not be found.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer</b> for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E

25|$|When the {{problems}} encountered by the wooden {{wings of the}} Vixen V in Chile were realised, {{it was decided to}} produce a version with metal wings. This was initially designated Vixen VII, but was soon renamed Vickers Vivid. The Vixen III prototype was rebuilt with metal wings to become the Type 130 Vivid, first flying in this form on 27 June 1927, powered by a Lion VA engine, later being re-engined with a 540hp (400kW) Lion XI as the Type 146 Vivid. The Vivid was evaluated by Romania, but no orders resulted, with the prototype being sold to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer</b> in 1931, being destroyed in a fire at Chelmsford in 1932.|$|E

Senior university officials authorised {{the sale of the}} collection to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer,</b> with no guarantee that it would remain intact or within the UK. Although the sale was legal, it was unpopular among the academic community, and the controversy was fuelled by prolonged negative press coverage suggesting that the £1m sale price was too low and that the collection was certain to be broken up.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built {{apparently}} as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow {{in the corporate}} museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only. Another is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Unlike Energia's unit, it has no internal components, {{but it does have}} casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which suggest it was built as more than just a model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous <b>private</b> <b>buyer</b> who donated it to the museum. Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott and Jay S. Walker.|$|E
25|$|A L Bruce Estates Ltd was undercapitalised, {{but before}} the 1940s refused to sell off any of its land to raise new funds. However, in 1945, the company {{announced}} it wished to sell its main estate, and the governor felt {{it was necessary to}} negotiate to buy it, even though it had been badly managed and deforested. Bruce Estates wanted a price sufficient to wipe out all its past losses since 1925, but this was considered excessive, and in 1947 the company tried to sell its land to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer,</b> but the sale fell through. Some of the A L Bruce Estates land was sold to private buyers, but the government’s need for land for re-settlement after the 1949 famine caused it to restart negotiations with the company in 1952. Around 75,000 acres was bought by the government, much of which was of poor quality.|$|E

25|$|After the {{departure}} of Kincaid-Smith, the company ceased to manage its estates actively, and by 1948 they were described as having many tenants who produced all its crops, as the owner was merely their broker. Magomero produced 500,000 to 700,000 pounds of tobacco a year, but the company paid badly for this, and many tenants preferred to grow maize to sell in local markets, avoiding sales through the company. In 1945, A L Bruce Estates Ltd announced it wished to sell Magomero. A government survey of the estate showed {{that it had been}} badly managed, deforested, and its soil and grassland abused. Nevertheless, the Governor felt it was necessary to buy the land through negotiation with the company, not by compulsory purchase. Bruce Estates wanted a figure that would wipe out its accumulated losses since 1925, but this was considered excessive, and in 1947 the company provisionally agreed to sell Magomero to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer</b> at a price of £80,000. However, this sale fell through.|$|E

25|$|While {{the first}} Jupiter Fighter was {{evaluated}} at Martlesham Heath and found wanting, being lost on 23 November 1923 when the engine seized at high altitude, {{the second was}} sent to Sweden for evaluation, where it coped excellently with the extreme cold of the Swedish winter, with the Jupiter, using normal fuels and winter motor oil, operating without trouble in temperatures which normally caused engine oil to freeze in hours. The second Type 76 was therefore purchased by the Swedish Air Force, who operated it from May 1924 until 1935, when it was sold to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer,</b> finally being written off in 1936. The final Type 76 {{was used as a}} testbed for a high compression version of the Jupiter intended for use at high altitudes, which was fitted with a bi-fuel system to allow use of alcohol at low altitudes, then switching to normal petrol once the aircraft had reached sufficient altitude to prevent premature detonation (Engine knocking). This system was rejected in favour of supercharging.|$|E

25|$|In April 1877, Lee {{filed suit}} in Alexandria County circuit court to eject the U.S. {{government}} from Arlington. His suit named, among others, Frederick Kaufman (a civilian in the United States Department of War who oversaw Arlington National Cemetery) and R.P. Strong (a U.S. Army officer who supervised the portion of Arlington which had become an Army post). Almost a thousand others were named in the suit, all of them former African American slaves who {{had been allowed to}} form a settlement known as Freedmen's Village on part of the estate. On July 6, United States Attorney General Charles Devens filed a writ of certiorari asking that the case be transferred to the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a request which the federal court approved three days later. On July 16, Devens filed a motion to have Lee's suit dismissed {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution made the federal government immune to suits at law (unless it gave its consent). Lee filed a demurrer, pointing out that the government had taken the contradictory position of being a <b>private</b> <b>buyer</b> in a tax sale and yet asserting sovereign immunity as if its purchase were a governmental act. On March 15, 1878, the circuit court held that not only did the court have jurisdiction to decide the issue but that the lawsuit presented a controversy over facts which should be decided by a jury. A jury trial was held January 24–30, 1879, in Alexandria. The jury found for Lee, concluding that the demand to accept payment only in person violated the Constitution's due process guarantees.|$|E
500|$|Hampered by age {{and declining}} health, Driberg became less active politically, and in 1972 was voted off Labour's NEC.

500|$|The Domesday Book {{mentions}} ponies in Exmoor in 1086. Mentions of {{the ponies}} are rare {{between then and}} 1818, when the Royal Exmoor Forest was sold to a <b>private</b> <b>buyer.</b> Sir Thomas Acland, the Exmoor Royal Forest's last warden, took 30 ponies from the area to Winsford Hill, where he owned land. This herd {{became known as the}} Anchor herd, and a small number of descendants of this original herd still remain at Winsford Hill. At the same time as Acland's removal, the rest of the ponies were sold, but some stayed with breeders in the area, and their families still preserve the descendants of those animals. From the 1820s to 1860s Exmoors were used to produce crossbreds, which although successful were not as hardy as their ancestors. In 1893, the ponies were described in Sidney's Book of the Horse as around [...] high, usually bay in color, and with conformation similar to what it is today. In the late 1800s, the National Pony Society began to register Exmoors and Exmoor crossbreds. In 1921, the Exmoor Pony Society was formed, and published its first stud book in 1963.|$|E
