40|$|We {{study the}} pumping effects, {{in both the}} {{adiabatic}} and nonadiabatic regimes, {{of a pair of}} itfinite finger-gate array (FGA) on a narrow channel. Connection between the pumping characteristics and associated mechanisms is established. The pumping potential is generated by ac biasing the FGA pair. For a single pair (N= 1) of finger gates (FG's), the <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is due to the coherent inelastic scattering of the traversing electron to its subband threshold. For a pair of FGA with pair number N> 2, the dominant <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism</b> becomes that of the time-dependent Bragg reflection. The contribution of the time-dependent Bragg reflection to the pumping is enabled by breaking the symmetry in the electron transmission when the pumping potential is of a predominant propagating type. This propagating wave condition can be achieved both by an appropriate choice of the FGA pair configuration and by the monitoring of a phase difference ϕ between the ac biases in the FGA pair. The robustness of such a <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is demonstrated by considering a FGA pair with only pair number N= 4. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{dynamic model}} with moving heat sources was {{developed}} to analyze the <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a valveless thermally-driven phase-change micropump. The coupled equations were solved to determine the pumping characteristics. The numerical results agree with experimental data from micropumps with dif-ferent diameter microtubes. The maximum flow rate reached 33 µL / min and the maximum pump pressure was over 20 kPa for a 200 -µm diameter microtube. Analysis of the <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism</b> shows that the main factors affecting the flow come from the large density difference between the liquid and vapor phases and the choking effect of the vapor region.

50|$|Because the {{mechanism}} of action of palytoxin was so unlike any other, it was initially not widely accepted.
