5|$|After the war, he {{commanded}} the Far East Air Forces, the Continental Air Command, and the Air Defense Command. He retired in 1951 {{after he was}} <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. Both his son, Ennis Whitehead, Jr., and his grandson, Ennis Whitehead III, became generals as well, rising to major general and brigadier general respectively.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, he {{returned}} to Vanderbilt as {{head coach of the}} basketball team and assistant football coach. In his second stint as Vanderbilt's basketball coach, Cody went 51–50. In 1934, when McGugin retired, Cody was <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> the head coaching job in favor of former Vanderbilt quarterback and SMU coach Ray Morrison. Morrison brought his own staff from SMU and neglected Cody's coaching abilities, but Cody remained basketball coach through the 1935–1936 season. His Commodores basketball teams tallied 51–50 in five seasons.|$|E
5|$|After several {{seasons of}} {{struggling}} for runs, Kippax returned {{to form in}} 193334. Against Queensland at New Year, he hit 125 and shared a stand of 363 in only 135minutes with Bradman. Altogether, he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England. <b>Passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> the vice-captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman, Kippax had the confidence of knowing that the Australian Board of Control had reached {{an agreement with the}} MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.|$|E

5|$|Following William's {{return to}} Jerusalem in 1165, King Amalric {{made him an}} {{ambassador}} to the Byzantine Empire. William became tutor to the king's son, the future King Baldwin IV, whom William discovered to be a leper. After Amalric's death, William became chancellor and archbishop of Tyre, two of the highest offices in the kingdom, and in 1179 William led the eastern delegation to the Third Council of the Lateran. As {{he was involved in}} the dynastic struggle that developed during Baldwin IV's reign, his importance waned when a rival faction gained control of royal affairs. He was <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> the prestigious Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and died in obscurity, probably in 1186.|$|E
5|$|In 294, Narseh, {{a son of}} Shapur who {{had been}} <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> the Sassanid succession, {{came to power in}} Persia. Narseh {{eliminated}} Bahram III, a young man installed in the wake of Bahram II's death in 293. In early 294, Narseh sent Diocletian the customary package of gifts between the empires, and Diocletian responded with an exchange of ambassadors. Within Persia, however, Narseh was destroying every trace of his immediate predecessors from public monuments. He sought to identify himself with the warlike kings Ardashir (r. 226–41) and Shapur I (r. 241–72), who had defeated and imprisoned Emperor Valerian (r. 253–260) following his failed invasion of the Sasanian Empire.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga, General Arnold had his seniority restored (he had lost it after being <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> promotion earlier in 1777). His leg wound left Arnold bedridden for five months. Later, while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia, Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British. He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted to hand {{it over to the}} British, only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John Andre led to the exposure of the plot. Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips, the commander of Burgoyne's right wing, in a 1781 expedition into Virginia.|$|E

This gift {{does not have to be}} money of course; any kind of gift that has value to both the giver and the receiver can be indicated by the Ace.|$|R

5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{departed}} Rio de Janeiro on 11 August 1837 for Salvador, {{capital of}} the province of Bahia. He {{had been charged with}} delivering the prisoner Bento Gonçalves (leader of the rebellion known as the Ragamuffin War that had ravaged Rio Grande do Sul since 1835) to a military fortress. On 7 September 1837, Joaquim Inácio was promoted to captain lieutenant. A couple of months later, the Sabinada rebellion erupted in Salvador. The rebels freed Bento Gonçalves, who escaped back to Rio Grande do Sul. Joaquim Inácio took part in the blockade of that city {{until the end of the}} rebellion in March 1838. His lack of family connections and political influence again stymied his career in 1839, when he was <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> a well-deserved promotion.|$|E

5|$|Savige {{enlisted in}} the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 6 March 1915, and was posted to the 24thInfantry Battalion, which {{departed}} Melbourne for Egypt on the transport Euripides on 8 May 1915. He was <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> a commission due to his lack of education, but was promoted to corporal on 30 April and lance sergeant on 8 May. The 24thInfantry Battalion landed at Gallipoli on 5 September 1915 and took over part of the line at Lone Pine. Savige became company sergeant major on 20 September. There, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 9 November 1915. During the evacuation of Gallipoli in December 1915, Savige {{was one of three}} officers chosen to serve with the battalion rearguard.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy {{regularly}} {{supplied the}} islandswith food from Britain, and visiting vessels brought bags of earth {{that allowed the}} development of a vegetable garden. Smith supported the islands with several gunvessels, including the converted hoys , , and , the fireship , and the Musquito-class floating battery , which he had had purpose-built for the defence of the islands. Lieutenant Charles Papps Price, captain of Badger and an unpopular officer who had repeatedly been <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> promotion, commanded the British occupation; Price {{spent most of his time}} on the islands with a prostitute he had brought from Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Underwood is <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> an {{appointment}} as United States Secretary of State {{even though he}} had been promised the position after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) as President. Walker's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 United States presidential inauguration. With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with Washington Herald reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press.|$|E
5|$|A smaller player {{than his}} peers – St. Louis was listed at five feet nine inches tall in college – he often {{struggled}} to gain recognition for his ability. He was <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> a provincial team at a midget age tournament despite leading his league in scoring, while major junior teams showed {{little interest in}} him. He was heavily recruited by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools to play for their programs, however. He played one season of junior A hockey with the Hawkesbury Hawks of the Central Junior Hockey League (CJHL) in 1992–93 where he scored 37 goals and 87 points in just 31 games. The University of Vermont Catamounts convinced St. Louis to join their hockey program.

5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jackson's {{father had}} been {{appointed}} to command Northern Command in May 1940 and was promoted to major general in July. However, the following year he was posted to Western Command and believed {{that he had been}} <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> a combat command after opposing the Brisbane Line strategy, subsequently retiring in early 1942. By late 1942 Jackson's battalion returned from the Middle East, and he later served in New Guinea fighting the Japanese at Gona, {{as well as in the}} Ramu Valley, the Finisterre Ranges and the New Guinea north coast. He was subsequently posted to Headquarters 18th Brigade as a major during the period 1943–44. In June 1944, he took up a position as an instructor at the Canadian Staff College in Kingston, where he remained until the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 10 March 1826 {{and in the midst}} of the siege of Sacramento, Joaquim Inácio boarded a small, unarmed boat {{accompanied}} by a single army officer and passed unnoticed through a line of nineteen enemy ships under cover of darkness. He reached the main Brazilian fleet on the morning of the next day and requested assistance from Vice-Admiral Rodrigo José Ferreira Lobo, the commander-in-chief of the naval forces operating in the war. Joaquim Inácio returned to Sacramento two days later under heavy enemy fire along with three boats carrying supplies and arms. Although welcomed as a hero in the besieged town, he was <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> <b>for</b> a promotion. Disregard for this achievement was due to his lack of wealth and family connections, a burden which continued to thwart his career for years to come.|$|E
