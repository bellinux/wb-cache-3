60|$|The grounds, I was told, {{are full}} of {{beautiful}} paths and seats, favorite walks and lounges of the poet; but the obdurate pertinacity of the rain compelled us to choose the very shortest path possible to the carriage. I picked a leaf of the <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel,</b> which I send you.|$|E
60|$|That round-headed tree, {{with dark}} rich <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel</b> foliage, {{arranged}} in stars {{at the end}} of each twig, is the Mango, always a beautiful object, whether in orchard or in open park. In the West Indies, as far as I have seen, the Mango has not yet reached the huge size of its ancestors in Hindostan. There--to judge, at least, from photographs--the Mango must be indeed the queen of trees; growing to the size of the largest English oak, and keeping always the round oak-like form. Rich in resplendent foliage, and still more rich in fruit, the tree easily became encircled with an atmosphere of myth in the fancy of the imaginative Hindoo.|$|E
60|$|The {{shrubbery}} {{was filling}} with twilight {{by the time}} she had completed her arrangements and sprinkled the sacrificial oil. As she lit the match that would burn her heart to ashes, she heard a groan or a grunt behind the dense <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The gardens include gothic fountains and statues {{surrounded}} by mature yews nearly 4 m high, hedging, <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurels</b> and honeysuckles trained over wired umbrellas. Spring colour {{is provided by}} daffodils, cowslips and magnolia with roses, dahlias and wild orchids flowering in the summer. The gardens are listed, Grade II*, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.|$|R
50|$|The gardens {{suffered}} badly {{from the}} severe frosts {{of the winter}} of 1879-1880, when the temperature was measured at -23 F. Peach trees that had been planted by Lady Boswall's family fifty years ago were killed to the roots, as were apricots and other fruit trees. An English Yew that had been planted the year Lady Boswall was born also died, as did many oaks. The frost killed Bay <b>Laurels,</b> <b>Portugal</b> <b>Laurels,</b> Rhododendrons, Hollies and other smaller trees.|$|R
60|$|It frightened the hen. It {{might have}} frightened any one. She dropped her victim into a <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel</b> (from {{which he was}} {{presently}} extracted, disordered but, save for his less delicate garments, uninjured), made a flapping leap for the roof of Fulcher's stables, put her foot through a weak place in the tiles, and descended, so to speak, out of the infinite into the contemplative quiet of Mr. Bumps the paralytic--who, it is now proved beyond all cavil, did, on this one occasion in his life, get down {{the entire length of}} his garden and indoors without any assistance whatever, bolt the door after him, and immediately relapse again into Christian resignation and helpless dependence upon his wife....|$|E
60|$|Birds, I early noticed, {{are always}} great {{carriers}} of fruit-seeds, because they eat the berries, but don't digest the hard little stones within. It {{was in that}} way, I fancy, that the <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel</b> first came to my islands, because it has an edible fruit with a very hard seed; and the same reason must account {{for the presence of}} the myrtle, with its small blue berry; the laurustinus with its currant-like fruit; the elder-tree, the canary laurel, the local sweet-gale, and the peculiar juniper. Before these shrubs were introduced thus unconsciously by our feathered guests, there were no fruits on which berry-eating birds could live; but now they are the only native trees or large bushes on the islands--I mean the only ones not directly planted by you mischief-making men, who have entirely spoilt my nice little experiment.|$|E
60|$|We rode by shining {{clumps of}} the <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel,</b> a {{beautiful}} evergreen, much resembling our mountain rhododendron; {{then there was}} the prickly, polished, dark-green holly, which I had never seen before, but which is, certainly, one of the most perfect of shrubs. The turf was of that soft, dazzling green, and had that peculiar velvet-like smoothness, which seem characteristic of England. We stopped at last before the door of a cottage, whose porch was overgrown with ivy. From that moment I ceased to feel myself a stranger in England. I cannot tell you how delightful to me, dizzy and weary as I was, was the first sight of the chamber of reception which had been prepared for us. No item of cozy comfort that one could desire was omitted. The sofa and easy chair wheeled up before a cheerful coal fire, a bright little teakettle steaming in front of the grate, a table with a beautiful vase of flowers, books, and writing apparatus, and kind friends with words full of affectionate cheer,--all these made me feel at home in a moment.|$|E
60|$|Hogglestock, as {{has been}} explained, has little to offer {{in the way of}} landskip beauty, and the clergyman's house at Hogglestock was not placed on a green slopy bank of land, retired from the road, with its windows opening on to a lawn, {{surrounded}} by shrubs, {{with a view of the}} small church tower seen through them; it had none of that beauty which is so common to the cosy houses of our spiritual pastors in the agricultural parts of England. Hogglestock parsonage stood bleak beside the road, with no pretty paling lined inside by hollies and laburnum, <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurels</b> and rose-trees. But, nevertheless, even Hogglestock was pretty now. There were apple-trees there covered with blossom, and the hedgerows were in full flower. There were thrushes singing, and here and there an oak-tree stood in the roadside, perfect in its solitary beauty.|$|R
5000|$|Native trees inhabiting Gillies Hill {{including}} silver birch, rowan, holly, oak, ash, hazel and {{clinging to}} the western cliffs, gnarled Scots Pine which form {{an essential part of}} this woodland ecosystem, their cones providing an excellent source of pine nuts for native Red Squirrels and Crossbills.Also found on the hill are species which were introduced by humans and have since become naturalized. These include [...] "archaeophytes" [...] (pre-1500) such as the Flanders Poppy and Spearmint; and [...] "neophytes" [...] (post-1500) such as European Beech, Sycamore, and Red Elderberry.Polmaise Castle is home to many exotic species of plant that were introduced as part of the estate’s gardens and designed landscapes. To the west and south of the castle are rows of English yew trees which once formed clipped hedges enclosing stately lawns. Other trees found here include an English holly, <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurels,</b> and a magnificent copper beech.In other areas of the hill, the natural woodland has been replaced with commercial species such as Sitka and Norway Spruce, which form dense canopies limiting undergrowth; and larch, a non-native deciduous conifer, which allows sunlight to penetrate to the ground flora.|$|R
6000|$|To {{describe}} to you, therefore, the Botanic Garden (in which the cottage stands) {{would take a}} week's work of words, which would convey no images to your mind. Let it be enough to say, that our favourite haunt in all the gardens is a little dry valley, beneath the loftiest group of trees. At its entrance rises a great Tamarind, and a still greater Saman; both have leaves like a Mimosa- -as the engraving shows. Up its trunk a Cereus has reared itself, for some thirty feet at least; a climbing Seguine {83a} twines up it with leaves like 'lords and ladies'; but {{the glory of the}} tree is that climbing palm, the feathers of which we saw crowning it from a distance. Up into the highest branches and down again, and up again into the lower branches, and rolling along the ground in curves as that of a Boa bedecked with huge ferns and prickly spikes, six feet and more long each, the Rattan {83b} hangs in mid-air, one hardly sees how, beautiful and wonderful, beyond what clumsy words can tell. Beneath the great trees (for here great trees grow freely beneath greater trees, and beneath greater trees again, delighting in the shade) is a group of young Mangosteens, {83c} looking, to describe the unknown by the known, like walnuts with leaflets eight inches long, their boughs clustered with yellow and green sour fruit; and beyond them stretches up the lawn a dense grove of nutmegs, like <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurels,</b> hung about with olive-yellow apples. [...] Here and there a nutmeg-apple has split, and shows within the delicate crimson caul of mace; or the nutmegs, the mace still clinging round them, lie scattered on the grass. Under the perpetual shade of the evergreens haunt Heliconias and other delicate butterflies, who seem to dread the blaze outside, and flutter gently from leaf to leaf, their colouring--which is usually black with markings of orange, crimson, or blue--coming into strongest contrast with the uniform green of leaf and grass. This is our favourite spot for entomologising, when the sun outside altogether forbids the least exertion. Turn, with us--alas! only in fancy--out of the grove into a neighbouring path, between tea- shrubs, looking like privets with large myrtle flowers, and young clove-trees, covered with the groups of green buds which are the cloves of commerce; and among fruit-trees from every part of the Tropics, with the names of which I will not burden you. Glance at that beautiful and most poisonous shrub, which we found wild at St. Thomas's. {84} Glance, too--but, again why burden you with names which you will not recollect, much more with descriptions which do not describe? Look, though, down that Allspice avenue, at the clear warm light which is reflected off the smooth yellow ever-peeling stems; and then, if you can fix your eye steadily on any object, where all are equally new and strange, look at this stately tree. A bough has been broken off high up, and from the wounded spot two plants are already contending. One is a parasitic Orchis; the other a parasite of a more dangerous family. It looks like a straggling Magnolia, some two feet high. In fifty years it will be a stately tree. Look at the single long straight air-root which it is letting down {{by the side of the}} tree bole. That root, if left, will be the destroyer of the whole tree. It will touch the earth, take root below, send out side-fibres above, call down younger roots to help it, till the whole bole, clasped and stifled in their embraces, dies and rots out, and the Matapalo (or Scotch attorney, {85a} as it is rudely called here) stands alone on stilted roots, and board walls of young wood, slowly coalescing into one great trunk; master of the soil once owned by the patron on whose vitals he has fed: a treacherous tyrant; and yet, like many another treacherous tyrant, beautiful to see, with his shining evergreen foliage, and grand labyrinth of smooth roots, standing high in air, or dangling from the boughs in search of soil below; and last, but not least, his Magnolia-like flowers, rosy or snowy-white, and green egg-shaped fruits.|$|R
60|$|Facilities for Dispersal of Azorean Plants.--Now in {{the course}} of very long periods of time the various causes here {{enumerated}} would be sufficient to stock the remotest islands with vegetation, and a considerable part of the Azorean flora appears well adapted to be so conveyed. Of the 439 flowering-plants in Mr. Watson's list, I find that about forty-five belong to genera that have either pappus or winged seeds; sixty-five to such as have very minute seeds; thirty have fleshy fruits such as are greedily eaten by birds; several have hispid seeds; and eighty-four are glumaceous plants, which are all probably well-adapted for being carried partly by winds and partly by currents, as well as by some of the other causes mentioned. On the other hand we have a very suggestive fact in the absence from the Azores of most of the trees and shrubs with large and heavy fruits, however common they may be in Europe. Such are oaks, chestnuts, hazels, apples, beeches, alders, and firs; while the only trees or large shrubs are the <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel,</b> myrtle, laurestinus, elder, Laurus canariensis, Myrica faya, and a doubtfully peculiar juniper--all small berry-bearers, and therefore likely to have been conveyed by one or other of the modes suggested above.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Arthuret {{came out}} with them, and found what Bessie could only regard as a scene of desolation. Though gentlemen, as a rule, have no mercy on trees, and ladies are equally {{inclined}} to cry, 'Woodman, spare that tree,' the rule was reversed, for Miss Arthuret was cutting, and ordering cutting all round her ruthlessly with something of the pleasure of a child in breaking a new toy {{to prove that it}} is his own, scarcely listening when the Admiral told her what the trees were, and how beautiful in their season; while even as to the evergreens, she did not know a yew from a cedar, and declared that she must get rid of this horrid old laurustinus, while she lopped away at a <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel.</b> Her one idea seemed to be that it was very unwholesome to live in a house surrounded with trees; and the united influence of the Merrifields, working on her mother by representing what would be the absence of shade in a few months' time, barely availed {{to save the life of}} the big cedar; while the great rhododendron, wont to present a mountain of shining leaves and pale purple blossoms every summer, was hewn down without remorse as an awful old laurel, and left a desolate brown patch in its stead.|$|E
6000|$|I turn {{my chair}} and look into the weedy dell. The ground on the {{opposite}} slope (slopes are, you must remember, here as steep as house-roofs, the last spurs of true mountains) {{is covered with a}} grass like tall rye-grass, but growing in tufts. That is the famous Guinea-grass {78e} which, introduced from Africa, has spread over the whole West Indies. Dark lithe coolie prisoners, one a gentle young fellow, with soft beseeching eyes, and 'Felon' printed {{on the back of his}} shirt, are cutting it for the horses, under the guard of a mulatto turnkey, a tall, steadfast, dignified man; and between us and them are growing along the edge of the gutter, veritable pine- apples in the open air, and a low green tree just like an apple, which is a Guava; and a tall stick, thirty feet high, with a flat top of gigantic curly horse-chestnut leaves, which is a Trumpet- tree. {79a} There are hundreds of them in the mountains round: but most of them dead, from the intense drought and fires of last year. [...] Beyond it, again, is a round-headed tree, looking like a huge <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel,</b> covered with racemes of purple buds. That is an 'Angelim'; {79b} when full-grown, one of the finest timbers in the world. And what are those at the top of the brow, rising out of the rich green scrub? Verily, again, we are in the Tropics. They are palms, doubtless, some thirty feet high each, with here and there a young one springing up like a gigantic crown of male-fern. The old ones have straight gray stems, often prickly enough, and thickened in the middle; gray last year's leaves hanging down; and feathering round the top, a circular plume of pale green leaves, like those of a coconut. But these are not cocos. The last year's leaves of the coco are rich yellow, and its stem is curved. These are groo-groos; {79c} they stand as fresh proofs that we are indeed in the Tropics, and as 'a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.' ...|$|E
50|$|Prunus lusitanica, the <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel,</b> is {{a species}} of the genus Prunus, related to the cherry. It is native to southwestern France, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Macaronesia (the Azores, Canary Islands and Madeira).|$|E
50|$|Vegetation in Pico da Vara is {{dominated}} by a dense forest of Laurissilva, whose origins date to the humid forests of the Tertiary, existent {{in the south of}} Europe that dominated for millions of years until the onset of glaciation. The forests of Pico da Vara has an elevated level of endemic species, that includes shrub plants, large fennel and dense ferns.ref name=DRA/> These include Madeiran holly (Ilex perado), Azorean holly (Ilex azorica), flowering laurel (Viburnum tinus and Viburnum subcordatum), Azores juniper (Juniperus brevifolia), Azores laurel (Laurus azorica), <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel</b> (Prunus lusitanica), Azorean laurel (Prunus azorica), woolly tree fern (Culcita macrocarpa), Azores blueberry (Vaccinium cylindraceum) and a wood rush (Luzula purpureo-splendens).|$|E
5000|$|Some species {{belong to}} the true laurel family or Lauraceae, but many have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to {{convergent}} evolution. As in any other rainforest, plants of the laurel forests must adapt to high rainfall and humidity. The trees adapted {{in response to these}} ecological drivers by developing analogous structures, leaves that repel water. Laurophyll or lauroid leaves are characterized by a generous layer of wax, making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed oval shape with an apical mucro or [...] "drip tip", which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing perspiration and respiration. The scientific names laurina, laurifolia, laurophylla, lauriformis, and lauroides are often used to name species of other plant families that resemble the Lauraceae. The term Lucidophyll, referring to the shiny surface of the leaves, was proposed in 1969 by Tatuo Kira. The scientific names Daphnidium, Daphniphyllum, Daphnopsis, Daphnandra, Daphne from Greek: Δάφνη, meaning [...] "laurel", laural, Laureliopsis, laureola, laurelin, Laurelindorinan, laurifolia, Cistus laurifolius (Laurel Rockrose), laurifolius, lauriformis, laurina, laurophylla, laurocerasus, laurus, Prunus laurocerasus (English laurel), Prunus lusitanica (<b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel),</b> Corynocarpus laevigatus (New Zealand Laurel), and Corynocarpus rupestris designate species of other plant families that resemble Lauraceae. The term [...] "lauroid" [...] is also applied to climbing plants such as ivies whose leaves resemble those of the Lauraceae.|$|E
5000|$|When John Edgerley sailed for England in 1842 he {{had taken}} back a {{collection}} of New Zealand plants for Kew Gardens. In return the director of Kew, Sir William Hooker, undertook to provide him {{with a wide range}} of flowering shrubs (six casefuls) for setting up his nursery on this land in Epsom. Edgerley requested the following plants: “Rhododendrons, camellias, arbutus or strawberry tree, laurustine, <b>Portugal</b> <b>laurel,</b> common laurel, azaleas, a plant or two of lilac, wisteria sinensis, tree paeonia, with a few plants of fuchsias - corymbiflora if you can spare it, ribes sanguinea, magonlia grandiflora, deutzia scabra, box for hedging, with a few good roses, white moss if you can spare it, ajuga japonica, cedar of Lebanon, jasminum…acorns, chestnuts, hawthorn berries or any other seed you thought would germinate, also a small collection of good flower seeds with fir cones” [...] Although roses, flowering seeds and annuals had been imported by early missionaries, their planting concentrated on practical plants such as fruit trees, shelter trees and crops. Certainly this was the first importation of rhododendrums, camellias, azaleas, lilac and wisteria into New Zealand [...] He married Sarah Newnham at Upper Arley on 27, December, 1842 and they travelled on the Tyne arriving at Hobart August 1843 then coming on to Auckland. It was possible that he leased some land immediately in the Epsom/Newmarket area as in the police census of 1844, he was living in a raupo hut in that location. John Edgerley brought a collection of items out with him including a set of blasting tools, candle snuffers, a tinder box and a humane man trap, these items are now in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E
