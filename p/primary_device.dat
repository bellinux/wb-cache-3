The ModularEEG was the <b>primary</b> <b>device</b> created the OpenEEG community; it was a 6-channel signal capture board that cost between $200 and $400 to make at home.

25|$|The quiz is the <b>primary</b> <b>device</b> of {{eliminating}} contestants across all series. Traditionally between ten and twenty questions, the quiz asks {{the players to}} identify the Mole and several pieces of information regarding the Mole, including the Mole's activity in challenges, biographical profile, their fashion and/or culinary choices during the show, etc. The player scoring lowest on the quiz (and taking the longest time to do so, {{in the event of}} tied scores) is eliminated from the game. The US version saw a format change from twenty questions to ten questions from Season 2 on, usually with all questions available to the public. Season 5 of the Australian series had contestants answer five questions about the Mole (not filmed), plus a further five questions for the live eliminations. On two separate occasions, the live elimination computer quiz system malfunctioned and didn't record some contestants' responses. The rules stated that if this were to happen the elimination would be based on the five questions answered before the live show.|$|E
2500|$|Coles' {{original}} slogan was [...] "nothing over 2/6", when it {{was primarily}} operating variety stores. The slogan [...] "You'll find the best value is at Coles New World" [...] {{was used in the}} 1980s. The red/orange orb was used from 1991 to 2005. [...] "Serving you better" [...] was used as a slogan from 1998 to 2003, replaced by [...] "save everyday", endorsed by actress Lisa McCune. A circled tick was used as a logo device from 2003 to 2007, replacing the orb as a <b>primary</b> <b>device</b> in 2005. [...] "Save everyday" [...] was later changed to the grammatically-correct [...] "save every day".|$|E
50|$|Larger <b>primary</b> <b>devices</b> (and transitions) that do {{not readily}} fit into a {{standard}} 4-foot m pre-cast manhole barrel, either a larger barrel or a concrete vault must be used - adding cost. The packaged metering manhole, on the other hand, can integrate <b>primary</b> <b>devices</b> that are larger than the manhole barrel - with any portion that doesn't fit inside the manhole barrel extending upstream / downstream as necessary. Those portion that extend upstream / downstream of the barrel are manufactured with integral covers and laminated into the manhole structure. It is this ability to incorporate <b>primary</b> <b>devices</b> larger than the manhole barrel that can allow a packaged metering manhole to be as, or better, cost effective than a pre-cast manhole / vault.|$|R

Evaluating the conformity of <b>primary</b> <b>devices</b> towards security and SAS architectures towards required specifications is a non trivial task. For that, we propose a co-simulation approach based on hardware and software in the loop add-on modules. An architecture combining both actual and virtual devices is simulated using this approach and dynamic scenarios are constructed for generating transaction delay performance index. Finaly, we provide an adequate explanation about the Co Simulation outcomes according to the type of real devices and the configuration of dynamic scenarios...|$|R
2500|$|In 1910, King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) {{decided to}} abandon the coat of arms {{altogether}} and use the Garuda as his <b>primary</b> <b>device.</b> The King asked Phra Dhevabhinimit (a famous artist at the time) to design a new seal, using Prince Naris' drawing of the Garuda, but with an addition of an encirclement of the King's ceremonial name on the outer edge. In 1911 an Act on the Seals of State was passed establishing the Garuda seal as the principal seal [...] "To be impressed for authentication of the King's signature on all important deeds and documents." [...] From then on the Garuda seal named Phra Khrut Pha became the country's official emblem. King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) continued {{the use of the}} seal by replacing his predecessor's name with his own. As King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) was never crowned in a coronation ceremony (and therefore was never bestowed with a regnal name), a seal for his reign was never carved, instead he used his grandfather's (those of King Rama V's) instead. The seal currently in use was made for King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) in 1946, soon after his coronation.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>device</b> was a COBRA Deuterium-Tritium gas-boosted {{atomic bomb}} made by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, a very compact MK 7 device. This boosted fission device was {{tested in the}} Upshot Knothole Climax event and yielded [...] (out of 50â€“70 kt {{expected}} yield range), so that the planned operation Domino could be cancelled before the coming presidential election. The implosion system was quite lightweight at , because it eliminated the aluminium pusher shell around the tamper and used the more compact ring lenses, a design feature shared with the Mark 5, 12, 13 and 18 designs. The explosive material of the inner charges (I.C. for short) in the MK 7 was changed to the more powerful Cyclotol 75/25, instead of the Composition B used in most stockpiled bombs at that time, as Cyclotol 75/25 was denser than Composition B and thus could generate {{the same amount of}} explosive force in a smaller volume (it actually provided 13% more compressive energy than Comp B). The composite uranium-plutonium COBRA core was levitated in a type-D pit. COBRA was Los Alamos most recent end-product of design work on the very important [...] "new principles" [...] of the hollow core. A copper pit liner encased within the weapon-grade plutonium inner capsule prevented DT gas diffusion in plutonium, a technique first tested in Greenhouse Item. The assembled module weighed , measuring [...] across. It was located {{at the end of the}} device, which, as seen in the declassified film, shows a small cone projecting from the ballistic case. This cone is the part of the paraboloid that was used to focus the radiation emanating from the primary to the secondary.|$|E

40|$|RF Spectrum {{scarcity}} inhibits {{development of}} newer wireless communication technolo-gies {{in a big}} way. With the current spectrum policies, there is heavy under utilization of available spectrum. This calls for more efficient spectrum allocation. One of the solu-tions to the problem is dynamic spectrum allocation algorithms. This can be achieved {{with the use of}} Cognitive Radio Technology. Cognitive radios allow for dynamic chang-ing of transmission parameters depending on the environment and available spectrum bands. The definition of Cognitive radios terms it an intelligent radio which alters its transmission/reception parameters in accordance with the radio environment and the network state to utilize spectrum efficiently. Cognitive radio technology allows for use of unlicensed secondary devices to utilize spectrum unused by licensed <b>primary</b> <b>devices.</b> The secondary devices can utilize the spectrum and transmit in bands not used by the <b>primary</b> <b>devices</b> in order to avoid any detrimental interference to the licensed primary users. This calls for stringent control of the secondary transceiver. In this thesis, we focus on designing an LTE standard based Non Contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Secondary Transceiver...|$|R
