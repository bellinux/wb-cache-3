40|$|AbstractThe Agricultural Economics Research Institute has {{calculated}} the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> {{of the major}} agricultural products since the 1970 s. The calculations are {{used to examine the}} development of <b>production</b> <b>costs,</b> and they are based on the farm models. These farm models are constructed partly on the basis of information compiled from bookeeping farms and on the basis of various standards and recommendations. The models describe a situation where a farm has specialised in a production of one product. The farm models represent the conditions in Southern Finland and a level of agriculture more efficient than average. Therefore, the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> calculated {{on the basis of these}} models do not descride the average <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of farm products in Finland. The production methods and yields of the farm models have now been revised to correspond to the current situations. The calculations consist of the production of milk, beef, pork, piglets, eggs, bread grain, feed grain, oil plants and sugar beets. The calculations are made for each product produced on farms of different sizes and so they show the effect of the farm size on the <b>production</b> <b>costs.</b> The total number of models presented in this report is 50. The cost structures of the models are based on the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> determined at the price and cost level of the year 1996. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of agricultural products according to farm models The <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of agricultural products according to farm model...|$|R

40|$|Profitability {{depends on}} <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> {{as much as}} it depends on sales revenue. Information on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> is {{therefore}} critical in the analysis of competitive commercial enterprises in all industry sectors. The dynamics of any industry sector, under either market or policy changes, depend on the relative <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> of its individual enterprises. Empirical data on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> are sparse, however, because of commercial sensitivity. Stock exchanges show share prices, and annual financial reports show aggregate income and outgoings, but unit <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> are treated as confidential. Here, therefore, I argue for greater effort in empirical studies on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> in tourism, to complement the existing body of theoretical research. In particular, I suggest that empirical information on <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> is prerequisite to analyze the value contributed by agents and intermediaries in tourism distribution systems. As an initial case study, I present data from six similar small-group international package tours in the nature and adventure subsector. In tourism, the most typical product design is a package that assembles a complex set of goods and services by purchasing and linking localized or specialized transport, accommodation, and activity subproducts. Theoretical aspects of the assembly, marketing, costs, pricing, and operation of package tours have been studied extensively (Assaf, Barros...|$|R
40|$|Despite recent progress, the <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> for {{renewable}} electricity remain above those for conventional power. Expectations of continuous reductions in <b>production</b> <b>costs,</b> typically underpin governments' policies for financial support.

This paper discusses how national-contextual factors also have a strong influence on <b>production</b> <b>costs,</b> such as geographic, infrastructural, institutional, and resource factors. As technologies mature, and as they reach significant levels of diffusion nationally, sustained increases in <b>production</b> <b>costs</b> might be recorded, due to these nationally contextual factors, poorly accounted for in policy-making decisions for price support. The paper suggests an analytical framework for a more comprehensive understanding of <b>production</b> <b>costs.</b> Based on this, it recommends that the evolution of specific cost levels and factors be monitored to locate 'sources of changes'. The paper also suggests policy instruments that governments may use to facilitate cost decreases, whenever possible.

The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E
