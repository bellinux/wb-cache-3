The main objective of this research was to present sexual development, sexual behavior, and sexual identity among <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> Furthermore, we determined the views and opinions of the parents and students, special educators and rehabilitators, about children <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> Basic tasks of this research were: to determine whether <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have a clear picture and concept of their sexuality, whether the parents discuss this topic with their children, whether and how <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> know what sex is, what is contraception, unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases or intimate parts of the body, whether they show some kind of sexual behavior, and whether the parents and students should be educated regarding the sexual development, behavior, and sexual identity of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> The survey was conducted over a period of almost 3 months, which included 94 respondents. Obtained data was collected, grouped, tabled, and processed with the standard statistical program Microsoft Office Excel 2003, applying χ 2 tests and Fisher's Еxact test. Statistical important difference was at the level of p< 0. 05. From the analysis and interpretation of the results, we can conclude that in Macedonian families and schools there is a very small extent or no existence of communication between the parents and professionals <b>with</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> about sexual development, sexual behavior, and sexual identity. <b>Persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have very little or no general knowledge about sexuality...|$|R

40|$|Lying is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} amongst human beings. It seems {{to play a role}} in making social interactions run more smoothly. Too much honesty can be regarded as impolite or downright rude. Remarkably, lying is not a common phenomenon amongst normally intelligent human beings who are on the autism spectrum. They appear to be 'attractively morally innocent' and seem to have an above average moral conscientious objection against deception. In this paper, the behavior of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> <b>with</b> regard to deception and truthfulness will be discussed in the light of two different ethical theories, illustrated by fragments from autobiographies of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> A systemizing 'Kantian' and an empathizing 'ethics of care' perspective reveal insights on high-functioning autism, truthfulness and moral behavior. Both perspectives are problematic from the point of view of a moral agent <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> High-functioning <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> are, generally speaking, strong systemizes and weak empathizers. Particularly, they lack 'cognitive empathy' which would allow them to understand the position of the other person. Instead, some tend to invent a set of rules that makes their behavior compatible with the expectations of others. From a Kantian point of view, the autistic tendency to always tell the truth appears praiseworthy and should not be changed, though it creates problems in the social life of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> From a care ethics perspective, on the other hand, a way should be found to allow the high-functioning <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> to respect the feelings and needs of other persons as sometimes overruling the duty of truthfulness. We suggest this may even entail 'morally educating' children and adolescents <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> to become socially skilled empathic 'liars'...|$|R

40|$|A {{forced choice}} {{reaction}} time (RT) task {{was used to}} examine the relations between covert orienting (shifts in attention independent of eye movement) and filtering (the inhibition of processing of irrelevant stimuli) components of attention in <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> (n = 12) and developmentally disabled persons without autism (n = 20). Conditions varied with regard to the validity of the cue (related to covert orienting) and presence of distractors (related to filtering). ?'he RT/p(correct) scores of both groups were longer in the distractor-present conditions and in conditions when a cue provided incorrect information regarding the location of the subsequent target (invalid cue). The RT/p(correct) scores of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> as compared to developmentally disabled persons without autism were slower overall. However the pattern of performance of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> was not significantly {{different from that of the}} developmentally disabled persons without autism. These results are inconsistent with the notions of specific deficits in covert orienting and filtering among <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> and indicate that certain attentional difficulties may not be unique to autism. Alternatively, they may also reflect differences in the specific mechanisms assessed in different studies.

Conditions varied with regard to {{the presence or absence of}} a window and number (zero, two, or four) and location of distractors. The RTs of the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> improved relative to the other groups in the presence of the window without distractors, but this effect was negated when distractors were also presented. The performance of the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> was the most impaired in the presence of distractors. These findings represent preliminary behavioral evidence of an inefficient attentional lens among <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> The ability to attend selectively to meaningful sources of in-formation while ignoring irrelevant ones is essential to compe-tent and adaptive functioning (Lane & Pearson, 1982). The task of attending is particularly challenging in that the human mind has a finite capacity, but is faced with infinite amounts of infor-mation from surrounding environments (e. g., Broadbent, 1971; Enns, 1990; Kahneman, 1973; Pearson & Lane, 1990).

In {{order to reduce the}} problem behavior, several behavioral interventions are used. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of single-subject studies to examine the efficacy of behavioral interventions for reducing problem behavior in <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> Two hundred and thirteen studies representing 358 <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> met the inclusion criteria and were included in the statistical analyses. Overall, we found that behavioral interventions were on average effective in reducing problem behavior in individuals <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> but some interventions were significantly more effective than others. The results further showed that the use of positive (nonaversive) behavioral interventions was increasing over time. The behavioral interventions were on average equally effective regardless of the type of problem behavior that was targeted. Interventions preceded by a functional analysis reduced problem behavior significantly more than interventions not preceded by a functional analysis. Finally, treatment and experimental characteristics, but not participant characteristics, were statistically significant moderators of the behavioral treatment effectiveness. status: publishe...|$|R
