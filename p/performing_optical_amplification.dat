40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} pulse interleaving and <b>optical</b> <b>amplification</b> on the spectral purity of microwave signals generated by photodetecting the pulsed output of an Er:fiber-based optical frequency comb.

We exploit <b>optical</b> <b>amplification,</b> in conjunction with high power handling modified uni-traveling carrier photodetectors, to generate a phase noise floor on a 10 GHz carrier of - 175 dBc/Hz, the lowest ever demonstrated in the photodetection of a mode-locked fiber laser.

40|$|Absorption and {{luminescence}} spectra and <b>optical</b> <b>amplification</b> in bismuth-doped germanate silicate glass were investigated. Two {{kinds of}} bismuth ion valence states could {{exist in the}} glass. One is Bi 2 +, which has shown red luminescence, another might be Bi+, which is the active center for infrared luminescence. The infrared luminescence excited at 700, 800, and 980 nm should be ascribed to the electronic transition P- 3 (1) [...] > P- 3 (0) of Bi+ ions in three distinct sites. The shifting, broadening, and multiple configuration of the luminescence {{could be due to}} the randomly disorder of local environment and multiple sites of the active centers.

40|$|International audienceRare earth ions, with {{relatively}} long luminescence lifetimes, have significant advantages for application in fields {{as varied as}} diagnostics and <b>optical</b> <b>amplification.</b> In diagnostics the long luminescence lifetimes allow for extremely sensitive time-gated detection, where the difference in temporal behavior of scatter and background fluorescence and the long-lived rare earth luminescence is utilized. In <b>optical</b> <b>amplification</b> the long excited-state lifetime {{makes it easier to}} obtain population inversion, a requirement for effective stimulated emission. Unfortunately the absorption cross section of rare earth ion transitions is extremely low. However, via sensitized excitation by means of a suitable organic molecule, efficient excitation is obtained. It is shown that excitation in the visible part of the spectrum can be used to excite rare earth ions which luminesce in the near-IR, such as ytterbium, neodymium, and erbium, via a fluorescein-derivative as sensitizer. The advantages of this approach are manifold. Low-cost light sources are available for the visible part of the spectrum, and interferences from the matrix (scatter, absorption) are minimal. Detection in the near-IR is almost interference-free. For <b>optical</b> <b>amplification</b> the wavelength regions around 1300 and 1550 nm, which can be covered with the neodymium and erbium complexes, respectively, are the most important for applications in optical telecommunication...|$|R
