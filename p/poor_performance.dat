5|$|Desertion had {{continued}} to be a problem for the 24th Infantry, a de facto segregated unit. Statistics compiled by the Eighth Army found the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 25th Infantry throughout August, compared to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. The regiment had already been criticized for its <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> at the Battle of Sangju several weeks earlier. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, and found its <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> was starting to bring other units of the division down as well. Kean considered the regiment a weak link in the chain, and after its <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, he suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops used as replacements for other units in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment.|$|E

Conversely, the 35th Infantry was widely praised for its actions at the Kum River line. The regiment had performed so well in repulsing the North Koreans that Kean nominated it for a Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

During World War II, the Epsteins moved to Southport, where two schools {{expelled}} Epstein for laziness and <b>poor</b> <b>performance,</b> but returned to Liverpool in 1945. The Epsteins lived at 197Queens Drive, Childwall in Liverpool, and remained there for the next 30years.|$|E

5|$|However, the <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> and {{military}} {{weakness of the}} Song army was observed by the Jurchens, who immediately broke the alliance, beginning the Jin–Song Wars of 1125 and 1127.

5|$|The {{first four}} Grizzlies seasons had given average {{attendance}} {{in the middle}} third of the league. However, {{the last two seasons}} saw a reduction to among the league's lowest attendances; participating reasons were the team's <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> and the 1998–99 NBA lockout. Contributing to the conditions for relocation were a weak Canadian dollar, unwillingness of some U.S. players to live in Canada, and lack of local ownership.|$|E
5|$|Though Sachsen entered {{service in}} 1878, she only participated in one annual fleet exercise, in 1880, before all four ships were {{assigned}} to the 1884 maneuvers. This was due to the <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> of Sachsen in the 1880 maneuvers and the negative reputation of the class. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen-class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. The four ships served rotations with the fleet for the next two years, though in 1886, all four were demobilized as the Reserve Division in the Baltic. Aside from the Sachsens half-sister , the German Navy took a hiatus on capital ship building until the late 1880s when the first of the s were laid down. The <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> of the sortie corvettes, coupled with the rise of the Jeune École, led Leo von Caprivi to abandon capital ship construction in favor of torpedo boats.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's defense, which {{performed}} {{well in the}} beginning of the season and against No.3 Miami, faltered in the final games of the regular season, allowing 123points and over 1,800yards to opponents' offenses. Despite a <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> when compared with previous seasons' accomplishments, Virginia Tech still ranked second in the Big East conference in total defense, scoring defense, and quarterback sacks.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{suggests}} that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology, the nuclear industry, and the NRC. Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> {{both before and after}} the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E

5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Nico Rosberg {{cemented}} his position {{at the top of the}} Drivers' Championship, having taken the maximum number of 100 points available from the first four rounds. Lewis Hamilton followed in second with 57 points, while Kimi Räikkönen moved up to third with 43 points. Vettel's retirement dropped him to fifth in the standings, behind Daniel Ricciardo. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes increased their points tally to 157, now 81 points clear of second-placed Ferrari. Red Bull's <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> saw their advantage over fourth placed Williams reduced to just six points.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw limited action during World War I, {{largely a}} result of the {{cautious}} strategies employed by the Regia Marina and its opponent, the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Nino Bixio was involved in the pursuit of a group of Austro-Hungarian raiders in December 1915, but did not engage them before they escaped. Marsala briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the late 1920s, the victims of very tight naval budgets and their own <b>poor</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

The Brute Man received generally negative reviews, drawing particular criticism for Hatton's <b>poor</b> <b>performance.</b> The film was featured in a 1996 episode of the movie-mocking comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.|$|E
5|$|Despite the uncomplimentary media {{coverage}} given {{him and his}} <b>poor</b> <b>performance</b> during the Independence Bowl, Bruce Smith was selected with the first overall pick in the 1985 NFL Draft. Smith was subsequently signed to a $2.6million contract by the Buffalo Bills. During the 1985 college football season, Virginia Tech struggled to rebuild from losing 20starters (10 on offense, 10 on defense) from the 1984 team, and finished with a 65 record. Air Force, meanwhile, performed extremely well, finishing with an 111 record, including a bowl-game win over the Texas Longhorns. Fisher DeBerry remained the coach of Air Force for another 22 years, eventually retiring after {{the conclusion of the}} 2006 season.|$|E
