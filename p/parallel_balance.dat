40|$|Successful {{adaptation}} {{in strategic}} alliances "calls for {{a delicate balance}} between the twin virtues of reliability and flexibility" [Parkhe 1998]. On one hand, the joint venture must be flexible enough {{to respond to the}} uncertainties of competitive business environments because it is not feasible to plan for every possible contingency. Yet, on the other hand, unfettered flexibility invites dysfunctional behavior, such as opportunism and complacency. This delicate balance accompanies a <b>parallel</b> <b>balance</b> between trust and control of the joint venture. The primary goal {{of this study is to}} empirically examine this relationship in the context of Vietnamese international joint ventures (IJVs) by building on the model of knowledge acquisition and performance in IJVs established by Lyles and Salk [1996]. This study makes three major contributions to the literature. First it confirms several findings of the original Lyles and Salk study [1996]. Second, we strengthen Lyles and Salk's original model by incorporating multiple measures of both interorganizational trust and control as independent variables. Finally, this study represents one of the first in-depth examinations of business in the emerging Vietnamese economy. ...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in natural populations {{is a prime}} prerequisite allowing populations to respond to selection, but is under constant threat from forces that tend to reduce it, such as genetic drift and many types of selection. Haldane emphasized the potential importance of parasites as a driving force of genetic diversity. His theory has been taken for granted ever since, but despite numerous studies showing correlations between genetic diversity and parasitism, Haldane's hypothesis has rarely been tested experimentally for unambiguous support. We experimentally staged antagonistic coevolution between the host Tribolium castaneum and its natural microsporidian parasite, Nosema whitei, to test for {{the relative importance of}} two separate evolutionary forces (drift and parasite-induced selection) on the maintenance of genetic variation. Our results demonstrate that coevolution with parasites indeed counteracts drift as coevolving populations had significantly higher levels of heterozygosity and allelic diversity. Genetic drift remained a strong force, strongly reducing genetic variation and increasing genetic differentiation in small populations. To our surprise, differentiation between the evolving populations was smaller when they coevolved with parasites, suggesting <b>parallel</b> <b>balancing</b> selection.

40|$|Understandings of, and {{objectives}} for, Interaction Design have been extended {{over the last}} few decades. Firstly, a single user-centred focus for Interaction Design is no longer regarded as adequate where any single central focus for design is now questioned. Post-centric approaches such as Balanced, Integrated and Generous (BIG) Design propose to achieve a broadened worth-focused content scope for Interaction Design, where worth is the balance of increasing benefits over reducing costs and generosity of choice. Secondly, there has been a broadened scope for disciplinary values in Human-Computer Interaction research, with the initial engineering and human science values of User-Centred Design and Human-Computer Interaction now complemented by the rapidly maturing creative field of Research through Design (RtD). Thirdly, RtD as a form of creative reflective practice does not have a sequential process, but needs parallel activities that can achieve total iteration potential (i. e., no restrictions on iteration sequences). Structured reflective tools such as the Working to Choose Framework may reveal this potential. An important opportunity remained that a complete challenging case study that integrated these domains (worth-focus) and tools (RtD, structured reflection) was carried out. The case study addressed the challenging social issues associated with supporting care circles of individuals with disabilities. It is original in completely tracking the combination of RtD with worth-focused Interaction Design, supported by established user-centred practices.

Many mathematical models for random networks have been proposed to capture {{the diversity of the}} real-world processes. Capturing the degree distribution {{is one of the most}} important aspects of these models. Many of the models can only produce random networks with predefined degree distribution. Chung–Lu model is a general random network model, which can produce networks with any arbitrary degree distribution. The complex systems we deal with are growing larger, and generating random networks with billions of nodes and edges or more has become a necessity. Generation of such massive networks requires efficient and parallel algorithms.
