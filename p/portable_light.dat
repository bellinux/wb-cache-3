25|$|With the {{successful}} {{outcome of the}} court case against the NCAA, more late afternoon and night games were scheduled in Norman and television schedules changed during the season, requiring large <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> trucks to take up space on campus {{while waiting for the}} next televised game. It was not until 1997 that permanent television lights were installed in the four corners of the stadium, along with a new south end zone video scoreboard to replace the antiquated main scoreboard.|$|E
25|$|For {{the thermal}} vision, {{infrared}} film {{could not be}} used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths. The filmmakers used an inframetrics thermal video scanner as it gave good heat images of objects and people. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from glow sticks used by campers and mixed with personal lubricant for texture. The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper pin registered on <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were composited by the optical crew for the finished effects. Additional visual effects, mainly for the opening title sequence of the Predator arriving on Earth, were supplied by Dream Quest Images (later Oscar-winners for their work on The Abyss and Total Recall). The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Visual Effects.|$|E

25|$|At the time, Owen Field did {{not have}} {{permanent}} artificial lighting sufficient for television broadcasts at night. This meant that untelevised home games had to start {{in the morning or}} early afternoon so as to be completed by dark, because the cost of leasing a set of portable lights was too high for a game that would not earn enough revenue to pay for those lights. For all televised games, portable lights on trucks were rented – but the leasing costs cut into the university's revenue, and often the four or five <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> trucks stayed on campus for weeks in anticipation of the next televised game. True night games were difficult to play in Norman because of the amount of portable lighting needed to illuminate the field adequately for spectators to see the players, much less the light required for television. Prior to 1982, the university knew which games would be televised and could plan months ahead for leasing the necessary lighting.|$|E

50|$|HID lamps {{are used}} in {{high-performance}} bicycle headlamps, as well as flashlights and other <b>portable</b> <b>lights,</b> because they produce {{a great amount of}} light per unit of power.

50|$|Although {{the weapon}} did see some action in World War I, the BAR {{did not become}} {{standard}} issue in the U.S. Army until 1938, when it was issued to squads as a <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> machine gun. The BAR saw extensive service in both World War II and the Korean War and saw limited service in the Vietnam War. The U.S. Army began phasing out the BAR in the late 1950s, when {{it was intended to}} be replaced by a SAW variant of the M14, and was without a <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> machine gun until the introduction of the M60 machine gun in 1957. The M60, however, was really a GPMG, a general-purpose machine gun, and was used as a SAW only because the U.S. Army had no other tool for the job until the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the mid-1980s.|$|E
