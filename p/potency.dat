5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its <b>potency</b> (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and <b>potency</b> ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% <b>potency</b> of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% <b>potency.</b>|$|E
5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The <b>potency</b> of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the <b>potency</b> of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the <b>potency</b> of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

TMC 207 had the strongest bactericidal efficacy, while rifapentine was the strongest contributor to sterilizing efficacy. The rank order of sterilizing <b>potencies</b> was different from the rank order of bactericidal <b>potencies,</b> underlining the importance of prioritizing new regimens designed to shorten the treatment duration by their sterilizing <b>potencies</b> rather than by their bactericidal <b>potencies.</b> Both 3 months of treatment with a regimen combining TMC 207, pyrazinamide, and rifapentine and 5 months of treatment with a regimen combining TMC 207, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin resulted in relapse rates similar to the rate obtained by 6 months of treatment with rifampin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide...|$|R

5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total <b>potency</b> varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their <b>potency</b> for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Biologic {{effects of}} high homeopathic <b>potencies</b> {{can be studied}} in cell {{cultures}} using cell lines or primary cells. We hypothesized that primary cells would be more apt to respond to high <b>potencies</b> than cell lines, especially cancer cell lines. We set out to investigate the effects of low doses and high homeopathic po-tencies of cadmium chloride, respectively, in an intoxication model with human primary lymphocytes com-pared to a human leukemia cell line (Jurkat). Design: Cells were pretreated with either low concentrations (nM–M) or high <b>potencies</b> (pool 15 – 20 c) of cadmium for 120 hours, following which they were exposed to a toxic treatment {{with a range of}} cadmium con-centrations (8 – 80 M) during 24 hours. Cell viability was eventually assessed by use of the MTS/PES assay. Controls included a vehicle (NaCl 0. 9 %) for the low concentrations of cadmium or water 15 – 20 c for cadmium 15 – 20 c. A total of 34 experiments were conducted, 23 with low concentrations and 11 with high <b>potencies</b> of cadmium. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Results: Pretreatment with low concentrations or high <b>potencies</b> of cadmium significantly increased cell vi-ability in primary lymphocytes after toxic challenge, compared to control cells (mean effect standard error 19 % 0. 9 % for low concentrations respectively 8 % 0. 6 % for high <b>potencies</b> of cadmium; p 0. 001 in both cases). The pretreatment effect of low doses was significant also in cancerous lymphocytes (4 % 0. 5 %; p 0. 001), albeit weaker than in normal lymphocytes. However, high homeopathic <b>potencies</b> had no effect on can-cerous lymphocytes (1 % 1. 9 %; p 0. 45). Conclusions: High homeopathic <b>potencies</b> exhibit a biologic effect on cell cultures of normal primary lym-phocytes. Cancerous lymphocytes (Jurkat), having lost the ability to respond to regulatory signals, seem to be fairly unresponsive to high homeopathic <b>potencies...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} design of simple, chemical systems for investigating the nature of homeopathic medicines has {{led to the development of}} an experimental protocol in which solvatochromic dyes are used as molecular probes of serially diluted and agitated solutions. Electronic spectroscopy has been used to follow changes in the absorbance of this class of dyes across the visible spectrum in the presence of homeopathic <b>potencies.</b> Evidence is presented using six different solvatochromic dyes in three different solvent systems. In all cases homeopathic <b>potencies</b> produce consistent and reproducible changes in the spectra of the dyes. Results suggest that <b>potencies</b> influence the supramolecular chemistry of solvatochromic dyes, enhancing either dye aggregation or disaggregation, depending upon dye structure. Comparable dyes lacking the intramolecular charge transfer feature of solvatochromic dyes are unaffected by homeopathic <b>potencies,</b> suggesting <b>potencies</b> require the oscillating dipole of solvatochromic dyes for effective interaction. The implications of the results presented, both for an eventual understanding of the nature of homeopathic medicines and their mode of action, together with future directions for research in this area, are discussed...|$|R

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high <b>potency</b> and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
