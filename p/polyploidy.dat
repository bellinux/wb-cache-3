5|$|In 1935, Stebbins {{was offered}} a {{genetics}} research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist E. B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus Crepis and was interested in developing Crepis into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, Crepis commonly hybridized, displayed <b>polyploidy</b> (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic Crepis species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by <b>polyploidy</b> and apomixis.|$|E
5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} {{more readily}} than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often.

30|$|Although array-CGH {{has several}} {{advantages}} {{compared to the}} conventional G-banding analysis, it is more costly and incapable of finding some <b>polyploidies</b> such as 69,XXX, 92,XXXX, 92,XXYY and balanced translocations (van den Berg et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2012; Dhillon et al. 2013). <b>Polyploidies</b> cause about 5 – 10  % of all first-trimester miscarriage (van den Berg et al. 2012). Balanced translocations are {{not the cause of}} miscarriage, but the findings suggest that either parent could be a balanced carrier and the results of parental karyotyping become useful information for future pregnancies. Therefore, the traditional G-banding analysis should be primarily performed for the specimens collected by D&C in the setting of RPL. If, however, the quality of specimens is poor for the G-banding analysis due to spontaneous discharge, array-CGH supplemented with STR analysis can be a powerful technique for cytogenetic evaluation of miscarriage, since STR analysis allows for the detection of triploidy and part of tetraploidy as well as maternal contamination.|$|R
40|$|Regioisomers of pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene quinones {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to induce {{structural}} and numerical aberrations and spindle disturbance in Chinese hamster epithelial liver (CHEL) cells in culture. All quinones tested were clastogenic. Pyrene- 1, 8 -quinone (P- 1, 8 -Q) and benzo[a]pyrene- 3, 6 -quinone (BP- 3, 6 -Q) induced strikingly high levels of triradials. In addition, dicentrics and ring chromosomes were very common in BP- 3, 6 -Q-treated cultures. Isomers of these compounds, pyrene- 1, 6 -quinone (P- 1, 6 -Q) and benzo[a]pyrene- 1, 6 -quinone (BP- 1, 6 -Q), induced unobtrusive patterns of chromosomal aberrations. We suspect that the P- 1, 8 -Q and BP- 3, 6 -Q moieties bound to the DNA were still reactive, and formed crosslinks and/or underwent redox cycling leading to high local concentrations of reactive oxygen species. In addition, P- 1, 8 -Q and BP- 3, 6 -Q induced c-mitoses, hyperdiploidies and <b>polyploidies,</b> in particular endoreduplications.

He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.|$|E
5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and <b>polyploidy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, the cytological {{basis of}} the gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} extended from about 1900–1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant Hybridization and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of <b>polyploidy</b> and hybridization in speciation and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology.|$|E

The experiments were done in vivo using cytogenetic analysis on BALB/c mouse bone marrow cells. The occurrence of chromosomal alterations was monitored in bone marrow and germ cells. The clastogenic effect of Tiamulin S was monitored at three doses (0. 01 ml/kg, 0. 2 ml/kg and 0. 4 ml/kg) through eight experimental cycles. The results obtained showed that Tiamulin S induces kariotype changes including both numerical (aneuploidies and <b>polyploidies)</b> and structural chromosomal aberrations (lesions, breaks and Robertsonian translocations). Thus, Tiamulin S exerts genotoxic potential. In addition, a clear dose-response effect was observed in this investigation...|$|R

5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses.

5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and <b>polyploidy</b> were also subject to selection.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through <b>polyploidy</b> (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E

40|$|Background: Overall, HER 2 -amplified female {{breast cancer}} (FBC) is {{associated}} with a high grade, an aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis. In male breast cancer (MBC) amplification of HER 2, located on chromosome 17, occurs at a lower frequency than in FBC, where it is part of complex rearrangements. So far, only few studies have addressed the occurrence of chromosome 17 alterations in small MBC cohorts. Methods: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect and characterize copy number changes on chromosome 17 in a cohort of 139 MBC. The results obtained were compared to those in FBC, and were correlated with clinicopathological features and patient outcome data. Results: We observed a lower frequency of chromosome 17 copy number changes with less complex rearrangement patterns in MBC compared to FBC. Chromosome 17 changes in MBC included gains of 17 q and losses of 17 p. Whole chromosome 17 <b>polyploidies</b> were not encountered. Two recurrent chromosome 17 amplicons were detected: on 17 q 12 (encompassing the NEUROD 2, HER 2, GRB 7 and IKZF 3 gens) and on 17 q 23. 1 (encompassing the MIR 21 and RPS 6 KB 1 genes). Whole arm copy number gains of 17 q were associated with decreased 5  year survival rates (p = 0. 010). Amplification of HER 2 was associated with a high tumor grade, but did not predict patient survival. Although copy number gains of HER 2 and NEUROD 2 were associated with a high tumor grade, a high mitotic count and a decreased 5  year survival rate (p = 0. 015), only tumor size and NEUROD 2 copy number gains emerged as independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: In MBC chromosome 17 shows less complex rearrangements and fewer copy number changes compared to FBC. Frequent gains of 17 q, encompassing two distinct amplicons, and losses of 17 p were observed, but no whole chromosome 17 <b>polyploidies.</b> Only NEUROD 2 gains seem to have an independent prognostic impact.

40|$|Fluorescent {{chromosome}} analysis technologies have advanced {{our understanding of}} genome organization during the last 30 years and have enabled the investigation of DNA organization and structure {{as well as the}} evolution of chromosomes. Fluorescent chromosome staining allows even small chromosomes to be visualized, characterized by their composition and morphology, and counted. Aneuploidies and <b>polyploidies</b> can be established for species, breeding lines, and individuals, including changes occurring during hybridization or tissue culture and transformation protocols. Fluorescent in situ hybridization correlates molecular information of a DNA sequence with its physical location on chromosomes and genomes. It thus allows determination of the physical position of sequences and often is the only means to determine the abundance and distribution of DNA sequences that are difficult to map with any other molecular method or would require segregation analysis, in particular multicopy or repetitive DNA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{knowledge}} about miscarriages mainly concerns pregnancies {{of at least}} 8 [*]weeks' gestation. Information about the morphology and the genetic determinants of early aborted embryos remains limited. In addition, {{it is known that}} aneuploidies account for less than half of recurrent spontaneous abortions. We hypothesized that (recurrent) early pregnancy losses might have other genetic causes. METHOD: Products of conception from 51 couples with at least one previous miscarriage were collected by hystero-embryoscopy. The extracted DNA was analyzed by low resolution array comparative genomic hybridization and high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect aneuploidies, <b>polyploidies,</b> submicroscopic copy number variants or copy neutral loss of heterozygosity. RESULTS: Chromosomal aberrations were identified in 65. 6 % (21 / 32) of miscarriages and in 89 % (8 / 9) of anembryonic cases. Interestingly, 4 / 11 chromosomally euploid embryos contained regions of loss of heterozygosity > 5 [*]Mb, suggesting the miscarriages might be due to an underlying lethal recessive disease. CONCLUSION: Hystero-embryoscopic biopsy followed by array comparative genomic hybridization is a valuable diagnostic tool for early and recurrent miscarriages.

25|$|<b>Polyploidy</b> is a {{very common}} feature in plants. It is {{believed}} that at least half plants are or have been polyploids. <b>Polyploidy</b> leads to genome doubling, thus generating functional redundancy in most genes. The duplicated genes may attain new function, either by changes in expression pattern or changes in activity. <b>Polyploidy</b> and gene duplication {{are believed to be}} among the most powerful forces in evolution of plant form. It is not known though, why genome doubling is such a frequent process in plants. One probable reason is the production of large amounts of secondary metabolites in plant cells. Some of them might interfere in the normal process of chromosomal segregation, leading to polypoidy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyploidy,</b> {{where there}} are more than two sets of {{homologous}} chromosomes in the cells, occurs mainly in plants.

These data suggest that the neoplastic transformation of MM may occur early in the hematopoietic development. Chromosomal aberrations involving mainly subclones and considerable cellular heterogeneity with gain of a variety of copy numbers of the same chromosome were demonstrated within PCs, which may possibly be the result of an underlying defect of PCs in the control of their number of chromosomes. Whereas PCs showed evidence suggestive of increased polyploidization, MCs and LCs, which exhibited similar chromosomal patterns as the former, rarely did.

40|$|Background: At {{the end of}} 80 s, cloning {{technologies}} {{with the}} increase of the antibodies’ sensibility made easier the development of technologies based on Fluorescence in situ Hibridation (FISH). Nowadays, It’s widely used in the field of basic investigation as much as clinic diagnostic. Method: FISH is a technique that combines molecular biology with histochemistry way to detect specific nucleotide sequences so that chromosome’s section or even whole chromosome can be marked on metaphases cells (cell in division) and on attached cellular nucleus. This detection is realized using DNA fluorescence probes (marked with fluorophores), that can be different according to the structures manage to detect: large single-locus probes, small unique-sequence probes, chromosome- or region-specific “paints” or repetitive sequence probes and genomic DNA probes. Some of the applications of this technique is that can be so useful in the detection of numerical and structural chromosomal alterations such as <b>polyploidies</b> or genomic rearrangement, to mapping metaphases cells and even to detect bacteria or another type of microorganism. In addition, FISH allows us to monitoring diseases (antitumor therapies, quantification of genomic altered cells…) and the precise location of chromosomic broken spots on tumor searching for new genes involved in cancer and detect and map interested known genes.

Results: A total of 832 samples were finally analyzed. 368 (44. 23 %) were abnormal, in which 84. 24 % (310 / 368) were aneuploidies and 15. 76 % (58 / 368) were <b>polyploidies.</b> The first was trisomy 16 (121 / 310), followed by trisomy 22, and X monosomy. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of aneuploidy in the advanced maternal age group (≥ 35 years old) and young maternal age group (< 35 years old). However, the rate of trisomy 22 and the total rate of trisomies 21, 13, and 18 (the number of trisomy 21 plus trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 together) showed significantly different in two groups. We found no skewed sex ratio. There was no significant difference in the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent miscarriage and sporadic abortion or between the samples from previous artificial abortion and those from no previous artificial abortion. Conclusions: Aneuploidy is a principal factor of miscarriage and total parental age is a risk factor. There is no skewed sex ratio in spontaneous abortion. There is also no difference in the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent abortion and sporadic abortion or between previous artificial abortion and no previous induced abortion...|$|R
