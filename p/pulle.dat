40|$|In my {{revision}} of the Rubiaceae in <b>Pulle’s</b> Flora of Surinam two genera, viz. Pagamea and Perama, which are now usually included in this family, are relegated to an appendix. On account of its superior ovary Pagamea was formerly reckoned to the Loganiaceae, from where it was referred to the Rubiaceae by Baillon and K. Schumann, who were of opinion that its solitary ascending ovules, and the valvate aestivation of the corolla lobes assigned it a place among the Psychotrieae. I think however that they overestimated {{the value of these}} characters, which are of a rather general nature, and that Pagamea both in the structure of its inflorescence and in that of its flowers shows so little resemblance to the Psychotrieae {{that it is impossible to}} include it in this group.

40|$|My {{revision}} of the Burseraceae in <b>Pulle’s</b> Flora of Suriname is extended here to a monographic treatment of those Burseraceous genera of which representatives occur in Suriname. Engler’s monograph of this family dates from nearly sixty years ago, and since that time many new species have been published. These additions and {{the large number of}} minor and major problems which presented themselves, doubtless justify the publication of this study. I am bound to admit however that not all problems could be solved. The present paper is divided into a General Part and a Taxonomic Part. The critical remarks concerning the whole family and its tribes are dealt with in the General Part, and those referring to the separate genera and species {{are to be found in}} the appropriate place in the Taxonomic Part; to the former is added a list of general literature, and to the latter a list of collectors’ numbers and indices of vernacular and scientific names...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{appreciate}} the impact of Italian migrants on Australia’s colonial and early Federated societies, and how they managed their place and identities within urban and rural settings, it is necessary firstly to outline the approach of Australia’s official policies towards them while contextualising such an approach globally. There are also {{a number of problems}} associated not only with the notion of ‘Italians’, but with the idea of their migrant communities, or ‘colonies’ to which they were referred by the early 1900 s. This point engages the discourse on regionalism versus nationalism in terms of identity. Finally, the idea of invention needs to be placed {{in the context of the}} turn of the twentieth century for the experiences and responses of Italian migrants to be expanded from views that have acknowledged neither their dynamism nor the innovative approaches they applied to their situations. Each of these points can be discussed following [Giovanni]Pullè’s life and activities, and illustrated by examples from Australia’s history and the literature devoted to Italian emigration. In particular, analysis of <b>Pullè’s</b> involvement with his co-nationals renders the concept of inventing ‘Italians’ an important part of early Italo-Australian experience...|$|R

40|$|In {{trying to}} prepare {{the account of the}} Myrtaceae for <b>PULLE’s</b> Flora of Suriname I soon found that a {{revision}} of the Myrtaceae of whole Guiana, especially of French Guiana, and preferably also of the Amazonian district, is necessary. The account would be of little value as long as our knowledge of the synonymy and the distribution of the species is so incomplete. The Myrtaceae of Guiana have been treated by BERG in Linnaea XXVII (1855 — 56) p. 1 — 512, XXIX (1858) p. 207 — 256 and XXX (1861) p. 647 — 713. Yet many species previously described from French Guiana, especially by AUBLET and by DE CANDOLLE, were not known to BERG. Moreover, BERG often based species on insufficient material, as has been pointed out by URBAN in his revision of the West Indian Myrtaceae in Engl. Bot. Jahrb. XIX (1895) p. 563. In this publication of URBAN the synonymy of several species common to the West Indies and Guiana is cleared up (Trinidad and Tobago are included in the West Indies). Another valuable contribution is SAGOT’s too little noticed account of the Myrtaceae of French Guiana in Annales Sciences Naturelles 6. 20 (1885) p. 181 — 198. But SAGOT apparently did not know BERG’s last publication in Linnaea XXX, in which RICHARD’s collection from French Guiana is treated. Thus SAGOT sometimes cites specimens of RICHARD without knowing that they must be duplicates of the types of one of BERG’s new species and his account remains very incomplete...|$|R
40|$|Though an excellent, {{critical}} monograph of {{the genus}} Cassipourea was published some years ago by ALSTON (in Kew Bulletin, 1925, p. 241 — 276), I should {{like to make a}} few remarks on the South-American species of this genus as my revision for <b>PULLE’s</b> Flora of Suriname III. 2 has brought to light a few new facts. It will also give me an opportunity to refer to a publication of BRIQUET on some American representatives of this genus (in Candollea IV, 1931, p. 342 — 350), which disagrees with regard to a number of species with ALSTON’s interpretations. The species which covers the largest area is the chiefly West-Indian C. elliptica (Sw.) Poir. Formerly also a number of West- Brazilian and Peruvian specimens were referred to it, but ALSTON pointed out that these plants belonged to another species for which he introduced the name C. peruviana. A new West-Indian species, based on Broadway nr. 3841 and 4631, both from Tobago, was described by BRIQUET under the name C. Broadwayi. This species is, in my opinion, conspecific with C. elliptica. BRIQUET amply discussed the differences with C. latifolia Alston from Trinidad, but does not mention its relationship to C. elliptica., though, in view of the latter’s area of distribution, this would have been more to the point. That ALSTON had already referred Broadway nr. 3841 to C. elliptica was apparently overlooked by BRIQUET. In opposition to BRIQUET I agree with ALSTON that no value should be set on the varieties of C. elliptica described by GRISEBACH (Fl. Br. W. Ind. Isl., I 860, p. 274) ...|$|R
40|$|In my {{revision}} of the Turneraceae for <b>PULLE’s</b> Flora of Suriname, I have accepted the genera Piriqueta and Turnera in the delimitation given to them by URBAN. The distinction rests on the presence in Piriqueta of a “corona” at the insertion of the petals. This corona, however, is often so weakly developed as to be almost invisible, and as moreover, the African representatives of Piriqueta {{appear to be more}} easily distinguishable from the American ones than the latter from some of the Turneras, the taxonomic importance of this organ appears to be somewhat dubious. A decision of the question, however, would necessitate a more extensive study of the genera than the demands of the present revision would justify; owing to lack of material, moreover, such a study would be impossible at the present time. The only species by which the genus Piriqueta is represented in Suriname was split by Urban in a fairly large number of varieties, of which four have been quoted by him from Suriname, namely: the var. genuina, the var. latifolia, the var. foliosa and the var. bracteolata. The var. foliosa differs from the type mostly in a more luxuriant growth and is very probably nothing but a form growing under somewhat different conditions. The bracteoles of the var. bracteolata are rather variable in size, and even in the specimen quoted by URBAN in the main not different from those found in other plants; it is not impossible that the somewhat larger size of some of them {{may be due to the}} presence of parasites. The leaves of the var. latifolia are distinctly wider than those of the type, and it is not improbable that this difference will prove constant. A study in the field, eventually supplemented by culture experiments. however, would be necessary to decide the point. For the present it is perhaps better not to lay too much stress on this rather insignificant difference...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{appearance}} of my „Notes on the Rubiaceae of Surinam” (in Rec. d. Trav. bot. néerl. XXXI, 1934, 248; also in Meded. Bot. Mus. Herb. Utrecht no. 11, 1934) a number of species and varieties new to the flora of that country have come to light. The majority have been collected by Mr. Rombouts during the 1935 / 36 expedition of the Boundary Commission who is surveying at present the border {{in the southern part}} of the colony; they were found along the River Corantyne and in the savannahs in the south-western part. One species was secured by Dr. Lanjouw, and has been mentioned already in his „Additions to <b>Pulle’s</b> Flora of Surinam I” (in Rec. d. Trav. bot. Néerl. XXXII, 1935, 258) and one, represented by a rather poor fruiting specimen collected years ago by the Forestry Bureau, was found among material provisionally consigned to another family. New to the flora of Surinam are the following twelve species: Alseis longifolia Ducke var. pentamera Brem. n. var., Sabicea cinerea Aubl., S. Romboutsii Brem. n. spec., S. surinamensis Brem. n. spec., Tocoyena surinamensis Brem. n. spec., Thieleodoxa nitidula Brem. n. spec., Guettarda Spruceana Müll. Arg., Psychotria Romboutsii Brem. n. spec., Declieuxia fruticosa (Willd. ex R. et S.) Kuntze, Diodia pulchristipula Brem. n. spec., Spermacoce guianensis Brem. n. spec, and Borreria verticillata (L.) G. F. W. Mey (the B. verticillata of the Flora of Surinam IV, 287 proved to be B. suaveolens G. F. W. Mey., under which name it had been recorded already by Miquel), and one variety: Sipanea pratensis Aubl. var. glaberrima Brem. n. var. Four of the ten genera to which these species belong, namely Alseis, Thieleodoxa, Declieuxia and Spermacoce, are also new to the flora of Surinam. Seven species and two varieties are entirely new, and will be described below. Before entering on this part of my task I will make a few remarks however on two of the species known already from elsewhere, namely on Guettarda Spruceana Müll. Arg. and on Borreria verticillata (L.) G. F. W. Mey, and on a third species, Coccocypselum guyanense (Aubl.) K.
