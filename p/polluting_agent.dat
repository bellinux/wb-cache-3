40|$|We {{focus on}} {{the role played by}} waste policy and {{enforcement}} in determining waste related corruption. We develop a simple model in which an economic agent chooses the level of illegal disposal of its waste. The <b>polluting</b> <b>agent</b> can be detected by the local police authority. In the event of discovery of illegal waste disposal, the local administration may decide to report the agent's illegal activity (implying that the agent itself will have to pay a unit fine on such activity), or to protect the <b>polluting</b> <b>agent</b> in exchange for a bribe. The official in charge is herself subject to enforcement from the central government. By varying the exogenous enforcement and waste tax levels, we derive several interesting trade-offs among the goals of reducing corruption, financing legal disposal costs and illegal dumping. For example, high charges for legal disposal lead to increased illegal disposal and corruption. Also, somewhat surprisingly, a stricter enforcement on the regulated agent may lead to an increased likelihood of corruption and to higher rates of illegal disposal...|$|E
40|$|In 1 Corinthians Paul {{demands a}} strong {{control of the}} body from {{the members of the}} church in Corinth. The main reason for Paul’s demand for a strong bodily control is because of his concern of {{pollution}} or impurity that can affect the Corinthian body (church). Throughout 1 Corinthians Paul takes on various subjects that have the potential to pollute the embodiment. Porneia, “sexual immorality”, is one such <b>polluting</b> <b>agent</b> that can contaminate the embodiment and spread widely its negative influences. In this thesis I will specifically look into Paul’s concern about keeping the body away from porneia “sexual immorality” as seen in chapters 5 and 6. I will argue that Paul viewed the “Corinthian body” 1 as an entity that was polluted from within itself because of porneia and was concerned about the sustenance of the church. The thesis of this work is to argue that Paul considered the Corinthian “bodies” (both individual and group) as being at risk of spreading the polluting effects of porneia and to propose that the way to keep the “bodies” away from the <b>polluting</b> <b>agent</b> (porneia) would require each individual to know his/her “embodiment” and guard against contamination through the rituals of the community.

40|$|Motivated by the {{structure}} of existing pollution permit markets, we study the equilibrium path that results from allocating an initial stock of storable permits to a large <b>polluting</b> <b>agent</b> and a competitive fringe.

However, whenever the large agent’s endowment falls short of its efficient endowment –allocation profile that would exactly cover its emissions along the perfectly competitive path– the market power problem disappears, much like in a durable-good monopoly.

Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the validity of}} the Porter hypothesis in the presence of environmentally conscious consumers and asymmetry of information between the regulator and the <b>polluting</b> <b>agent.</b> Consumers are aware of the environmental damage caused by the production process and are willing to pay a higher price for the environmentally less damaging products. The regulator cannot observe the R&D effort of the firm. There are two implications of the Porter hypothesis. One, a policy based on best available technology hampers firms ’ incentives to invest in R&D effort for developing new and (environmentally) improved technology. Second, a stricter environmental regulation spurs innovation and thus improves welfare. We argue that the first implication is, indeed, true. As for the second, a stricter regulation is better, but the strictest possible regulation is not optimal...|$|E

In order to monitor sea levels of heavy metals are used specific bioindicators like Mytilus galloprovincialis whose sperm chromatin is organized by three protamine-like (PLII, PLIII and PLIV), which belong to sperm nuclear basic proteins. We report the effects of Cd 2 + on DNA, PLII and PLIII. Both PLII and PLIII acquired a slight proteinase K digestion resistance in the presence of metal. We also analyzed the self-association ability of PLII and PLIII Cd 2 +mediated. Turbidity assay showed that cadmium caused PLII but not PLIII aggregation, while glutaraldehyde produced a reduction of self-association ability for both proteins. Further, Cd 2 + induced a decreasing of PLII DNA binding affinity but an increasing for PLIII and promoted H 2 O 2 DNA damage even in the presence of Protamine-like.

In such natural systems Pb has two origins: a natural one and an anthropogenic one. In an interesting way Pb isotopic composition allows to distinguish these two origins. Geochemical characteristics of open field rain water, throughfall, soil solution, spring and stream-waters in the small granitic Strengbach catchment (Vosges, France) have been regulary determined for ten years (Probst et al., 1995; Dambrine t al., 1995) and specifically during hydrological event (Ladouche et a/., 1995).

Bioaccumulation of heavy metals is strictly monitored, {{because of its}} possible toxic effects. In this work, we utilized the EDX microanalysis {{in order to identify}} the potential heavy metal accumulation in the lung tissue.  To this aim, we enrolled 45 human lung biopsies: 15 non-small cell lung cancers, 15 lung benign lesions and 15 control biopsies. Lung samples were both paraffin embedded for light microscopy study and eponepoxid embedded for transmission electron microscopy. EDX microanalysis was performed on 100 nm thick unstained ultrathin-sections placed on specific copper grids. Our results demonstrated that the EDX technology was particularly efficient in the study of elemental composition of lung tissues, where we found heavy metals, such as Cobalt (Co), Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn) and Lead (Pb). Furthermore, in malignant lesions we demonstrated the presence of multiple bio-accumulated elements. In fact, a high rate of lung cancers was associated with the presence of 3 or more bio-accumulated elements compared to benign lesions and control tissue (91. 7 %, 0 %, 8. 3 %, respectively).

Toxicity assays involved the Microtox® test, the T. pyriformis population growth impairment test employing three different processes (flasks, tubes, microplates), and the T. pyriformis nonspecific esterase activities test. Several IC 50 or EC 50 values are reported for each molecule. Alachlor exerted a toxic effect on the two nontarget cells used. The results for diuron and its photo and biotransformation products indicated {{that most of the}} metabolites presented nontarget toxicity higher than that of diuron. Glyphosate and AMPA had a less negative effect on T. pyriformis than on V. fischeri. Nevertheless, in all cases, glyphosate was found to be more toxic than AMPA.

N 2, to degrade phenylurea herbicides, biotransformation assays were performed in mineral medium with resting cells of this soil bacterial strain on three phenylurea herbicides (diuron, chlorotoluron and isoproturon). Each herbicide considered, {{led to the formation of}} only one metabolite detected by HPLC analysis. After isolation, the metabolites were identified by NMR and MS, as the corresponding substituted anilines. According to the Microtox(R) test (realized on the bacterium Vibrio fischeri), these metabolites presented non-target toxicity far more important (up to 600 times higher for 4 -isopropylaniline) than the parent molecule. For isoproturon and chlorotoluron, the amount of substituted anilines obtained at the end of the biotransformation was very low, whereas the biotransformation of diuron into 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was almost quantitative. In this last case, the degradation product accumulated in the medium. In soil, other microorganisms are present that might degrade it. So the biotransformation of 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was then tested with four fungal strains: Aspergillus niger, Beauveria bassiana, Cunninghamella echinulata var. elegans and Mortierella isabellina. The aniline was further transformed with all the microorganisms tested. Only one metabolite was detected by HPLC analysis and after isolation, it was identified to be 3, 4 -dichloroacetanilide. This acetylated compound led to biological effects less important on V fischeri than 3, 4 -dichloroaniline.

METHODS: Data regarding the fuel leak accident with, which occurred in the Brasilia, Federal District, {{were obtained from the}} Fuel Distributor reports provided to the environmental authority. Information about the affected population (22 individuals) was obtained from focal groups of eight individuals. Length of exposure and water benzene concentration were estimated through a groundwater flow model associated with a benzene propagation model. The risk assessment was conducted according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry methodology. RESULTS: A high risk perception related to the health consequences of the accident was evident in the affected community (22 individuals), probably {{due to the lack of}} assistance and a poor risk communication from government authorities and the <b>polluting</b> <b>agent.</b> The community had been exposed to unsafe levels of benzene (> 5 &# 181;g/L) since December 2001, five months before they reported the leak. The mean benzene level in drinking water (72. 2 &# 181;g/L) was higher than that obtained by the Fuel Distributer using the Risk Based Corrective Action methodology (17. 2 &# 181;g/L). The estimated benzene intake from the consumption of water and food reached a maximum of 0. 0091 &# 181;g/kg bw/day (5 x 10 - 7 cancer risk per 106 individuals). The level of benzene in water vapor while showering reached 7. 5 &# 181;g/m 3 for children (1 per 104 cancer risk). Total cancer risk ranged from 110 to 200 per 106 individuals.
