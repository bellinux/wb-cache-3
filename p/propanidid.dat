50|$|<b>Propanidid</b> is an ultra short-acting {{phenylacetate}} general anesthetic. It {{was originally}} introduced by Bayer in 1963 but anaphylactic reactions {{caused it to}} be withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to develop eugenol {{derivatives}} as intravenous anesthetics, as an alternative to <b>propanidid</b> which produces unacceptable side effects around the site of injection in many patients.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that the toxic effects or {{reactions}} to <b>propanidid</b> (and Althesin) were due to the drugs themselves.

This suggest that the negative reactions were mainly caused by Cremophor and not by the drug substances themselves.|$|E
40|$|Twelve rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm {{preparations}} {{were used}} to investigate the neuro-muscular interactions of <b>propanidid,</b> suxamethonium, tubocurarine and mipafox (an anticholinesterase compound). The potentiation of suxamethonium by <b>propanidid</b> was demonstrated to be a neuromuscular effect, and was increased by chemical inactivation of cholinesterase. A complex interaction between tubocurarine and <b>propanidid</b> was found. A hypothesis for these actions of <b>propanidid</b> is propounded. Suxamethonium produces a more prolonged period of apnoea after a <b>propanidid</b> induction of anaesthesia than after the same dose of suxameth-onium following a barbiturate induction (Howells et al., 1964; Clarke, Dundee and Daw, 1964). The site of this potentiation has not so far been conclusively demonstrated {{and it is the}} purpose of this paper to present pharmacological evidence of a probable site and mechanism of action...|$|E
40|$|The binding of [3 H]muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) {{receptor}} agonist, to a membrane preparation from pig {{cerebral cortex}} was {{enhanced by the}} anaesthetic <b>propanidid</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. At 0 degrees C, binding was stimulated to 220 % of control values, with 50 % stimulation at 60 microM-propanidid. At 37 degrees C, <b>propanidid</b> caused a more powerful stimulation of [3 H]muscimol binding (340 % of control values). <b>Propanidid</b> (1 mM) exerted {{little effect on the}} affinity of muscimol binding (KD approx. 10 nM), but increased the apparent number of high-affinity binding sites in the membrane by 2 -fold. Enhancement of [3 H]muscimol binding was observed only in the presence of Cl- ions, half-maximal activation being achieved at approx. 40 mM-Cl-. Picrotoxinin inhibited the stimulation of [3 H]muscimol binding by <b>propanidid</b> with an IC 50 (concentration causing 50 % inhibition) value of approx. 25 microM. The enhancement of [3 H]muscimol binding by <b>propanidid</b> was not additive with the enhancement produced by secobarbital. Phenobarbital inhibited the effect of <b>propanidid</b> and secobarbital. The GABA receptor was solubilized with Triton X- 100 or with Chaps [3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]propanesulphonate]. <b>Propanidid</b> and secobarbital did not stimulate the binding of [3 H]muscimol after solubilization with Triton X- 100. However, the receptor could be solubilized by 5 mM-Chaps with retention of the stimulatory effects of <b>propanidid</b> and secobarbital. Unlike barbiturates, <b>propanidid</b> did not stimulate the binding of [3 H]flunitrazepam to membranes. It is suggested that the ability to modulate the [3 H]muscimol site of the GABA-receptor complex may be a common and perhaps functional characteristic of general anaesthetics...|$|E
40|$|<b>PROPANIDID,</b> an ultra short-acting non-barbiturate compound, {{has been}} {{successfully}} used as an intravenous anaesthetic agent. 1 - 5 Dundee and Clarke have compared thiopentone, <b>propanidid,</b> G 29505, and methohexitone as intravenous agents. 4 The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to compare thiopentone and <b>propanidid</b> as induction agents for short operative procedures.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} in adults aged 20 - 60 years comparing the interaction of <b>propanidid</b> or thiopentone with the muscle relaxant suxamethonium. An attempt was made to correlate the apnoea time with the incidence and severity of muscle pains. No correlation was found between the apnoea times and the incidence of muscle pains. The overall incidence of muscle pains was 19 per cent. The older age-groups of both sexes had a significantly shorter apnoea time with <b>propanidid</b> Than with thiopentone, when the drugs were used in combination with suxamethonium; this was also true of the young females. On the other hand, {{there was no difference in}} the young males between <b>propanidid</b> and thiopentone and their interaction with suxamethonium, but young men had a higher incidence of muscle pains than anybody else.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been observed that with methohexitone and <b>propanidid</b> the incidence and severity of induction side effects increases with increase in dosage. A mixture containing methohexitone 10 mg and <b>propanidid</b> 25 mg per ml was used as main anaesthetic agent with nitrous oxide-oxygen for a standard operative procedure in adult females. It was anticipated that the mixture would be followed by fewer side effects than comparable doses of <b>propanidid</b> and methohexitone alone. This hope was fulfilled and {{it proved to be}} a satisfactory induction agent. Dosage studies showed that there was some loss of potency, which is more likely to have affected the <b>propanidid</b> component in view of the pH of the mixture (10. 15). It became more acid on storage over six weeks and there was further detectable loss of potency. It is recommended that methohexitone-propanidid mixtures should only be used when freshly prepared. The scope of intravenous anaesthesia has been increased in recent years by the availability of drugs with a shorter duration of action than thiopentone, particularly methohexitone (Brietal...|$|E
40|$|Manual {{dilatation}} of the anus {{was carried}} out on 50 unpremedicated outpatients under <b>propanidid,</b> nitrous oxide, and halothane anaesthesia with E. C. G. monitoring. About half of the patients received intravenous atropine with the <b>propanidid.</b> The operation induced a variety of changes in heart rate but in the whole experiment only two isolated cardiac arrhythmic complexes were seenâ€”a single defect of conduction and a solitary ventricular extrasystole. Changes in rate were not modified by atropine. It is concluded that manual dilatation of the anus is a safe procedure when carried out under the anaesthetic described and that prior medication with atropine is not necessary.

40|$|The acute haemodynamic efifects of thiopentone, methohexitone and <b>propanidid</b> {{have been}} {{compared}} in anaesthetized dogs. All three drugs caused {{a reduction in}} arterial blood pressure and minor changes in cardiac output, but whereas thiopentone and metho-hexitone had similar effects <b>propanidid</b> {{was found to be}} three times as potent as thio-pentone in its effect upon arterial systolic pressure. Thiopentone and methohexitone had slight effects upon right ventricular pressures, whilst <b>propanidid</b> markedly increased right ventricular systolic pressure. Intravenous agents which produce loss of consciousness in one arm-brain circulation time commonly cause some degree of circulatory dis-turbance.

40|$|<b>Propanidid</b> {{followed}} by intravenous atropine and suxamethonium induced anaphylaxis in a 29 -year-old woman. The patient {{had previously been}} exposed to suxamethonium and atropine but the episode reported here occurred after initial exposure to <b>propanidid.</b> The patient's leucocytes eight weeks after anaesthesia released histamine in vitro {{in the presence of}} both <b>propanidid</b> and atropine. Histamine release, however, could not be demonstrated at 17 and 22 weeks after anaesthesia, hence the adverse reaction in this context was transient in nature. The abnormal response to these drugs {{does not appear to be}} dependent upon immunological mechanisms, but is in all probability idiosyncratic. Abnormal reactions to drugs used in general anaes-thesia are an increasingly difficult problem. Anaes-thetics and other substances used in anaesthesia are able to release histamine and may induce anaphy-lactoid responses which can be severe and may have a fatal outcome.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{laryngoscopy}} {{and the introduction}} of a bronchography tube on blood pressure, heart rate, rhythm and plasma catecholamines was studied in 30 patients during three different modes of anaesthesia induction (thiopentone 5 mg/kg followed by suxamethonium 1 mg/kg, <b>propanidid</b> 7 mg/kg followed by suxamethonium 0. 2 mg/kg and <b>propanidid</b> 10 mg/kg). Laryngoscopy and intubation caused an increase in systolic blood pressure in all groups, although the increase was not statistically signifi-cant after <b>propanidid</b> alone. Levels of total plasma catecholamines, measured during and two minutes after laryngoscopy, remained unchanged in all groups. The preanaes-thetic content of noradrenaline as a percentage of total catecholamines was higher in those patients who developed a more marked increase in blood pressure during laryngo-scopy and intubation.

40|$|Background: Soft {{drugs are}} {{molecules}} that are purposefully {{designed to be}} rapidly metabolized (metabolically labile). In anesthesia, the soft drug is useful because it enables precise titration to effect and rapid recovery, which might allow swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness and early home readiness. Propofol may cause delayed awakening after prolonged infusion. <b>Propanidid</b> and AZD 3043 have a different metabolic pathway compared to propofol, resulting in a short-acting clinical profile. Fluorine imparts a variety of properties to certain medicines, including an enhanced absorption rate and improved drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. We hypothesized that the introduction of fluorine to the frame structure of <b>propanidid</b> and AZD 3043 would further accelerate the swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness. To test this hypothesis, we developed a series of fluorine-containing phenyl acetate derivatives. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fluorine-containing phenyl acetate derivatives were synthesized, and their hypnotic potencies and durations of LORR following bolus or infusion administration were determined in mice, rats and rabbits. The metabolic half-lives {{in the blood of}} various species were determined chromatographically. In vitro radioligand binding and c-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor electrophysiology studies were performed. Among the 12 synthesized fluorine-containing phenyl acetate derivatives, compound 5 j induced comparable duration of LORR with AZD 3043, but more rapid recovery than AZD 3043, <b>propanidid</b> and propofol. The time of compound 5 j to return to walk and behavioral recovery ar...|$|E
40|$|CT 1341 {{is a new}} {{intravenous}} anaesthetic {{which appears}} to have overcome the dis-advantages of the earlier steroid.

The advent of <b>propanidid</b> and subsequent work on this agent (Horatz, Frey and Zindler, 1965; Doenicke et al., 1968) suggested that rapid and complete recovery from anaesthesia was more likely to follow the use of a non-barbiturate whose reversal depended on breakdown or ex-cretion than the use of a barbiturate dependent mainly on redistribution.

40|$|Using a new, highly {{sensitive}} and specific method for {{the determination of}} histamine in human plasma, it was shown that release of histamine followed injection of <b>propanidid</b> and thiopentone. Observations of gastric secretion, arterial pressure and pulse rate supported these findings. In normal persons the release of histamine had no special clinical significance. On the other hand, when anaphylactoid reactions occurred following <b>propanidid</b> injection histamine release was so massive as to explain the severe clinical signs and symptoms observed. In this study no reactions occurred following thiopentone injection. Although {{it seems likely that}} massive histamine release can occur during anaphylactoid reactions with this anaesthetic, we have no observations to confirm this. In one case it was shown that premedication with glucocorticoids and anti-histaminics and therapy with plasma substitutes could prevent the development of a severe reaction. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{anaesthetic}} {{techniques for}} blind nasal intubation have been compared. The first consisted of <b>propanidid,</b> followed if necessary by nitrous oxide, oxygen, halothane and carbon dioxide, {{and the second}} of thiopentone, nitrous oxide, oxygen, halothane and carbon dioxide. The success rate in three or less attempts with <b>propanidid</b> was 75 per cent and with the thiopentone-carbon dioxide sequence 53 per cent. The ultimate success rate was similar in both groups. Many anaesthetists may not accept that blind nasal intubation is a satisfactory technique for a routine case, despite certain advantages, such as the avoidance of suxamethonium with its possible ill effects. Few would disagree that on occasions it can be lifesaving. In the ward, blind nasal intubation of the awake patient with postoperative pulmonary complications is a simple way of providing a route for endobron-chial toilet (Gold and Buechel, 1960; Gillespie, 1963). Nevertheless, the technique has fallen out of favour, and few junior anaesthetists are {{given the opportunity to}} learn it. Much practice on routine cases is necessary in order to acquire the skill to employ the method with confidence when it is strongly indicated for a difficult case. References to the method in recent literature may indicate renewed interest in this classical technique (Thomas, 1969; Nolan, 1969; Mostert, 1969). Because of the known respiratory stimulation accompanying its use, <b>propanidid</b> could be expected to facilitate blind nasal intubation. To assess its value, a technique using <b>propanidid</b> was compared with the more usual method, employing thiopentone with an inhalation agent, and carbon dioxide. METHOD Blind nasal intubation was attempted by the author in 172 patients. Anaesthesia was induced with pro-panidid in 84 patients (31 males) and with thiopen-tone in 88 (34 males).

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{histamine}} release {{was investigated in}} 16 volunteers by means of plasma histamine determination after the administration of etomidate, Althesin, <b>propanidid,</b> and Cremophor EL. Althesin and <b>propanidid</b> caused release of histamine in various degrees of frequency.

Histamine was, indeed, only released to such an extent (with the exception of one borderline case) that no clinical symptoms other than secretion of gastric juice and erythema were to be expected. After the application of etomidate and Cremophor EL an increase in plasma histamine was not detectable. Changes in the differential Wood picture in terms of a decrease in basophils only occurred after Althesin and propanidid; not, however, after etomidate and Cremophor EL.

40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{study of the}} effects of diazepam as an adjuvant to <b>propanidid</b> anaes-thesia for legal abortion has shown that the incidence of nausea and vomiting was significandy reduced as a result of giving diazepam, and that, in general, the conditions of anaesthesia were more acceptable widi diazepam. The diazepam group had a pro-longation of the time to recovery of consciousness but this was not considered unacceptable. Diazepam has continued to attract the interest of anaesthetists since its introduction in 1961 (Randall et al., 1961) and its use in anaesthesia has been reviewed by Dundee and Haslett (1970). Although the drug is seldom indicated as the sole anaesthetic agent, it is useful as an adjuvant to many types of intravenous and inhalation anaesthesia. Diazepam has few undesirable cardiovascular effects (Stovner and Endresen, 1966). Bradycardia occurs occasion-ally but is prevented readily by atropine. There are great individual variations in the response to the drug and in the dose required to induce sleep (Brown and Dundee, 1968). In addition, it has been noted that patients premedicated with opiates may become apnoeic as a result of muscular hypotonia and depression of the respiratory centre (Hunter, 1967). <b>Propanidid</b> is widely used as an ultra-short acting anaesthetic (Wynards and Burfoot, 1965). In clinical use the drug causes characteristic changes in the respiratory pattern; a period of initial hyperventila-tion being followed by a period of hypoventilation (Harnick, 1964). In the series of Wynards and Bur-foot the incidence of nausea with or without vomit-ing was 30 %, but this may have been partially die result of the other drugs employed in their method of anaesthesia. These authors also observed a decrease in arterial pressure in 89 % of their patients. Since 1965 we have used <b>propanidid</b> as the sole anaesthetic for short procedures (Manila, Hakalehto and Babinski, 1966). However, in some patients, the duration of its effect has been too short and supple-mentary doses have been required. On occasions unco-ordinated movements by the patient have bee...|$|E

This investigation {{was limited to}} the first 10 minutes after induction. A significant decrease of plasma potassium concentration (0. 24 - 0. 29 m. equiv/ 1.) was observed with thiopentone, methohexitone and diazepam. <b>Propanidid</b> and Althesin were investigated at two dose levels. <b>Propanidid</b> 10 mg/kg showed a small but signifi-cant mean peak rise of 0. 06 m. equiv/ 1. of plasma potassium.

However, muscle relaxants are usually given immediately following the administration of an intravenous induction agent. In order to carry out a meaningful study of the effect of the relaxants on plasma electrolytes one must know what influence the induction agents have on the potassium, sodium and chloride concentrations.

Increased sensitivity to somatic pain following injection of sub-anaesthetic doses of thiopentone has been demonstrated by Clutton-Brock (1960) and Dundee (1960). This also applies to metho-hexitone (Dundee, 1964). When working with <b>propanidid,</b> Dundee and Clarke (1965) found evidence of a transient analgesic action which was of too short a duration to be of any clinical use. In this study, no increased sensitivity to pain was found during recovery from large doses. Althesin is a new steroid induction agent...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{complement}} {{conversion and}} white cell variations {{were made on}} sequential blood samples obtained from a single volunteer following repeated administration of Althesin. The results suggest a mechanism by which a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction to the drug might be mediated. Studies of patients receiving routine anaesthesia revealed a very high incidence of sub-clinical "hypersensitivity " reaction, some of which appear to be immune-mediated. These reactions occurred irrespective of whether the patients were induced with Althesin, methohexitone or <b>propanidid.</b> Althesin (Glaxo Laboratories Ltd, Greenford, Middlesex) comprises the potent pregnane derivative anaesthetic drug, 3 <x hydroxy- 5 a pregnane- 11, 20 dione (alphaxalone), a surfactant (cremophor) and a co-solubilizing related steroid (alphadolone acetate). Although Althesin is a satisfactory induction agent, a number of adverse reactions which resemble immediate hypersensitivity responses have bee...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} of general anaesthesia involving {{the use of}} <b>propanidid,</b> nitrous oxide, oxygen and halothane followed by a slow injection of suxamethonium and lignocaine is described. The technique decreased the increase in serum potassium concentration that follows the injection of suxamethonium and,it is suggested, possesses advantagesoverthe existing practice of the injection of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs before suxamethonium {{in an attempt to}} reduce the frequency of serious cardiac arrhythmia. The i. v. injection of suxamethonium 50 mg has been shown to increase the serum concentration of potassium by 0. 2 - 0. 4 mmol litre" 1 (Bah", Dundee and Assaf, 1975). The author has described previously a {{technique of}} general anaesthesia that decreases the frequency and force of fasciculations after suxa-methonium (Fry, 1975 a) and the frequency and severity of the subsequent muscle pains (Fry, 1975 b). <b>Propanidid</b> was followed by nitrous oxide, oxygen and halothane until spontaneous breathing was estab-lished, when a mixture of lignocaine 0. 75 mg kg" 1 and suxamethonium 0. 35 mg kg" 1 was injected slowly i. v. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that the technique modifies the increase in the serum potas-sium following suxamethonium. METHODS One hundred consecutive patients were anaesthetized by the author and received a single dose of suxa-methonium to facilitate tracheal intubation. The patients were divided randomly into two groups (control and lignocaine). Control group. 22 males, average age 41. 2 (SD 17. 6) yr, range 16 - 76 yr; 28 females, average age 46. 6 (SD 21. 8) yr, range 12 - 85 yr. Lignocaine group. 24 males, average age 40. 9 (SD 19. 6) yr, range 15 - 70 yr; 26 females, average age 44. 5 (SD 21. 8) yr, range 12 - 84 yr. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. All the patients were premedicated with metoclo-pramide 20 mg and diazepam 20 mg orally approxi-mately 90 min before operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of 8 -aminolaevulinic acid synthase (E. C. 2, 3. 1. 37) (the rate-limiting enzyme for haem and porphynn biosynthesis) has been {{measured in the}} rat liver after the repeated administration of anaesthetic agents in vivo. The {{activity of}} the enzyme was increased by Althesin, chlordiazepoxide, enfiuranej etomidate, lignocaine, methohexitone, methoxyflurane, pentazocine and thiopentone and decreased by procaine. No significant changes in activity occurred after the administration of amethocaine, atropine, bupivacaine, diazepam, droperidol, halothane, ketamine, morphine, nitrous oxide, pethidine, phenoperidine, prilocaine and <b>propanidid.</b> It is suggested that those anaesthetic agents which induced activity of the enzyme should not be administered to patients with an acute porphyria. Drugs are the commonest of the exogenous factors which can precipitate attacks of the acute porphyrias, and the barbiturates are implicated most commonly (Eales, 1971). Although information about the por-phyrinogenic effects of anaesthetic agents {{is essential to the}} management of anaesthesia in individuals wit...|$|E
