60|$|Before {{he crossed}} the Madras territory, he overtook the Vakeel, or {{messenger}} of the British Government, of whom Esdale had spoken. This man, accustomed for a sum of money to permit adventurous European traders who desired to visit Hyder's capital, to share his <b>protection,</b> <b>passport,</b> and escort, was not disposed to refuse the same good office to a gentleman of credit at Madras; and, propitiated by an additional gratuity, undertook to travel as speedily as possible. It was a journey which was not prosecuted without much fatigue and considerable danger, as they had to traverse a country frequently exposed to all the evils of war, more especially when they approached the Ghauts, those tremendous mountain-passes which descend from the table-land of Mysore, and through which the mighty streams that arise in {{the centre of the}} Indian peninsula, find their way to the ocean.|$|E

Kennedy International Airport, {{only to find}} that his passport is suddenly no longer valid. The United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation after the outbreak of a civil war, and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now stateless. Because of this, US Customs and Border <b>Protection</b> seizes his <b>passport</b> and airline ticket.|$|R

Paspor ini berlaku untuk seluruh negara dan wilayah kecuali ditentukan lain In English: [...] The Government of the Republic of Indonesia requests to all whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance and afford him/her such assistance and <b>protection.</b> This <b>passport</b> is valid for all countries and areas unless otherwise endorsed ...|$|R
50|$|More {{than his}} Jewish roots, the photographer's {{political}} past {{made him a}} target for persecution. In August, 1933, a band of Sturmabteilung (SA) storm troopers, members of Hitler’s private army, banged {{on the door of}} his studio. Using a portrait of German nobleman Franz von Papen he’d taken the year before when he was Chancellor of Germany, and a letter of thanks he’d received, Breitenbach convinced the troopers that he was under Papen’s <b>protection.</b> With his <b>passport</b> about to expire, Breitenbach made his way to France a few days later, joining other German exiles seeking refuge in Paris.|$|R
50|$|National without {{household}} registration (abbreviated NWOHR) is {{the legal}} status held by nationals of the Republic of China (ROC) who lack household registration in the Taiwan Area. ROC nationality law considers many overseas Chinese {{as well as most}} residents of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau to be ROC nationals. Such persons may be entitled to ROC consular <b>protection</b> and ROC <b>passports.</b> However, nationality is a necessary but insufficient condition for most civic duties and privileges in Taiwan. NWOHRs are subject to immigration control under the Immigration Act (though on different terms than foreigners), and can only receive national health insurance if they have resided in Taiwan for at least one year in a two-year period. Although they may not vote, they are exempt from military conscription.|$|R
50|$|NICOP, National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis is {{the first}} {{attribute}} of the process. Only a token receipt of NICOP is enough for <b>passport</b> <b>protection</b> process. NICOP is a computerized card for identification of a single person visiting a particular country. This card is issued by NADRA, National Database and Registration Authority within 15 days of application submission for urgent applications and within 45 days for normal applications. It will cost at least 3000 PKR (2500 PKR for normal application submission and PKR 6000 for urgent applications of NICOP). This is an important fact that NICOP receipt is necessary for Protectorate of Emigrants department but the original plastic card {{is not necessary to}} travel outside Pakistan. This means a person who does not have NICOP plastic card, can still travel outside Pakistan.|$|R
40|$|In most EU {{countries}} all {{the commonly}} issued passports (with validity exceeding 12 months) must be electronic. Electronic passports include a contact less smartcard, which contains digitally signed {{data about the}} passport holder and the issuing institution. Because of the contact less nature of the chip, the data can be accessed remotely. That can cause problems with the privacy <b>protection</b> of the <b>passport</b> holder. A partial solution {{is the use of}} the "Basic access control" and in the cases of passports with fingerprints also the "Extended access control". Digitally signed data can be copied (cloned) including the digital signature and therefore there exists a protocol known as the active authentication, which helps to cope with the cloning attacks. Even if there are some electronic passports already in circulation, the use of the electronic part of the passport is still in the beginning. JRC.

60|$|To {{counteract}} the proclamation of the British commissioners, promising amnesty to all in rebellion who should, {{in a given}} time, return to their allegiance, Washington now issued a counter proclamation (Jan. 25th), commanding every person who had subscribed a declaration of fidelity to Great Britain, or taken an oath of allegiance, to repair within thirty days to head-quarters, or the quarters of the nearest general officer of the Continental army or of the militia, and there take the oath of allegiance to the United States of America, and give up any <b>protection,</b> certificate or <b>passport</b> he might have received from the enemy; {{at the same time}} granting full liberty to all such as preferred the interest and protection of Great Britain to the freedom and happiness of their country, forthwith to withdraw themselves and families within the enemy's lines. All who should neglect or refuse to comply with this order were to be considered adherents to the crown and treated as common enemies.|$|R
60|$|Some {{time after}} our {{arrival at the}} inn Yejiro {{reported}} that the police officer wished to see me. The man had already seen the important part of me, the passport, and I {{was at a loss}} to imagine what more he could want. So Yejiro was sent back to investigate. He returned shortly with a sad case of concern for consideration, and he hardly kept his face as he told it. The conscientious officer, it seemed, wished to sleep outside my room for my <b>protection.</b> From the <b>passport</b> he felt himself responsible for my safety, and had concluded that the least he could do would be not to leave me for a moment. I assured him, through Yejiro, that his offer was most thoughtful, but unnecessary. But what an out-of-the-world corner the thought implied, and what a fine fossil the good soul must have been! Here was survival with an emphasis! The man had slept soundly through twenty years or more of change, and was still in the pre-foreign days of the feudal ages.|$|R
5000|$|The Raoul Wallenberg Emlékpark (memory park) in {{the rear}} {{courtyard}} of the Dohány Street Synagogue holds the Memorial of the Hungarian Jewish Martyrs — at least 400,000 Hungarian Jews were murdered by the Nazis. [...] Made by Imre Varga, it resembles a weeping willow whose leaves bear inscriptions {{with the names of}} victims. There is also a memorial to Wallenberg and other Righteous Among the Nations, among them: Swiss Vice-consul Carl Lutz; Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian man who, with a strategic escamotage, declared himself the Spanish consul, releasing documents of <b>protection</b> and current <b>passports</b> to Jews in Budapest without distinction (he saved five thousand); Mons. Angelo Rotta, an Italian Prelate Bishop and Apostolic Nuncio of the State of Vatican City in Budapest, which issued protective sheets, misrepresentations of baptism (to save them from forced labor) and Vatican passports to Jews, without distinction of any kind present in Budapest (saving fifteen thousand), who saved, with his secretary Mons. Gennaro Verolino tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II.|$|R
50|$|He {{was fought}} at the Battle of Bunker Hill, with the Rhode Island Brigade, and marched with Benedict Arnold from Cambridge to Quebec in 1775. Many {{starved to death}} along the way, and others deserted. After several days with no food, a group of Indians brought the small army a dog - {{he said it was}} the sweetest food he had ever eaten. In the Battle of Quebec he was {{captured}} by the British, and in prison he contracted smallpox. Wheeler became bald from the illness and remained permanently so. After his exchange, he returned to Rhode Island, and re-enlisted on a privateer. He was later captured on the high seas by the British and was sent to a prison at the naval base at Kinsale, Ireland. He was treated particularly harshly, for his participation in the Gaspee Affair in 1772. After {{a year and a half}} he was offered help from the Irish orator and patriot Henry Grattan, if he could escape. This he and two others did, and Grattan gave them <b>passports,</b> <b>protection</b> from impressment, and passage to Dunkirk, France, and thence to America.|$|R
