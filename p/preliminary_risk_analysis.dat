The remaining 10 - 25 % of health-care waste is regarded as hazardous due {{to one or more}} of the following characteristics: it may contain infectious agents, sharps, toxic or hazardous chemicals or it may be radioactive. Infectious health-care waste, particularly sharps, has been responsible for most of the accidents reported in the literature. In this work the <b>preliminary</b> <b>risks</b> <b>analysis</b> (PRA) technique was used to evaluate practices in the handling of infectious health-care waste. Currently the PRA technique is being used to identify and to evaluate the potential for hazard of the activities, products, and services from facilities and industries. The system studied was a health-care establishment which has handling practices for infectious waste. Thirty-six procedures related to segregation, containment, internal collection, and storage operation were analyzed. The severity of the consequences of the failure (risk) that can occur from careless management of infectious health-care waste was classified into four categories: negligible, marginal, critical, and catastrophic. The results obtained in this study showed that events with critics consequences, about 80 %, may occur during the implementation of the containment operation, suggesting the need to prioritize this operation. As a result of the methodology applied in this work, a flowchart the risk series was also obtained.

40|$|Abstract. Dredging in a {{contaminated}} river {{has been}} widely accepted {{to have an impact}} on the environment; however environmental <b>risk</b> assessment <b>analysis</b> could be costly, time-consuming and difficult to perform. Therefore, a screening method acting as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>risk</b> assessment <b>analysis</b> to screen potential contaminated areas is necessary. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a new screening method for <b>risk</b> assessment <b>analysis</b> in a scenario where economy, time and simplicity factors had been a concern. The development of this method is based on a variation of standard Ecological <b>Risk</b> Assessment. An <b>analysis</b> will be performed on two elements. Firstly, the level of contaminants in the water, groundwater and air (known as the media) and, secondly the behavior of environmental indicators during monitoring of historical dredging. This analysis is performed in order to establish the degree of contamination in an area that is about to be dredged, in where the publicly accessible contamination level in the media and the historical dredging monitoring data will be utilized. Eight dredged sites in Peninsular Malaysia are selected as the case studies of this research. This research showed that Sungai Perlis has a very high total risk value, which could have a fatal impact on its biodiversity if dredging is performed with negligence at this location. This research could provide an opportunity for Malaysia to increase its efforts to avoid dredging impacts without being constrained on time, cost and simplicity factors...|$|R

This study was designed to obtain initial data on the prevalence of smear-negative cases of TB in prisons as well as <b>preliminary</b> <b>risk</b> factor <b>analysis</b> for such TB cases. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in November 2013 at eight main prisons located in the state of Amhara, Ethiopia.

Three consecutive sputum samples were collected and examined using acid fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy at the point of care. All smear-negative sputum samples were taken for culture and Xpert testing. Descriptive and multivariate analysis was done using SPSS version 16. Results: Overall the prevalence of smear-negative pulmonary TB cases in the study prisons was 8 % (16 / 200). Using multivariate analysis, a contact history to TB patients in prison, educational level, cough and night sweating were found to be predictors of TB positivity among smear-negative pulmonary TB cases (p # 0. 05).

Receptor interactions with these stressors at the four highest tiers of risk were dominated by marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and birds (diving and non-diving); only the riverine case (Free Flow) included different receptors in the third tier (fish) and the fourth tier (benthic invertebrates).

The Gnome site in southeastern New Mexico was the location of an underground detonation of a 3. 5 -kiloton nuclear device in 1961, and a hydrologic tracer test using radionuclides in 1963. The tracer test involved the injection of tritium, {sup 90 }Sr, and {sup 137 }Cs directly into the Culebra Dolomite, a nine to ten-meter-thick aquifer located approximately 150 in below land surface. The Gnome nuclear test was carried out in the Salado Formation, a thick salt deposit located 200 in below the Culebra. Because salt behaves plastically, the cavity created by the explosion is expected to close, and although there is no evidence that migration has actually occurred, it is assumed that radionuclides from the cavity are released into the overlying Culebra Dolomite during this closure process. Transport calculations were performed using the solute flux method, with input based on the limited data available for the site. Model results suggest that radionuclides may be present in concentrations exceeding drinking water regulations outside the drilling exclusion boundary established by DOE.

The Rulison site in west-central Colorado was the location of an underground detonation of a 40 -kiloton nuclear device in 1969. The test took place 2, 568 m below ground surface in the Mesaverde Formation. Though located below the regional water table, none of the bedrock formations at the site yielded water during hydraulic tests, indicating extremely low permeability conditions. The scenario evaluated was the migration of radionuclides from the blast-created cavity through the Mesaverde Formation. Transport calculations were performed using the solute flux method, with input based on the limited data available for the site. Model results suggest that radionuclides from the test are contained entirely within the area currently administered by DOE. The transport calculations are most sensitive to changes in the mean groundwater velocity and the correlation scale of hydraulic conductivity, with transport of strontium and cesium also sensitive to the sorption coefficient...|$|E

On the other hand, the shift to higher space-time-yields and temperatures comprises new risks (see Parts I and II). A tool was developed for <b>preliminary</b> <b>risk</b> assessment to cover characteristic features of micro-designed equipment, called HAZOP-LIKE study (see Part III). The generic case studies were applied to two demonstration projects within the IMPULSE project: sulfur dioxide oxidation and the alkylation reaction {{for the production of}} ionic liquids. The generic templates proved to be applicable and support comprehensive <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> studies on processes with hidden deviations not obviously following traditional HAZOP studies...|$|R
40|$|Ozone in the {{atmosphere}} serves as a partially protective filter against the most harmful part of the solar UV-spectrum. Decreases in ozone lead to increases in ambient UV {{with a wide variety}} of adverse effects on human health, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and food chains. Human health effects include the incidence of skin cancer, cataracts and an impairment of the immune system. Ozone depletion has been observed over the past decades, and is most likely caused by man made emissions of halocarbons. The ozone depletion observed over the past decades has probably led to a 5 - 10 % increase in harmful UV-radiation in large parts of Europe. Due to the long atmospheric life time of the ozone depleting substances the countermeasures agreed upon could at best be expected to lead to a slow recovery of the ozone layer in the next 50 - 60 years. However, in that best scenario it is assumed that no interaction occurs with climatological changes, and that a full global compliance with the strictest Amendments of the Montreal Protocol is obtained. Recent scientific evidence indicates that climate change might delay the recovery of the ozone layer by 10 to 20 years. This report summarizes the present knowledge on the climate-ozone interaction, the past and present UV-climate in Europe and dose-effect relationships for health and aquatic effects. Using this information a <b>preliminary</b> integrated <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> is provided for skin cancer risks and effects on the primary production of phytoplankton. Skin cancer risks due to ozone depletion peaks in the period 2050 - 2070. The excess risks in North western Europe due to ozone depletion is estimated at 50 - 60 additional cases per million per year if no climate-ozone interaction is included, and nearly 100 additional cases per million per year if the interaction is included. It should be noted that large uncertainties still exist in view of the gaps in the present knowledge on various aspects of the cause-effect chain. ...|$|R
