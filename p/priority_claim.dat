25|$|Secured and {{unsecured}} creditors {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors {{are ahead of}} shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a <b>priority</b> <b>claim</b> on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|E

Executive Order 7509 established wildlife population limits, beyond which wildlife had no <b>priority</b> <b>claim.</b> The court also held that the refuge should be administered according to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 and not the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. In April 1986, the National Park Service adopted an environmental impact statement and [...] "decision of record" [...] which established a resource management plan for the refuge.

5000|$|According to Ragnar Hall, any {{enactment}} of {{the current version of}} Icesave bill 2, would mean that the highest creditor priority would no longer be held solely by the Icelandic Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund, as would have been the case if only the standard Icelandic receivership/bankruptcy law had applied, but instead the Icesave bills had now relegated its priority order to be equal with all other [...] "priority claims" [...] towards the receivership. By side-ordering all creditor <b>priority</b> <b>claims,</b> which primarily was related to the extra claims from UK and Netherlands also to seek coverage for their extended repayment of deposits to UK and Dutch savers (from the receivership and not from the Icelandic state), in reality meant that after liquidation of all positive remaining Landsbanki assets, then this recovery would no longer first be used 100% to repay all of the €4bn big minimum deposit guarantees to the Icelandic state, but due to the side-ordering of creditor priorities the Icelandic state would straight from the start only be repaid by the receivership by a 51% share of the money being recovered. If the receivership managed to recover enough money to cover all <b>priority</b> <b>claims,</b> the Icelandic State's loss of first priority status within the <b>priority</b> <b>claims</b> would not cause any difference. In the event the receivership only managed to recover 50% of all <b>priority</b> <b>claims,</b> there would however be a huge difference, as a first priority status then would ensure 100% coverage of the €4bn liabilities, while {{enactment of}} the Icesave bill agreements on the contrary would mean that the Icelandic state instead only would receive half of its €4bn claims towards the receivership, leaving the Icelandic state and tax payers responsible to pay for the remaining claims not being met.|$|R
2500|$|The Madoc legend {{attained}} {{its greatest}} prominence during the Elizabethan era, when Welsh and English writers {{used it to}} bolster British claims in the New World versus those of Spain. The earliest surviving full account of Madoc's voyage, as the first to make the claim that Madoc had come to America before Columbus, appears in Humphrey Llwyd's published 1559 Cronica Walliae, an English adaptation of the Brut y Tywysogion. John Dee used his manuscript when he submitted a treatise the [...] "Title Royal" [...] to Queen Elizabeth in 1580 which stated that [...] "The Lord Madoc, sonne to Owen Gwynned, Prince of Gwynedd, led a Colonie and inhabited in Terra Florida or thereabouts" [...] in 1170. The story was first published by George Peckham's as A True Report of the late Discoveries of the Newfound Landes (1583) and like Dee {{it was used to}} support English claims to the Americas. It was picked up in David Powel's Historie of Cambria (1584), and Richard Hakluyt's The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation (1589).

40|$|In this article, I address {{concerns}} that the ontological <b>priority</b> <b>claims</b> definitive of ontic structural realism are as they stand unclear, and I do so by placing these claims on a more rigorous formal footing than they typically have been hitherto. I first of all argue that Kit Fine’s analysis of ontological dependence furnishes us with an ontological priority relation that is particularly apt for structuralism. With that in place, and with reference to two case studies prominent within the structuralist literature, I consider whether any of structuralism’s distinctive <b>priority</b> <b>claims</b> may be regarded as warranted. The discussion {{as a whole has}} largely negative implications for the radical structuralism of French and Ladyman (including their ‘eliminativist’ interpretation of it), largely positive implications for the moderate structuralism primarily advocated by Esfeld and Lam, and some broad lessons for contemporary fundamentalist metaphysics as a whole. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{practice}} of surgery had changed little over millennia when Abraham Groves and William Osler attended medical school together in Toronto, Ontario. The invention of anesthesia sparked such rapid development {{that by the}} time of Groves 2 ̆ 7 and Osler 2 ̆ 7 s deaths, surgical practice resembled the current model. Several <b>priority</b> <b>claims</b> have been attributed to Groves 2 ̆ 7 life in surgery, including aseptic surgery (1874), suprapubic lithotomy (1878), appendectomy (1883), surgical gloves (1885) and cancer radiotherapy (1903). These claims arise from an autobiography written by Groves at the age of 87 years in 1934. METHODS: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess these <b>priority</b> <b>claims</b> from a modern surgical perspective. We did a systematic search of contemporary (1873 - 1934) and modern journals for articles by or about Groves. We searched relevant archives and museums. We reviewed the 1934 autobiography, notes held by descendants, reminiscences by contemporaries and collateral information. We assessed the information not only for priority but also for the development of organized surgical thought. RESULTS: Groves published frequently throughout his career; thus far we have located 36 papers, almost all of which were published in Canadian journals. He spoke regularly at regional meetings in Ontario. Many medical students apprenticed with him (including his brother, son and grandson), he established a hospital and he founded a school of nursing. His contemporaries published complimentary reminiscences, but no correspondence with his classmate, William Osler, is known. Groves 2 ̆ 7 <b>priority</b> <b>claims</b> for aseptic surgery, suprapubic lithotomy and radiotherapy are supported by contemporary publications. Groves independently developed an organized surgical system that remains valid today. <b>Priority</b> <b>claims</b> for appendectomy and the use of surgical gloves are entirely consistent with that system. CONCLUSION: Although Groves 2 ̆ 7 impact was reduced by his location and the limited circulation of the journals in which he wrote, he demonstrated a systematic understanding of modern surgery well ahead of his contemporaries...|$|R
