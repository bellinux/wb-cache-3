2500|$|... "To all who {{received}} Him, He gave {{the power to}} become sons of God" [...] (Jn 1:12). For a Christian, {{this is not just}} a way of speaking or calling. Awareness of divine filiation is rooted in a divine gift that transforms a person from within. St. John <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: [...] "See what love the Father has for us, that He has called us sons of God, and so we are!...We are truly children of God" [...] (1 Jn 3:1–2). St. Josemaria concludes that [...] "whoever is unaware of this is unaware of his innermost truth;" [...] he has not yet discovered the deepest reality of his being, nor the meaning of his existence on this earth.|$|E

2500|$|Novelist Julia Glass has {{similarly}} written about Tyler’s characters’ families: “What makes each story distinctive is the particular way its characters rebel against hereditary confines, cope with fateful crises or forge relationships with new acquaintances who rock their world.” [...] In the same way, Glass mentions the frequent role of marriage struggles in her work: “Once again, Tyler exhibits her genius for the incisive, savory portrayal of marriage, of the countless perverse {{ways in which}} two individuals sustain a shared existence.” [...] McMurty <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way, [...] "The fates of [...] families hinge on long struggles between semiattentive males and semiobsessed females. In her patient investigation of such struggles, Miss Tyler has produced a very satisfying body of fiction.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard asks, {{where does}} the single {{individual}} turn {{if he wants to}} think about the expectancy of an eternal life? How does it work in civic affairs? Does a state official turn to [...] "aliens and foreigners" [...] or to [...] "loafers and irresponsible tramps" [...] or [...] "robbers and agitators" [...] to discuss the state of the nation? No, the official goes to someone who has a [...] "concern" [...] for the [...] "welfare of the country." [...] The single individual doesn't go to someone who says [...] "salvation is a matter or course" [...] he goes to someone who [...] knows [...] "that no one can serve two masters, since he must hate the one and love the other" [...] (Matthew 6:24), whose soul is fully awakened from sleep to understand what presumably would hurl the sleepwalker into the abyss, [...] "that love of the world is hatred of God!" [...] (James 4.4) Kierkegaard <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way, ...|$|E
2500|$|Gould {{was widely}} {{known for his}} unusual habits. He usually hummed while he played the piano, and his {{recording}} engineers had mixed results in how successfully they could exclude his voice from recordings. Gould claimed that his singing was unconscious and increased proportionately with {{the inability of the}} piano in question to realize the music as he intended. It is likely that this habit originated in Gould's having been taught by his mother to [...] "sing everything that he played", as Kevin Bazzana <b>puts</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> became [...] "an unbreakable (and notorious) habit". Some of Gould's recordings were severely criticised because of the background [...] "vocalising". For example, a reviewer of his 1981 re-recording of the Goldberg Variations opined that many listeners would [...] "find the groans and croons intolerable". Gould was renowned for his peculiar body movements while playing and for his insistence on absolute control over every aspect of his playing environment. The temperature of the recording studio had to be exactly regulated. He invariably insisted {{that it had to be}} extremely warm. According to Friedrich, the air conditioning engineer had to work just as hard as the recording engineers. The piano had to be set at a certain height and would be raised on wooden blocks if necessary. A small rug would sometimes be required for his feet underneath the piano. He had to sit fourteen inches above the floor and would play concerts only while sitting on the old chair his father had made. He continued to use this chair even when the seat was completely worn through. His chair is so closely identified with him that it is shown in a place of honour in a glass case at the National Library of Canada.|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.

I'm to go with her--'in {{attendance}} on my mistress,' as the lady <b>puts</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> I will say for Mrs. Delvin: her handwriting is a credit to the school that taught her; and the poor bedridden creature words her invitation so nicely, that I myself couldn't have resisted it--and I'm a hard one, as you know. You don't seem to heed me, Mr. Morris." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{might he}} have {{weathered}} the general hostility had Charles been half as loyal {{to him as}} he had ever been loyal to Charles. For a time, it is true, the King stood his friend, and might so have continued to the end had not the women become mixed up in the business. As Evelyn, the diarist, <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> great man's fall was the work of [...] "the buffoones and ladys of pleasure." ...|$|E

5000|$|Alfred Harbage {{analyzes}} Shakespeare's [...] "sense of history" [...] as he <b>puts</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> definitely centers {{itself on}} the idea of reflexivity, especially {{at the beginning of the}} poem, where Shakespeare shows the [...] "baggage" [...] that he enters his writing with.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the drawbacks, thumb-shift {{is popular}} {{among people who}} write {{a large amount of}} sentences, {{including}} writers, playwrights and lawyers. They cite various explanations for their preference: speed, naturalness, less fatigue and so on. One author <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: [...] "Thumb-shift keyboard enables you to not only move your brain and fingers in sync with the proper rhythm of the Japanese language but also type fast. It is the keyboard that protects the beauty of the mother tongue." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} morning of June 14, 1991, Ledbetter, then a student at Florida State University, broke into the Florida State Capitol {{building}} and phoned a number of odd demands {{from the office of}} Wayne Todd, the Sergeant At Arms of the Florida Senate. This triggered a police standoff (the police were not sure whether Ledbetter was armed or if he might have a hostage) that eventually ended peacefully.

5000|$|BioArt {{is often}} {{intended}} to be shocking or humorous. One survey of the field in Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: [...] "BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: {{draw attention to the}} beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the ambush, {{numerous}} questions arose, {{based on}} the differing accounts: Hamer and Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections, Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff's office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish. The three duos distrusted each other, kept to themselves, and did not much like each other. They each carried differing agendas into the operation and brought differing narratives out of it. Historian Guinn <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: ...|$|E
5000|$|As a high {{official}} in the play <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> work is [...] "a pasquinade on Moscow". The play depicts certain social and official stereotypes in the characters of Famusov, who hates reform; his secretary, Molchalin, who fawns over officials; and the aristocratic young liberal and Anglomaniac, Repetilov. By contrast {{the hero of the}} piece, Chatsky, an ironic satirist just returned from western Europe, exposes and ridicules the weaknesses of the rest. His words echo the outcry of the young generation in the lead-up to the armed insurrection of 1825.|$|E
