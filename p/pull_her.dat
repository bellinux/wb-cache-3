5|$|Gefjon appears {{prominently}} as the allegorical {{mother of}} Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in the forty-page Swedish Romantic poem Gefion, a Poem in Four Cantos by Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll (1770–1835). A fountain depicting Gefjun driving her oxen sons to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> plough (The Gefion Fountain, 1908) by Anders Bundgaard stands in Copenhagen, Denmark, {{on the island}} of Zealand, as in the myth. The Gefion family, a family of asteroids, and asteroid 1272 Gefion (discovered in 1931 by Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth) both derive their names from that of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons end up staying inside {{during an}} acid {{rainstorm}} caused by The Republican Party's latest {{decision to make}} caring for the environment a felony offense {{to play a game}} of Monopoly. When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces, Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him. Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart. Despite her inability to talk, Maggie calls the police on her family before taking hold of Marge and attempting to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off Homer. With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{completion}} on 10 March 1945, 801, 828, 880, and 1771 Squadrons reembarked {{with a total}} strength of 48 Seafires, 21 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and a dozen Fireflies, the largest air group aboard a British carrier thus far. Implacable departed six days later to join the BPF and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 25 March. While passing through the Suez Canal, a strong gust of wind forced her ashore and it took her escorting tugboats five hours to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off. Undamaged, she proceeded on her voyage and reached Sydney on 8 May 1945 (V-E Day).|$|E
50|$|The song is {{told from}} the point of view of a death-row inmate, who recalls how Lilly would do the Zampoughi every time he <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> coattails. It is {{eventually}} revealed that he kills her, because she would do the zampoughi whenever any other guy <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> coattails.|$|R

5|$|Webb {{demonstrated}} his aggressiveness when {{he attempted}} to sortie on the first spring tide (30 May) after taking command, but Atlantas forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions, and the ship ran aground. She was not damaged although it took over a day to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> free. He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide, rejecting Mallory's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad Savannah was finished before his next sortie. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, had ordered the monitors Weehawken and Nahant into Wassaw Sound. Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the two ships.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the kayak helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out of the water.|$|E

60|$|She found that, {{in all her}} {{outgoings}} and her incomings, he prevented her. Gradually {{she realized}} that she was being borne down by him, borne down by the clinging, heavy weight of him, that he was <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> down as a leopard clings to a wild cow and exhausts <b>her</b> and <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> down.|$|R
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Braunschweig {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise in June and July, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. During torpedo training on 16 February 1905, Wörth ran aground off Stollergrund; Braunschweig unsuccessfully attempted to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> free and other ships were called to come to Wörths aid. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. On 22 November, Prince Heinrich boarded the ship in Kiel, which then steamed to Denmark to take Prince Carl of Denmark to Norway, where he was crowned Haakon VII of Norway. Braunschweig was back in Kiel by 30 November. On 14 December, Braunschweig was replaced as the deputy commander's flagship by the battleship , which had larger facilities for a command staff.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
5|$|While Lowestoffe was sailing {{through the}} Caicos passage late on 10 August, Pamplin {{realised}} that the strong currents known {{to run through}} the channel had reversed direction and Lowestoffe was running into shallow waters. He attempted to avoid grounding, but to no avail, and the Lowestoffe ran broadside onto Little Inagua (“Heneaga”) Island. The crew threw stores and equipment overboard to lighten the ship, and boats came from other ships in the convoy to try to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off. The attempts to refloat her failed and her crew abandoned her by mid-afternoon. The only casualties were five men who drowned when their boat capsized in the surf. The change in currents also caused the wreck of five merchantmen. In the late afternoon of 11 August Acasta left Bonetta and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy.|$|E

25|$|In January 1806, {{while under}} the command of Lieutenant Martin White, she {{grounded}} off Rysum, in the River Ems, East Friesland. When White went ashore to supervise attempts to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off, a party of Dutchmen from a schuyt landed and captured him. Manlys master, William Golding, decided to surrender her. Dutch gun-boats then captured her. The subsequent court martial stripped Golding of his rank for conduct unbecoming an officer and ordered him to serve a two-year term as a seaman. The board also reprimanded White for not having lightened Manly before trying to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off.|$|E
25|$|Oceanus' {{daughters were}} filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely {{approached}} and asked for bow and arrows.

Jill, showing off, moves too close to the edge, and Eustace falls off trying to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E
25|$|Seine {{underwent}} a refit at Chatham Dockyard between June and July 1803, with Milne recommissioning her in May for the North Sea. However, {{shortly after her}} return to service she grounded on a sandbank to the northward of Terschelling on 21 July 1803. That evening Milne had ordered the pilots to keep her out of shallow water and they had assured {{him that she was}} safe; forty minutes later she struck. The crew labored all night and well into the morning, with the assistance of two passing merchant vessels to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off and to lighten her, but to no avail. At about 11:30am the crew abandoned Seine; they set fire to her as they left to prevent the French recapturing her.|$|E
