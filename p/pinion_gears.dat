25|$|The {{scarcity}} and unreliability of the French-built Hispano-Suiza 8B engine {{proved to}} be the most serious problem in the deployment and use of the Dolphin. Use of insufficiently hardened metal in the <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> led to numerous failures of the reduction gearing, particularly in engines built by the French firm Brasier. The engine also suffered persistent lubrication problems. Limited production capacity for the Hispano-Suiza engine and the priority afforded to French aircraft like the SPAD S.XIII slowed Dolphin deliveries. Availability of the Hispano-Suiza improved in early 1918 as the French firm Emile Mayen began deliveries on an order placed by the British Admiralty.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} days, Crown created a {{modified}} Volkswagen differential carrier by adding two extra <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> {{to the existing}} two gears which in effect lessened the load and made the differentials last longer. It was called a Beef-a-diff. When Corvair transaxles started {{to be used in}} high performance applications the differential again being a weak spot was modified by adding two more <b>pinion</b> <b>gears.</b> This created a cross legged look whence the [...] "spider" [...] nickname was derived.|$|E

50|$|A three speed gearbox {{was fitted}} as standard; three forward and one reverse. Several ways of {{improving}} the performance through modifications to the gearbox and transmission train were applied; replacement close ratio gears fitted to gearbox, overdrive gears fitted behind the original gearbox and higher ratio crown & <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> fitted to the differential unit on the back axle.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{feature that}} gave the product its name was that one side had a hinge that allowed models built with Tog'l blocks to flex and move. Other {{building}} elements included wheels, axles, <b>pinion</b> <b>gears,</b> tubes, girders, air bellows, windows, doors, blue pins, green [...] "hemisphere" [...] pins, red double pins, clown heads, pig heads, hands, feet, and many other variations with generic uses or specific purposes.|$|E
50|$|Aside from magnets {{the cars}} also had wider pickups on the underside. They also had torquier motors and a {{different}} <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> and crown wheel. Essentially, every Powertrack Plus car was a revamped Powertrack car body shell with the new Chassis.|$|R

50|$|The Dream had {{optional}} {{three or}} four speed transmission, manufactured to Brough's own design by David Brown Ltd. of Huddersfield. The final shaft drive had an underslung worm and <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> on the rear axle and the propeller shaft was enclosed in a tube.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, {{a revolutionary}} new reel was {{introduced}} to catch the most challenging game fish, the Senator. Immediately successful, it led to numerous fishing records being set, and remains popular to this day, known for its high quality and dependability. [...] It featured high speed stainless <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> for taking in line faster and was well adapted to the extra demands of professionally guided charter fishing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{results of}} tests on {{protective}} boots for automotive rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> showed that older TPV has slightly lower physical and mechanical properties than new material. Yet {{some of the}} key indicators of the material's ability to hold up in this dynamic application did not change significantly. For example, the new and old TPVs had nearly the same properties after air and oil aging. Compression set also remained virtually identical.|$|E
50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, hoist motors, drag lines, <b>pinion</b> <b>gears,</b> split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|E
40|$|A pseudo-fluid control {{extension}} system {{was created to}} manipulate a medical device. The device {{had the ability to}} control a transesophageal echocardiogram transducer (TEE) from a distance of five feet. Designs were created using cable and hydraulic systems, but both systems were problematic. A pseudo-fluid system consisting of tubes filled with steel balls was developed to capture the positive aspects of cable and fluid systems. The user interface consisted of two rotatable knobs that actuate rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> sets, which push the pseudo-fluid balls through tubes. At the distal ends of the tubes, the balls move the racks of rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> sets that rotate shafts in a TEE. The resulting user interface has ergonomic and mechanical properties similar to the original TEE...|$|R

Army Laboratories, a series of experiments are being performed on the 500 HP OH- 58 a Transmission Test Rig at NASA Glenn Research Center. The findings reported in this paper were drawn from Phase 1 of a two-phase experiment, and {{are focused on the}} vibration response of an undamaged <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> and planetary system operating in situ in the transmission test rig. Phase 2 of the experiment, which is reported elsewhere, introduced a seeded fault into the <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> and tracked its progress in real-time. Based on methods presented here, further experimental research will be conducted to examine planetary system faults...|$|R

5000|$|Production of the U660E and U660F {{commenced}} in January 2006, Toyota's first 6-speed automatic transaxles for front-wheel-drive vehicles; Transaxles {{feature a}} compact gear train that achieves six speeds using a single axis {{to produce a}} high torque of 400 Nm, and are as low cost, compact, and light as 4-speed automatic transaxles [...] The transaxle is a Lepelletier design which uses a simple gear set to drive a Ravigneaux planetary gear set (with long and short <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> in the same planet carrier).|$|E
50|$|Military 181s {{attain a}} higher ride height and lower {{effective}} gearing by using reduction boxes, {{a form of}} portal axles. 181s without reduction boxes feature a transmission similar to the Beetle but with a slower gearing by use of different ring and <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> and have stronger, more flexible CV axles. Most mechanical parts are interchangeable {{with those of other}} VW models. Optional dual oil bath air cleaners increased filtering ability in dusty environments, and low noise ignition systems were fitted to military cars to be used for radio communication.|$|E

50|$|The new chassis {{allowed the}} floor to be placed much lower, which in turn led to a lower and longer look overall. The major {{component}} of this chassis was a differential whose <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> was exceptionally low relative to the axleshafts, lower than in conventional hypoid differentials.|$|R
5000|$|The {{available}} power for traction is [...] - produced at 600 V AC, and is rectified to DC through {{two groups of}} 30 silicon diodes, and eventually supplies six nose suspended traction motors which drive the wheels via a <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> {{at a ratio of}} 59:18.|$|R
50|$|Start - The <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> on {{the starter}} motor is engaged with the {{flywheel}} and the starter motor runs {{to turn the}} engine over. In most cases, only the left magneto is active (the right p-lead is grounded) due to timing differences between the magnetos at low RPMs.|$|R
5000|$|The 32 lipfire {{sports a}} six-shot {{cylinder}} {{in the smaller}} caliber. The design of the [...]32 caliber lipfire breaks from its bigger brothers in several important ways. Firstly, it sports a spur trigger rather than using the standard trigger with guard. Secondly, it uses a side-hammer of earlier design. Lastly, it ditches the trigger guard ejector/plunger for a weaker left-mounted plunger with rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> {{to the top and}} left of the chamber. In design, {{it seems to be a}} marriage/compromise between its bigger brothers and the earlier [...]32 Rimfire revolver. Barrel lengths include 4, 5 and 6 inch.|$|E
5000|$|The base design {{from the}} {{original}} Torqueflite remains largely unchanged {{and the addition of}} a 2-speed output shaft (overdrive unit) that is bolted {{to the back of the}} 3-speed transmission has only two ratios: direct (1:1) and overdrive (.69:1). While lubrication to the overdrive unit was a challenge early on, this challenge was later overcome with factory improvements and/or aftermarket valve body kits. The overdrive planetary has six <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> (unlike the 5 pinion used with the A518 used with the Cummins turbodiesel) which is often used as an aftermarket replacement for the stock 4 pinion planetary used with the lighter duty transmissions.|$|E
50|$|Back then a CIDCO {{transaxle}} {{could be}} purchased, this stands for Corvair Improvement Distributing Company as owned by Bob Anderson. At {{one time he}} developed Corvair transaxles with many improvements, not only for Corvairs but the kit car industry as well. Bob improved the longevity of the differentials thru many modifications, re-manufacture and re-engineering, along with careful assembly. This included having reverse cut ring and <b>pinion</b> <b>gears</b> made for the Kelmark transaxle setup which ran in reverse. His setup was in great demand by the mid-engine Corvair enthusiasts. One of the trademarks of the CIDCO diff is the shoulder bolted steel plate cover {{on top of the}} differential in place of the tin cover.|$|E
50|$|Rack-and-pinion {{elevator}} are {{powered by}} a motor driving a <b>pinion</b> <b>gear.</b> Because they can be installed on a building or structure's exterior {{and there is no}} machine room or hoistway required, they are the most used type of elevator for buildings under construction (to move materials and tools up and down).|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Harold Fairbanks as the Laminated <b>Pinion</b> <b>Gear</b> Company in 1964.
