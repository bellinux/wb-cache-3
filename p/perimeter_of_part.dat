5000|$|Laminated-Object Manufacturing - A sheet {{material}} is laid {{on a platform}} and a laser cuts the desired contour. The platform is lowered by one sheet thickness and a new sheet is laid {{with a layer of}} thermal adhesive between the two sheets. A heated roller presses the sheets together and activates the adhesive. The laser cuts the contours of this layer and the process is repeated. When the part is finished, the leftover {{sheet material}} around the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>part</b> must be removed. The final part is coated with sealant.|$|R

50|$|The {{field is}} uniformly {{perpendicular}} to the cylindrical rotor surface and does not change polarity over the 360-degree <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the cylindrical <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the rotor. That means if the field is considered entering the rotor between the slip-rings it must leave the rotor though the rotor's end surfaces. It is not important that the magnetic field is generated from the stator; a similar field may be generated from the rotor with the same effect (the magnetic fields would not rotate with the rotor).|$|R
5000|$|Perth is {{also home}} to two main parks, namely the North Inch and South Inch (the word [...] "Inch" [...] being an anglicisation of the Gaelic innis meaning island or meadow). The Inches were given to the city in 1377 by King Robert III. The North Inch is located {{directly}} {{to the north of the}} city centre. It is bordered to the south by Charlotte Street and Atholl Street and to the southwest by Rose Terrace. Its western <b>perimeter</b> consists <b>of</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the exercise path that circumnavigates the entire park. The River Tay bounds it to the east.

The active <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> punch and die were covered by PVD coating of ZrN type with LARC technology. The punches and the dies were tested in a complex tool by joining thin hot-dip galvanized steel sheets with the pressing force of 7, 000 N.

40|$|A {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) sewing thread has been {{designed}} which consists of a two-ply yarn in a 122 turns-per-meter-twist construction. Two processing aids in thread construction were evaluated. Prototype blankets were sewn using an SiC thread prepared either with polytetrafluoroethylene sizing or with an overwrap of rayon/dacron service yarn. The rayon/dacron-wrapped SiC thread was stronger, as shown by higher break-strength retention and less damage to the outer-mold-line fabric. This thread enables thermal protection system articles to be sewn or joined, or have <b>perimeter</b> close-out <b>of</b> assembled <b>parts</b> when using SiC fabric for high-temperature applications...|$|R

25|$|But {{the idea}} of the Eugene Mall had been {{considered}} by civic leaders prior to the 1960s. In 1945, for example, Fred Cuthbert proposed closing Willamette Street to cars {{in order to create a}} landscaped pedestrian oasis in the center of town, and he suggested parking along the <b>perimeter.</b> As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Eugene Centennial Celebration in 1959, a section of Broadway from Oak Street to Charnelton Street was closed to motor traffic, and pedestrians were delighted.|$|R
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories {{manufactures}} {{high precision}} microparts using LIGA technology. LIGA is the German acronym for x-ray lithography (Lithographie), electrodeposition (Galvanoformung) and molding (Abformung) [1]. Fabricating large batches of high aspect ratio metal microstructures {{has been demonstrated}} at Sandia and provides {{a unique opportunity to}} produce centimeter scale macroscopic parts with micrometer scale precision. [2, 3]. A challenge in LIGA processing {{is the fact that the}} favored x-ray lithography resist, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), swells approximately 0. 4 % in the aqueous electrolyte solution during electrodeposition [4]. The effect is significant in thick molds and for long electroplating times, and seriously impacts the fidelity of critical dimensions. Other geometric distortion occurs due to the bottom surface boundary condition of the PMMA; being fixed to the mold substrate [5, 6]. Auxiliary surrounding features which are put adjacent to features of critical dimension can limit the primary swelling [3, 6]. Complicated geometries pose a challenge for designing auxiliary features because the features must follow the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>part</b> uniformly. Complex non unifor...|$|R
50|$|Under abbot Willem van Brussel {{in about}} 1520 the <b>perimeter</b> wall, <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> which survive, {{surrounding}} the abbey complex was built, and the abbot's lodgings were refurbished (of which the cellars {{and the present}} Emperor's Hall remain). The Baroque gateway was completed in 1665 {{on the occasion of}} the thousand-year anniversary of the abbey's foundation. Some of the service buildings were also renewed at this time. Finally, at the end of the 18th century, abbot Joseph van Herck had the abbey buildings refurbished in Neo-classical style.|$|R
50|$|In earlier times, the Schaumburg Forest was {{a border}} {{area between the}} Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe and Prussia; today <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> its western <b>perimeter</b> form <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the border with North Rhine-Westphalia. A {{boundary}} embankment, the Schaumburger Landwehr , runs for about 25 km through the Schaumburg Forest. It once extended as far as Lake Steinhude and, in the Middle Ages, marked the border of Schaumburg-Lippe with Westphalia. The Schaumburg Forest is the western remnant of the historic Dülwald forest that once extended from Minden to Lake Steinhude and was a border forest of the old Saxon districts or Gaue.|$|R

5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle <b>of</b> Pusan <b>Perimeter</b> as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|R
40|$|Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) and Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) are {{studied at}} three levels: the {{international}} literature, {{the policy and}} action taken in India and the field work in the various states of India at large scale irrigation system. International literature argues that management will improve if users can take management decisions that are the outcome of local negotiations between stakeholders and based on local knowledge and normative frameworks. Since the 1980 s, several governments have adopted these turnover programs, often as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the requirements of a structural adjustment package negotiated with IMF and international development banks. These show that in many countries the tight financial situation of governments has been important for introducing PIM/IMT. The management transfer from the State to Water Users Associations (WUAs) has been more successfully achieved in some places, than in other places. Literature provides explanations as success factors for PIM/IMT like relative strength of economy and central government, higher literacy and standard of living. It is necessary to understand the national {{as well as the}} local context, the opportunities it offers, and the constraints it places on successful institutional reform. Case specific reasons that could explain the hesitance of PIM/IMT implementation are i) The irrigated <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> various <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> India, as it is managed nowadays by the Public Works Department (PWD), functions relatively well, ii) the society is characterised by relatively strong central rule, iii) rigid labour relations in the civil service and iv) farmers are hesitant to take over the irrigation management...|$|R

When his troops were driven back from most of their positions, Lanza ordered them to bombard the city for three days, provoking the deaths of 600 civilians. By May 28, Garibaldi controlled {{much of the city}} and declared the Bourbon authority deposed. The following day, a desperate Neapolitan counteroffensive was driven back, and Lanza asked for a truce. However, when a reinforcement party of well equipped and well trained troops arrived in the city, the situation became very serious for Garibaldi, who was saved only by Lanza's decision to surrender. Through the mediation of a British admiral, an armistice was signed and the Neapolitan fleet abandoned the port.|$|R
