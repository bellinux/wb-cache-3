We tested the effects of higher incubation temperatures on embryo and hatchling mortality and on <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in a population of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the eastern Pacific. The long-term study provided a large sample size in a location influenced by El Niño Southern Oscillation that resulted in highly variable climatic conditions between seasons. High temperatures reduced emergence success. Output of female hatchlings increased with incubation temperature as it reached {{the upper end of the}} transitional range (range of temperatures that produce both sexes) (30. °C) and decreased afterwards because high temperatures increased mortality of 'female clutches'.

We monitored incubation temperatures of eastern Pacific leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea in hatchery and in situ clutches at Playa Grande, Costa Rica, throughout each nesting season from 1998 to 2007.

Alteration of both <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> and hatching success is the tradeoff for reducing the risk of death to egg clutches by translocation to a hatchery.

Estimates of the genetic correlations of sex ratio across environments were highly positive and essentially indistinguishable from + 1.

Recent studies have begun to quantify climate change impacts to sea turtle populations, especially in terms of predicting effects on hatchling <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, given the inherent difficulty in studying <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> at this life stage, a more accurate assessment of changes in population <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> might be derived by evaluating the juvenile portion of foraging aggregations. We investigated the long-term trend in <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of a juvenile loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle population inhabiting Pamlico and Core Sounds, North Carolina, USA. We used plasma testosterone reference ranges measured using radioimmunoassay (RIA) to assign sex for 959 turtles and confirmed sex assignment of a subset (N = 58) of the sampled turtles through laparoscopic examination of their gonads. Our results demonstrate that for this particular population of loggerheads, <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> (3 Females: 1 Male) had not significantly changed over a 10 year period (1998 - 2007), nor showed any significant difference among 5 -cm straight carapace length (SCL) size classes. Ultimately, these findings provide a basis for comparison with future <b>sex</b> <b>ratios,</b> and highlight the importance of establishing similar long-term studies monitoring secondary, rather than <b>primary,</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios,</b> so that needed mitigation measures to climate change impacts can be implemented...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>primary</b> offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> adjustment is being extensively studied, yet {{knowledge of the}} underlying proximate mechanism is still mainly hypothetical. Female birds are the heterogametic sex, thus potentially controlling {{the sex of the}} gamete to be fertilized. In several bird species, independent studies showed effects of maternal plasma testosterone, corticosterone, or condition on <b>primary</b> offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio.</b> Our objective was to investigate the causal relation between these two maternal hormones, body condition, and offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> in homing pigeons (Columba livia domestica). Following our earlier study, we again implanted females with testosterone and determined embryo sex of first eggs. To identify the pathway of <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> adjustment, we repeatedly measured not only maternal plasma testosterone and mass but also plasma corticosterone, cholesterol, and glucose, all indicators of body condition. We also calculated the temporal change in these parameters, which has been proposed to be a more accurate predictor of offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> compared with the absolute values. Furthermore, we analyzed testosterone concentrations in outer yolk layers, which potentially influence the first meiotic division of the gamete. We found no relation between plasma parameter and embryo sex of first eggs; testosterone treatment did not affect any of the measured parameters. However, females that increased in mass produced more male embryos, irrespective of treatment group. Outer yolk layer testosterone concentrations did not differ between treatment groups or between male and female eggs. We propose that not only the absolute values but also the complex interactions between maternal hormones and body condition ultimately affect the mechanism of <b>primary</b> offspring <b>sex</b> manipulation. ...|$|R

40|$|In ants, young queens can {{found new}} colonies {{independently}} (without {{the help of}} workers) or dependently (with the help of workers). It {{has been suggested that}} differences in the mode of colony founding strongly influence queen survival and colony development. This is because independent queens are constrained to produce a worker force rapidly, before they deplete their body reserves and to resist the intense intercolony competition during the founding stage. By contrast, queens that found colonies dependently remain with the workers, which probably results in a lower mortality rate and earlier production of reproductive offspring. Consequently, in species that found independently, queens of incipient colonies are expected to produce mostly worker brood by laying a lower fraction of haploid (male) eggs than queens in mature colonies; such a difference would not occur in species founding dependently. We compared the <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> (proportion of male-determined eggs) laid by queens in incipient and mature colonies of two ant species Lasius nigerLinepithema humile, showing independent and dependent modes of colony founding, respectively. As predicted L. niger queens of incipient colonies laid a lower proportion of haploid eggs than queens from mature colonies. By contrast, queens of L. humile laid a similar proportion of haploid eggs in both incipient and mature colonies. These results provide the first evidence that (1) the <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> varies according to the mode of colony foundation, and (2) queens can adjust the <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> according to the life history stage of the colony in ants.

40|$|Across various animal taxa {{not only}} the {{secondary}} sex ratio but also the <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> (at conception) shows significant deviations from the expected equal proportions of sons and daughters. Birds are especially intriguing to study this phenomenon as avian females are the heterogametic sex (ZW); therefore sex determination might be under direct control of the mother. Avian sex ratios vary in relation to environmental or maternal condition, which can also affect the production of maternal steroids that in turn are involved in reproduction and accumulate in the developing follicle before meiosis. As the proximate mechanisms underlying biased <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> are largely elusive, we explored how, and to what extent, maternal steroid hormones {{may be involved in}} affecting primary or secondary sex ratio in clutches of various species of pigeons. First we demonstrated a clear case of seasonal change in sex ratio in first eggs both in the Rock Pigeon (Columba livia) and in a related species, the Wood Pigeon (Columba palumbus), both producing clutches of two eggs. In the Homing Pigeon (Columba livia domestica), domesticated from the Rock Pigeon, testosterone treatment of breeding females induced a clear male bias, while corticosterone induced a female bias in first eggs and we argue that this is in line with sex allocation theory. We next analyzed treatment effects on follicle formation, yolk mass, and yolk hormones, the latter both pre- and post-ovulatory, in order to test a diversity of potential mechanisms related to both primary and secondary sex ratio manipulation. We conclude that maternal plasma hormone levels may affect several pre- ovulatory mechanisms affecting <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio,</b> whereas egg hormones are probably involved in secondary sex ratio manipulation only. ...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{effects on}} sex {{allocation}} are common, yet the evolutionary {{significance of these}} effects remains poorly understood. Environmental effects might influence parents, such that their condition directly influences sex allocation by altering the relative benefits of producing sons versus daughters. Alternatively, the environment might influence the offspring themselves, such that the conditions they find themselves in influence their contribution to parental fitness. In both cases, parents might be selected to bias their <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> according to the prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we consider sex allocation in the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri, a species with an unusual genetic system in which paternal genes are lost from the germline in males. We test environmental factors that may influence either female condition directly (rearing temperature and food restriction) or {{that may be used}} as cues of the future environment (age at mating). Using cytological techniques to obtain <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios,</b> we show that high temperature, older age at mating and starvation all affect sex allocation, resulting in female-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, the effect of temperature is rather weak, and food restriction appears to be strongly associated with reduced longevity and a truncation of the usual schedule of male and offspring production across a female’s reproductive lifetime. Instead, facultative sex allocation seems most convincingly affected by age at mating, supporting previous work that suggests that social interactions experienced by adult P. citri females are used when allocating sex. Our results highlight that, even within one species, different aspects of the environment may have conflicting effects on sex allocation. ...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} mothers should adjust {{offspring}} <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> when the expected fitness gains or rearing costs differ between sons and daughters. Recent empirical work has linked biased offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> to environmental quality via changes in relative maternal condition. It is unclear, however, whether females can manipulate offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> {{in response to}} environmental quality alone (i. e. independent of maternal condition). We used a balanced within-female experimental design (i. e. females bred on both low- and high-quality diets) to show that female parrot finches (Erythrura trichroa) manipulate <b>primary</b> offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> {{to the quality of}} the rearing environment, and not to their own body condition and health. Individual females produced an unbiased <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> on high-quality diets, but over-produced sons in poor dietary conditions, even though they maintained similar condition between diet treatments. Despite the lack of sexual size dimorphism, such <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> adjustment is in line with predictions from sex allocation theory because nutritionally stressed foster sons were healthier, grew faster and were more likely to survive than daughters. These findings suggest that mothers may adaptively adjust offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> to optimally match their offspring to the expected quality of the rearing environment. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A 200 -year {{time series}} of {{incubation}} temperatures and <b>primary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> for green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) sea turtles nesting in St. Eustatius (North East Caribbean) {{was created by}} combining sand temperature measurements with historical and current environmental data and climate projections. Rainfall and spring tides were important because they cooled the sand and lowered incubation temperatures. Mean annual sand temperatures are currently 31. 0. °C (SD. =. 1. 6) at the nesting beach but show seasonality, with lower temperatures (29. 1 - 29. 6. °C) during January-March and warmer temperatures (31. 9 - 33. 3. °C) in June-August. Results suggest that all three species have had female-biased hatchling production for the past decades with less than 15. 5 %, 36. 0 %, and 23. 7 % males produced every year for greens, hawksbills and leatherbacks respectively since the late nineteenth century. Global warming will exacerbate this female-skew. For example, projections indicate that only 2. 4 % of green turtle hatchlings will be males by 2030, 1. 0 % by 2060, and 0. 4 % by 2090. On the other hand, future changes to nesting phenology {{have the potential to}} mitigate the extent of feminisation. In the absence of such phenological changes, management strategies to artificially lower incubation temperatures by shading nests or relocating nest clutches to deeper depths may {{be the only way to}} prevent the localised extinction of these turtle populations...|$|R
