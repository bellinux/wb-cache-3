5|$|Poles {{were viewed}} by Nazis as subhuman non-Aryans {{and during the}} German {{occupation}} of Poland 2.7 million ethnic Poles {{were killed by the}} Nazis. Polish civilians were subject to forced labour in German industry, internment, wholesale expulsions to make way for German colonists and mass executions. The German authorities engaged in a systematic effort to destroy Polish culture and national identity. During operation AB-Aktion, many university professors and members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed, or transported to concentration camps. During the war, Poland lost an estimated 39 to 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> physicians and dentists, 26 to 57 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> lawyers, 15 to 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> teachers, 30 to 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> scientists and university professors and 18 to 28 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> clergy.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had not {{achieved}} {{a degree of}} success commensurate with their exertions. Nevertheless, in the belief they were having considerable effect on Fighter Command, they prepared to launch their all-out assault on the RAF the following day. By 12 August, German air strength had reached acceptable levels. After bringing its serviceable rates up, the Luftwaffe began Adlertag with 71 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> bomber force, 85 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Bf 109 units, and 83 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Bf 110 units operational.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy casualties. The Polish {{casualties were}} particularly severe. In {{a relatively short}} time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> personnel and 57 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total). Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000. According to Polish historian Zbigniew Wawer, this was the most bloody battle that the Polish Army had been involved in since the battle of Bzura in 1939.|$|E

5|$|German losses {{had been}} heavy at Hannut and Gembloux. The 4th Panzer Division {{was down to}} 137 tanks on 16 May, {{including}} just four Panzer IVs. The 3rd Panzer Division was down by 20–25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> operational force, while the 4th Panzer Division 45–50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> tanks were not combat ready.

5|$|The {{main tank}} of the Soviet tank arm was the T-34, {{on which the}} Red Army {{attempted}} to concentrate production. The tank arm also contained large numbers of the T-70 light tank. For example, the 5th Guards Tank Army roughly contained 270 T-70s and 500 T-34s. In the salient itself the Soviets assembled {{a large number of}} lend-lease tanks. These included U.S.-manufactured M3 Lees and British-built Churchills, Matildas and Valentines. However, the T-34 made up the bulk of the Soviet armour. Without including the deeper reserves organised under the Steppe Front, the Soviets massed about 1,300,000 men, 3,600 tanks, 20,000 artillery pieces and 2,792 aircraft to defend the salient. This amounted to 26 percent of the total manpower of the Red Army, 26 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> mortars and artillery, 35 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> aircraft and 46 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> tanks.|$|E

5|$|Detachment Lika was {{an ad hoc}} {{formation}} {{consisting of}} the 44th Infantry Regiment and one battery of the 17th Artillery Regiment.

5|$|During this time, the U.S. Army {{underwent}} a drastic reduction in size. At {{the end of}} World War II, it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, there were just 10 active divisions in the force, {{along with a few}} reserve divisions such as the 45th Infantry Division which were combat-ineffective. The division retained many of its best officers as senior commanders as the force downsized, and it enjoyed a good relationship with its community. The 45th in this time was {{regarded as one of the}} better-trained National Guard divisions. Regardless, by mid-1950 the division had only 8,413 troops, less than 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> full-strength authorization. Only 10 percent of the division's officers and 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> enlisted men had combat experience with the division from World War II.|$|E

5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely {{more and more}} on the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided $1.4 billion worth of military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> grain imports. Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> economic aid and one-third of its military aid.|$|E
