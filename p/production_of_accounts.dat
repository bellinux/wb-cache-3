50|$|An {{attempt was}} made in 1865 to {{amalgamate}} Her Majesty's and Covent Garden into the Royal Italian Opera Company, Limited, when Gye was to have had £270,000 for {{his interest in the}} latter house, but the project came to nothing. In 1869, however, the two establishments were joined under the management of Gye, and a season commencing on 30 March left a profit of £22,000. Mapleson, the lessee of Her Majesty's, and Gye dissolved their partnership in the autumn of 1870, when there {{is said to have been}} a mortgage of £150,000 on Covent Garden. Gye had much litigation between 1861 and 1872 with Brownlow William Knox, his partner in the Italian opera, who filed a bill in chancery against him (on 20 March 1861) for a dissolution of partnership and a <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts.</b> The action was finally settled in Gye's favour by a judgment of the House of Lords on 8 July 1872.|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} overlap between the Malesian and Nepalese floras was {{analyzed}} by {{comparison of the}} distributions of twenty plant families revised for Flora Malesiana. Despite their geographic separation in some plant families there is significant overlap between the two areas at both the generic and specific levels. In seven of these families at least 40 % of Nepalese species were also found in Malesia. In some families with temperate distributions up to 29 % of Malesian species and all Malesian genera are also found in Nepal. It is suggested that a coordinated approach to the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of such families would improve the rate of <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> and would greatly facilitate knowledge transfer and help to build scientific networks and expertise in Nepal...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the role <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> in society {{by looking at}} the consumption <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> signs during the financial restructuring of a corporation. The paper builds upon insights from prior research on accounting as simulacrum and hyperreality. It examines how accounting numbers serve as reconfigurable signs that construct appropriate "crises", motivate government intervention, and marshal stakeholders towards solutions. The incident {{at the heart of this}} study is the 2001 bailout of the Algoma Steel pension plan by the Ontario government. The incident demonstrates how accounting technologies are required both for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> signs and for their consumption. The paper asks how the <b>production</b> and consumption <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> signs is different from that of other communication signs, what role consumers <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> signs play in determining their meaning, and what difference this makes in how corporate pension plans are protected by government. It concludes that the structures and mechanisms surrounding the consumption <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> signs enable different stakeholders to influence the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> meaning at the moment when accounting signs are consumed, changing the way that risk and wealth are redistributed, and shaping government intervention. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{embodied}} interactional {{ways in which}} people naturally collaborate around and share collections of photographs. We employ ethnographic studies of paper-based photograph use to consider requirements for distributed collaboration around digital photographs. Distributed sharing is currently limited to the ‘passing on ’ of photographs to others, by email, webpages, or mobile phones. To move beyond this, a fundamental challenge for photoware consists of developing support for the practical achievement of sharing ‘at a distance’. Specifically, this entails augmenting the natural <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> or ‘photo-talk ’ to support the distributed achievement of sharing...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the authors discuss the {{usefulness}} of focus groups for researching sensitive issues using evidence from a study examining the experiences of nurses providing care {{in the context of}} the Northern Ireland Troubles. They conducted three group interviews with nurses during which they asked about the issues the nurses face(d) in providing nursing care amid enduring social division. Through a discursive analysis of within-group interaction, they demonstrate how participants employ a range of interpretive resources, the effect of which is to prioritize particular knowledge concerning the nature of nursing care. The identification of such patterned activity highlights the ethnographic value of focus groups to reveal social conventions guiding the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> but also suggests that accounts cannot be divorced from the circumstances of their production. Consequently, the authors argue that focus groups should be considered most useful for illuminating locally sanctioned ways of talking about sensitive issues...|$|E

The article uses a study of malaria interventions to explore the means through which accountability endures.

Second, the article turns attention to interventions in malaria and specifically the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> and distributions of accountability in this field. It will be argued that one means through which accountability has endured is through a heretofore un-discussed parasitism.

The article will suggest that it is the very features of accounts and distributions of accountability that enable such parasitism and that accountability becomes parasitic upon the organizational form...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} three aims. First, it {{presents}} what the term ethnomethodology means and explains {{some of its}} central concepts and tenets. Second, the paper illustrates an ethnomethodological approach to studying strategy by drawing on a fieldwork study {{of the development of}} a waste management strategy in a UK Local Authority, conducted by the first author. Third, the distinctive approach that ethnomethodology takes to the study of social organization is presented in order to outline what it could offer to the understanding of strategic organization in particular. The paper concludes by discussing the insights that ethnomethodology can offer in the strategic management field, including existing applications and potential future lines of enquiry, particularly in the field known as Strategy-as-Practice. The conclusion advocates a move away from rational analytic models, proclamations and prescriptive treatments of strategy towards studying the more mundane work that enables strategic action to take place, notably the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of various kinds. It is argued that through accounts, members produce the social facts that generate ‘strategies’ of various kinds. This necessitates a studying fact production ‘in flight’. Strategic organization is thereby conceptualised as an ongoing achievement of member’s ethno-methods for producing it...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on a {{comparative}} {{case study of}} enterprise risk management, and building on the literature on boundary objects, this study sheds light on the ‘dynamics of (dis) integrated risk management’. Our analysis of enterprise risk management in two large organisations reveals a set of pressures that undermine the ideals of enterprise risk management mobilised by practitioners and their promise for ‘integrated’ control practices. While the two cases show how enterprise risk management is shaped in different forms, {{in both cases the}} attempt to create a shared context for the identification and communication of enterprise-wide risks makes visible and active residual elements that contribute to generate dissatisfaction and calls for change to integrated risk management. The discussion of the dynamics of (dis) integrated risk management contributes to extending research that is critical of procedural forms of enterprise risk management, as well as recent work that draws attention to the role of ‘risk talk’ in enterprise risk management. We also suggest that our study of enterprise risk management sheds light on some key tensions of infrastructure formation, thus contributing to recent theory-building research that draws attention to the accretion of processes, roles, and governance structures into an infrastructure that enables the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of performance...|$|E
