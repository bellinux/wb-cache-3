5|$|Toyota's Vehicle Proximity Notification System (VPNS) was {{introduced}} in the United States in all 2012 model year <b>Prius</b> family vehicles, including the <b>Prius</b> v, <b>Prius</b> Plug-in Hybrid and the standard <b>Prius.</b> The system is being introduced to comply with the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010.|$|E
5|$|According to the U.S. Department of Energy, {{combined}} sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric {{cars in the}} American market climbed more rapidly and outsold by more than double sales of hybrid-electric vehicles over their respective 24 month introductory periods. A 2016 analysis by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric cars in the U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. An analysis by Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period. Monthly sales of the Volt, <b>Prius</b> PHV and Leaf performed better than the conventional <b>Prius</b> during their respective introductory periods, {{with the exception of the}} Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which has been outsold most of the time by the <b>Prius</b> HEV over their 36-month introductory periods.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, it was {{reported}} that General Motors would lose money on the Volt for at least the first couple of generations, but it hoped the car would create a green image that could rival the <b>Prius.</b>|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{companies}} in the U.S. offering conversions. The most common conversions have been from hybrid electric cars to plug-in hybrid, but due to the different technology used in hybrids by each carmaker, the easiest conversions are for 2004–2009 Toyota <b>Prius</b> and for the Ford Escape/Mercury Mariner Hybrid.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and {{it was found that}} under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All <b>Prius</b> models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E
5|$|Several plug-in {{electric}} vehicle fire incidents {{have taken place}} since the introduction of mass-production plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s in 2008.

5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a <b>Prius</b> Plug-in and suggested buying a standard <b>Prius</b> hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} avoid its {{dependence}} on rare-earth minerals, Toyota Motor Corporation announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and electric cars that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an induction motor that is lighter and more efficient than the magnet-type motor used in the <b>Prius,</b> which uses two rare earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in electric cars in the market that use these rare-earth elements are the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt and Honda Insight. For its second generation RAV4 EV due in 2012, Toyota is using an induction motor supplied by Tesla Motors that does not require rare-earth materials. The Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Model S use a similar motor.|$|E

5000|$|Green {{grew up in}} Los Angeles {{where he}} [...] "spent {{most of his life}} stuck in traffic."
