500|$|The {{year after}} their marriage, the couple began {{campaign}}ing for George W. Bush's 1978 Congressional candidacy. According to George Bush, {{when he asked}} her to marry him, she had said, [...] "Yes. But only if you <b>promise</b> <b>me</b> that I'll never have to make a campaign speech." [...] She soon relented, and gave her first stump speech for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in Muleshoe, Texas. After narrowly winning the primary, he lost the general election.|$|E
500|$|Richard {{herself has}} been less {{complimentary}} about her alter ego's departure. She has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's [...] "changing character" [...] and [...] "depressing final storyline". In {{an interview with the}} Biography Channel she explained: [...] "I did say, <b>promise</b> <b>me</b> you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That's what [...] Julia Smith wanted, and that's what I felt was right, so I resigned... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now... There was so much history with that family." ...|$|E

[...] He served as President of the Council for Music in Hospitals from 1987 to 1999. He also published two volumes of reminiscences: <b>Promise</b> <b>Me</b> You'll Sing Mud (1975) and Nothing Quite Like It (1982), and a third book, Reflections on Scotland (1988).|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} continued {{traveling and}} growing more tired and cold. Then the sleigh again hit an obstruction and tipped over, throwing Hazel over the dashboard into the snow. Hazel, Emmet, and Myrdith {{tried to push}} the sleigh upright, but were {{not strong enough to}} lift it, even with all three pushing at once. Using the overturned sleigh as a shelter, Hazel spread two blankets, told Emmet and Myrdith to lie down, and placed a third blanket atop them. The children tried to keep moving to stay warm. Hazel huddled beside her brother and sister and used her body heat to warm them. She told them stories to keep them awake. The children sang all four verses of [...] "America the Beautiful," [...] a song they had sung during opening exercises at the country school that morning, and repeated the Lord's Prayer. Hazel advised her siblings, [...] "Remember, you mustn't go to sleep — even if I do. <b>Promise</b> <b>me</b> you won't, no matter how sleepy you get. Keep each other awake! Promise?" [...] Her brother and sister promised.|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover. She had {{initially}} {{tried to get a}} picture with just Lennon alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and {{he looked like he was}} clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. <b>Promise</b> <b>me</b> it'll be on the cover.' I looked him in the eye and we shook on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|E
