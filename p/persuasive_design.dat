In this study we conducted four surveys of Sweden’s four most popular Social networking sites and how they are used. We followed up with ten interviews to gain understanding of why the users use these sites in a certain way. We identified four different target behaviors on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn with help from the results we gathered from our surveys and our interviews. We then used a behavior model for <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> (FBM) to identify the different factors of the model in Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn’s design. The three factors of the behavior model are: motivation, ability and triggers. To gain further understanding of how Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn motivates, allows and triggers users to perform target behaviors we analyzed our findings using theories from research already done on <b>persuasive</b> <b>design.</b> We found that <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> was a powerful tool {{when it comes to making}} users perform a certain target behavior. Where the target behavior was not being performed we identified where the design did not correspond with the behavior model. Our goal was to expand on the behavior model by providing it with real world examples. By doing so we hope to help designers gain further understanding about how <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> works and how to put it into practice. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{worldwide}} internet usage {{has given rise}} to the phenomenon of 'open movements'. These are communities that evolve based around the collaborative production of common resources, to which free access is typically provided to all who choose to use it. Such communities and the resources they create have developed rapidly over the past 10 - 20 years and are the cause for major scholarly interest. This study takes the step of applying the lens of <b>Persuasive</b> <b>Design</b> to the study of open movements in order to show how site design can play a role in increasing participant activity and longevity. For this purpose it looks at two 'open movement' resources, the collaboratively edited map OpenStreetMap and The Pirate Bay, a tracker for torrents uploaded by the le-sharing community. The analysis is two-fold: first, it uses quantitative data of user participation in the systems, derived from downloads of system-generated user-histories to generate an overall picture of user-participation in each of the systems. Second, it applies a set of heuristics to evaluate the <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> of the systems in question. It then connects the results of the quantitative analysis with the heuristic analysis in order to see how the <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> of the systems impact on user participation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the existing body of knowledge on how we design computer systems, particularly multiuser software for knowledge sharing and creation in globally diffused companies. This is achieved by conducting a work place study of a global industrial engineering conglomerate which has the strategy of working with knowledge {{in the form of}} “best practices” meant to boost performance. The thesis explores the situation that workers are in, since they are meant to share and develop “best practices” knowledge in a portal based Knowledge Management System (KMS). The study indentifies a set of problems that prevents knowledge sharing from taking place to the degree to which management was specifically aiming. It was explored whether these problems could, to some degree, be mitigated by employing <b>persuasive</b> <b>design,</b> which is a new stance towards design where the aim is to directly seek to change the user’s behavior, i. e., persuading more knowledge sharing. The main contribution is an indication of an anomaly with regards to the strategic approach towards knowledge management, where knowledge sharing is seen as an effort by which companies can gain a competitive advantage by working with knowledge in a structured fashion. The issue is that the descriptions found in literature on strategic knowledge management do not address the many issues uncovered when conducting prolonged fieldwork among workers who engage in the activities that the literature seemingly takes for granted. Thus, many practical problems were uncovered that would need some level of mitigation before a company could hope to gain a strategic advantage from working with knowledge. This challenges the “stock" approach towards knowledge management, which seems to address only the management level of the organization. A contribution is also made in exploring the state-of-the-art of the emerging field of <b>persuasive</b> <b>design.</b> <b>Persuasive</b> <b>design</b> aims at enabling designers to create designs that deliberately change the user’s attitude or behavior. According to this new design tradition, the designer specifically designs with the aim of behavior transformation. The goal is a deliberate behavioral change, rather than supporting a set of existing tasks or a set of existing behaviors. The work presented shows how <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> is a very conceptual area of research, and {{that it is not a}} fitting approach for attaining a higher degree of participation in computer systems for knowledge sharing and creation. <b>Persuasive</b> <b>design</b> is thus not the remedy for the many problems found that prevent knowledge sharing from taking plac...|$|E

40|$|Although eHealth {{technologies}} and especially web-based interventions {{for the promotion}} of health and health related behavior {{have been shown to be}} effective, the impact is hindered by non-adherence: while many eHealth interventions reach a large group of participants, not all of these participants complete the intervention and may therefore not benefit as much from the intervention as they could. In this thesis, non-adherence is investigated by means of empirical studies into two web-based interventions: the Healthy Weight Assistant, an intervention aimed at healthy dietary and physical activity behavior; and Living to the Full, an intervention for the prevention of depression. Additionally, a systematic review was conducted to investigate the influence of intervention characteristics and <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> on adherence to web-based interventions. The comparison of adherers and non-adherers in the empirical studies has shown that adherers and non-adherers are different groups, but there are no universal predictors for adherence; rather it is important to create a match between participants and the intervention to improve adherence. Second, the human centered development process of Living to the Full and the investigation of the reasons for use of the Healthy Weight Assistant showed that participants expect a web-based intervention to support them in achieving their goals and to have the advantages that the Internet has to offer. Not fulfilling these expectations may well be a reason for non-adherence. Third, the systematic review showed that a <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> of web-based interventions, especially more use of dialogue support, increases the adherence to the intervention. The investigation of the impact of different <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> elements in Living to the Full showed that these <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> elements not always result in better adherence. Lastly, the empirical studies showed that participants do not use all features of a web-based intervention, but adherers use more features and seem to be more involved with the intervention than non-adherers. With these insights, the opportunity arises to not only hope for adherence, but to plan for adherence...|$|E

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} addresses persuasive technologies, being {{dedicated to}} the stu¬dy of their inherent design strategies and proposing their practical exploration. Given the emergence of numerous applications for mobile devices that are currently created to assist individuals in performing everyday tasks, it becomes necessary to understand the design techniques that they use in order to influence user behavior. In this sense, this dissertation seeks to identify <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> principles and patterns. The study begins by discussing the concept of persuasive technology according {{to the notion of}} captology, establishing a connection with strategies of gamification, and focusing on motivation as an element of connection between these concepts. Subse¬quently, a comparison of the terminology used by several authors is made, in a search for systematization of a vocabulary that is still unstable. We focus on <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> patterns and principles, identifying design elements and specific mechanics, which are intended to promote certain dynamics, or behaviors {{on the part of the}} user. In this process, the relevance of the social dimension in persuasion is emphasized, as a princi¬ple that guides the development of the practical component of this study. The study proceeds to the conceptualization and prototyping of an application for mobile devices, informed by the observation of existing persuasive mobile applications. This project aims to put into play previously identified <b>persuasive</b> <b>design</b> strategies, following a methodology that highlights the role of the social dimension in persuasion. In this manner, this study aims to promote awareness on a topic that is becoming more and more present in our everyday use of technologies, both in terms of their design as well as in terms of their experience through interactio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a novel artifact to provide categorized and ethical examples of <b>design</b> principles of <b>Persuasive</b> System <b>Design</b> (PSD) model. PSD model is considered as a fundamental design and analysis tool for creating systems that aim at behavior and attitude change ethically. With the increased attention in <b>persuasive</b> system <b>design</b> field and rise in Behavior Change Support Systems (BCSS), we can expect an in increase in adoption of PSD model in design and development of such systems. Despite these developments, examples of design principles from PSD model are neither readily available nor categorized. In response to this obstacle, we created and evaluated a support tool where users could share, obtain, and rate examples from each design principle. We utilized design principles from PSD model to implement the rating feature. We used Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to create the artifact. We tested desirability using Product Reaction Cards to understand user’s feeling about the support tool. We also evaluated perceived effectiveness of both rating feature and app as a whole to identify the perceived effectiveness. From the results, we deduced intention to use and predicted actual usage in the future. The support tool may be useful for persuasive system designers, researchers or beginners on this field to see real life examples of design principles of PSD model. Hopefully, it could support them on <b>designing</b> more ethical <b>persuasive</b> system or contribute towards the <b>persuasive</b> system <b>design</b> area...|$|R

40|$|Persuasion is {{the process}} of {{changing}} individuals' attitude, or behavior, or both. The study of persuasion in the context of technology has led to building models for <b>designing</b> <b>persuasive</b> software. Following these models' specifications has been believed to enhance system persuasive effect. In this research, we aim at answering the question of the suitability of <b>persuasive</b> system <b>design</b> models for different software systems. We investigate the role of user-centered design approaches, in electing concepts of persuasive system models, in order to increase persuasiveness. Moreover, we test the effect of performing us- ability tests on alternative onboarding scenarios, while A/B testing small changes to the existing onboarding design. The methodology of this research defines an artifact that we want to build. The artifact is a system that provides the feature of renting used clothes through “Le Tote". We gather information about the users’ needs and the stakeholders desires of building a persuasive system, and we then use persuasive system models to fullfil these needs, and build the artifact. After that, we evaluate the artifact and the designs through usability testing of the onboarding scenarios, and A/B testing the minor changes in the existing design. Combining user-centered <b>design</b> approaches with <b>persuasive</b> system <b>design</b> models helps in electing specific persuasive concepts which are suitable for the nature of the technology. We conclude that not all concepts from persuasive models can be applied to all technologies. Moreover, using usability tests in the whole product, in addition to A/B tests on minor design changes, leads to revealing the need to focus on micro-interactions and language in persuasive scenarios...|$|R
