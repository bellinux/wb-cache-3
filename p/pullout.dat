5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and {{fighting}} {{between the two sides}} was paused. After a series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions and the JNA retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. Serbia continued to support the RSK after the JNA <b>pullout.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1972, {{it became}} the basis for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Center, Vietnam Field Office. It served in the region for several years and earning ten {{campaign}} streamers before being deactivated during the American forces <b>pullout</b> from the region. The brigade was reactivated in Korea in the 1980s to provide command and control for all U.S. Pacific military police forces, and has since been moved to Hawaii, where much of U.S. Army Pacific is located.|$|E
5|$|In November, the JNA and Croatia reached several {{agreements}} {{to end the}} blockade and withdraw JNA from Croatia. The <b>pullout</b> was completed by 4 January 1992, except in areas around Dubrovnik and on the islands of Vis and Lastovo. The JNA maintained its presence there until the summer of 1992. As the JNA withdrew from the areas it controlled in Croatia, it {{was replaced by the}} UN peacekeepers agreed upon by the Vance plan.|$|E

40|$|The National Park Service {{proposes to}} resurface, restore, and {{rehabilitate}} {{the road and}} associated <b>pullouts</b> and parking areas between Canyon Junction and Fishing Bridge Junction, {{also known as the}} "Hayden Valley " road, within Yellowstone National Park. This is an interim measure until the road can be reconstructed in the future. The proposal (Alternative A) would be to recycle and overlay the entire 25. 3 kilometers (15. 7 miles) of road on the existing alignment to the same 7. 4 -meter (24 -foot) width. Eleven <b>pullouts</b> would be formalized; seven informal <b>pullouts</b> would be obliterated due to safety and resource concerns, and three new <b>pullouts</b> constructed. Aggregate and borrow material would be obtained from the Sylvan Pass pit. Under Alternative B (No Action) no major repair work would be done until the road is scheduled for reconstruction, at least ten years into the future. This segment of the Grand Loop Road is in an advanced state of deterioration, and work is needed now to maintain the road until it can be reconstructed in ten to fifteen years. The pavement is rutted from wear and cracking because of poor drainage, poor-quality base material, and increasingly heavy vehicle use. Wildlife viewing has increased in the central portion of the park, and there are insufficient <b>pullouts</b> and parking areas to support the use. As a result, the public is creatin...|$|R

5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially pushed for a negotiated settlement but later supported a unilateral <b>pullout</b> from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1968 {{the group}} was again activated, this time in Vietnam. Its {{activation}} {{was part of a}} larger activation of several military police groups in the region to provide greater command and control for Military Police operating throughout the region. As such, the headquarters element took command of military police units already operating in the country. The Brigade provided policing duties, based in Long Binh along with the 89th Military Police Group. During that time it was a subordinate unit of the 18th Military Police Brigade. It received its distinctive unit insignia on 12 November 1969. The group operated in Vietnam until the <b>pullout</b> of U.S. forces from the nation, receiving ten campaign streamers for its role in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The TuđmanĆosić {{agreement}} on the <b>pullout</b> of JNA troops from Konavle provoked an emotional response in Yugoslavia, where it was interpreted as a defeat and betrayal. Following the agreement, the Prevlaka Peninsula was demilitarized and placed under the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), established by the UN Security Council Resolution 779 of 6 October 1992. The resolution placed the peninsula {{under the control of}} UNPROFOR. The UN Security Council Resolution 981 transferred control to the newly established United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia on 31 March 1995, and then to UNMOP through the UN Security Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996. The UN mission there expired two months later. , the Prevlaka Peninsula remains demilitarized, with Croatian and Montenegrin police jointly patrolling the sea. The border in the area remains disputed between Croatia and Montenegro.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{military}} in Anbar Province {{had a series}} of reorganizations in late 2009 and early 2010. The last non-American foreign forces left Iraq on 31 July 2009 and Multi-National Forces West became United States Force– West. On 23 January 2010, the Marines formally left both Anbar Province and Iraq, transferring American military commitments over to the United States Army's 1st Armored Division. The Army promptly merged United States Division West with United States Division– Baghdad, creating United States Division– Center to advise Iraqi forces in both Anbar and Baghdad. In December 2010, the 25th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for Anbar Province. On 7 December, the United States transferred its last base in Anbar Province, Al Asad, to the Iraqi Government. One week later, hundreds of Fallujah residents celebrated the <b>pullout</b> by burning American flags in the city.|$|E
5|$|In late September, Izetbegović and Tuđman {{met again}} and {{attempted}} to create military coordination against the VRS, but to no avail. By October, the agreement had collapsed and afterwards Croatia diverted delivery of weaponry to Bosnia and Herzegovina by seizing a significant amount for itself. Boban had abandoned a Bosnian government alliance and ceased all hostilities with Karadžić. The dominant Croatian–Bosnian defense of Posavina fell apart after Tuđman and/or Gojko Šušak ordered {{the withdrawal of the}} Croatian Army (HV), enabling the Serbs to gain control of the corridor and connect their captured territories in western and eastern Bosnia. On 8 October, the town of Bosanski Brod was abandoned by the HVO and left to the VRS. By that time, the HV and the HVO had sustained approximately 7,500 casualties, out of 20,000 troops committed to the battle to control Posavina. The <b>pullout</b> appeared to be a quid pro quo for the JNA withdrawal from Dubrovnik's hinterland that took place in July. Still, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements. On 9 October, the HVO signed a cease-fire with the VRS in Jajce in exchange for providing electricity.|$|E
5|$|The JNA also {{evacuated}} its facilities {{elsewhere in}} Croatia. <b>Pullout</b> from the Maršal Tito and Kerestinec barracks in Zagreb started on 30 November, and {{was completed by}} the end of 1991. Istria was evacuated by the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy on 15 December, handing over the Croatian TO weapons to the HV. The quantity of the TO weapons handed over in Istriawhere the JNA evacuated 78 facilitieswas enough to arm two combat brigades. In December 1991, only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade, including a minor, unsuccessful HV attack on Mekušje barracks in Karlovac. Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment, the JNA remained for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually withdrew from Croatia, the JNA left their equipment to the Republic of Serbian Krajina, established in the JNA-held areas of Croatia on 19 December. The JNA and the Yugoslav Navy kept their bases on Vis and Lastovo islands until early June 1992 before pulling out unilaterally. The JNA maintained positions near Dubrovnik until July, while the naval blockade of the city was lifted on 26 May 1992.|$|E
