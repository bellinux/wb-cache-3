40|$|Background: Compound {{profiling}} {{and drug}} screening generates {{large amounts of}} data and is generally based on microplate assays. Current information systems used for handling this are mainly commercial, closed source, expensive, and heavyweight {{and there is a}} need for a flexible lightweight open system for handling plate design, and validation and preparation of data. Results: A Bioclipse plugin consisting of a client part and a relational database was constructed. A multiple-step <b>plate</b> <b>layout</b> point-and-click interface was implemented inside Bioclipse. The system contains a data validation step, where outliers can be removed, and finally a plate report with all relevant calculated data, including dose-response curves. Conclusions: Brunn is capable of handling the data from microplate assays. It can create dose-response curves and calculate IC 50 values. Using a system of this sort facilitates work in the laboratory. Being able to reuse already constructed plates and plate layouts by starting out from an earlier step in the <b>plate</b> <b>layout</b> design process saves time and cuts down on error sources...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a SPICE model for the ohmic side of AC-coupled Si microstrip detectors where interstrip isolation is obtained via field plates. The interstrip isolation has been measured in various conditions by varying the field plate voltage. Simulations have been compared with experimental data {{in order to determine}} the values of the SPICE parameters for different voltages applied to the field plates. The model is able to predict correctly the frequency dependence of the coupling between adjacent strips. Furthermore, we have used such model for the study of the signal propagation along the detector when a current signal is injected in a strip. Only electrical coupling is considered here, without any contribution due to charge sharing derived from carrier diffusion. For this purpose, the AC pads of the strips have been connected to a read-out electronics and the current signal has been injected into a DC pad. Good agreement between measurements and simulations has been reached for the central strip and the first neighbours. Experimental tests and computer simulations have been performed for four different strip and field <b>plate</b> <b>layouts,</b> in order to investigate how the detector geometry affects the parameters of the SPICE model and the signal propagation.

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{types of}} assays allow {{sensitive}} detection of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. For example, {{the extent of}} antibody neutralization of HIV- 1, SIV and SHIV {{can be measured in}} the TZM-bl cell line through the degree of luciferase reporter gene expression after infection. In the past, neutralization curves and titers for this standard assay have been calculated using an Excel macro. Updating all instances of such a macro with new techniques can be unwieldy and introduce non-uniformity across multi-lab teams. Using Excel also poses challenges in centrally storing, sharing and associating raw data files and results. Results We present LabKey Server's NAb tool for organizing, analyzing and securely sharing data, files and results for neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays, including the luciferase-based TZM-bl NAb assay. The customizable tool supports high-throughput experiments and includes a graphical plate template designer, allowing researchers to quickly adapt calculations to new <b>plate</b> <b>layouts.</b> The tool calculates the percent neutralization for each serum dilution based on luminescence measurements, fits a range of neutralization curves to titration results and uses these curves to estimate the neutralizing antibody titers for benchmark dilutions. Results, curve visualizations and raw data files are stored in a database and shared through a secure, web-based interface. NAb results can be integrated with other data sources based on sample identifiers. It is simple to make results public after publication by updating folder security settings. Conclusions Standardized tools for analyzing, archiving and sharing assay results can improve the reproducibility, comparability and reliability of results obtained across many labs. LabKey Server and its NAb tool are freely available as open source software at [URL] under the Apache 2. 0 license. Many members of the HIV research community can also access the LabKey Server NAb tool without installing the software by using the Atlas Science Portal ([URL]).

40|$|A global-local {{higher order}} model {{considering}} transverse normal deformation is proposed {{to predict the}} thermal response of laminated plates subjected to actual temperature field. The in-plane temperature field is expressed as a harmonic series expansion whereas the nonlinear temperature profile in the thickness direction is determined by solving the heat conduction equation. Validity of the proposed model is verified by comparing results with existing publications. Moreover, influence of the temperature fields along the thickness direction on the thermal behaviors of laminates is also investigated. Numerical results show that present model can reasonably predict thermal response of general laminated plates as well as laminated <b>plates</b> with arbitrary <b>layouts</b> under actual temperature loads. However, higher-order zigzag theory neglecting transverse normal deformation is inadequate for predicting thermal response of laminated plates subjected to actual temperature fields.

40|$|Infection {{with human}} {{influenza}} virus leads to serious respiratory disease. Vaccination {{is the most}} common and effective prophylactic measure to prevent influenza. Influenza vaccine manufacturing and release is controlled by the correct determination of the potency-defining haemagglutinin (HA) content. This determination is historically done by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID), which utilizes a statistical slope-ratio model to estimate the actual HA content. In this paper we describe the development and qualification of a parallel line model for analysis of HA quantification by SRID in cell culture-derived whole virus final monovalent and trivalent influenza vaccines. We evaluated <b>plate</b> <b>layout,</b> sample randomization, and validity of data and statistical model. The parallel line model was shown to be robust and reproducible. The precision studies for HA content demonstrated 3. 8 - 5. 0 % repeatability and 3. 8 %- 7. 9 % intermediate precision. Furthermore, system suitability criteria were developed to guarantee long-term stability of this assay in a regulated production environment. SRID is fraught with methodological and logistical difficulties and the determination of the HA content requires the acceptance of new and modern release assays, but until that moment, the described parallel line model represents a significant and robust update for the current global influenza vaccine release assay.

40|$|International audienceThe {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{describes how the}} surface of the Earth is split into an organized jigsaw of seven large plates 1 of similar sizes and a population of smaller plates, whose areas follow a fractal distribution 2, 3. The reconstruction of global tectonics during the past 200 My 4 suggests that this layout is probably a long-term feature of our planet, but the forces governing it are unknown. Previous studies 3, 5, 6, primarily based on statistical properties of plate distributions, were unable to resolve how the size of plates is determined by lithosphere properties and/or underlying mantle convection. Here, we demonstrate that the <b>plate</b> <b>layout</b> of the Earth is produced by a dynamic feedback between mantle convection and the strength of the lithosphere. Using 3 D spherical models of mantle convection with plate-like behaviour that match the plate size-frequency distribution observed for Earth, we show that subduction geometry drives the tectonic fragmentation that generates plates. The spacing between slabs controls the layout of large plates, and the stresses caused by the bending of trenches, break plates into smaller fragments. Our results explain why the fast evolution in small back-arc plates 7, 8 reflects the dramatic changes in plate motions during times of major reorganizations. Our study opens the way to use convection simulations with plate-like behaviour to unravel how global tectonics and mantle convection are dynamically connected...|$|E
