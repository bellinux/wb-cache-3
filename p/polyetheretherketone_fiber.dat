40|$|Efforts were {{directed}} to develop processing methods to make carbon fiber/thermoplastic fiber preforms {{that are easy to}} handle and drapeable, and to consolidate them into low void content laminates. The objectives were attained with the development of the hybrid yarn concept; whereby, thermoplastic fiber can be intimately intermixed with carbon fiber into a hybrid yarn. This was demonstrated with the intermixing of Celion 3000 with a Celanese liquid crystal polymer fiber, polybutylene terepthalate fiber, or <b>polyetheretherketone</b> <b>fiber.</b> The intermixing of the thermoplastic matrix fiber and the reinforcing carbon fiber gives a preform that can be easily fabricated into laminates with low void content. Mechanical properties of the laminates were not optimized; however, initial results indicated properties typical of a thermoplastic/carbon fiber composites prepared by more conventional methods...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 51 As {{the usage}} of {{sealless}} pumps increases, so do the demands for journal bearing materials that can operate successfully through the thermal upsets that can take place in these pumps. Material specification literature is only a start at making a knowledgeable choice. A test facility and procedure was developed to evaluate different journal bearings materials for use in sealless pumps. The facility simulates an actual American Petroleum Institute (APO) sealless pump bearing installation. Fifteen different materials combinations were tested. Tabulated and graphed test results are presented. A 30 percent carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>polyetheretherketone</b> (PEEK) and a 15 percent graphite filled polyimide material operated 40 minutes in a no flush water condition. Silicon carbide {{and most of the}} carbon graphite based materials had no wear after the no flush water tests were terminated. Polymer based materials had the most wear and operated the shortest amount of time in the no flush water condition...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} a part of European {{commission}} collaborative Safeprotex project of Seventh Framework Programme to manufacture high protective clothing for complex emergency operations. The goal of this thesis is to manufacture <b>polyetheretherketone,</b> PEEK, <b>fibers</b> by melt spinning and modify them to provide antimicrobial, self-cleaning and antipollution properties. PEEK has excellent thermal and mechanical properties and good chemical resistance. The literature review clearly shows that PEEK should be easily spinnable. Melt spinning is a process where polymer is melted, normally by extruder or piston system. The system of TUT is based on Göttfert capillary rheometer which is a piston system. Melt material is pushed through a small hole after which it faces cold air and starts to cool down. Solidified fiber is drawn to a roll. PEEK modification is done by sulfonate groups that change the chemical structure so that functional properties are possible. Without modification the reaction does not happen. Reaction is based on benzophenone compounds that are excited by UV-light. During the experimental part DSC, TGA and rheological tests were made to characterize PEEK. The results of these tests confirm that PEEK has excellent thermal properties and it should be easily spinnable. Fiber spinning of virgin PEEK turned out to be easy and the best achieved fibers were less than 20 μm in diameter. Operating temperature and hole diameter {{turned out to be the}} most important parameters in our spinning system. TUT piston system, Göttfert capillary rheometer is not designed for fiber spinning which lead to a few problems most importantly variations in fiber thickness. PEEK modification was done by our Italian partner company Next Technology Tecnotessile. Modification provided wanted functional properties but it also made spinning more difficult, worsened thermal stability and made the fibers more brittle. Modified PEEK was mixed with virgin PEEK to avoid these problems. At best, 1. 5 % of modified PEEK could be added to virgin PEEK and still be able to make fibers of it. /Kir 1...|$|R
40|$|This morphometric and {{experimental}} {{study was designed}} to assess the dimensions and axes of the subaxial cervical pedicles and to compare the accuracy of two different techniques for subaxial cervical pedicle screw (CPS) placement using newly designed aiming devices. Transpedicular fixation is increasingly used for stabilizing the subaxial cervical spine. Development of the demanding technique is based on morphometric studies of the pedicle anatomy. Several surgical techniques have been developed and evaluated with respect to their feasibility and accuracy. The study was carried out on six conserved human cadavers (average age 85  years). Axes and dimensions of the pedicles C 3 –C 7 (60 pedicles) were measured using multislice computed tomography (CT) images prior to surgery. Two groups consisting of 3 specimens and 30 pedicles each were established according to the screw placement technique. For surgical technique 1 (ST 1) a para-articular mini-laminotomy was performed. Guidance of the drill through the pedicle with a handheld aiming device attached onto the medial aspect of the pedicle inside the spinal canal. Screw hole preparation monitored by lateral fluoroscopy. In surgical technique 2 (ST 2) a more complex aiming device was used for screw holes drilling. It consists of a frame with a fully adjustable radiolucent arm for carrying the instruments necessary for placing the screws. The arm was angled according to the cervical pedicle axis as determined by the preoperative CT scans. Drilling was monitored by lateral fluoroscopy. In either technique 3. 5  mm screws made of carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>polyetheretherketone</b> (CF-PEEK) were inserted. The use of the CF-PEEK screws allowed for precise postoperative CT-assessment since this material does not cause artifacts. Screw placement was qualified from ideal to unacceptable into four grades: I = screw centered in pedicle; IIa = perforation of pedicle wall less than one-fourth of the screw diameter; IIb = perforation more than one-fourth of the screw diameter without contact to neurovascular structures; III = screw more than one-fourth outside the pedicle with contact to neurovascular structures. Fifty-six pedicle screws could be evaluated according to the same CT protocol that was used preoperatively. Accuracy of pedicle screw placement did not reveal significant differences between techniques 1 and 2. A tendency towards less severe misplacements (grade III) was seen in ST 2 (15 % in ST 2 vs. 23 % in ST 1) as well as a higher rate of screw positions graded IIa (62 % in ST 2 vs. 43 % in ST 1). C 4 and C 5 were identified to be the most critical vertebral levels with three malpositioned screws each. Because of the variability of cervical pedicles preoperative CT evaluation with multiplanar reconstructions of the pedicle anatomy is essential for transpedicular screw placement in the cervical spine. Cadaver studies remain mandatory to develop safer and technically less demanding procedures. A similar study is projected to further develop the technique of CPS fixation with regard to safety and clinical practicability...|$|R
