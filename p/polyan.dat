5000|$|The Polans (Поляни Polyany;); also Polianians; were an East Slavic tribe {{between the}} 6th and the 9th century, which {{inhabited}} {{both sides of}} the Dnieper river from Liubech to Rodnia and also down the lower streams of the rivers Ros', Sula, Stuhna, Teteriv, Irpin', Desna and Pripyat. In the Early Middle Ages there were two separate Slavic tribes bearing the name of Polans, the other being the western Polans (ancestors of the modern Poles), an unrelated West Slavic tribe. The name derives from the Old East Slavic word поле or поляна (polyana), which means [...] "field", because the Polans tribe used to settle in the open fertile agricultural fields. In roughly 862 Polans were attached to ancient Rus'. After shifting the ancient Rus' capital to their city Kiev, the Polans managed to provide their language as state language and were the first non-Rus' tribe to change their name to Rus' and {{played a key role in}} the formation of Ukrainian identity. Ukrainian, Belorussian and, somewhat possibly, Rusyn languages descend from <b>Polyan</b> dialects.|$|E
40|$|Mutations in RPGRIP 1 are {{associated}} with early onset retinal degenerations in humans and dogs. Dogs homozygous for a 44 bp insertion including a polyA 29 tract potentially leading to premature truncation of the protein, show cone rod degeneration. This is rapid and blinding in a colony of dogs in which the mutation was characterised but in dogs with the same mutation in the pet population there is very variable disease severity and rate of progression. Objective: We hypothesized that this variability must be associated with leakiness of the RPGRIP 1 mutation, allowing continued RPGRIP 1 production. The {{study was designed to}} discover mechanisms that might allow such leakiness. Methods: We analysed alternate start sites and splicing of RPGRIP 1 transcripts; variability of <b>polyAn</b> length in the insertion and slippage at <b>polyAn</b> during transcription/translation. Results and Significance: We observed a low rate of use of alternative start codons having potential to allow forms of transcript not including the insertion, with the possibility of encoding truncated functional RPGRIP 1 protein isoforms. Complex alternative splicing was observed, but did not increase this potential. Variable <b>polyAn</b> length was confirmed in DNA from different RPGRIP 12 / 2 dogs, yet <b>polyAn</b> variability did not correspond with the clinical phenotypes and no individual was found that carried a <b>polyAn</b> tract capable of encoding an in-frame variant. Remarkably though, in luciferase reporter gene assays, out-of-frame inserts still allowed downstream reporter gene expression at some 40 % of the efficiency of in...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA novel {{method is}} {{proposed}} to access to new poly(a-amino-e-caprolactoneco-e-caprolactone) using poly(a-iodo-e-caprolactone-co-e-caprolactone) as polymeric substrate. First, ring-opening (co) polymerizations of a-iodo-e-caprolactone (aIeCL) with e-caprolactone (eCL) are performed using tin 2 -ethylhexanoate (Sn(Oct) 2) as catalyst. (Co) polymers are fully characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, FTIR, SEC, DSC, and TGA. Then, these iodinated polyesters {{are used as}} polymeric substrates to access to poly(a-amino-e-caprolactone-co-e-caprolactone) by two different strategies. The first one is the reaction of poly(aIeCL-co-eCL) with ammonia, the second one is the reduction of <b>poly(aN</b> 3 eCL-co-eCL) by hydrogenolysis.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the separation of tetrahydrofuran-methanol by heteroazeotropic-batch-distillation and methanol-hexane by pervaporation is presented. In particular for this last task, four different specialty commercial membranes were tested (varying feed concentration and temperature). The “pore filling” <b>PolyAn</b> membranes show methanol permeance values higher than 5100 GPU (Typ M 2 VR); separation factor of 19; and a selectivity of about 119 (Typ M 1 VR). From the results, a coupling phenomenon was observed. An assessment of the temperature effect in the pervaporation process corroborates the hypothesis of the presence of a coupling phenomenon. Finally, a discussion is made on two industrial scale units for the separation of the same mixture: a system of a distillation column integrated with a decanter and stand-alone pervaporation unit. The energetic comparison shows that when using pervaporation a large reduction of the energetic consumption compared to a conventional distillation system (up to 29 %) can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{transesterification}} {{reaction to}} produce methanol and butyl acetate has {{great interest in}} the chemical industry. The separation of these two compounds from the reaction media increases the productivity, thus, a hybrid configuration composed of reaction-pervaporation is of interest. In this work, 10 commercial specialty membranes (PlyAn and Sulzer Pervap membranes) have been studied in a pervaporation setup at three temperatures (30, 40 and 50 °C) and a feed concentration ranging between 20 and 80 mol% methano/butyl acetate {{in order to determine}} their performance in terms of permeance, selectivity and the McCabe-Thiele separation diagram. From the results, it can be observed that most of the membranes are butyl acetate selective, with selectivities up to 307 and permeances of butyl acetate up to about 80, 000 GPU. In general, an increase in temperature decreases the permeance of butyl acetate through the <b>PolyAn</b> membranes and it has a dramatic effect on the Pervap 1201 membrane since the selectivity to butyl acetate decays from 300 at 30 °C to around 0. 2 at 50 °C. The Pervap 2255 - 50 membrane presents an increase of selectivity as the temperature increases. On this basis the potential of developing a pervaporation membrane reactor for production of butyl acetate by transesterification is assessed...|$|E

These materials let the specialists widen the application of full and partial dentures even in difficult clinical cases. Objective: A survey regarding the awareness of the properties, the drawbacks and the indications of the thermoplastic materials for dental purposes in Bulgaria. Material and method: Inquiry ranged from April 2016 until October 2016. The participants were 289 dentist and dental technicians in Bulgaria.

Results: Most of the participants work in a private practice, and half of them are familiar with the TMs in general. Conclusion: This study shows that 52 % of the participants are aware of have some information about TM, 82 % of them know the polyamides, 25 % the thermoplastic acrylic resins, 15 % polyoxymethylene, 4 % polyolefin and only 1, 5 % <b>Polyan.</b> 42 % use these materials in their practice and are familiar with the technological and working protocol and only 36 % report that they are aware of their properties, disadvantages and indications...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates pervaporation, a {{membrane}} separation {{process for the}} removal of sulfur-containing components from jet fuel. To this end, one type of commercial membrane from <b>PolyAn</b> GmbH was applied. The influence of the crucial reaction parameters of the pervaporation process, such as feed temperature, permeate pressure, and permeate temperature, on the characteristic pervaporation measures such as permeate flux and enrichment factor was tested experimentally. Fuels with different sulfur mass fractions were applied and the long-term stability of the membranes used was studied. Different spectroscopic methods were applied to investigate correlations between membrane performance and material properties of the membrane. It was found that an increased feed temperature had a positive effect on the permeate flux while it had a negative effect on the enrichment factor. At 100 degrees C, the permeate flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 1. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at a feed temperature of 80 degrees C. At a feed temperature of 80 degrees C, the enrichment factor was 0. 47, while it amounted to 0. 64 at a feed temperature of 100 degrees C. In the case of the permeate pressure, the trends were also antagonistic. Low permeate pressure enhanced the permeate flux but deteriorated the enrichment factor. At a value of 20 mbar, the permeate flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 0. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at 100 mbar. The enrichment factor was 0. 64 at 20 mbar and decreased to 0. 35 at 100 mbar. Different permeate temperatures and sulfur mass proportions had only a minor effect on the permeate flux and the enrichment factor. Experiments on the long-term stability of the membranes used showed that fortunately the pervaporation process could be run for more than 500 h using membranes from <b>PolyAn</b> GmbH while still showing a measurable permeate flux and a remarkable reduction of the sulfur mass fraction in the permeate. However, a significant deactivation with time on stream was observed. The permeate flux continuously decreased from 3. 5 kg/(h m(2)) to 0. 5 kg/(h m(2)) after 532 h of time on stream. The enrichment factor increased from 0. 5 to 0. 6. Long-term experiments with pretreated membranes revealed that interaction between the hydrocarbon matrix in kerosene Jet A- 1 and the membrane material itself was not responsible for the observed degradation of performance. Spectroscopic investigations were used to show that the reduction of the permeate flux was probably caused by an irreversible inclusion of polar - mostly aromatic - molecules in the polymeric separation layer of the membrane. The probable influence of unknown additives on the permeate flux could not be proven but should be considered. No degradation of the membrane material itself was found. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{separation}} of binary ethyl acetate-isooctane mixtures by pervaporation and pervaporation-based hybrid methods is studied in this paper. The potential of pervaporation using commercially available membranes (<b>PolyAn</b> GmbH, Germany) was evaluated experimentally {{and the effect}} of the feed concentration and the operating temperature on the separation performance was determined. Only two of the eight tested membranes, i. e. POL_AL_M 2 and POL_OL_M 2 were found preferentially permeable to ethyl acetate and chemically stable up to 25 wt. % of ethyl acetate in isooctane solution, thus restricting the concentration range for which pervaporation can be applied. The POL_OL_M 2 membrane combining a maximum separation factor of 22. 34 with a total permeate flux of 6. 3 kg/m 2 h at 30 °C and a feed concentration of 25 wt. % ethyl acetate, demonstrated a higher pervaporation separation index (PSI) than the POL_AL_M 2 membrane. The obtained retentate was highly concentrated in isooctane (more than 99 wt. %) but the permeate reaches an ethyl acetate concentration lower than 90 wt. %. As maximal isooctane recovery and full ethyl acetate purification could not be achieved by stand-alone pervaporation using the available membranes, pervaporation-based hybrid processes were considered for both solvents. Because of its higher PSI, the POL_OL_M 2 membrane was selected for these hybrid processes, aiming at a higher purity of ethyl acetate enriched permeate and total recovery of both ethyl acetate and isooctane...|$|E
40|$|Pervaporation {{presents}} an efficient alternative to other high energy demanding technologies, such as distillation, in {{the separation of}} challenging mixtures in the chemical industry (e. g., azeotropic mixtures). In this work, the transesterification reaction between butanol and methyl acetate to produce methanol and butyl acetate is considered as case of study of an equilibrium-limited reaction. The objective is to {{emphasize the importance of}} a prior evaluation of the driving force of each compound in order to determine when pervaporation is an appropriate technique to perform the separation of multicomponent mixtures. Three commercial membranes from <b>PolyAn</b> GmbH (Germany) and two membranes from Sulzer Chemtech (Switzerland), selected from a previous study, are used for the separation of equimolar mixtures of methanol-methyl acetate-butanol-butyl acetate, at 30, 40 and 50 °C (± 2 °C). Results show that all the studied membranes present a preference for the permeance of butanol, reaching permeances of butanol until 140, 000 GPU. However, methanol and methyl acetate are the compounds with a higher driving force due to their higher volatility, leading to higher concentration in the permeate and preferential separation instead of butanol. Thus, the study of permeances/permeabilities and selectivities is required but not sufficient to evaluate the real performance of pervaporation. The driving force has to be evaluated, and membranes that enhance the effect of the driving force by permeating the species with the highest driving force should be preferably selected. Then, pervaporation is used under conditions of maximum performance...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogels {{based on}} saponified {{products}} of poly (acrylonitrile, AN) -starch composites were&# 13; prepared, characterized and their water abosrbency properties examined. The term composite refered to&# 13; the resultant products of polymerizatin of AN with starch in presence of {{ceric ammonium nitrate}} (CAN) &# 13; as initiator, that is the composite consists of <b>poly(AN)</b> -starch graft copolymer, homopoly(AN),&# 13; oxidized starch and unreacted starch. Thus AN monomer was polymerized with gelatinized starch using&# 13; the ceric ion method. Gelatinization of starch prior to polymerization was affected by heating certain&# 13; weight of starch in certain volume of distilled water at different temperrature (65, 75 and 85 °C). &# 13; Polymerization was carried out {{under a variety of}} coditions. Saponification of poly (AN) -starch&# 13; composites was performed in sodium hydroxide to yield the hydrogels. The water absorbency&# 13; properties of these hydrogels were found to rely on variables affecting the magnitudes of both&# 13; polymerization and saponification. Among these variables mention was made of the starch/liquor ratio,&# 13; cocentration of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN), monomer/starch molar ratio, duration of grafting and&# 13; gelatinization temperature as well as saponification time. Hydrogels display their maximum water&# 13; absorbency when granular starch was firstly gelatinized at 85 °C for 30 min and secondly subjected to&# 13; polymerization with AN using AN/starch molar ratio of 4. 8 and CAN concentration of 10 mmol/L&# 13; liquor ratio of 12. 5 and thirdly sample of the so obtained poly (AN) -starch composite was saponified in&# 13; sodium hydroxide (0. 7 N) at 95 °C for 180 min. The saponified product was then precipitated in excess&# 13; methanol, dried and finally converted into powder. The product (hydrogel) in the powder form&# 13; exhibited maximum water absorbency of 920 g water per gram hydrogel and 38 mL synthetic urine per&# 13; gram hydrogel. </font...|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} of organic solvents in {{the chemical industry}} is discussed and assessed in this dissertation, with particular attention to solvents involved in equilibrium reactions such as transesterification. An overview of {{the current state of}} the main solvents used in chemical industry was carried out. Forty-five solvents present in the software Ecosolvent v. 1. 0. 1 were evaluated from an environmental point of view considering five different impact indicators. From the results of the impact during the production stage of these solvents, guidelines on the selection of these solvents in terms of technology treatments were developed. Incineration and continuous distillation were considered. The guidelines are shown in several charts. It is shown that for a solvent with low impact during its production, incineration is the best treatment. On the other hand distillation becomes more environmentally friendly when the solvents have a high impact during their production. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of the results does not allow making decisions on the most appropriate technology when the solvent has a medium impact. Pervaporation was investigated as a possible alternative to reduce the environmental impact caused by distillation. For the separation of methanol-methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), two commercial membranes were tested. The Poly AL M 1 membrane was found to have a separation factor of up to 350 and Poly OL M 1 a flux ranging from 2. 26 to 25 kg/m 2 h. These two membranes from <b>PolyAn</b> were investigated in an industrial context. A pervaporation unit was modeled with Aspen Custom Modeler and then imported in Aspen Plus to verify the improvement on the application of this membrane technology. It is clearly shown that the pervaporation unit brings a benefit in terms of energy consumption reducing the energy costs by 9 - 14 % with respect to the conventional process. Furthermore, exergy analysis was also applied to the biodiesel process. The chemical process was first revised because of some inconsistencies found in literature. Then, since in the version 7. 3 of Aspen Plus exergy is not available, a new and very simple method was developed using the calculator block. The exergy concept was compared with energy for the production process of biodiesel. It was found that the reaction section has the largest losses whereas in the energy study separation steps are the most important. During the investigation of exergy, an issue was found to consider in the right manner the mixing term during the implementation in Aspen Plus. For this reason another process, also involving transesterification, was considered and a new method to include more directly the mixing term was developed. The results of the exergy analysis for the butyl acetate production were compared with the calculation of exergy using Aspen Plus 8. 4. It is shown that the current implementation of exergy in the simulator has to be improved for the mixing term but also for the contribution of chemical exergy due to the formation of the components, otherwise the error can be large. In the biodiesel process the introduction and evaluation of a membrane contactor unit was considered to purify biodiesel from the main impurities as methanol and glycerol. A setup was built and several flat sheet commercial membranes were tested to evaluate if membrane extraction can replace an extraction unit that requires a lot of water and its consequent further separation steps. All the membranes used were able to purify biodiesel but it was shown that only the hydrophobic ones can be used in an industrial context because of their high breakthrough pressure. The most suitable membrane, PTFE, was selected and the effects of the concentration of methanol, the flow rate variation and the presence of glycerol were investigated. The overall mass transfer coefficient observed was compared with that calculated using a model present in the literature, and was in the range of 3. 5 - 7 * 10 - 3 (cm/min) for methanol. Life cycle assessment was considered to evaluate a more specific study to treat a waste stream, isopropanol-water. A hybrid system distillation coupled with pervaporation to produce alcohols with high purity was compared with two alternatives to incinerate the mixture in a conventional waste solvent incineration unit or in a cement kiln plant after a pre-concentration step by distillation. The LCA results, performed in SimaPro using the Recipe method, showed that the main impact is related to the solvent production. Thus, solvent recovery is the best option if minimization of the use of resources is paramount. Nevertheless incineration in a cement kiln becomes relevant in terms of human health for the avoided use of fuels. Finally, LCA was compared with exergy analysis for the butyl acetate production via reactive distillation. The results show that the two methodologies are speculative and both are important to be used during the process design.
