50|$|Transactions can {{be grouped}} broadly {{according}} to {{purpose in the}} following accounts;the <b>production</b> <b>account</b> displays the transactions involved in the generation of income by the production of goods and services. For {{each of the four}} sectors (the rest of the world does not have a <b>production</b> <b>account),</b> the balancing item, gross value added, is shown as output less intermediate consumption.Gross value added at basic prices for each sector differs from gross domestic product for the UK total economy. The difference occurs because taxes less subsidies on products are not included in the <b>production</b> <b>account</b> by sector and are instead included within resources for the UK total economy. The sum of gross value added and taxes less subsidies on products for the UK economy is equal to GDP at market prices.The distribution and use of income accounts exist for all the institutional sectors. These accounts describe the distribution and redistribution of income and its use in the form of final consumption. The distribution and use of income are analysed in four stages, each of which is presented as a separate account.|$|E

50|$|Yet at {{the same}} time owners of funds, land or subsoil assets who {{exclusively}} rent out these assets are not considered to be themselves engaged in productive activity at all, and therefore excluded from the <b>production</b> <b>account.</b> The assets loaned, rented or leased are regarded as not being produced in this case, and no capital consumption is considered to be incurred in respect of their use. On the other side, having been included in intermediate consumption, the property incomes payable by enterprises that borrow funds or rent land or subsoil assets do not enter into the calculation of their value added, or operating surpluses, at all.|$|E
50|$|Today, 40% {{of paper}} pulp is created from wood (in most modern mills only 9-16% of pulp {{is made from}} pulp logs; the rest comes from waste wood that was {{traditionally}} burnt). Paper production accounts for about 35% of felled trees, and represents 1.2% of the world's total economic output. Recycling one ton of newsprint saves about 1 ton of wood while recycling 1 ton of printing or copier paper saves slightly more than 2 tons of wood. This is because kraft pulping requires twice as much wood since it removes lignin to produce higher quality fibres than mechanical pulping processes. Relating tons of paper recycled {{to the number of}} trees not cut is meaningless, since tree size varies tremendously and is the major factor in how much paper can be made from how many trees. Trees raised specifically for pulp <b>production</b> <b>account</b> for 16% of world pulp production, old growth forests 9% and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the balance. Most pulp mill operators practice reforestation to ensure a continuing supply of trees. The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certify paper made from trees harvested according to guidelines meant to ensure good forestry practices. It has been estimated that recycling half the world’s paper would avoid the harvesting of 20 million acres (81,000 km²) of forestland.|$|E
5000|$|Tourism {{is another}} area {{which it is}} {{believed}} will soon develop rapidly, and an increased demand for jobs. The European Union Council on Tourism and Trade (EUCTT) has also awarded the nation as being [...] "The Best Tourist Destination for 2012". Local hotels {{have already begun to}} make plans to facilitate an influx of European tourists upon the nation receiving this designation. However, the EUCTT is not affiliated with any part of the European Union's Institutions. Despite concerns over the global economy, international tourism demand continues to show resilience. The number of international tourists worldwide grew by 5% (22 million) between January and June 2012, with Asia and the Pacific (+8%) leading the growth among the regions. Given this growth rate a total of one billion international tourists are expected by the end of 2012. In 2011, the total contribution of World Travel & Tourism to global GDP was USD6,346.1Bn (9.1% of GDP). In 2011, the Caribbean region received 20.9 million tourists, a growth of 4.4% over the same period in 2010. The Caribbean is the most dependent region on tourism with Travel and Tourism contributing 13.9% (USD47.1Bn) to its economic output. Trinidad and Tobago received an estimated 402,058 visitors in 2011, representing 2% of all Caribbean visitor arrivals. Due to the multifaceted nature of tourism, its economic impact is not confined to any single industry. To adequately measure the economic impact of the tourism sector, the United Nations World Travel and Tourism Council (UNWTO) devised the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), an extension of the System of National Accounts (SNA). The TSA is a detailed <b>production</b> <b>account</b> of the tourism sector showing its linkages to major industries, total employment, capital formation and additional macro-economic variables.|$|E

40|$|This report compiles a latest social {{accounting}} matrix (SAM) of Pakistan {{for the year}} 1989 - 90. The SAM framework provides useful information about the structure of Pakistan’s economy. Within this framework, the preferred classifications of various accounts are undertaken according to the policy objectives and later model building. The SAM presents four types of accounts: factor account, institution account, <b>production</b> <b>account,</b> and capital account. Theses accounts are disaggregated {{on the basis of}} requirement and availability of data. The account of factors of production is disaggregated into labour and capital. Institution accounts consist of households, firms, government, and rest of the world. Household account is further disaggregated by four income categories for rural and urban areas. <b>Production</b> <b>account</b> is disaggregated into agriculture, industry, education, health and other sectors. Further disaggregation of <b>production</b> <b>account</b> is also {{made on the basis of}} goods for domestic market and for export market. Finally, it presents consolidated capital account. This study also aims to undertake a multiplier analysis, which provides backward and forward linkages in production, consumption, distribution, and accumulation accounts of the economy. The multipliers for all endogenous accounts imply a high degree of integration of the accounts. For the production sectors, backward linkages are strongest for the education, followed by agriculture, health, other sector and industry. The largest forward linkage multipliers are found for industry, followed by other sectors, agriculture, health and education. Regarding the households income groups, the largest backward linkage is found for the urban poorest and smallest for the rural rich. While, the largest forward linkage is for the rural poorest and smallest for the urban poorest. ...|$|E
