5|$|Enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1910, Middleton {{was first}} {{assigned}} to the 29th Infantry Regiment, where {{he worked as a}} clerk. Here he did not become an infantryman as he had hoped, but he was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service playing football, a sport strongly endorsed by the army. Following two years of enlisted service, Middleton was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was given the opportunity to compete for an officer's commission. Of the 300 individuals who were vying for a commission, 56 were selected, and four of them, including Middleton, would become general officers. As a new second lieutenant, Middleton was {{assigned to the}} 7th Infantry Regiment in Galveston, Texas, which was soon <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service, responding to events created by the Mexican Revolution. Middleton spent seven months doing occupation duty in the Mexican port city of Veracruz, and later was assigned to Douglas, Arizona, where his unit skirmished with some of Pancho Villa's fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses. Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens must also have been <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E
5|$|After having {{declined}} in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation {{in the late}} Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britain; under Pompey, a large fleet {{was raised in the}} Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service from Greek cities.|$|E

5|$|Ark Royal was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service, {{delivering}} {{aircraft to}} Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing {{as much as}} ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, {{against the advice of}} Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E
5|$|Before the Orange Bowl, Cincinnati {{was ranked}} 50th (of 119 Division I FBS teams) in total offense. The team was ranked 24th in passing offense, {{with the five}} quarterbacks <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service during the season {{averaging}} 254.1 passing yards per game. By {{the end of the}} season, Tony Pike emerged as Cincinnati's sole starting quarterback. He finished the regular season having completed 183 of 291 pass attempts for 2,168 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions. He ranked second in the Big East and 29th nationally in passing efficiency with a passer rating of 141.07.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

5|$|By nightfall on 18 August, the North Korean 4th Division {{had been}} annihilated; {{huge numbers of}} deserters had {{weakened}} its numbers during the fight, but by that time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the U.S. forces. Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire. The next day, the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left {{a large number of}} artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Jamestown Exposition in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the Jamestown colony. She later sailed with the Great White Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, Connecticut participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service as a troop transport at the end of World War I to expedite the return of American Expeditionary Forces from France.|$|E
5|$|Debs {{attended}} public school, {{dropping out}} of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years.|$|E

The population in the Bay Area grew faster than even Houston as processing plants and factories were built and expanded. Ellington Air Force Base was built to the southeast of Houston (adjacent to modern Clear Lake City) and became a major air field and flight training center during the wars.|$|E
5|$|Flick {{began his}} career in semi-professional {{baseball}} and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, {{the manager of the}} Phillies, who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder. Flick was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick jumped to the Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed by a stomach ailment.|$|E
5|$|In September 1955, {{the sole}} {{remaining}} Pulqui II prototype was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> {{action in the}} Revolución Libertadora, a coup d'état led by General Eduardo Lonardi against Perón. The exact details of its participation are unknown, but when rebel forces commanded by Lonardi captured Córdoba as their first conquest, together with the Meteor F 4s fighter-bombers stationed at the Córdoba Escuela De Aviación - SACE (Military Aviation School), the IAe 33 was enlisted in the struggle.

40|$|Profile of a Merger: In 2009, {{the dean}} of {{libraries}} {{and the director of}} the university press at Utah State University proposed a departmental merger to their central administration. They argued that through restructuring reporting lines so that the press became a department of the library at least three important benefits could be achieved. First, the central administration was at the time hoping to cut costs by consolidating operations in various parts of the university; merging the staff reporting lines of the university <b>press</b> <b>into</b> the library offered an opportunity for consolidation. Secondly, integrating the <b>press</b> <b>into</b> the library promised it some relief from the structural vulnerability it had suffered historically as a department among “other instructional activities” reporting directly to the provost. And for the university library, to move the <b>press</b> <b>into</b> a structural collaboration would bring an established publisher of e-books into the library, representing a steady source of book-length content for the digital institutional repository that the library was consciously building. In short order, and spurred by the impacts of the Great Recession on higher education, the merger was approved...|$|R

5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service, though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Suevic was {{launched}} on 8 December 1900, and set sail on her maiden voyage to Sydney on 23 March 1901. Shortly thereafter, Suevic and her four sisters were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service carrying troops {{to fight in}} the Boer War in South Africa. In August 1901 she made her one and only voyage from Liverpool to New York City. Once the Boer War was over, White Star was finally able to institute regular monthly service to Australia using the Jubilee-class ships.|$|E
5|$|The Polikarpov I-5 was a single-seat biplane {{which became}} the primary Soviet fighter between its {{introduction}} in 1931 through 1936, after which it became the standard advanced trainer. Following Operation Barbarossa, which destroyed much of the Soviet Air Forces (VVS), surviving I-5s were equipped with four machine guns and bomb racks and <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> service as light ground-attack aircraft and night bombers in 1941. They were retired in early 1942 as Soviet aircraft production began to recover and modern ground-attack aircraft like the Ilyushin Il-2 became available.
