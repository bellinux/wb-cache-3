40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{potential}} distortive impacts of state aids and of incumbent firms' market behaviours and business strategies on competitive outcome. The problems emerged {{within the framework}} of the third <b>postal</b> <b>directive,</b> the unresolved questions of regulation and the contradictions between postal and other regulations are analyzed in the first part. The second part describes the most typical anti-competitive practices. The third and fourth part discusses the effects of state aids and mergers in the postal sector, finally the Hungarian competition issues are examined...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the basic approaches {{to calculate the}} cost of the USO and compares them with the requirements of the 3 rd <b>postal</b> <b>directive.</b> We conclude that the profitability cost approach will lead to consistent estimations if it is applied in a global way. We illustrate our findings with an econometric estimation of the net costs of Swiss Post’s obligation to provide a nationwide post office network for postal and financial services. We finally illustrate that the financing mechanism in place must be considered as well as there are important drawbacks on the cost of the USO.

40|$|The new European <b>Postal</b> <b>Directive</b> of 2008 {{provides}} the postal market with new opportunities as {{it allows for}} the gradual development of competition of services of general interests in Europe. However, the directive leaves room for uncertainties and the full opening of the postal market is hampered {{by a number of}} existing and emerging barriers. Thus the European Commission is handling complaints about state aid which is granted to national postal services in order to facilitate their role as service of national interest. Much harder to challenge are a number of "de facto barriers" which fall outside competition law. Currently, the infringement procedure is the aggressive weapon against Member States contravening the Treaty. However, this procedure does not offer an overall solution to remove all trade barriers especially the "de facto barriers". In contrast, the Open Method of Co-ordination could be used to set policy and norms for the postal market. These could serve as best practices to manage the postal market by objectives rather than through enforceable laws...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} EU <b>Postal</b> <b>Directives</b> (97 / 67 /EZ and 2002 / 39 /EZ) in a {{consolidated}} {{text and the}} respective parts of the Croatian legislative frame {{with the aim of}} harmonising the national postal system with EU. Both regulatory frames are presented, as well as objectives and scopes, types of postal services (particularly the universal ones), reserved area, necessary conditions governing the provision of services, tariff principles, insurance of market competition through transparency of financing and separation of the accounting system, desired quality of universal services, harmonisation of technical standards and obligations of national regulatory authorities. By presenting individual chapters of the Post Directives, some specific solutions of the Croatian regulatory framework have been indicated and uncertainties which result from the comparison analysis of the European <b>Postal</b> <b>Directives</b> and the Croatian legislation as well as the influence of these documents on the postal traffic technology.

5000|$|Universal {{service was}} widely adopted in {{legislation}} in Europe {{beginning in the}} 1980s and 1990s. For instance, under the EU <b>Postal</b> Services <b>Directive</b> (97/67/EC), the Electricity Market Directive (2003/54/EC) and the Telecommunications Directive (2002/22/EC). The language of [...] "universal service" [...] has also been used in proposals by the US Democratic Party for the reform of health care.|$|R
40|$|The {{financing}} of universal service {{provision in the}} postal sector has traditionally relied on granting the universal service provider a reserved area. Together with growing electronic substitution, current liberalization policies promoting competitive entry may put the traditional universal service at risk. Hence, there is an increased interest in knowing the cost of universal service provision. The third EC <b>postal</b> <b>directive</b> proposes a calculation approach to separately determine the net cost of a universal service obligation and to compensate the universal service provider (USP). This paper discusses the interaction between universal service costing and financing and shows that the EC approach may result in distorted results. It also quantifies the effects based on a model calibration with Swiss data. The results show that separate costing and financing leads to a considerable under-compensation of the USP {{if there is a}} compensation fund to which every operator contributes. The USP is over-compensated if it is exempt from contributing to the fund (pay or play mechanism). The problem of under- or overcompensation can be resolved by an integrated computation of the net cost that includes the competitive effects of the financing mechanism. Such an integrated approach results in a fair compensation of the USP. Regulation, Post, Universal service obligation, Financing...|$|E
40|$|Why is {{liberalisation}} reform {{introduced in}} some areas but not in others? In an introduction and four independent yet interconnected articles, this doctoral thesis aims at making a contribution to answering the above mentioned question. Through detailed case studies and process-tracing, the thesis outlines four key contributions: it uses institutional perspectives to understand why a common policy becomes different in character across sectors; it identifies conditions under which liberalisation reform occurs at both the EU and local level; it contributes to clarifying the scope regarding the assumption that a constitutional bias towards negative integration explains the introduction of liberalisation policy in the EU; finally, it adds insight as to how trade unions, which are {{generally considered to be}} weak in EU liberalisation politics, may be influential at the EU level. There is more focus on sectors rather than the state, thus allowing for focus on policy level variables and not for example on the institutional features of different national political systems. The public service sector has been selected for analysis since differentiated integration remains under-researched in this area. A focus on infrastructures ensures that the selected cases - the <b>Postal</b> <b>Directive,</b> the Public Transport Regulation and the Port Directive - share certain similarities. As several public services are sub-national responsibilities, this thesis also contributes to understanding the appeal of competitive tendering at the local level. The thesis consists of four chapters (i. e. independent articles) and an introduction that shows how these articles form an integrated set of output. The four independent articles are: (1) An in-depth analysis of the <b>Postal</b> <b>Directive</b> that fully opened the postal services to competition. This chapter complements theories of institutional change by adding insight as to how layering brings about policy change of liberalisation in the EU. (2) A case-study of the failed Port Directive. This chapter contributes to the literature of European integration by outlining the forces that create barriers for further integration and tests the widely held assumption that trade unions have limited impact on the EU level decision-making process. (3) A comparative analysis of the two above mentioned cases (from points one and two), alongside a third case, the Public Transport Regulation. This chapter questions the scope of the widely cited assumption that a bias in the treaties explains the introduction of negative integration in the EU and asks what the limits of EU liberalisation are. (4) A case study of the organisation of public transport in the Norwegian County of Sør-Trøndelag. This chapter contributes to our understanding of why liberalisation occurs at sub-national level, even when policies endorsed at higher levels remain flexible (i. e. EU policies and the transposition of such legislation at the national level) ...|$|E

40|$|The European <b>postal</b> <b>directives</b> and Serbian {{legislation}} as well {{define the}} quality standards for universal service obligations at the aggregate level, i. e. for all postal items transferred by the postal operator. This paper proposes {{a new concept}} where the transit time {{is defined by the}} customer and specified for each shipment. The paper considers three different models of this new concept. However, the one where a customer could choose between two alternatives: D+ 1 and D+ 3 transfer, is analysed in details. By using the attitudes of examined customers, forecasting methods and analysis of revenues from the past, it is assessed at what price the new postal service should be offered to achieve the highest revenue. The proposed methodology was tested and verified {{in the case of the}} Post of Serbia. The results indicate that the best would be to offer the service D+ 1 at the 40 % increased price compared to the existing prices. </p...|$|R
5000|$|This meant {{a core of}} {{economic}} sectors in postal services could be reserved for financing the state industry. This {{was followed by the}} <b>Postal</b> Services <b>Directive</b> 97/67/EC, which required Member States to [...] "ensure that users enjoy the right to a universal service involving the permanent provision of a postal service... at all points in their territory." [...] This means once a working day deliveries and pick-ups, and that services that could be reserved for state monopolies include [...] "clearance, sorting, transport and delivery of items of domestic correspondence and incoming cross-border correspondence". For countries that had not liberalised postal services in any measure, the directive contained provisions to gradually open up to competition. It was intended {{to strike a balance between}} competition and continued quality service. In the Deutsche Post decision the Commission took strong enforcement action. Deutsche Post was accused of predatory pricing in the business parcel delivery sector (i.e. not one of the services [...] "reserved" [...] under the directive) by the private firm UPS. The Commission ordered the structural separation of the normal postal services from business deliveries by Deutsche Post.|$|R
40|$|The Information Revolution is placing severe strains on the {{traditional}} national post office. As the pace of commerce has quickened, private express services have arisen to provide more rapid and reliable delivery services than available from the post office. Telecommunications coupled with improved printing technologies allow large mailers to bypass the first stages of postal distribution. Email has become an increasingly viable substitute {{for all types of}} letters and invoices. Corporate websites routinely handle transactions that once required several postal exchanges. In the postal world, however, change is welcomed by few. The postal monopoly and government status have substantially insulated the post office from the larger world of commerce. Isolation has impeded the incremental changes that allow orderly transformation in most industries. Politically important groups oppose radical change. Armies of postal managers and employees fear (probably correctly) that postal modernization will mean fewer jobs and lower wages for them (although not necessarily for the sector as a whole). Citizens in rural districts believe (probably incorrectly) that adapting the post office to changing times will lead to relatively higher prices or poorer service in the countryside. Nonetheless, in the last decade a cautious European Union has pressed a reluctant postal sector to introduce significant reform. The <b>Postal</b> <b>Directive</b> of 1997, adopted after 10 years of study and debate, placed a ceiling on the scope of postal monopolies and required tighter and more objective regulation of "universal service providers", i. e., national post offices. In 2002, the maximum scope of services that could be reserved for the national post office was lowered again, and regulatory requirements were strengthened in 228 COMMUNICATIONS & STRATEGIES no. 56 small but significant respects.
