500|$|The gaps, {{the longest}} of which {{measures}} about [...] long, {{appear to have}} followed {{the line of the}} hull plates. This suggests that the iron rivets along the plate seams snapped off or <b>popped</b> <b>open</b> to create narrow gaps through which water flooded. An engineer from Titanics builders, Harland and Wolff, suggested this scenario at the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry following the disaster but his view was discounted. Titanics discoverer Robert Ballard has commented that the assumption that the ship had suffered a major breach was [...] "a by-product of the mystique of the Titanic. No one could believe that the great ship was sunk by a little sliver." [...] Faults in the ship's hull may have been a contributing factor. Recovered pieces of Titanics hull plates appear to have shattered on impact with the iceberg, without bending.|$|E

I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow <b>popped</b> <b>open.</b> I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet."

60|$|As the practitioner's foot struck {{even with}} {{the corner of a}} tall brick {{residence}} of more pretension than its fellows the front door <b>popped</b> <b>open,</b> and a bawling negress clattered down the steps to the pavement. Some medley of words came from her mouth, addressed, like as not, to herself--the recourse of her race when alone and beset by evil. She looked to be one of that old vassal class of the South--voluble, familiar, loyal, irrepressible; her person pictured it--fat, neat, aproned, kerchiefed.|$|E
60|$|All {{the summer}} long the little brown {{packages}} grew and grew until {{they looked like}} little nuts.

You never saw such a popping and a snapping and a jumping! Pop! pop! snap! snap! hippetty hop! they went, faster than the corn pops in the corn popper. Reddy Fox, who always is suspicious, thought some one was shooting at him. Down on the ground fell the little brown shining seeds and tucked themselves into the warm earth under the warm leaves, there to stay all winter long.|$|E
