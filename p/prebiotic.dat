5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles {{to life on}} Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the <b>prebiotic</b> conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding {{the early history of}} the terrestrial biosphere.

5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a <b>prebiotic.</b> The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E

25|$|The lipid world theory postulates {{that the}} first {{self-replicating}} object was lipid-like. It is known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation—the same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other amphiphilic long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves {{the same size and}} composition of lipids in the two progenies. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially <b>prebiotic</b> amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles.

Lactose-derived <b>prebiotics</b> have several functional and nutritional values. The biochemical activities of lactose-based <b>prebiotics</b> are expressed {{in the presence of}} probiotics (lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, Bacillus spp.). Galacto-oligosaccharide and lactosucrose reduce the risk of bowel disorder (diarrhea), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease), and colon cancer. Galacto-oligosaccharide helps colonic absorption of minerals (iron, magnesium and calcium) and prevents osteoporosis. Lactulose, galacto-oligosaccharide, and lactitol promote laxative activity. Furthermore, lactulose may decrease the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. <b>Prebiotics</b> have low calorific value and glycemic index. Galacto-oligosaccharide and tagatose reduce the risks of hyperglycemia (Type 2 diabetes) and low density lipid (lipoprotein) accumulation in blood stream. Moreover, <b>prebiotics</b> improve immunomodulation, which reduces the risk of respiratory infection and allergies.

40|$|In our study, we dwelled upon {{combinations}} of lactobacilli/prebiotics, considering four different strains {{belonging to the}} Lactobacillus rhamnosus species, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and different <b>prebiotics</b> often found in commercial synbiotic products, such as inulin, lactulose and polyols mannitol and sorbitol. In {{the first step of}} the research, the survival, the growth kinetic parameters and the protein expression of Lb. rhamnosus strains cultivated in presence of the different <b>prebiotics</b> as a unique carbon source were evaluated. In the second step, the influence of pre-cultivation in medium added of metabolizable <b>prebiotics</b> on the strains survival to simulated gastrointestinal (GI) transit, assayed without <b>prebiotics</b> addition, was estimated. Our results showed that the presence in the medium of certain low fermented <b>prebiotics,</b> specific for each strain, represents a stress factor that significantly affects the growth of Lb. rhamnosus strains, inducing the up-regulation of several proteins. In detail, all added <b>prebiotics</b> used as unique carbon source caused a growth retard compared with glucose, as testified by increased values of the lag phase and decreased values of the μmax. Mannitol evidenced intermediate μmax values between those registered with glucose and those detected with the other assayed <b>prebiotics.</b> Moreover, the cultivation with <b>prebiotics</b> induced the over expression of 7 protein bands. Interestingly, we found a correlation between the up-regulation of two specific stress proteins, called P 4 (ATP-binding subunit Clpx) and P 7 (GrpE), and the death kinetic parameters (resistance and cells viability) registered during the simulated GI transit of strains pre-cultivated with specific, low fermented <b>prebiotics.</b> Specifically, the highest resistance and gastric-vitality scores were highlighted for the strain AT 195 when pre-cultivated in presence of sorbitol. Conversely, the lowest values were found in the case of DSM 20021 pre-cultivated with mannitol. Among the up-regulated stress proteins, P 7 resulted involved in the response to the starvation. Finally, it is possible to conclude that the pre-cultivation with certain <b>prebiotics</b> as a unique carbon source represents a strain-specific, sub-lethal stress able to enhance the resistance of Lb. rhamnosus strains and consequently their viability under simulated GI transit...|$|R

When molecular oxygen is used for the metabolism of the products of glycolysis the process is usually referred to as aerobic, whereas if no oxygen is used the process is said to be anaerobic. Thus, glycolysis occurs, with variations, in nearly all organisms, both aerobic and anaerobic. The wide occurrence of glycolysis indicates that {{it is one of the}} most ancient metabolic pathways. Indeed, the reactions that constitute glycolysis and its parallel pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, occur metal-catalyzed under the oxygen-free conditions of the Archean oceans, also in the absence of enzymes.

40|$|Abstract Background Synbiotics, probiotics or <b>prebiotics</b> {{are being}} added to infant formula to promote growth and {{development}} in infants. Previous reviews (2007 to 2011) on term infants given probiotics or <b>prebiotics</b> focused on prevention of allergic disease and food hypersensitivity. This review focused on growth and clinical outcomes in term infants fed only infant formula containing synbiotics, probiotics or <b>prebiotics.</b> Methods Cochrane methodology was followed using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared term infant formula containing probiotics, <b>prebiotics</b> or synbiotics to conventional infant formula with / without placebo among healthy full term infants. The mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were reported for continuous outcomes, risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95 % CI for dichotomous outcomes. Where appropriate, meta-analysis was performed; heterogeneity was explored using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. If studies were too diverse a narrative synthesis was provided. Results Three synbiotic studies (N = 475), 10 probiotics studies (N = 933) and 12 <b>prebiotics</b> studies (N = 1563) were included. Synbiotics failed to significantly increase growth in boys and girls. Use of synbiotics increased stool frequency, had no impact on stool consistency, colic, spitting up / regurgitation, crying, restlessness or vomiting. Probiotics in formula also failed to have any significant effect on growth, stool frequency or consistency. Probiotics did not lower the incidence of diarrhoea, colic, spitting up / regurgitation, crying, restlessness or vomiting. <b>Prebiotics</b> in formula did increase weight gain but had no impact on length or head circumference gain. <b>Prebiotics</b> increased stool frequency but had no impact on stool consistency, the incidence of colic, spitting up / regurgitation, crying, restlessness or vomiting. There was no impact of <b>prebiotics</b> on the volume of formula tolerated, infections and gastrointestinal microflora. The quality of evidence was compromised by imprecision, inconsistency of results, use of different study preparations and publication bias.
