5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|Lyons took on {{a number}} of causes in the 1910s and 1920s. He worked with Bishop David Greer and Rabbi Stephen Wise to expose {{conditions}} in New York's tenements, dissociated himself from Tammany Hall candidates, tried to secure a re-trial for Leo Frank, and opposed some of the views of Samuel Gompers. In 1912, Lyons was {{a founding member of the}} Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis from the Eastern United States that was created despite opposition from the Central Conference of Reform Rabbis. In 1919 he withdrew from the Brooklyn Victory Celebration Committee (celebrating the Allied victory in World War I) and asked that his contributed funds be donated instead to the Red Cross; many committee members eventually resigned in protest over the overt <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event, and its control by William Randolph Hearst.|$|E
25|$|<b>Politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German academia {{under the}} National Socialist regime had driven many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians out of Germany {{as early as}} 1933.

25|$|None {{of these}} measures, however, {{were able to}} make the Commission as {{effective}} as desired, mainly {{because of the presence of}} human rights violators and the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.

25|$|<b>Politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{academic}} community, {{combined with}} the impact of the Deutsche Physik movement and other policies, such as drafting physicists to fight in the war (e.g., Paul O.

At the close of the war, physicists born between 1915 and 1925 were almost nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{education}} system essentially replaced academic tradition and excellence with ideological adherence and trappings, such as membership in National Socialist organizations, {{such as the}} Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party), the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League), and the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League). The politicization can be illustrated with the conflict which evolved when a replacement for Arnold Sommerfeld was sought in view of his emeritus status. The conflict involved one of the prominent Uranverein participants, Werner Heisenberg.|$|E

25|$|Casualty {{rates were}} the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, {{by the end of}} 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained {{recruits}} had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops in 1917.|$|E

Nevertheless, by early 2002, Venezuela was [...] "embroiled... in a severe political crisis" [...] as Chávez sought to bring more of the country's vast oil wealth under state control. Although the state-owned radio and television stations remained staunch advocates of Chávez's stated policies—to redistribute the nation's wealth to the poorest—the private media was more hostile. The crisis reached a head when Chávez attempted to remove the management of the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), provoking a showdown. [...] "Oil managers, business leaders, and large segments of organized labor" [...] called a general strike.

In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> understanding religious teachings, believers interpret them correctly through exploring the substantial meaning, particularly in understanding religious doctrines regarding to <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> justice, human rights, democratization, and so forth. Furthermore, religion is understood as the truth {{rather than as an}} identity and a symbolic form. This is because understanding religion as an identity tends to create conflicts.

500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics {{has three}} key aims, and, correspondingly, its {{chapters}} are split into three sections. These aims are {{the analysis of}} three key [...] "innovations" [...] that the editors identify in the book's introduction. The first {{of these is the}} move, in animal ethics, from thinking about personal change to thinking about the implementation of rules or norms of conduct at the societal level. The second of these is a possible rapprochement between animal ethics and ecologism (environmental ethics and green political theory). The third is the increased presence of animal protection laws for the benefit of nonhuman animals themselves. Aside from the introduction, the book features ten single-authored chapters, with three in Part I: The <b>Politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Animal Advocacy Discourse, three in Part II: The Rapprochement between Animal Ethics and Ecologism, and four in Part III: The Introduction of Laws and Institutions for the Benefit of Animals.|$|E
500|$|After {{a week of}} {{denunciation}} in China's English-language media, {{with most}} journals silent about the award except for perfunctory quotes from the foreign ministry, the country's Chinese-language media launched a concerted assault on Liu and the award, accompanied by renewed attacks in the English-language media. Xinhua argued on 17 October that the Communist Party had made [...] "unremitting efforts to promote and safeguard human rights", and questioned how Liu's actions had contributed to human rights progress for the Chinese people. The agency cited a journal from Saudi Arabia, and one from Russia, that had denounced the award; it quoted the Pakistani Foreign Office as saying, [...] "the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nobel Peace Prize {{for the purposes of}} interference in the domestic affairs of states is not only contrary to the recognized principles of inter-State conduct, but also a negation of the underlying spirit conceived by the founder of the Prize." [...] In what was described by Chinese media–watchers as a surprise because of its historical professionalism, China Youth Daily published an article containing Beijing students' expressions of anger and disbelief over the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu. The journal employed the traditional hard-liner phrase [...] "people with ulterior motives" [...] (别有用心的人)—directed to at least one student. It further denounced the [...] "farcical" [...] Nobel decision to use the award as [...] "a tool... in their relentless effort to undermine China and frustrate its development".|$|E

40|$|Many {{commentators}} today lament <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> bioethics, {{but some}} suggest distinguishing among different kinds <b>of</b> <b>politicization.</b> This essay pursues that idea {{with reference to}} three traditions of political thought: liberalism, communitarianism, and republicanism.

The liberal emphasis on <b>the</b> irreducible plurality <b>of</b> values and interests in modern societies, and the communitarian concern with <b>the</b> social dimensions <b>of</b> biotechnology, offer important insights for bioethics councils.

30|$|What {{do these}} {{findings}} teach us? Starting with research on <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> social identification: Turkish and Islamic identifications relate to local voting likelihood among <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> Turkish immigrants in Western Europe. In researching <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> social identification, <b>the</b> interplay between social identification, <b>the</b> perceptions <b>of</b> group discrimination, personal discrimination {{and the policy}} context {{should be taken into}} account, since they can have interactive effects on political participation. This study also shows that Turkish and Islamic identifications can relate differently to local voting, depending on the circumstances (e.g. perceived personal discrimination). This underlines <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> not collapsing origin country and religious categories, as is becoming increasing usual when it comes to immigrants and their descendants from predominantly Muslim countries. Not only are these groups religiously diverse (see e.g. Brouard & Tiberj, 2005 for a French example) but the commitment to these identities can also relate differently to political behavior (see also Kranendonk et al., 2018).|$|R

40|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{migration}} policy in Europe is <b>the</b> increased use <b>of</b> ICTs for border control purposes. A growing academic literature explains <b>the</b> digitisation <b>of</b> border controls as {{an instance of}} post- 9 / 11 securitization of migration policy.

Although security imperatives {{play a role in}} accelerating digitisation, a securitization framing obscures continuities with pre- 9 / 11 practices and underplays other policy drivers. Pre-emptive mobility governance is best characterised as a digital-era version of ‘remote control’, and is shaped by other organizational and political rationales: first, instrumental beliefs about <b>the</b> efficiency gains <b>of</b> border technologies; second, their symbolic role in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> immigration. <b>The</b> paper then considers how ICTs are reshaping <b>the</b> tools <b>of</b> mobility governance, enabling three distinct modes of pre-emptive detection and effect: black, grey and green-listing...|$|R
40|$|Policy {{relevant}} {{scientific information}} is increasingly sought after {{in the climate}} regime. Yet little analysis has been done exploring what this phrase means.
