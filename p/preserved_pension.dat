The dramatic decline in the stock market has diminished pension savings and reportedly led to low levels in older Americans' {{confidence in their ability to}} retire. Even before the current economic recession, research indicated that pension benefits are likely to be inadequate for many Americans. This report addresses the following questions: (1) What are key risks faced by U. S. workers in accumulating and <b>preserving</b> <b>pension</b> benefits? (2) What approaches are used in other countries that could address these risks and what trade-offs do they present? (3) What approaches do key proposals for alternative plan designs in the U.

To complete this work, we reviewed research on defined benefit and defined contribution plans, and interviewed pension consulting firms, industry experts, academics, and other relevant organizations in the U. S. and abroad. In addition, we used a microsimulation model to assess the impact of certain strategies to increase pension coverage on accumulated benefits.

It is usually assumed that their relative weight creates a seniority bias that compels union leaders to <b>preserve</b> the <b>pension</b> system status quo. More important, however, is how they are represented within unions. Labor leaders are more likely to support pension reforms that impose significant costs on current workers when internal union institutions allow pensioners to influence unions social policy positions and centralize authority in peak-level bodies.

Moreover, the ranking of adjustments in the labor supply is <b>preserved</b> across the <b>pension</b> systems for the respective subcohorts. The increases are similar across the pension systems, although DC provides stronger incentives for work. The higher the preference for leisure and impatience, the larger the scope of labor supply adjustment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} pension reforms under population ageing. The {{concepts of}} “implicit pension debt”, “implicit tax ” and “internal {{rate of return}} ” are first intro-duced {{with the help of}} a three-period model. Using stylised facts, ageing is traced to low fertility and increasing longevity. Formulating a benchmark for intergenerational fairness leads to a framework for designing pension reforms such that leaving an unfair burden to future generations is avoided. Secondly, a yearly simulation model is used to arrive at the following main results for reform blueprints: (1) In a Defined Benefit (DB) system, partial pre-funding is needed to achieve inter-generational fairness unless benefits are sufficiently reduced; partial privatisa-tion is an option for the management of the accumulating funds. (2) Transition from a DB to a Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) system is an-other reform option; it reduces the replacement rates to levels which match pre-scribed contribution rates; an NDC public pillar can be accompanied by a sec-ond pillar, managed by the private sector. (3) An effective increase in the retirement age is necessary to moderate the increase in pension expenditure and to <b>preserve</b> adequate <b>pension</b> levels. (4) Pension reforms have important effects on public finance target setting. (JEL H 1...|$|R
40|$|All pension {{systems have}} been {{affected}} by the financial and economic crisis, although in different ways. This paper analyses the effects of the crisis on pension systems and the resulting responses and changes, and offers a theoretical interpretation of these responses. This interpretation focuses on the relationships between pension systems and broader socioeconomic institutional configurations, and between pension systems and other core, formative economic institutions, in order to explain the effects of the crisis, the nature of the reforms adopted by governments and the future outlook for pension systems. From this perspective, a comparative analysis of two pension systems with different approaches, the French system that relies heavily on social insurance and the primarily market-based British system, appears relevant in the interest of assessing how similar pressures and disruptions can produce different impacts and responses. The analysis shows that these pension systems' responses to the crisis have preserved the main institutional features of each configuration, and even reinforce some of them. Nevertheless, it appears that both systems are converging toward an institutionalization of a twofold social welfare system. The French system attempts to <b>preserve</b> the <b>pension</b> rights of core-workers on a mandatory social insurance basis, while non-standard workers benefit from tax-funded social solidarity measures. In the British system, the State intervenes to both extend secure pension fund enrolment to low income groups and to reinforce safety nets for lower income retirees. Finally, the recent changes have not called into question the fundamental logic of either pension system, although concerns are on the rise in respect of their future adequacy and sustainabilit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Occupational Pension Scheme Survey (OPSS) provides a detailed view {{of the nature of}} occupational pension provision in the UK by organisations. Until 2000, the surveys were conducted every four to five years. Following a review in 2003, the surveys have been annual since 2004. Taken together, the surveys allow the changes in the nature of occupational pension provision to be studied across the UK as a whole. The OPSS has been run by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) since 2006. The survey was previously carried out by the Government Actuary's Department between 1953 and 2005. Transfer of responsibility to the ONS enabled the data to be collected under the Statistics of Trade Act 1947, making the survey mandatory and hence helping to boost response rates. The UK Data Archive only holds the results from the surveys carried out by the ONS, i. e. from 2006 onwards. The OPSS is restricted to occupational pension schemes registered in the UK, set up under trust law by one or more employers for the benefit of their employees. It does not cover individual or group personal pension schemes or stakeholder pension schemes. It covers both public and private sector occupational pension schemes, and does not cover state pension provision. All public sector schemes in the survey are 'defined benefit' schemes, where benefits are related to the members' earnings or salary. Private sector schemes include 'defined benefit' schemes as well as 'defined contribution' schemes, where benefits are based on the accumulation of contributions paid. The samples for the annual surveys are selected at random from the Pensions Scheme Registry, which is a register of all occupational and personal pension schemes in the UK with two or more members, and maintained by the Pensions Regulator. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. You may consider applying for other business data to assist your research. The sixth edition (March 2015) includes a revised data file for 2012 and a provisional data file for 2013. For the seventh edition (April 2016), the 2014 data file has been added to the study. Main Topics : Separate questionnaires are sent out, depending on the type, size and status of the occupational pension scheme, as follows: defined benefit schemes defined contribution schemes public sector defined benefit schemes very small schemes (those with fewer than 12 members) regardless of whether they are defined benefit or defined contribution schemes schemes which were winding up, regardless of size or whether they were defined benefit or defined contribution schemes Schemes having multiple sections (i. e. the basis on which benefits are given differs between members of the scheme) are given one questionnaire for each section having over 100 members. Questionnaires for public sector schemes, very small schemes and winding up schemes are shortened and/or modified versions of the questionnaire. Topics covered by the questionnaires include: membership contributions benefits, including: benefits at normal pension age benefits other than at retirement on age grounds (ill-health, death, etc) benefits on death after retirement <b>pension</b> increases <b>preserved</b> <b>pensions</b> transfer payments pension sharing on divorce changes to scheme other pension provision by principal employer business sector of principal employer </ul...|$|R
40|$|The legal {{competency}} or {{capability to}} exercise rights is level of judgment and decision-making ability needed to manage one 2 ̆ 7 s own affairs and to sign official documents. With some exceptions, the person entitles this right in age of majority. It is acquired without legal procedures, however the annulment of legal capacity requires a juristic process. This resolution {{may not be}} final and could be revoked thorough the procedure of reverting legal capacity – fully or partially. Given {{the increasing number of}} persons with dementia, they are often subjects of legal expertise concerning their legal capacity. On the other part, emphasis on the civil rights of mentally ill also demands their maximal protection. Therefore such distinctive issue is approached with particular attention. The approach in determination of legal competency is more focused on gradation of it 2 ̆ 7 s particular aspects instead of existing dual concept: legally capable – legally incapable. The main assumption represents how person with dementia is legally capable and should enjoy all the rights, privileges and obligations as other citizens do. The aspects of legal competency for which person with dementia is going to be deprived, due to protection of one 2 ̆ 7 s rights and interests, are determined in legal procedure and then passed over to the guardian decided by court. Partial annulment of legal competency is measure applied when there is even one existing aspect of <b>preserved</b> legal capability (<b>pension</b> disposition, salary or pension disposition, ability of concluding contract, making testament, concluding marriage, divorce, choosing whereabouts, independent living, right to vote, right to decide course of treatment ect.). This measure is most often in favour of the patient and rarely for protection of other persons and their interests. Physicians are expected to precisely describe early dementia symptoms which may influence assessment of specific aspects involved in legal capacity (memory loss, impaired task execution, language difficulties, loosing perception of time and space, changes in mood and behaviour, personality alterations, loss of interests and initiative). Towards more accurate determination of legal competency the psychometric tests are being used. The appliance of these tests must be guided with basic question during evaluation: „For what is or is not he/she capable?« In prediction of possible dementia development, the modern diagnostic procedures are used as help for potentially demented individuals in order to plan own affairs and by oneself determine future guardian. This ensures the maximal respect and protection of rights among persons with dementia in order to independently manage life one step ahead of progressive illness. Finally, it is to be distinguished medical concept of legal capacity which is universal and judicial concept which is restricted by rules of national legal system differing from country to country...|$|R
