40|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{distinguishing}} between task-based <b>testing</b> and <b>performance</b> <b>testing.</b> It then provides a short historical {{overview of the}} development of performance assessment. Next, a preliminary overview of the <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> literature sketches out some of the general trends in that literature including the fact that that it already contains many (a) overviews and discussions of language <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> (b) many papers and books providing guidelines for developing and doing <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> and (c) numerous articles on the place of <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> in language curriculum. The paper then restricts itself to looking at the most productive recent areas of research on <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> with the goal of addressing the following key questions (that also serve as main headings in the paper) : 1. What happens when actual <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> are developed and validated? 2. What are the characteristics of <b>performance</b> <b>tests?</b> 3. What are the benefits of <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> (why bother?) ? 4. What factors are involved in performance task difficulty? 5. How should we best go about scoring <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> (in terms of scoring criteria and rater effects) ? 6. Are <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> reliable? 7. Are <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> valid? 8. Are there other issues about <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> that need to be researched? The conclusions section then extends each of the main questions into a number of as yet unanswered sub-questions that might prove useful for future research on <b>performance</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

An {{execution}} {{system of}} distributed <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> is designed in this paper, {{which provides a}} mechanism of node communication, test script deployment, test scheduling, execution-driving and test result collection in distributed environment. A workload model is established, by which testers can describe the <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> requirement. A <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> framework is given, which simulates user behaviors in real environment based on virtual users so as to generate workload from the system under test (SUT). It can control the execution of virtual users by TTCN- 3 standard interface. After executing the <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> test report is generated by extracting log. A method of generating performance test-case is studied by reusing functional test scripts.

According to a <b>performance</b> <b>test</b> by ZDNet, Windows 7 Beta beat both Windows XP and Vista in several key areas, including boot and shutdown time {{and working with}} files, such as loading documents. Other areas did not beat XP, including PC Pro benchmarks for typical office activities and video editing, which remain identical to Vista and slower than XP. On January 7, 2009, the x64 version of the Windows 7 Beta (build 7000) was leaked onto the web, with some torrents being infected with a trojan. At CES 2009, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the Windows 7 Beta, build 7000, had been made available for download to MSDN and TechNet subscribers in the format of an ISO image. The Beta was to be publicly released January 9, 2009, and Microsoft initially planned for the download to {{be made available to}} 2.5million people on this date. However, access to the downloads was delayed because of high traffic. The download limit was also extended, initially until January 24, then again to February 10. People who did not complete downloading the beta had two extra days to complete the download, and, after February 12, unfinished downloads became unable to complete. Users could still obtain product keys from Microsoft to activate their copies of Windows 7 Beta, which expired on August 1, 2009.|$|E

High quality web-based software is adorned with quick responsiveness, bandwith, reliability, safety and a possibility to widen the application under a certain workload.
