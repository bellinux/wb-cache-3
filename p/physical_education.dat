40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the current status of computer use in <b>physical</b> therapist <b>education</b> programs, what is being done to develop computer skills in physical therapist students, the factors impacting computer use in <b>physical</b> therapist <b>education,</b> {{and if there is a}} disparity between the type of computing technology used in the profession and that which is used in the <b>education</b> of <b>physical</b> therapists. The directors of all <b>physical</b> therapist <b>education</b> programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of <b>Physical</b> Therapy <b>Education</b> (CAPTE) in the United States were surveyed in nine different topic areas related to computer use in <b>physical</b> therapist <b>education.</b> Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results. Ninety-eight of 162 surveys were returned for a 60 % response rate. Respondents rated their faculty highest in word processing, Internet, e-mail, and presentation program skills, and lowest in authoring systems/courseware, creating home pages, and troubleshooting computer problems. Almost all respondents (96. 9 %) use computer aided instruction in the delivery of their curricula, and 95 % require students to submit assignments using various computer skills. Hardware, software, technical support, and computer training are available to faculty, and, to a lesser extent, students. Most respondents believed it was not their responsibility to develop relevant computer skills in their students, and the vast majority did not favor having CAPTE establish minimum computer skills for graduates of <b>physical</b> therapist <b>education</b> programs. There does not appear to be a disparity between the type of computing technology used in the profession and that which is used in the <b>education</b> of <b>physical</b> therapists in most areas. What is lacking is a commitment to developing database skills, encouraging innovation in using the Internet for practice, creating educational courseware, and using/creating virtual reality for physical therapists. It is recommended that faculty reconsider where the responsibility resides for developing relevant computer skills in physical therapist students. It is also recommended that research be done on the use of computer skills in the various practice environments. In addition, much more needs to be done in research and development of computer applications specific to <b>physical</b> therapist <b>education</b> and practice...|$|R
5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> departments at most {{high schools and}} colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of <b>physical</b> <b>education,</b> which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E

Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All There is to Know About Hitting.|$|E
