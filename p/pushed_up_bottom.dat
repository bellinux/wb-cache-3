5000|$|It usually {{consists}} of a percussive system and a rotative system. The percussive system strikes the drill steel, for example 2000-5000 strikes per minute, whereas the number of rotations can be, for example, 100-400 per minute. The combination of these functions enables drilling holes into rock. The excess material (cuttings) is <b>pushed</b> <b>up</b> from the <b>bottom</b> of the hole by means of pressurized air or water.|$|R
50|$|A {{version with}} columns {{rather than a}} moulded {{architrave}} was illustrated by Sebastiano Serlio in 1537, where the voussoirs but not the keystone <b>push</b> <b>up</b> past the <b>bottom</b> edge of the pediment. Variations of this style are seen, for example, in the upper-floor windows of Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza (apparently part of the additions by Andrea Palladio), where only the keystone breaks into the pediment. The effect of a Gibbs surround is achieved round {{the doors of the}} south front of the Petit Trianon by stopping the horizontally banded rustication short in alternate levels.|$|R
50|$|Pokémon Puzzle League {{features}} the same gameplay as in Panel de Pon. The {{objective is to}} clear blocks from the playfield by arranging them in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. A continuous stream of new blocks <b>pushes</b> <b>up</b> from the <b>bottom</b> of the playfield, causing the entire playfield to rise continuously. If the blocks reach {{the top of the}} playfield, the player loses. The player can temporarily stop the progression of blocks by scoring combos and chains, and in two-player battles, these actions also cause garbage blocks to stack on top of the opponent's playfield.|$|R

The individual then performs two <b>push</b> <b>ups,</b> then kneels and performs eight unweighted overhead presses. The individual will continue to ladder up in this manner, with the count of unweighted overhead presses equalling four times the number of pushups. When muscle failure is reached, the individual then ladders down with a decreasing number of <b>push</b> <b>ups</b> and a corresponding number of unweighted overhead presses.|$|R

Research completed at the Department of Physical Therapy, College of Health Professions and the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, College of EngineeringThe unstable surfaces of a BOSU® ball and Swiss ball typically have {{a greater impact on}} EMG muscle activity during a <b>push</b> <b>up</b> compared to a normal <b>push</b> <b>up</b> done on a flat stable surface. This study's purpose was to determine if performing a <b>push</b> <b>up</b> on a BOSU® ball and on an exercise bench influenced EMG muscle activity when compared to the activity of a <b>push</b> <b>up</b> on a stable surface in females. Eighteen females were recruited from a convenience sample of college students. The pectoralis major, rectus abdominus, and external oblique muscles showed the greatest EMG muscle activity. The posterior deltoid showed the lowest activity. Overall, the <b>push</b> <b>up</b> performed on the bench showed the greatest EMG muscle activity compared to the other types of <b>push</b> <b>ups...</b>|$|R

50|$|No {{external}} power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One caisson always ascends {{and the other}} always descends during each locking cycle. When one caisson reaches the top position, it stops 12 in below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top caisson gates open, and water flows into the top caisson until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is 144 ST, making the total weight of the upper caisson 1844 ST. Any vessels that just ascended in the top caisson exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top caisson from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the crossover valve in the connecting pipe between the ram shafts is opened. Since the upper caisson weighs more than the lower caisson (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting pipe into the shaft of the bottom caisson. The force <b>pushes</b> <b>up</b> on the <b>bottom</b> caisson's ram, raising the caisson {{up to the top}} position. When the gate of the newly descended top caisson and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any descended vessels exit, allowing the cycle to start over again.|$|R
