40|$|Northern Saskatchewan is home {{to several}} active uranium (U) mines. Discharges of U to the aquatic {{environment}} during mining operations may produce measurable increases in U levels that could pose a potential hazard for aquatic organisms. Aqueous U toxicity has been investigated {{in a number of}} aquatic invertebrates, but limited data are available on the effects of U exposure on benthic macroinvertebrates. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the toxicity and accumulation of U over the life cycle of the aquatic invertebrate, Chironomus tentans, and to determine the rates of uptake and depuration for U in C. tentans larvae. Chronic U toxicity was evaluated by exposing the animals to three different U concentrations (40, 200, and 1000 Âµg/L) and an untreated control. Dry weight and U tissue concentration were measured at all life stages and for the exuvia remaining after adult emergence. In addition, some C. tentans adults collected from the treatments were mated with un-exposed adults from an in-house colony to evaluate hatching and mating success. After 10 d of U exposure, C. tentans larvae showed a significant decrease in growth (as dry weight) at mean U concentrations â‰¥ 157 Âµg/L. The no observable effect concentration and lowest observable effect concentration for growth in U exposed C. tentans larvae were 39 and 157 Âµg/L, respectively. Ten-day larval growth retardations correlated strongly with emergence reductions (r 2 = 0. 88) and also led to significant delays in time to adult emergence. Reductions of approximately 30 to 40 % in larval growth corresponded to decreases of 40 to 60 % in adult emergence. This strongly indicates that reductions in C. tentans emergence can be predicted by 10 -d growth data. Furthermore, the effects of U on larval growth were observed not only in the directly exposed F 0 larvae, but also in the unexposed F 1 generation larvae. Therefore, U exposure during the <b>paternal</b> <b>generation</b> can significantly influence the growth and reproductive potential of the next generation. Uranium that accumulated during C. tentans immature stages was partially excreted (approximately 50 %) during metamorphosis to the adult stage. The process of U elimination can be explained both by physiological changes taking place during metamorphosis, as well as by the shedding of the exoskeleton when molting from the pupal to the adult stage. However, the elimination of U was not complete and, as a result, transfer of U to the adult midges was observed. In order to investigate U uptake and depuration, 10 -d old C. tentans larvae were exposed to 300 Âµg U/L. After 9 d, larvae were transferred to clean water to calculate the U depuration rate. Animal samples were collected every 3 d to evaluate U tissue concentration and dry weight. Steady state conditions during U exposure were approached in 9 - 11 d. However, accumulated U was rapidly depurated (within 3 d) when larvae were transferred to U free water. The calculated uptake (Ku) and depuration rate constants (Kd) were 20. 3 and 0. 36, respectively. A separate experiment that measured U uptake in dead and live larvae revealed that accumulation of U in C. tentans larvae could be explained by a passive mechanisms of uptake coupled with an active mechanisms of U depuration...|$|E

50|$|Rafael's <b>paternal</b> {{ancestors}} for <b>generations</b> {{have been}} related to Valle del Roncal; until today Casa Gambra and Casa Sanz are iconic mansions of the area. The Gambras made their name fighting the French in 1809. Rafael’s grandfather, Pedro Francisco Gambra Barrena (died 1930), married descendant to a distinguished Carlist military Sanz family; himself he rose to high positions in Ministry of Economy. His son and Rafael’s father, Eduardo Gambra Sanz (1882-1964), became an architect. Key Gambra’s works are offices of Sociedad Gran Peña along the Gran Via and refurbishment of Palacio del Marqués de Miraflores, marked by attempt to re-capture the splendor of historical Spanish architecture. In 1915 he married Rafaela Ciudad Villalón (died 1947), born in Seville though raised in Madrid. She came from a distinguished family of civil servants; her father José Ciudad Aurioles in the early 20th century was a Cortes deputy, until the early 1920s a longtime senator, and in 1917-1923 served as President of Tribunal Supremo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{and related}} conditions, notably subfertility, are {{increasingly}} prevalent. Paternal influences {{are known to}} influence offspring health outcome, but the impact of paternal obesity and subfertility on the reproductive health of subsequent generations has been overlooked. METHODS: A high-fat diet (HFD) was used to induce obesity but not diabetes in male C 57 Bl 6 mice, which were subsequently mated to normal-weight females. First-generation offspring were raised on a control diet and their gametes were investigated for signs of subfertility. Second-generation offspring were generated from both first generation sexes and their gametes were similarly assessed. RESULTS: We demonstrate a HFD-induced paternal initiation of subfertility in {{both male and female}} offspring of two generations of mice. Furthermore, we have shown that diminished reproductive and gamete functions are transmitted through the first <b>generation</b> <b>paternal</b> line to both sexes of the second generation and via the first generation maternal line to second-generation males. Our previous findings that founder male obesity alters the epigenome of sperm, could provide a basis for the developmental programming of subfertility in subsequent generations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first observation of paternal transmission of diminished reproductive health to future generations and could have significant implications for the transgenerational amplification of subfertility observed worldwide in humans.

40|$|Sib matings {{increase}} homozygosity and, hence, {{the frequency}} of detrimental phenotypes caused by recessive deleterious alleles. However, many species have evolved adaptations that prevent the genetic costs associated with inbreeding. We discovered that the highly invasive longhorn crazy ant, Paratrechina longicornis, has evolved an unusual mode of reproduction whereby sib mating does not result in inbreeding. A population genetic study of P. longicornis revealed dramatic differences in allele frequencies between queens, males and workers. Mother-offspring analyses demonstrated that these allele frequency differences resulted {{from the fact that}} the three castes were all produced through different means. Workers developed through normal sexual reproduction between queens and males. However, queens were produced clonally and, thus, were genetically identical to their mothers. In contrast, males never inherited maternal alleles and were genetically identical to their fathers. The outcome of this system is that genetic inbreeding is impossible because queen and male genomes remain completely separate. Moreover, the sexually produced worker offspring retain the same genotype, combining alleles from both the maternal and <b>paternal</b> lineage over <b>generations.</b> Thus, queens may mate with their brothers in the parental nest, yet their offspring are no more homozygous than if the queen mated with a male randomly chosen from the population. The complete segregation of the male and female gene pools allows the queens to circumvent the costs associated with inbreeding and therefore may act as an important pre-adaptation for the crazy ant's tremendous invasive success.

40|$|Current {{treatments}} {{have largely}} failed {{to slow the}} rapidly increasing world-wide prevalence of obesity and its co-morbidities. Despite a strong genetic contribution to obesity (40 – 70 %), {{only a small percentage}} of heritability is explained with current knowledge of monogenic abnormalities, common sequence variants and conventional modes of inheritance. Epigenetic effects are rarely tested in humans because of difficulties arranging studies that distinguish conventional and transgenerational inheritance while simultaneously controlling environmental factors and learned behaviors. However, growing evidence from model organisms implicates genetic and environmental factors in one generation that affect phenotypes in subsequent generations. In this report, we provide the first evidence for paternal transgenerational genetic effects on body weight and food intake. This test focused on the obesity-resistant 6 C 2 d congenic strain, which carries the Obrq 2 aA/J allele on an otherwise C 57 BL/ 6 J background. Various crosses between 6 C 2 d and the control C 57 BL/ 6 J strain showed that the Obrq 2 aA/J allele in the <b>paternal</b> or grandpaternal <b>generation</b> was sufficient to inhibit diet-induced obesity and reduce food intake in the normally obesity-susceptible, high food intake C 57 BL/ 6 J strain. These obesity-resistant and reduced food intake phenotypes were transmitted through the paternal lineage but not the maternal lineage with equal strength for at least two generations. Eliminating social interaction between the father and both his offspring and the pregnant dam did not significantly affect food intake levels, demonstrating that the phenotype is transmitted through the male germline rather than through social interactions. Persistence of these phenotypes across multiple generations raises the possibility that transgenerational genetic effects contribute to current metabolic conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a case study and field {{research}} which study the kinship terms of address of Hing Hwa Chinese Indonesian in Surabaya. In Chinese communities there are many ethnic groups and each ethnic group has its own tradition, dilalect, and kinship system, such as Cantonese, Hakka, Teo-Ciu, Cuan Ciu and Hing Hwa. In this study, the researcher chooses the Hing Hwa Chinese Indonesian because she is interested in knowing the kinship system in Hing Hwa, besides {{she is also a}} Hing Hwa Chinese Indonesian herself. The writer carries out a research for her thesis entitled The Kinship Terms Of Address Of Hing Hwa Chinese Indonesian As Spoken By Plus-One Generation And Zero Generation which the respondents are linuted only in writer's families who stay in Surabaya. The problems which come up in this research are what kind of kinship terms of address used and also what social factors which influence the terms of address. For the theory, the writer uses Brown and Gilman's, Burgess and Locke's theories. Brown and Gilman's theories are about 'The Pronouns Of Power And Solidarity', Burgess and Locke's are about 'The Characteristics Of Chinese Family' and also other researchers as the support theories [...] As her respondents, the researcher uses her families and relatives who still live in Surabaya and ask some questions how they address their families or relatives in paternal line, within family, and maternal line.
