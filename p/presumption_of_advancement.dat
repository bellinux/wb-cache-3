2500|$|If {{there is}} no {{evidence}} either way of intention to benefit someone with a property transfer, the presumption of a resulting trust is transferred is not absolute. The Law of Property Act 1925 section 60(3) states that a resulting trust does not arise simply with absence of an express intention. However, the presumption is strong. This has a consequence when property is transferred in connection with an illegal purpose. Ordinarily, English law takes the view that one cannot rely in civil claims on actions done that are tainted with illegality (or in the Latin saying ex turpi causa non oritur actio). However, in Tinsley v Milligan, it was still possible for a claimant, Ms Milligan, to show she had an equitable interest in the house where she and her partner, Ms Tinsley, lived because she had contributed to the purchase price. Ms Tinsley was the sole registered owner, and both had intended to keep things this way because with one person on the title, they could fraudulently claim more in social security benefits. The House of Lords held, however, that because a resulting trust was presumed by the law, Ms Milligan did not need to prove an intention to not benefit Ms Tinsley, and therefore rely on her intention that was tainted with an illegal purpose. By contrast, the law has historically stated that when a husband transfers property to his wife (but not vice versa) or when parents make transfers to their children, a gift is presumed (or there is a [...] "presumption of advancement"). This presumption has been criticised on the ground that it is essentially sexist, or at least [...] "belonging to the propertied classes of a different social era." [...] It could be thought to follow that if Milligan had been a man and married to Tinsley, then the case's outcome would be the opposite. One limitation, however, came in Tribe v Tribe. Here a father transferred company shares to his son with a view to putting them out of reach of his creditors. This created a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement.</b> His son then refused to give the shares back, and the father argued in court that he had plainly not intended the son should benefit. Millett LJ held that because the illegal plan (to defraud creditors) had not been put into effect, the father could prove he had not intended to benefit his son by referring to the plan. Depending on what an appellate court would now decide, the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> may remain a part of the law. The Equality Act 2010 section 199 would abolish the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement,</b> but the section's implementation was delayed indefinitely by the Conservative led coalition government when it was elected in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{property}} passes between individuals, English law {{presumes that}} the relationship between them makes it an outright gift, and thus not subject to a resulting trust in the event of failure; this is the [...] "presumption of advancement". A presumed resulting trust occurs where the transfer fails, {{and there is no reason}} to assume it was intended as an outright gift. With some relationships, such as property transfers between father and son and husband and wife, this <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> is applied by default, and requires strong evidence for it to be rebutted. Presumed resulting trusts do arise, however, in one of three situations: where it is a voluntary gift, where there is a contribution to purchase price, and where the presumption that it was an outright gift can be rebutted. Rules differ for transfers and gifts of personal property and land; while personal property is assumed by default to create a resulting trust, Section 60(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925 prevents the creation of automatic resulting trusts. It does not comment on presumed resulting trusts, and while later law has seemingly permitted such trusts, there is some disagreement.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presumption}} {{has been}} subjected to criticism on the basis that it reflects outdated Victorian era social values, i.e. a transfer from a father or a husband is to be presumed to be a gift, but not a transfer from a wife or a mother (although in Australia it has been recognised in Brown v Brown that a wife can transfer property to her husband).

As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>{{presumption}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> is a {{legal presumption}} which arises in various common law jurisdictions {{in relation to the}} transfers of money or other property.

5000|$|Since Tinsley, {{the courts}} have been more willing to examine the {{intention}} of the parties rather than relying on the strict maxim that [...] "he who comes to equity must come with clean hands". The standard law on this was set out by Millett LJ in Tribe v Tribe: [...] (1) Title to property passes both at law and in equity even if the transfer is made for an illegal purpose. The fact that title has passed to the transferee does not preclude the transferor from bringing an action for restitution. (2) The transferor's action will fail if it would be illegal for him to retain any interest in the property (3) Subject to (2) the transferor can recover the property if he can do so without relying on the illegal purpose. This will normally be the case where the property was transferred without consideration in circumstances where the transferor can rely on an express declaration of trust or as a resulting trust in his favour. (4) It will almost invariably be so where the illegal purpose has not been carried out. It may be otherwise where the illegal purpose has been carried out and the transferee can rely on the transferor's conduct as inconsistent with his retention of a beneficial interest. (5) The transferor can lead evidence of the illegal purpose whenever it is necessary for him to do so provided that he has withdrawn from the transaction before the illegal purpose has been wholly or partly carried into effect. It will be necessary for him to do so (i) if he brings an action at law or (ii) if he brings proceedings in equity and needs to rebut the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement.</b> (6) The only way in which a man can protect his property from his creditors is by divesting himself of all beneficial interest in it. Evidence that he transferred the property in order to protect it from his creditors, therefore, does nothing by itself to rebut the presumption of advancement; it reinforces it. To rebut the presumption it is necessary to show that he intended to retain a beneficial interest and conceal it from his creditors. (7) The court should not conclude that this was his intention without compelling circumstantial evidence to this effect. The identity of the transferee and the circumstances in which the transfer was made would be highly relevant. It is unlikely that the court would reach such a conclusion where the transfer was made {{in the absence of an}} imminent and perceived threat from known creditors. As seen in Tribe v Tribe, a common form of illegality is where the transferor is worried about bankruptcy or insolvency, and transfers the property to avoid having to pay his creditors. Section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986 empowers to the courts to reverse any transfer which removes assets from creditors with the intention to avoid their claims. These creditors do not have to be creditors at the time of the transfer; it is enough that they be creditors after the transfer or sale, as in Midland Bank v Wyatt.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Oxford University Press via [URL] <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> is a well-established equitable principle in English law, which operates to presume that a purchaser or transferor of property intended to transfer the beneficial interest to the recipient in certain relationships. However, its future is far from certain. While {{it appeared that the}} presumption would be abolished by the Equality Act 2010 (UK) c 15 section 199, that section has never been brought into force. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the enduring impact of the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement,</b> and what its future might be. This article considers the operation of the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> in English law and attempts to abolish the presumption via legislative reform. It details a survey of UK case law, to ascertain how the presumption is operating in practice, and canvasses alternative approaches to dealing with the presumption, drawing on comparative perspectives and academic critiques.

40|$|While the {{doctrine}} of the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> and its applicability {{have been the subject of}} much judicial and academic criticism, this article reviews judicial approaches from Australasia and Canada and argues that {{the doctrine}} is still relevant in contemporary times. While it is evident that Canadian courts are not willing to support the place of the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> in relation to gratuitous gifts by parents to adult children, Australasian jurisprudence supports a more expansive view, which is consistent with the basis of the doctrine. The more expansive view is that the natural bond of love and affection flows from a parent to child, irrespective of the age of the child, and this does not change, regardless of social, political, or economic constraints or changes. Therefore, it is argued that the doctrine is still a useful tool in the judicial toolbox for resolving family disputes today. As a result, the author does not support the relegation of this doctrine to the annals of history, because to do so would be to ignore the realities of contemporary economic pressures...|$|E
