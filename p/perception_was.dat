5|$|Austen's novels {{appeared}} in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of Pride and Prejudice, quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen {{was not well}} known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works {{as part of the}} English novel tradition. This <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State Nguyễn Đính Thuan and Interior Minister Bùi Văn Lương {{were caught}} off guard by the attacks. The initial <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> that the {{military}} establishment had suddenly cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed {{to be a threat}} to the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held that the military felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17–18 August. In Huế, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at Xá Lợi during which some monks had called for the overthrow of the Diệm regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist statements of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous.|$|E
5|$|The pied currawong's {{impact on}} smaller birds that are {{vulnerable}} to nest predation is controversial: several {{studies have suggested that}} the species has become a serious problem, but the truth of this widely held <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed that common introduced birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of Gould's petrel at a colony on Cabbage Tree Island, near Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is negatively correlated with the presence of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis).|$|E

50|$|Pratyaksha (प्रत्यक्ष) means <b>perception.</b> It <b>is</b> of {{two types}} in Dvaita and other Hindu schools: {{external}} and internal. External <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> described as that {{arising from the}} interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> described as that of inner sense, the mind.|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{notion of}} how things are seen <b>is</b> that <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> passive, that the eyes are windows, and in floods reality. Physiological work of the 19 th century cast doubt on this view that <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> passive acceptance of reality. <b>Perception</b> <b>is</b> not {{at the present time}} a popular topic for philosophers. This must be partly because scientific accounts of perception have now gone a long way away from appearances. They depend on physiological and psycho-physical experiments which require technical investigation and do not fall within traditional concepts of philosophy. Theories of visual <b>perception</b> <b>are</b> examined, both from a physical and psycho-physical standpoint...|$|R
25|$|Between his {{appointment}} and the election, Debnam never quite shook {{the perception that}} under Brogden or O'Farrell, the party would have performed much better. This <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> reinforced when, {{in a bid to}} capitalise on the Orkopoulos scandal, the opposition leader raised unsubstantiated allegations against Attorney-General Bob Debus in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Early on, in 1985, a {{link between}} odors {{released}} by stressed rats and pain <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> discovered: unstressed rats exposed to these odors developed opioid-mediated analgesia. In 1997, researchers found bees became less responsive to pain after they had been stimulated with isoamyl acetate, a chemical smelling of banana, and a component of bee alarm pheromone. The experiment also showed that the bees' fear-induced pain tolerance was mediated by an endorphine.|$|E
25|$|During the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongol {{emperors}} made Esoteric Buddhism {{an official}} religion of China, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court. A common <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> that this patronage of lamas caused corrupt forms of tantra to become widespread. When the Mongol Yuan Dynasty was overthrown and the Ming Dynasty was established, the Tibetan lamas were {{expelled from the}} court, and this form of Buddhism was denounced as not being an orthodox path.|$|E
5000|$|Moral <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} in ethics to denote the {{discernment}} of the morally salient qualities in particular situations. Moral <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> argued {{to be necessary}} to moral reasoning (see practical reason), the deliberation of {{what is the right}} thing to do. Moral <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> variously conceptualized by Aristotle, Hannah Arendt, and Martha C. Nussbaum. Lawrence Blum (1994) distinguishes moral perception from moral judgment. Whereas a person's judgment about what the moral course of action would be is the result of a conscious deliberation, the basis for that process <b>is</b> the <b>perception</b> of aspects of one's situation, which is different for each person. Moral <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> also particular in nature.|$|R

25|$|Because the <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> {{that the}} Alliance for Progress was a failure, shortly after taking office, on February 17, 1969, President Richard Nixon {{commissioned}} {{a study to}} assess the state of Latin America. Nixon appointed his most powerful political rival, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to direct the study. The poor {{relationship between the two}} politicians suggested that Nixon would not be that interested in the results of the study. There was a lack of interest for the region in the late 1960s to early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Charvaka {{epistemology}} represents minimalist pramāṇas (epistemological methods) in Hindu philosophy. The {{other schools}} of Hinduism developed and accepted multiple valid forms of epistemology. To Charvakas, Pratyakṣa (<b>perception)</b> <b>was</b> the one valid way to knowledge {{and other means}} of knowledge were either always conditional or invalid. Advaita Vedanta scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: Pratyakṣa (perception), Anumāṇa (inference), Upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), Arthāpatti (postulation), Anupalabdhi (non-perception, cognitive proof) and Śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). While Charvaka school accepted just one, the valid means of epistemology in other schools of Hinduism ranged between 2 and 6.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} (such as Finland) convertibles of various structures may {{be treated as}} equity by the local accounting profession. In such circumstances, the accounting treatment may result in less pro-forma debt than if straight debt was used as takeover currency or to fund an acquisition. The <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> that gearing was less with a convertible than if straight debt was used instead. In the UK the predecessor to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{put a stop to}} treating convertible preference shares as equity. Instead it has to be classified both as (1) preference capital and as (2) convertible as well.|$|E
5000|$|For Kant, {{there is}} {{absolutely}} no knowledge of an object unless there is thought which employs abstract concepts. For him, <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> not knowledge because it is not thought. In general, Kant claimed that <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> mere sensation.|$|R

25|$|A {{recent study}} by Cohen, Alvarez & Nakayama (2011) calls into {{question}} the validity of evidence supporting the attention-free hypothesis. They found that participants did display inattentional blindness while doing certain kinds of multiple-object tracking (MOT) and rapid serial visual presentation (RVSP) tasks. Furthermore, Cohen et al. found that participants' natural scene <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> impaired under dual-task conditions, but that this dual-task impairment happened only when participants' primary task was sufficiently demanding. The authors concluded that previous studies showing the absence of a need for focused attention did not use tasks that were demanding enough to fully engage attention.|$|E
25|$|The Khmelnytsky Uprising was the {{beginning}} of a long period of internal crisis in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The external situation also deteriorated, because of the increased strength of Sweden, Russia, Prussia and the Ottoman Empire. Being forced to simultaneously fight on the Baltic and Ukrainian fronts, the Commonwealth incurred significant territorial losses, even though for the time being its existence was not realistically threatened. The Commonwealth was regarded by main European states, including France of Louis XIV, as a regional power and valuable partner, necessary component of the European balance of power. This <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> being reinforced by military victories, especially under the Hetman and then King John III Sobieski.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, Tordoff {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army Air Forces, and trained as a fighter pilot. He later recounted that he naively {{imagined}} flying as thrilling, {{and a way to}} avoid ground combat. His depth <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> low by Air Force standards, so he passed his vision test by watching another pilot candidate get tested, and figuring out how the settings worked on the apparatus that was used. In 1943 he earned his wings, and joined the 352nd Fighter Squadron, 353rd Fighter Group, 8th Air Force. He flew a total of 85 missions during the war, in support of the Allied bombing of Germany, and reached the rank of captain.|$|E
50|$|A schema of {{empirical}} <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> a sketchy, imagined perception. Thus, a schema is the mere imagined form or outline, so to speak, {{of a real}} <b>perception.</b> It <b>is</b> related to an empirical abstract concept {{to show that the}} concept is not mere word-play but has indeed been based on real <b>perceptions.</b> These <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> the actual, material content of the empirical abstract concept.|$|R
50|$|Direct <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> {{knowledge}} which excludes conceptual thought (kalpanā). This only {{reveals the}} bare features {{of an object}} via the senses. This knowledge is inexpressible in words, relating to real objects and ultimate reality. Errors of perception arise through misinterpretations by conceptual thought. Each item of sense <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> unique. Dignāga does not specify what {{the nature of the}} object of <b>perception</b> <b>is,</b> but implies that although it is not atomic or otherwise, it is existent. It is real because it is causally efficient (artha-kriyā).|$|R

25|$|One of the {{recurrent}} {{themes of}} these painstakingly detailed new theories {{was the idea}} that humans may not perceive colours in isolation but rather, that one colour may be seen to interfere with another colour neighbouring it. In this way, colour <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data. Seurat’s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most obviously in such areas as those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.|$|E
25|$|The {{practical}} {{effect of}} the Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that the US would not invade Cuba. It is possible that Khrushchev placed the missiles in Cuba only to get Kennedy to remove the missiles from Italy and Turkey and that the Soviets {{had no intention of}} resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the U.S. Because the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time, Khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened. The <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been humiliated. However, both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 study {{examined}} adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being {{negatively associated with}} resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills {{as a form of}} intervention. Emotional intelligence has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress and as mentioned previously, the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression. One factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one’s own emotions. Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.|$|E

25|$|Fifty years ago, {{the common}} <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> that water was an {{infinite}} resource. At the time, {{there were fewer}} than half the current number {{of people on the}} planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of peak water. This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.|$|E
25|$|According to English Common Law, which {{developed}} from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held {{at the time of}} marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually English courts forbade a husband's transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965. In the 16th century, the Reformation in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers Jane Anger, Aemilia Lanyer, and the prophetess Anna Trapnell. English and American Quakers believed that men and women were equal. Many Quaker women were preachers. Despite relatively greater freedom for Anglo-Saxon women, until the mid-19th century, writers largely assumed that a patriarchal order was a natural order that had always existed. This <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> not seriously challenged until the 18th century when Jesuit missionaries found matrilineality in native North American peoples.|$|E
25|$|The Hong Kong Police Force {{previously}} had an Anti-Corruption Branch, {{but it did}} little to reduce corruption. Public <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> that Anti-Corruption police, following the discovery of corrupt practices, would then enter into the dealings themselves. One example was Peter Godber, a senior officer stationed at Wanchai police station and later at Kai Tak Airport police station. Before his retirement in 1973, he had amassed at least 4.3million Hong Kong dollars (approximately 600,000 US dollars) in overseas bank accounts. The police's Anti-Corruption Branch investigated his wealth and ordered him to explain his source of income. In response, Godber immediately arranged for his wife to leave the colony, then used his police airport pass to bypass Immigration and Passport checks and walked onto a plane for London. Godber's escape led to a large public outcry over the integrity {{and quality of the}} police's self-investigation and called for reforms in the government's anti-corruption efforts. Godber was later extradited back to Hong Kong to face trial and was convicted.|$|E

40|$|Enactivists often {{claim that}} since <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> one with action, {{it does not}} involve representations, hence <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> direct. Here we argue that {{empirical}} evidence on neural activity in the ventral premotor cortex confirms the enactivist intuitions about the unity of action and perception. But this very unity requires the detection of the action possibilities offered by the objects in the environment, which in turn involves certain representational processes at the neural level. Hence, the enactivist claim that <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> direct is wrong, or at least ambiguous and potentially misleading: in one important sense perception involves representations...|$|R
