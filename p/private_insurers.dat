40|$|The {{starting}} point of my doctoral research is the observation that solidarity mechanisms are being introduced in private insurance. We {{will focus on the}} following three questions: what is the rationale of the solidarity mechanisms? What kind of mechanisms are we talking about? And to what extend does the <b>private</b> <b>insurer</b> have to provide access to and solidarity within the insurance policy? On the one hand the legislator must safeguard that the <b>private</b> <b>insurer</b> does not enter the area of social security. On the other hand we observe that competitive elements have found their way into social security. Hence, it is necessary that borders are set out between these two areas. The doctoral research aims to draft a uniform and coherent legal framework, applicable to all insurance agreements. nrpages: 370 status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Because Medicare offers statutorily {{determined}} benefits, {{its coverage}} policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees {{are entitled to}} the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer disclosure requirements than Medicare, and studies show that customers {{in the private sector}} can find it difficult to know what their policy covers. and at what cost. Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees—data that <b>private</b> <b>insurers</b> treat as trade secrets—it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{differs from}} private {{insurance}} available to working Americans {{in that it}} is a social insurance program. Social insurance programs provide statutorily guaranteed benefits to the entire population (under certain circumstances, such as old age or unemployment). These benefits are financed in significant part through universal taxes. In effect, Medicare is a mechanism by which the state takes a portion of its citizens' resources to guarantee health and financial security to its citizens in old age or in case of disability, helping them cope with the enormous, unpredictable cost of health care. In its universality, Medicare differs substantially from <b>private</b> <b>insurers,</b> which must decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and guarantee their costs don't exceed premiums.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} {{reported a}} {{growth rate of}} around 10% from 1996–97 to 2000–01. After opening the sector, growth rates averaged 15.85% from 2001–02 to 2010–11. Specialised insurers Export Credit Guarantee Corporation and Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) offer credit guarantee and crop insurance, respectively. AIC, which initially offered coverage under the National Agriculture Insurance Company (NAIS), has now started providing crop insurance on commercial line as well. It has introduced several innovative products such as weather insurance and insurance related to specific crops. The premium underwritten by the non-life insurers during 2010–11 was 42,576crore (425billion) against 34,620crore (346billion) in 2009–10. The growth was satisfactory, particularly given across-the-broad cuts in the tariff rates. The <b>private</b> <b>insurers</b> underwrote premiums of 17,424crore (174billion) against 13,977crore (140billion) in 2009–10. Public sector insurers underwrote premiums of 25,151.8crore (252billion) in 2010–11 against 20,643.5crore (206billion) in 2009–10, a growth of 21.8% against 14.5% in 2009–10.|$|E

25|$|After Georgian independence, the {{government}} found that its Soviet-style centralized healthcare system was underfunded and failing. State-run centralized medical facilities were typically inefficient {{and in need}} of renovation and technological upgrades. As a result, {{the government}} privatized almost all public hospitals and clinics, and the insurance system was deregulated, with private insurance companies able to offer coverage. Only a few specialized facilities for mental health and infectious diseases remained in government hands, and the state continued to provide health insurance for those below the poverty line, whose insurance was paid for by public funds and provided by <b>private</b> <b>insurers,</b> and some civil servants, amounting to about 40% of the population. As a result, the level of healthcare greatly improved, with new hospitals and clinics beginning to replace older facilities. However, a portion of the population was uninsured, as it could not afford private insurance and did not qualify for public insurance.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of health care in the United States is {{attributed}} variously to technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than people in other countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from the full cost of treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to receive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a notable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more likely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other countries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to the fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by <b>private</b> <b>insurers</b> and drug companies. Government plans often pay less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the privately insured through higher prices.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advantages}} of the NPT approach are that it is fast and convenient, usually less painful, and offers, in home use, the ability for patients to measure their own INRs when required.

In the UK these are available on prescription so that elderly and unwaged people will not pay for them and others will pay only a standard prescription charge, which at the moment represents only about 20% of the retail price of the strips. In the USA, NPT in the home is currently reimbursed by Medicare for patients with mechanical heart valves, while <b>private</b> <b>insurers</b> may cover for other indications.

25|$|Overall {{health care}} costs were {{projected}} in 2011 to increase by 5.8 percent annually from 2010 to 2020, {{in part because of}} increased utilization of medical services, higher prices for services, and new technologies. Health care costs are rising across the board, but the cost of insurance has risen dramatically for families and employers as well as the federal government. In fact, since 1970 the per-capita cost of private coverage has grown roughly one percentage point faster each year than the per-capita cost of Medicare. Since the late 1990s, Medicare has performed especially well relative to <b>private</b> <b>insurers.</b> Over the next decade, Medicare’s per capita spending is projected to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent each year, compared to private insurance’s 4.8 percent. Nonetheless, most experts and policymakers agree containing {{health care costs}} is essential to the nation’s fiscal outlook. Much of the debate over the future of Medicare revolves around whether per capita costs should be reduced by limiting payments to providers or by shifting more costs to Medicare enrollees.|$|E
