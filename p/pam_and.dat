5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) has {{returned}} to his old job as regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch and announces that Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Ryan (B. J. Novak) have joined the sales team, retaining their old clients from the Michael Scott Paper Company. Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats <b>Pam</b> <b>and</b> Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus <b>Pam</b> <b>and</b> Ryan, to think of a way to get their clients back.|$|E

40|$|Pam 18 /Tim 14 <b>and</b> <b>Pam</b> 16 /Tim 16, highly conserved {{proteins}} among eukaryotes, are two essential subunits {{of protein}} import motors localized {{in the inner}} mitochondrial membrane. The heterodimer formed by <b>Pam</b> 18 <b>and</b> <b>Pam</b> 16 via their J-type domains serves a regulatory function in protein translocation. Here, we report that thirty-one <b>Pam</b> 18 <b>and</b> twenty-six <b>Pam</b> 16 putative orthologues in twelve plant species were identified and analyzed through bioinformatics strategy. Results data revealed that <b>Pam</b> 18 <b>and</b> <b>Pam</b> 16 were also highly conserved among plants including their J-type domains within the hydrophilic region. Key amino acid residues and an HPD motif of Pam 18 were identical among the orthologues except OsPam 18 L 5. N-myristoylation sites of <b>Pam</b> 18 <b>and</b> casein kinase II phosphorylation sites of Pam 16 were more abundant, which might be important functional sites. Some <b>Pam</b> 18 <b>and</b> <b>Pam</b> 16 proteins contained a transmembrane region at the N-terminal region. Sub-cellular prediction results indicated that many orthologues localized at mitochondria. Gene expression analyses revealed that <b>Pam</b> 18 <b>and</b> <b>Pam</b> 16 in Arabidopsis might play roles in senescence and abiotic stress responses.

The office space used to be a closet; water pipes run through the room, so they can hear the toilets flush from the Dunder Mifflin bathrooms above them. Ryan openly goofs off in front of <b>Pam</b> <b>and</b> Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. <b>Pam</b> <b>and</b> Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. <b>Pam</b> <b>and</b> Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E

5|$|Someone paints butts on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults <b>Pam</b> <b>and</b> her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so <b>Pam</b> <b>and</b> Dwight take things {{into their own hands}} by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers.
