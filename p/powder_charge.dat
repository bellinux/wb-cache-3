25|$|A {{significant}} improvement in combat capabilities was achieved by boosting the <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> of the 155 L, a measure {{made possible by the}} strong construction of the gun. Before 1914, the typical shell fired by the 155 L had a speed of 470m/s and a range not exceeding 9800 meters. With the boosted <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> adopted in 1915, the shell speed increased to 561m/s and gained 2,900 meters in range.|$|E
25|$|HEAT M67 Shell had {{non-adjustable}} propelling charge. For blank ammunition, {{a shorter}} Cartridge Case M15 with black <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> was used.|$|E
25|$|The {{cast iron}} shell, similar in shape to a Minié ball, had a thin lead coating {{which made it}} fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell. This system had just been {{developed}} by Martin von Wahrendorff and Giovanni Cavalli in Sweden. This spin, together with the elimination of windage {{as a result of}} the tight fit, enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smoothbore muzzle-loaders with a smaller <b>powder</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|What the [...]458 Lott lacks in {{velocity}} and energy {{compared to the}} [...]450 Rigby or the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum, it more than makes up for {{by virtue of its}} versatility. Larger volume cases such as the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum do not do well with <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> below the recommended minimums. This is due to the erratic ignition and hangfire issues experienced when large capacity cartridges are loaded with small <b>powder</b> <b>charges.</b> The Lott has no such issues and takes well to lower <b>powder</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R

The guns were mounted in Mark IV turrets, which had a range of elevation of 15degrees to -5degrees. The turrets required the guns to return to 2degrees for loading. Ammunition storage was 60shells per gun.|$|E

Hangfires with cartridges such as the [...]460 Weatherby are extremely unpleasant. <b>Powder</b> <b>charges</b> with higher load densities provide more reliable burn performance than lighter charges.|$|R
50|$|For the artillery, {{the crew}} of the #1 380 mm turret were sent to man the two 240 mm guns of the coast defence battery of Cape Manuel, the most {{southern}} promontory of Cap-Vert peninsula. Only the #2 (380 mm) and #7 (152 mm axial) turrets could be manned, and the latter for anti-ship fire only, as the #1 fire control director for 152 mm turrets in anti-aircraft purpose was never put into service. As only less than 200 SD21 <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> had been embarked in Brest, the 800 <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> with SD19 propellant for Strasbourgs 330 mm guns left stored at Dakar the previous year were reconditioned in 600 <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> for 380 mm guns.|$|R

500|$|Handloading is {{possible}} with 5.7×28mm ammunition, and 5.7-mm (.224 in) bullets {{are widely available}} due to use in [...]223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO cartridges. Handloaders have noted that the 5.7×28mm cartridge is very sensitive to small changes in <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> or overall length (OAL) with a bullet inserted. Bullets weighing 2.6 g (40 grains) or less are recommended for optimal use in 5.7×28mm applications, but the 1:231 mm (1:9.1in) rifling twist rate (distance the bullet must travel to complete one full revolution) used in the firearms' barrels will stabilize bullets weighing up to 4.5 g (70 grains).|$|E
500|$|The carronade was {{initially}} very successful and widely adopted, {{although in the}} 1810s and 1820s, greater {{emphasis was placed on}} the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The small <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> of the carronade was only able to project a heavy cannonball over a relatively limited distance. [...] The short barrel, low muzzle velocity and short range also increased the risk that a carronade would eject burning wadding onto nearby combustible materials, increasing the risk of fire. The carronade disappeared from the Royal Navy from the 1850s after the development of steel, jacketed cannon by William George Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships of}} the Re Umberto class were {{armed with a}} main battery of four [...] 30-caliber guns, mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one on {{either end of the}} ship. This was more {{efficient}} than the arrangement used in previous designs, with both pairs of guns mounted in a central barbette that limited their arcs of fire. The guns were the Pattern B type manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth. These guns fired a [...] capped armor-piercing shells with a [...] brown <b>powder</b> <b>charge,</b> which produced a muzzle velocity of [...] The guns could elevate to 15degrees and depress to -5degrees; elevation was controlled by hand, and loading required the guns to be elevated to 15degrees.|$|E

500|$|In {{the space}} of a week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 [...] crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the {{explosive}} and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. He raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with Farrell, who agreed that {{it might be a good}} idea. Farrell asked Parsons if he knew how to perform this task. [...] "No sir, I don't", Parsons conceded, [...] "but I've got all afternoon to learn." [...] The night before the mission, Parsons repeatedly practiced inserting the <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> and detonator in the bomb in the poor visibility and cramped conditions of the bomb bay.|$|E
500|$|Rear Admiral William Sterling [...] "Deak" [...] Parsons [...] (26 November 1901 – 5 December 1953) was an American {{naval officer}} {{who worked as}} an {{ordnance}} expert on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He {{is best known for}} being the weaponeer on the Enola Gay, the aircraft which dropped the Little Boy atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan in 1945. To avoid the possibility of a nuclear explosion if the aircraft crashed and burned on takeoff, he decided to arm the bomb in flight. While the aircraft was en route to Hiroshima, Parsons climbed into the cramped and dark bomb bay, and inserted the <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> and detonator. He was awarded the Silver Star for his part in the mission.|$|E
500|$|Specific {{weapons from}} the ancient and medieval periods {{continued}} to develop, and many have [...] modern equivalents. [...] Rocket technology, originally trialled by the Mongols, Indians and the Chinese, amongst others, was improved by the 19th century; one example was the incendiary Congreve rocket, which had a tail, a fuse, and a <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> (saltpetre, sulfur and carbon) inside a hollow shell. Grenades continued to develop, although still retaining some aspects of their medieval equivalents. [...] The grenades carried on board British Royal Navy ships in the late 18th century and early 19th century were constructed from hollow cast iron, filled with gunpowder; the fuse was a hollow wooden tube filled with combustible material. [...] During World War I, grenades were still occasionally launched by ballistae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} factory load fires a 480 gr g bullet at 2200 ft/s, although two <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> {{were available}} with either 80 gr g or 85 gr g of cordite. W.J. Jeffery & Co offered an alternate loading with a 500 gr g projectile fired at 2150 ft/s, although again multiple <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> were available, with either 75 gr g, 80 gr g or 85 gr g of cordite. However, the Jeffery version uses a [...]488 in diameter bullet. Both versions are not interchangeable.|$|R
5000|$|Double shot - Two {{round shot}} or other {{projectiles}} loaded in one gun and {{fired at the}} same time. Double-shotting lowered the effective range and accuracy of the gun, but could be devastating within pistol shot range—that is, when ships drew close enough for a pistol shot to reach between the two ships. To avoid bursting the gun, reduced <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> were used. Guns sometimes were double-shotted with canister or grape on top of ball, or even triple-shotted with very small <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> which still were enough to cause horrible wounds at close range.|$|R

500|$|Like firearms, cannon are a {{descendant}} of the fire-lance, a gunpowder-filled tube used as a flamethrower; [...] was sometimes placed in the barrel {{so that it would}} fly out together with the flames. In due course, the proportion of saltpeter in the propellant was increased to increase its explosive power. To better withstand that explosive power, the paper and bamboo of which fire-lance barrels were originally made came to be replaced by metal. And {{to take full advantage of}} that power, the shrapnel came to be replaced by projectiles whose size and shape filled the barrel more closely. With this, we have the three basic features of the gun: a barrel made of metal, high-nitrate gunpowder, and a projectile which totally occludes the muzzle so that the <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> exerts its full potential in propellant effect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} {{the quest for a}} more accurate, flatter shooting, [...]45 caliber {{cartridge}} and firearm was the Springfield trapdoor rifle. Like the [...]50-70 before it, the [...]45-70 used a copper center-fire case design. A reduced power loading was also adopted for use in the trapdoor carbine. It had a 55 grain (3.6 g) <b>powder</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E

Original UMC loads used a [...] <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> and [...] bullet. This was reduced to [...] of powder, and later, by the Army, to [...]|$|E
50|$|During this operation, Captain Merveilleux du Vignaux, the new {{commanding}} officer {{since the beginning}} of May, decided that, due to the shortcomings of the U.S. manufactured <b>powder</b> <b>charges,</b> to use the remaining French SD21 <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> with standard AP shells for combat actions. It also appeared that the APC shells were effective in penetrating concrete structures, but did not explode, and tended to bury themselves when they hit the ground. It was therefore resolved to order from British manufacturers specially designed 380 mm HE shells, which would be registered in the French post-war ammunition inventories as 380 mm OEA Model 1945.|$|R
50|$|The mortar {{employed}} conventional 8 cm 3.5 kg shells (high explosive or smoke) with percussion fuzes. The range {{could be}} extended by fitting {{up to three}} additional <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> between the shell tailfins.|$|R
5|$|The {{gasoline}} {{fires that}} flared up around Turret 1 {{might have caused}} more critical damage if the main magazines had not been empty. For several days prior to the attack, all of the 14-inch-gun (356mm) battleships had been replacing their standard-weight main battery projectiles with a new heavier projectile that offered greater penetration and a larger explosive charge {{in exchange for a}} slight decrease in range. All of the older projectiles and <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> had been removed from the magazines of Nevada, and the crew had taken a break after loading the new projectiles in anticipation of loading the new <b>powder</b> <b>charges</b> on Sunday.|$|R
2500|$|Under an 1890 {{regulation}} {{issued by}} the United States Department of War, the [...] "Salute to the Union" [...] consists of one round for every state of the United States, or 50 rounds since 1959; it is fired by the battery annually at noon on U.S. Independence Day. During ceremonial volleys, the Presidential Salute Battery fires blank artillery rounds packed with a 1.5 pound <b>powder</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For reduced {{velocity}} reloads powders such as Accurate Arms AA8700 and Hodgdon’s H870 {{have performed}} well. With AA8700 and H870 there {{will remain a}} large quantity of un-burnt powder which can be annoying. Faster powders, if used, will occupy less volume; so a [...] filler such as Dacron is used to hold the <b>powder</b> <b>charge</b> against the primer to provide shot to shot consistence and reliable ignition.|$|E
2500|$|Flash hole uniforming {{tools are}} used to remove any burrs, which are {{residual}} brass remaining from the manufacturing punching operation used in creating flash holes. [...] These tools resemble primer pocket uniformer tools, except being thinner, and commonly include deburring, chamfering, and uniforming functions. [...] The purpose of these tools is to achieve a more equal distribution of flame from the primer to ignite the <b>powder</b> <b>charge,</b> resulting in consistent ignition from case to case.|$|E
