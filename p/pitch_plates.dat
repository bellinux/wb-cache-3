5000|$|There is also {{an illegal}} form of {{pitching}} known as [...] "crow-hopping". A [...] "crow hop" [...] occurs when the pitcher pushes with the pivot foot from somewhere other than the <b>pitching</b> <b>plate.</b> This often involves jumping from the <b>pitching</b> <b>plate</b> and replanting somewhere {{in front of the}} <b>pitching</b> <b>plate.</b> The umpire sticks his left arm out straight to the side and clenches his fist. This results in a ball being awarded to the batter, and any runners on base advancing to the next base. If the batter swings at the pitch that is deemed illegal and puts the ball in play, the defense is given the option to accept the results of the play or accept the penalty listed previously. Image to the right demonstrates a legal pitch as the push-off foot has not left the ground. The ball must be released simultaneously with the lead leg step.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of a [...] "batter's box", {{the home}} plate {{serves as a}} <b>pitching</b> <b>plate,</b> which is round with a {{diameter}} of 0.6 m. All other batting team players stand in a semicircle near the batter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{battery is}} {{composed}} of the pitcher, who stands on the rubber of the mound, which {{is also known as}} the <b>pitching</b> <b>plate,</b> and the catcher, who squats behind home plate. These are the two fielders who always deal directly with the batter on every pitch, hence the term [...] "battery", coined by Henry Chadwick and later reinforced by the implied comparison to artillery fire.|$|R
5000|$|Play {{begins with}} the umpire saying [...] "Play Ball". After the batter is ready and all fielders (except the catcher) are in fair territory, the pitcher stands at the <b>pitching</b> <b>plate</b> and {{attempts}} {{to throw the ball}} past the batter to the catcher behind home plate. The throw, or pitch, must be made with an underarm motion: the ball must be released below the hip when the hand is no farther from the hip than the elbow to get it in the strike zone.|$|R
25|$|The game is {{also very}} common in the {{southwest}} counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset. In Dorset some games are played by bowling a technique known as the 'Dorset flop'. This is where the bowler crouches on the alley and throws himself and the ball forward landing on his stomach and letting the ball go between two bowling lines. In some parts of Somerset the ball has to hit a <b>pitch</b> <b>plate</b> (a diamond painted on the alley) in order {{for it to be}} a legal ball. It is also popular in South Wales.|$|R

40|$|Propulsive {{performance}} of a passively flapping plate in a uniform viscous flow has been studied numerically {{by means of a}} multiblock lattice Boltzmann method. The passively flapping plate is modeled by a rigid plate with a torsion spring acting about the pivot at the leading-edge of the plate, which is called a lumped-torsional-flexibility model. When the leading-edge is forced to take a vertical oscillation, the <b>plate</b> <b>pitches</b> passively due to the fluid-plate interaction. Based on our numerical simulations, various fundamental mechanisms dictating the propulsive performance, including the forces on the plate, power consumption, propulsive efficiency and vortical structures, have been studied. It is found that the torsional flexibility of the passively <b>pitching</b> <b>plate</b> can improve the propulsive performance. The results obtained in this study provide some physical insights into the understanding of the propulsive behaviors of swimming and flying animals...|$|R

50|$|After {{the final}} game in the Stadium's history was played on September 21, 2008, public tours of Yankee Stadium {{continued}} until November 23, 2008. November 9, 2008 was the last day the public tours included Monument Park and the retired number area. On November 12, 2008 construction workers began removing memorials from Monument Park for relocation to the new facility. On November 8, 2008 former Yankees Scott Brosius, Paul O'Neill, David Cone and Jeff Nelson, {{all members of the}} 1998 World Series championship team, joined 60 children from two Bronx based youth groups Youth Force 2020 and the ACE Mentor Program in ceremoniously digging up home plate, the pitcher's mound <b>pitching</b> <b>plate</b> (rubber) and the surrounding dirt of both areas and transporting them to comparable areas of new Yankee Stadium.|$|R
50|$|Pitch count {{can also}} be used to gauge the {{effectiveness}} and efficiency of a pitcher. It is better under most circumstances for a pitcher to use the fewest number of pitches possible to get three outs.

40|$|Abstract: This work exposes and {{discusses}} results obtained for aerodynamic forces using an indirect calculation based on Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The methodology used {{is based on}} the integral formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations and is applied to spatio-temporal data for different flows around a plate with a 16 : 1 chord-to-thickness ratio at high angle of attack. Experimental data are obtained in a water channel for both a static and a <b>pitching</b> <b>plate.</b> In addition to PIV data, direct measurements of aerodynamic loads are carried out to assess the quality of the indirect calculation. It is demonstrated that this indirect method is able to compute the mean and the temporal evolution of the lift and drag coefficients with a reasonable accuracy. It is also shown that the noise sensitivity of the method can be partly alleviated through the use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) as a pre-processing step to smooth the spatio-temporal data. ...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{strategies}} {{are a key}} component of game theory. Investigations into whether or not people use optimal mixed strategies have largely been limited to laboratory settings and have produced mixed results. Recently, the empirical framework has been extended into professional sports. This study uses pitch-level data from Major League Baseball games to see if pitchers mix their pitches optimally. The scope of this study is limited to the first <b>pitch</b> of a <b>plate</b> appearance and finds that pitchers are mixing optimally to have success on the first <b>pitch</b> of the <b>plate</b> appearance, but the null hypothesis of optimal play for the plate appearance outcome is rejected. ...|$|R
50|$|The Mets, however, {{would benefit}} from two {{questionable}} umpire's calls. In {{the top of the}} sixth inning, Mets starting pitcher Jerry Koosman appeared to have hit Frank Robinson with a <b>pitch,</b> but <b>plate</b> umpire Lou DiMuro ruled that the pitch hit his bat before hitting him and denied him first base. Replays showed, however, that Robinson was indeed hit first—the ball struck him on the hip, then bounced up and hit his bat.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Abreu led {{the major}} leagues in walks (124), <b>pitches</b> per <b>plate</b> {{appearance}} (4.45), and number of pitches seen (3,056), and was second in {{the major leagues}} in percent of plate appearances that were walks (18.5%), and led the AL in percentage of pitches taken (66.2), and in walks per plate appearance (.181), third in batting average on balls in play (.375), eighth in on-base percentage (.424), 18th in stolen bases (30), and 19th in doubles (41).|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} between swimming by flapping and by periodic contractions is conducted. Swimming by flapping is approximated as a <b>pitching</b> <b>plate</b> while swimming by periodic contractions is approximated as clapping plates. A direct comparison is {{made between the}} two propulsion mechanisms by utilizing a machine that can operate in either a flapping or a clapping mode between Reynolds numbers of 1880 and 11 260 based on the average plate tip velocity and span. The average thrust generated and the average input power required per cycle are compared between cases where the total sweep angle and the total sweep time are identical. Variation of the kinematics results in a similar thrust between the two mechanisms, but a greater power is required for clapping. Variation of the flexibility results in a consistent decrease in the required power for clapping {{and a decrease in}} thrust at high flexibility. Variation of the duty cycle for clapping rigid plates results in a significant increase in thrust and a significant decrease in the required power. Overall, the results suggest that flapping propulsion is the more effective propulsion mechanism within the range of Reynolds numbers tested...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{immersed}} boundary method {{is applied to}} simulate incompressible turbulent flows around stationary and moving objects. The goal is {{to demonstrate that the}} immersed boundary technique along with a large eddy simulation approach is capable of simulating the effect of the so-called leading edge vortex (LEV), which can be found in flapping wing aerodynamics. A Lagrangian method is used to approximatethe solutions in the freshly cleared cells that lay within solid objects at one time step and emerge into fluid domain at the next time step. Flow around a stationary cylinder at ReD D 20, 40, and 3900 (based oncylinder diameter D) is first studied to validate the immersed boundary solver based on the finite volume scheme using a staggered grid. Then, a harmonically oscillating cylinder at ReD D 10 000 is considered to test the solver after the Lagrangian method is implemented to interpolate the solution in the freshly cleared cells. Finally, this approach is used to study flows around a stationary flat-plate at several angles of attack and fast pitching flat-plate. The rapidly <b>pitching</b> <b>plate</b> creates a dynamic LEV {{that can be used to}} improve the efficiency of flapping wings of micro air vehicle and to determine the optimum flapping frequency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{resistance}} {{to a change in}} wing shape due to the aerodynamic forces. In particular, the work required by an airfoil to overcome the aerodynamic forces and produce a change in lift is examined. The relationship between this work and the total aerodynamic energy balance is shown to have significant consequences for transient changes in airfoil shape. Specification of the placement of the actuators and the actuator energetics is shown to be required for the determination of the airfoil shape change requiring minimum energy input. A general, simplified actuator model is adopted in this study which assigns different values of actuator efficiency for negative and positive power output. Unsteady thin airfoil theory is used to analytically determine the pressure distribution and aerodynamic coefficients as a function of time for a ramp input of control deflection. This allows the required power and work to overcome the aerodynamic forces to be determined for a prescribed change in the airfoil camberline. The energy required for a <b>pitching</b> flat <b>plate,</b> conventional flap, conformal flap, and two variable camber configurations is investigated. For the <b>pitching</b> flat <b>plate,</b> the minimum energy pitching axis is shown to be dependent on the pitch rate and the initial angle of attack. The conformal flap is shown to require les...|$|R
