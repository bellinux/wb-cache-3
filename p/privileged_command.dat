Collected data is stored to a PostgreSQL database. If Cisco Discovery Protocol, Link Layer Discovery Protocol, Foundry Discovery Protocol or SynOptics Network Management Protocol is available, discovery of the network topology is mostly automatic. In case the above-mentioned protocols are not enabled (for example due to incompatibilities between the network devices or for security reasons) the topology can be defined manually. A record is maintained of the IP addresses and ports each node has used.|$|E

OSCAL is {{a useful}} online library that helps {{students}} trying to learn Operating system concepts and AICAL is a similar online library with Artificial Intelligence concepts. Both these libraries offer graphical animations of operating system and artificial intelligence concepts. The new concepts that are being added to OSCAL are Buffer Overflow Attack and Access Control Matrix Implementation. The new concept being added to AICAL is Adversarial search technique using Minimax Algorithm and an Evaluation Function for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Adversarial search is finding the best next move for Max in a two-player game, where Max represents the agent. The problem domain used to apply this search is the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a 3 * 3 board. The Minimax Algorithm is used {{to find the best}} move by employing a depth first search where all possible moves of Max are explored. Hence, {{in order to reduce the}} computation and size of game tree, an Evaluation function is used. The game tree during the course of the game and how the evaluation function is applied, is graphically explained in this applet. Buffer Overflow occurs when a program???s input is not bounded, that is, the program while writing data to the buffer, overruns the allotted space of the buffer and starts to write to the adjacent memory. This security attack is based on memory violation. Buffer overflow attack is aimed at gaining control of the attacked program, or results in a root shell or other <b>privileged</b> <b>command</b> execution. To achieve this, the attacker must first arrange for suitable code to be available in the program???s address space and then get the program to jump to that code, with suitable parameters loaded into registers and memory. In this applet, we demonstrate how the stack is initialized with local parameters, frame pointer and return address and then how the buffer overflows and the return address is manipulated to gain control of the program. Access Control Matrix represents how access rights of different objects are enforced and implemented. The rows in the access matrix represent different domains such as different users and columns represent different objects such as files or printers. An access control matrix consists of access rights such as read, write, execute, owner, etc. Domains can also be added as objects in the access matrix to control domain switching, that is, when a process switches from one domain to another. This applet demonstrates the implementation of the Access Matrix and, addition and modification of access rights. The applets are being developed in JAVA using Eclipse IDE. Computer Scienc...|$|E

The innermost ring has hardware privilege and applications, including <b>privileged</b> <b>commands,</b> {{run in the}} outermost. The inner three rings constitute the kernel. Software in an outer ring is prevented from tampering with software in an inner ring. The kernel is part of every process’s address space and is needed by both normal and privileged processes.|$|R
50|$|Rooting lets all user-installed {{applications}} run <b>privileged</b> <b>commands</b> typically {{unavailable to}} the devices {{in the stock}} configuration. Rooting is required for more advanced and potentially dangerous operations including modifying or deleting system files, removing pre-installed applications, and low-level access to the hardware itself (rebooting, controlling status lights, or recalibrating touch inputs.) A typical rooting installation also installs the Superuser application, which supervises applications that are granted root or superuser rights by requesting approval from the user before granting said permissions. A secondary operation, unlocking the device's bootloader verification, is required to remove or replace the installed operating system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{virtualization}} {{of resources}} in SMP machines with Xen offers automatic round-robin based coarse-grain assignment of VMs to physical processors and manual assignment via <b>privileged</b> <b>commands.</b> However, two problems can arise in Grid environments: (1) if Xen’s sEDF scheduler assigns the VMs, then some processors could be over or under-utilized and the VMs could receive more resources than specified, and (2) manual assignment is not feasible in a dynamic environment and also requires {{being aware of}} each node’s heterogeneity. Our approach proposes an enhanced fine-grain assignment of SMP’s virtualized resources for Grid environments {{by means of a}} local resource manager (LRM). We have developed a prototype which adds a partitioning layer of subsets of physical resources. Our experimental results show that our approach achieves a flexible assignment of resources. At the same time, due to the fine-grain access, a more efficient resource assignment is achieved compared to the original mechanism. Key words: Resource provisioning, local resource manager, virtual ma-chine. ...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{components}} of the system, including user programs, CLSs, and subroutines loaded in shared virtual memory, can be debugged and new versions of many can be installed while the system is running without requiring a system shutdown. It is possible to substitute a private copy of all components except the supervisor and parts of some job programs. A [...] "test" [...] version of the MTS job program (TMTS) is available to allow testing in the regular production environment. SWAT is an interface that allows the Symbolic Debugging System, which is normally used to debug user programs, {{to be used to}} debug MTS. [...] $PEEK is a <b>privileged</b> MTS <b>command</b> that uses Program Event Recording (PER) and other facilities to facilitate debugging one job program from another. Components that cannot be debugged in this way can be debugged by running in an MTS virtual machine (a user program).|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of eunuchs were also {{acquired}} by the slave traders in the southern parts of Ethiopia. Mainly consisting of young children, they led the most <b>privileged</b> lives and <b>commanded</b> the highest prices in the Islamic global markets because of their rarity. They served in the harems of the affluent or guarded holy sites. Some of the young boys had become eunuchs due to the battle traditions that were at the time endemic to parts of southern Ethiopia. However, the majority came from the Badi Folia principality in the Jimma region, situated to the southeast of Enarea. The local Oromo/Galla rulers were so disturbed by the custom that they drove out of their kingdoms all who practiced it.|$|R
