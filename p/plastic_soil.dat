Existing models for the wave-induced seabed response around breakwater heads have been limited to poro-elastic soil behavior and de-coupled oscillatory and residual mechanisms for the rise in excess pore water pressure. To overcome the shortcoming of the existing models, in this study a new three-dimensional poro-elastoplastic model is established, in which both oscillatory and residual mechanisms can be simulated simultaneously. The reduced cases of the proposed model are verified with existing 2 D experimental data available and a 3 D poro-elastic analytical solution in front of a breakwater.

40|$|An {{analytical}} and numerical investigation is {{conducted for the}} seismic response of earth retaining structures. The investigation consists of a two-level approach. In the first level, a fundamental understanding of soil-wall interaction is gained by developing a complete analytical solution to obtain the seismic load behind a wall with an elastic backfill. In the second level, the seismic force on the wall is obtained from numerical simulations using a non-linear <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> model developed for this research. ^ A complete analytical elastic solution is proposed for the seismic response of a wall that can bend, translate horizontally and rotate about its base. Comparisons between predictions from the analytical solution and those obtained from numerical analyses show that the analytical solution provides results {{that are similar to}} those from the numerical model. In addition a series of numerical analyses are performed to identify key parameters that affect the seismic response of a retaining wall. The identified parameters are: (1) seismic input motion; (2) flexural stiffness, rotation and translation of the wall; and (3) type of the interface between the wall and the backfill such as high or low frictional or fixed interfaces. ^ A three-dimensional cyclic non-linear <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> model is developed to investigate the effect of elasto-plastic response of soils on the seismic earth pressures. The soil model includes the pressure-dependence of the initial stiffness of the soil and its evolution with strain, as well as a yield criterion that is represented by the Drucker-Prager formulation. Results from the soil model are compared with those from five laboratory tests performed on diverse soils under different loading conditions. In addition the model is evaluated by comparing its predictions from laboratory tests on small-scale wall tests conducted by Koseki et al. (1998) and Watanabe et al. (2003). The comparisons indicate that: (1) the results from the numerical model agree with the laboratory measurements; (2) multiple failure surfaces may form in the backfill at high seismic loads; (3) vertical failure surfaces are observed behind a cantilever wall, which may limit the volume of the soil driving the loading; (4) sliding of the wall results in a significant reduction of the seismic force; and (5) the Mononobe-Okabe method overestimates forces at high seismic loads. ^ A parametric numerical analysis using the cyclic non-linear <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> model shows that the seismic forces on a retaining wall that is built on a stiff foundation depend, to a large extent, on the flexural relative flexibility of the wall to the backfill (dB) and on the type of interface between wall and foundation. If the foundation is soft, the seismic forces are much less affected by dB and type of interface, and are much smaller than those for a wall on a stiff soil foundation. A comparison between the elastic analytical solution and the non-linear <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> model suggest that: (1) the analytical solution may be used to estimate the seismic force acting on a wall built on a soft foundation (V sF≤ 300 m/s); (2) the analytical solution may underestimate the seismic force on a wall resting on a stiff foundation, if the wall does not slide; if the wall slides, then the analytical solution gives a reasonable estimate of the seismic force. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{existence}} of expansive soils {{in the study}} area that undergo swelling and shrinkage when subjected to moisture variations has caused major deterioration and distresses on lightweight construction such as shallowly founded structures ad roads founded on them. Unfortunately, the treatment of these highly <b>plastic</b> clay <b>soils</b> has attracted minimal attention despite the damages they are able to induce. Stabilization of highly <b>plastic</b> clay <b>soils</b> with lime or cement alone is generally not satisfactory. While significant increase in workability and adequate strength can be achieved by lime treatment, the process is characterised by brittleness. On the other hand, soil treatment with cement alone can somehow increase strength but with the danger of leaving pockets of uncemented material in the modified mass. Therefore, substantial increase in both unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and tensile-split strength can be achieved through a two sequential mixing operation whereby soil brittleness is reduced by providing smaller loss of post-peak strength. The operation is carried out by firstly treating the soil with lime, leaving it to mellow for some hours to ensure adequate workability and then secondly treating it with cement to obtain lime-cement treated soil with adequate strength and durability. The analysis of test results of the two sequential lime-cement treated soils showed markedly improvement in the unconfined compressive strength at a large strain when highly <b>plastic</b> <b>soils</b> were first treated with lime followed with cement treatment. This indicates that the use of two-sequential lime-cement soil stabilization is the cost effective techniques that effectively improves the engineering properties of expansive problematic soils...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{developing}} an improved thermo-mechanical soil-structure interaction (i. e., load transfer) analysis {{to assess the}} axial strains, stresses, and displacements during thermo-mechanical loading of energy piles in different soils having different end restraint boundary conditions. This study builds on established analyses by (i) incorporating an algorithm to identify {{the location of the}} point of zero displacement (i. e., the null point) during changes in temperature, (ii) adding models for the ultimate side shear resistance representative of drained and undrained soils, and (iii) incorporating an unloading path for the side shear resistance curve. A parametric evaluation was performed to understand the roles of the soil shear strength parameters, toe stiffness, head stiffness, side shear stress-displacement curve, and radial expansion, as well as the foundation type, mechanical load magnitude, and temperature change magnitude. This investigation showed that the end restraint boundary conditions played the most important role in controlling the magnitude and location of the maximum thermal axial stress. The soil type also caused changes in the nonlinearity of the axial stress distribution throughout the energy pile.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of electronic digital calculating {{machines in the}} last decade or two has {{led to the development of}} mathematical models of pile foundations. These models are able to overcome many hitherto intractable analytical problems in pile-soil interaction studies, through the use of numerical methods possible only with the computer. These models fall into two classes; those dealing with an elastic system of both pile and soil, with modifications to allow some non-linear pile-soil interaction, and those using only empirical measured values of soil response, thus permitting full non-linear treatment. The first class of models allows the action of the entire soil-pile system to be taken into account. The second, though better coping with the true non-linear behaviour of the pile-soil system, considers only the effects immediately adjacent to the pile. This thesis presents a new model that incorporates the approaches of each class, thus being a completely non-linear model that accounts for the total behaviour of the soil-mass system. Part I of the thesis is concerned with the development of the model. The pile is considered as a series of elastic elements contained in an elastic soil, but between the soil and the pile a layer of soil with plastic properties is assumed. On the pile sides the layer is thin; below the pile a <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> element of finite length and the same section as the pile allows a non-linear base response. The properties of these <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> regions are determined from empirical soil tests in situ or in the laboratory. The behaviour of the semi-infinite elastic soil mass outside the <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> region is accounted for by the use of equations developed by R. D. Mindlin in 1936. A large section of the first part of the thesis is devoted to a discussion of the Mindlin equations and the solution of singularities that arise in their use. The second part of the thesis first compares the model pile results with field tests for which the relevant model input information is also available. Reasonable agreement between model and test results is demonstrated, although there is clearly a scarcity of the information required for input to the model. The thesis then presents a series of studies on typical, arbitrary piles in a variety of soil types, although the general characteristics of the soils considered are those of clay soils. Characteristics typical of piles of a particular type and in soils of a particular type are considered, in the hope of identifying characteristics typical of such piles or soils in the field. Characteristics identified from the load-settlement curve of the pile top are particularly considered, since many such curves are produced daily in the construction industry. Certain trends in the shape of these load-settlement curves are discerned, but no positive unique characteristic of any one soil or pile type has been found. It appears that the pile load-settlement curve with a marked peak, or change in slope, is typical of the friction pile, with the peak corresponding to development of maximum pile side friction. However the trend is not as yet certain enough to be of practical use. It is concluded that the model is valid, but requires a large reserve of information about soil plastic properties and to a lesser extent elastic properties before substantial use of the model can be made. However it appears that much of this reserve of information can be found from existing tests commonly performed, in particular the conventional shear box test. The movements associated with peak shear in this test are the values required for the assumed model <b>plastic</b> <b>soil</b> properties; such movements though often recorded are rarely published and so this information is lost. A technique is suggested at the end of the thesis for adapting the model to forecast the results of cyclic loading tests. Though of little design value such a model, if accurate, would clearly be reliable for use in general design procedures...|$|E

The main design criteria against which performance is assessed are a criterion for retention of fine particles. The characteristic size of finer fraction influences the size distribution of the filter pore and hence the retention capacity of flowing particles, and the permeability of the filter itself. This paper reports experimental results obtained on the soil-filter system behaviour subject to different hydraulic and geometrical conditions. Many core soils and filters were used. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of the filter to protect the silt submitted to erosion under controlled water flow. Particles transport and filtration through each granular filter were analysed as regards to filter retention capacity and particles size selection. The plasticity of base soil influences greatly the filtration since slightly <b>plastic</b> <b>soils</b> are more erodible than <b>plastic</b> <b>soils.</b> The analysis of hydraulic conductivity in the filter is of a great concern and leads to understand the filtration process. A comparison of the efficiency of the filters is assessed toward the usual required criteria and the most appropriate for the dam filters. Matching experimental results with filter design criteria reveals that many of them are conservative. The filter porosity variation was assessed and correlated with clogging particles volume. The evolution of such parameter may be an indicator of likely filter clogging. A new approach of filter clogging was proposed by evaluating a damage index which is affected by various parameters such as the ratio D 15 /d 85 and the size of eroded particles. An approach linking the geometrical parameters (damage index) to the hydraulic conductivity leads to an estimation of the filter performance which provides an interesting and realistic criterion...|$|R
