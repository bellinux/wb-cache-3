40|$|The {{extent to}} which very short peak widths, peak frequency, {{sampling}} time and post-sampling/pre-capping time impact upon occupational exposure measurements of toluene has been investigated using Perkin-Elmer diffusive tubes. Real-time instruments (photoionisation detectors - PIDs) were also used to study {{the effect of the}} width of the peak on the estimation of peak maximum concentration and TWA concentration (peak area). A purpose built apparatus was used to perform the tests, comparing diffusive tubes with reference pumped sorbent tubes and five types of <b>photoionisation</b> <b>detector</b> having different response times. The experimental data from the PIDs was modelled theoreticallyFM/ 02 / 02 (from title page) SIGLEAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC: 4274. 8537 (2002 / 07) / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an analytical procedure developed {{in order to}} monitor specific volatile organic compounds (VOC) causing olfactive nuisances in the environment of a landfill site. 1 -Methyl- 4 -iso-propenyl- 1 -cycolohexene (limonene) and 1 -methyl- 4 -iso-propyl-benzene (p-cymene) detected by GC-MS in the landfill gas emissions were considered as tracers of the malodour. An on-line analytical system including a gas chromatograph coupled with a <b>photoionisation</b> <b>detector</b> was installed 'on-site' to detect these markers at μg/m 3 level in the atmosphere after pumping up the ambient air at close intervals. Quantitative results of the semi-continuous monitoring were strongly correlated with olfactive nuisances reported {{in the vicinity of}} the source. The chemical characterisation of odorous organic tracers and their 'on-site' monitoring was shown to be a useful technique to detect malfunctions in the bio-gas collecting facilities and to prevent air pollution and olfactive nuisances in the environment.

40|$|A <b>photoionisation</b> <b>detector</b> (PID) was {{coupled to}} packed-capillary liquid and supercritical-fluid {{chromatography}} to study its performance. Several mobile phases were tested {{to evaluate the}} potential of liquid chromatography with photoionisation detection, LC-PID. The behaviour of the PID was {{not as good as}} in gas chromatography (GC), due to the absorption of photons by the mobile phase vapour. Therefore, the minimum detection limits (MDLs) were high compared to those in GC-PID, being at the low nanogram level for, e. g., ketones, aldehydes and amides. Coupling of the PID with supercritical-fluid chromatography (SFC) using modified carbon dioxide gave more satisfactory results. For aromatic compounds like phenanthrene and pyrene MDLs were found to be 12 and 20 pg, respectively. These values were almost the same as found in GC-PID. Separation and detection of aliphatic C 4 -Q 3 carboxylic acids and some organosulphur/phosphorus pesticides (disulfoton, ethion and sulfotepp) showed the possibility to detect several classes of compounds at the low nanogram level using methanol-modified carbon dioxide. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

40|$|A {{nanoscale}} ioniser {{is presented}} exceeding {{the limitation of}} conventional <b>photoionisation</b> <b>detectors.</b> It employs accelerated photoelectrons that allow obtaining molecule specificity by the tuning of ionisation energies. The material lanthanum hexaboride (LaB 6) is used as air stable photo cathode. Thin films of that material deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) show quantum efficiency (QE) {{in the range of}} 10 (- 5) which is comparable to laser photo stimulation results. A careful treatment of the material yields reasonable low work functions even after surface reoxidation which opens up the possibility of using ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs) in replacement of discharge lamps.

40|$|Abstract: Occupational {{exposure}} to toxic chemicals such as Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) from diesel engine exhaust implicates genotoxic risk. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the DNA damage among KL Sentral depot workers exposed to TVOC by means of cytogenetic analysis. Data were obtained partially from disseminated questionnaires and buccal cells samples were collected from a total of 27 depot workers and 10 office workers by using wooden tongue depressor. TVOC measurement was carried out by using <b>Photoionisation</b> <b>Detector</b> (PID). 4 sampling points were selected, namely Locomotive (LOCO), Power Generating Car (PGC), refuelling of diesel and coach. Cytogenetic analysis was done by using Acridine Orange (AO) staining. Micronucleus (MN) frequency as a biomarker for DNA damage was scored from 1, 000 cells per sample observed under fluorescence microscope. The results showed that the overall means of concentrations for TVOC were 0. 1 ± 0. 1, 0. 0 ± 0. 0, 0. 1 ± 0. 0 and 0. 1 ± 0. 0 in LOCO, PGC, refuelling of diesel an...|$|E
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOC’s) {{have a variety}} of negative impacts on human health (Harold, 1998; Barbara et al, 2007), some (e. g. benzene and formaldehyde,) are known to be human carcinogens (IARC, 2004). There is, therefore, often a pressing requirement to monitor these compounds. However, monitoring these compounds is not straightforward as their concentrations vary with environmental parameters such as temperature, barometric pressure and groundwater movement. Because of this, the sampling frequency that is used at present is ineffective for determining their representative concentration; therefore, a device which can be left in-situ to collect high temporal resolution data has been developed (Gasclam, Ionscience, UK). VOC’s are measured by <b>Photoionisation</b> <b>detector</b> (PID), however; PID measures aggregated VOC concentration. Because VOC’s have differing toxicities and behaviours, individual identification is required, therefore, a sample must be collected. In order to do this, a sorbent material must be used to transfer the sample to the GC-MS for identification. The sorbent material must be appropriate for the range of VOC’s and of sufficient capacity for extended exposure (BS EN ISO 16017 - 1 : 2001). To solve these problems, an optimum VOC monitoring methodology known as dual measurement VOC monitoring has been developed following the incorporation of a suitable sorbent into the latest in-borehole monitoring device, th...|$|E
40|$|Single strand {{breaks in}} DNA were {{monitored}} in leucocytes from 17 men occupationally exposed to styrene. Personal air monitoring {{was carried out}} during one workday with two diffusion samplers and a portable <b>photoionisation</b> <b>detector</b> placed in the breathing zone. Exposure to styrene was also monitored by analysing styrene in blood and urine and mandelic acid in urine. Single strand breaks were measured in leucocytes by the alkaline elution technique. The biological samples were collected before a shift, {{at the end of}} a shift, and the next morning, before the next shift. An exposure dependent increase in single strand breaks was seen {{at the end of a}} shift but not before a shift or the next morning. Linear regression analysis indicated that the amount of DNA damage was roughly doubled after eight hours of exposure to 18 ppm styrene or at a urine concentration of 240 mg mandelic acid/g creatinine compared with the damage in non-exposed men. This study indicates that monitoring of single strand breaks with the alkaline elution technique may be a sensitive marker of genotoxic effects. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a marker has been shown to correlate with exposure to less than 20 ppm styrene...|$|E
