It is thus named for being both the one written authority (codex) secondary (only) to the Tanakh as a basis for the <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> <b>a</b> source and a tool for creating laws, and the first of many books to complement the Tanakh in certain aspects.|$|R

By his own native capacity, alike unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities. An able theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his practice, he was not without the power <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> <b>an</b> adequate <b>judgment</b> in matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine, whether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness of his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have surpassed all others in the faculty <b>of</b> intuitively meeting <b>an</b> emergency." ...|$|R

5000|$|Per incuriam, {{literally}} {{translated as}} [...] "through lack of care", refers to <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> court {{which has been}} decided without reference to a statutory provision or earlier judgment {{which would have been}} relevant.

Ordinarily, in the common law, the rationes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> must be followed thereafter by lower courts hearing similar cases. A lower court is free, however, to depart from <b>an</b> earlier <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superior court where that earlier judgment was decided per incuriam.|$|R
40|$|Temporality {{is one of}} {{the tools}} {{enabling}} courts to deal with the consequences <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment.</b> The present paper focuses on the special case of temporality in judicial review type judgments, ie the doctrine of temporal limitation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> by the Court of Justice of the EU in the procedure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> preliminary ruling. Although the primary goal of the doctrine was to avoid harsh consequences in cases determined by the conventional retroactive application <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment,</b> the doctrine has created its own costs. The paper is an attempt to discuss the arguments of the Court from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>a</b> consequences-based argumentation regarding the temporal effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> preliminary ruling.
