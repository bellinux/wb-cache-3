40|$|Guided waves {{inspection}} is {{a well-established}} method for the long-range ultrasonic inspection of <b>pipes.</b> <b>Guided</b> waves, {{used in a}} pulse-echo arrangement, can inspect a large range of the pipe from a single point as the pipe structure carries the waves over a large distance due to the relatively low attenuation of the wave modes. However, {{the complexity of the}} dispersion characteristics of these <b>pipe</b> <b>guided</b> wave modes are well known, and can lead to difficulty interpreting the obtained results. The torsional family of guided wave modes are generally considered to have much simpler dispersion characteristics; especially the fundamental T(0, 1) mode, which is nominally non-dispersive, making it particularly useful for guided wave inspection. Torsional waves have been generated by a circumferential ring of transducers to approximate an axi-symmetric load to excite this T(0, 1) mode. Presented here is a new design of EMAT that can generate a T(0, 1) as a single transducer, rather than a circumferential array of transducers that all need to be excited in order to generate an axisymmetric force. The EMAT consists of a periodic permanent magnet array and a single meander coil, meaning that the excitation of the torsional mode is greatly simplified. The design parameters of this new EMAT are explored, and the ability to detect notch defects on a pipe is demonstrated...|$|R

Guided wave ultrasonic modes propagating over long distances {{can be applied}} to NDT for long structures such as plates, rods and <b>pipes.</b> <b>Guided</b> waves have a dispersion property, which represents dependence of propagation velocities on frequencies. Therefore, for effective use of guided waves, we need to know this property, which is usually expressed as dispersion curves [1]~[3]. The goal {{of this paper is to}} numerically investigate effects of curvatures on the dispersion property of guided waves propagating in a helical structure and a curved plate by a semi-analytical finite element method (SAFE) [4]~[6]. A helical structure is regarded as cylinder with curvatures and torsions, and a curved plate is regarded as a flat plate with curvatures. Thus, the authors investigated how dispersion properties of fundamental modes change as the curvature increases.

A steel pipe with holes is detected by guided wave and the measured signal is decomposed and reconstructed by MSP. The matched result is compared to the process result from MP with DEA. The SNR of the processed signal is improved obviously, and the defect echo can be identified easily. The matched parameters get by MSP and MP are compared and analyzed. The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) of the detection signal and its matched result are computed and compared. The WVD of the detection signal is enhanced after processed by MSP. The defect locations and the center frequency of the excitation signal are more exactly get from MSP than from MP. The computation time by MSP is a little longer than by MP.

Also, producing a condition monitoring system for buried pipelines is challenging. Small pipes (with diameters less than 50 mm) are considered here as most of the literature focuses on larger <b>pipes.</b> <b>Guided</b> wave theory will be introduced alongside a numerical simulation of the relevant dispersion curves of the system. This paper investigates the feasibility of using torsional guided waves for inspecting defects in buried pipes with small diameters. The pipes are assumed to be lossless and hence the effect of attenuation is ignored in the calculations. Upon finding the theoretical guided wave characteristics, experiments were conducted to see if the aim could be achieved in a realistic scenario. A steel pipe with a diameter of 34 mm and wall thickness of 5. 5 mm is considered. High reverberation levels at high frequency propagations due to mode conversion are studied.

In case of bottom of the line corrosion, i. e., a single corrosion pit, a simpler approach may be followed. Data is collected in a pitch-catch configuration at the 12 o'clock position using highly dispersive guided waves. After dispersion correction the data collapses to a short pulse, any residual dispersion indicates wall loss. The phase spectrum is used to invert for the wall thickness profile in the circumferential direction, assuming a Gaussian defect profile. The approach is evaluated on numerically simulated and on measured data. The method is intended for rapid, semi-quantitative screening of pipes...|$|R

In this paper, the characteristic of guided waves propagation in pipes that L(0, 1) and L(0, 2) have a cutoff frequency are respectively discussed, and the calculation formulas of their cutoff frequency are given. The varied relationship between the cutoff frequency of L(0, 1) and L(0, 2) mode guide waves, the outer diameter and wall thickness of pipes are discussed, respectively. For a given steel pipe, experiments are carried out by selection of different exciting frequency. The results show that the “low-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 1) and “high-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 2) are reduced with increasing of outer diameter of pipes, and the “low-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 1) and “high-pass ” type cutoff frequency of L(0, 2) are initially increased with increasing of wall thickness of pipes, but the increased amplitude is slowly changed a little.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work is to find an apposite non-destructive technique to identify defects in soil embedded <b>pipes</b> using Cylindrical <b>Guided</b> Waves. These waves can propagate a long distance through the walls of cylindrical <b>pipes</b> as <b>guided</b> waves and are sensitive to defects along their path of propagation. The traditional ultrasonic methods are good for detecting relatively large voids or defects (compared to signal wave lengths) but are not very efficient in detecting small defects. Cylindrical guided waves are sensitive to small defects. In transmission pipelines, most of the pipes are buried in soil or have protective surface coatings. In addition, flow through the pipes has to be stopped while using conventional non-destructive testing. One of the foremost objectives of this research work is to find an appropriate guided wave technique to detect defects without hampering the flow through the pipes. This research investigates how the propagation of leaky cylindrical guided waves {{are affected by the}} presence of surrounding soil when the pipes are embedded in the soil. In this research work, Continuous Wavelet Transform and Gabor Transforms are used along with Fast Fourier transforms as signal processing tools to analyze the signals and to detect and locate defects in pipes.
