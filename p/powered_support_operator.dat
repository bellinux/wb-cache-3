The <b>support</b> <b>operator</b> method first constructs discrete divergence operator from the divergence theorem and then constructs discrete gradient operator as the adjoint operator of the divergence.

Developed method is exact for linear solution and has second order convergence rate. It is working well for discontinuous diffusion coefficient and very rough or very distorted grids which appear quite often e. ~g. in Lagrangian simulations. Being formulated on the unstructured grid the method can be used on the region of arbitrary geometry shape. Numerical results confirm these properties of the developed method...|$|R

We design the work knowledge acquired from skilled people and manuals as a work flow, rule base, goal tree, domain ontologies and RDF data. Workers follow work process by referring to the work flow, referring to multimedia, and receiving answers from the question-answering module incorporated with a knowledge base for questions that are raised during the work.

Conventionally, STATCOMs are employed for reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> only. However, with {{the integration of}} energy storage (ES) into a STATCOM, it can provide active <b>power</b> <b>support</b> {{in addition to the}} reactive <b>power</b> <b>support.</b> The control method of a STATCOM with an energy storage device is discussed in this paper. To determine the switching level control, SPWM (Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation) methods is used. This paper will introduce an integrated STATCOM/BESS for the improvement of dynamic and transient stability and transmission capability. This work suggests a simple and easy to implement PI controller to control the operation of ESTATCOM placed at the weak point of Mosul city 132 kV ring system. The whole system including the ESTATCOM and its controller has been simulated after some kinds of disturbances and the results show improvements in the dynamic active and reactive power capabilities of the system...|$|R

The outcomes of an industry sponsored (ACARP) research project on the geotechnical issues associated with conventional longwall recoveries is presented with updates the experiences gained. A number of critical features of the geotechnical environment, support design and mining geometry have a pronounced impact on ground control during take-off. A model of roof behaviour at the take-off point has been developed and validated. Key geotechnical issues include low roof competency (ie weak roof), an adverse weighting environment, geological structure and horizontal stress concentrations at the gate ends (generally the maingate). All of these are identifiable either at the support design stage or, at worst, {{prior to the start}} of <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> removal, which is the critical stage of the take-off process. Key aspects of the geometry and process are the ability to maintain <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> resistance during bolt-up and take-off, the direction in which the <b>powered</b> <b>supports</b> are removed, the impact of take-off chutes and the speed of the <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> removal process.
