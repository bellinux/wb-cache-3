40|$|Key Words heavy metals, detoxification, homeostasis, {{phytochelatin}} synthase n Abstract Among {{the heavy}} metal-binding ligands in plant cells the phytochelatins (<b>PCs)</b> <b>and</b> metallothioneins (MTs) {{are the best}} characterized. <b>PCs</b> <b>and</b> MTs are different classes of cysteine-rich, heavy metal-binding protein molecules. PCs are enzymatically synthesized peptides, whereas MTs are gene-encoded polypeptides. Recently, genes encoding the enzyme PC synthase {{have been identified in}} plants and other species while the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence has allowed the identification of the entire suite of MT genes in a higher plant. Recent advances in understanding the regulation of <b>PC</b> biosynthesis <b>and</b> MT gene expression and the possible roles of <b>PCs</b> <b>and</b> MTs in heavy metal detoxification and homeostasis are reviewed...|$|R

40|$|Short-term (less than 2 h) glucose {{stimulation}} of isolated pancreatic islets specifically increases the biosynthesis of proinsulin and its converting enzymes <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 at the translation level. To determine whether gene expression of <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 was also regulated by longer-term (more than 6 h) glucose stimulation {{along with that}} of preproinsulin, studies were performed with the beta TC 3 insulin-producing cell line. By Northern blot analysis, glucose maintained <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 mRNA levels in parallel with those of preproinsulin. After 48 h, mRNA levels of preproinsulin, <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 were, respectively, 2. 9 (P < 0. 05), 3. 0 (P < 0. 005) and 5. 3 (P < 0. 001) times greater {{in the presence of}} glucose than in beta TC 3 cells cultured in the absence of glucose. Glucose-regulated <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 gene expression, like that of preproinsulin, was maximal at glucose concentrations above 5. 5 mM. Studies of mRNA stability showed that the half-lives of PC 2 (9 h) <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 (5 h) mRNA were much shorter than that of preproinsulin mRNA (over 24 h), but little effect of glucose on stability of these mRNAs was observed. Nuclear run-off analysis indicated that transcription of preproinsulin, <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 was modestly induced after 1 h exposure to 16. 7 mM glucose. Therefore preproinsulin, <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 mRNA levels in beta TC 3 cells were most probably maintained at the level of gene transcription. In contrast, elevation of cyclic AMP by forskolin had no effect on mRNA levels or gene transcription of preproinsulin, <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3, despite a cyclic-AMP-induced phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein that correlated with a marked increase in cJun and cFos gene transcription in the same beta-cells. These results suggest that preproinsulin, <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 gene transcription can be specifically glucose-regulated in a mechanism that is unlikely to involve a key role for cyclic AMP. The co-ordinate increase in <b>PC</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>PC</b> 3 mRNA levels with that of preproinsulin mRNA in response to chronic glucose represents a long-term means of catering for an increased demand on proinsulin conversion...|$|R
