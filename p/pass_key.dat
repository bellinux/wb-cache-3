25|$|The 1986 Corvette saw the {{reintroduction}} of {{the convertible}} {{and was named}} as the Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500. 1986 also saw {{the introduction of the}} <b>Pass</b> <b>Key</b> I passive anti-theft system, wherein each key contained a special pellet that could be detected and identified by the car's computer system by detecting electrical resistance. Being early in the rollout of this new technology, there were only 15 different resistance values available, which, once thieves discovered this weakness, markedly reduced the value of this early system.|$|E
500|$|After having {{completed}} the 24-reel cut of Greed, von Stroheim told Goldwyn executives {{that he could}} not cut another frame. Goldwyn producers thought that this version was still too long and told him to cut it to a more manageable length. Von Stroheim then sent the film to his friend, director Rex Ingram, who turned it over to his editor, Grant Whytock. Whytock had worked with von Stroheim on The Devil's <b>Pass</b> <b>Key</b> and was familiar with the director's style and tastes. Whytock initially proposed that it be split in two, with one 8-reel film ending with the wedding and a second 7-reel film ending at Death Valley. Whytock eventually cut the film down to 18 reels. His only major cut was the entire subplot of Zerkow and Maria, which he thought was [...] "very distasteful". Otherwise he simply cut down scenes and cut out [...] of quick [...] "flash" [...] shots that only lasted a few frames. However, Whytock's version of Greed retained the prologue and other subplots, as well as much of the humor that was later cut out of it.|$|E

2500|$|To {{achieve the}} {{required}} density LCC architects favoured tower blocks set in green space {{as can be}} seen in the neighbouring Silchester Estate, the Clifford Wearden & Associates architects propose a solution of densely packed low-rise apartments with landscaped greenspace. The [...] finger block was seen as a tower block laid on its side- instead of lifts and service shafts there was the internal walkway. [...] It was intended to keep the housing as compact as possible thus freeing up more green space in between. The units were of different sizes and slotted together like lego blocks. The finger blocks were built above garages on a deck, along the centre of the deck was a covered walkway, which provided the street in the sky. On either side of the street were flats and the stair columns that rose to the flats above. The flats themselves were grouped in blocks and projected, joining over the walkway. The finger blocks were very close to the annual disturbances in Notting Hill, and the walkways provided escape routes that the police were unable to control. In 1992, the finger blocks were refurbished and wall erected that segmented the walkways and required <b>pass</b> <b>key</b> access- destroying the original design concept and one of the finger blocks unique features.|$|E
6000|$|The {{two younger}} monks got up quickly, passed before the visitors, crossed a {{whitewashed}} anteroom, unlocked a solid door, then sprung {{it back in}} the face of oncoming Isabel. But despite the haste of a fleeing order she had {{caught a glimpse of the}} sacred garden beyond, and it did not occur to her disqualified judgment to regard herself as a natural temptation for carnal thoughts. She simply smiled at the rude opportunity enjoined by holiness. As she followed the [...] "brother" [...] in charge of the regulation tour for strangers, she kept wondering about the tall, handsome monk who had used a <b>pass</b> <b>key</b> on the spring lock of the oaken door.|$|E
60|$|As these {{reflections}} thronged on his mind, he {{had nearly}} {{reached the end}} of his journey, and, with the glee maiden still hanging on his cloak, exhausted, partly with fear, partly with fatigue, he at length arrived at the middle of the wynd, which was honoured with his own habitation, and from which, in the uncertainty that then attended the application of surnames, he derived one of his own appellatives. Here, on ordinary days, his furnace was seen to blaze, and four half stripped knaves stunned the neighbourhood with the clang of hammer and stithy. But St. Valentine's holiday was an excuse for these men of steel having shut the shop, and for the present being absent on their own errands of devotion or pleasure. The house which adjoined to the smithy called Henry its owner; and though it was small, and situated in a narrow street, yet, as there was a large garden with fruit trees behind it, it constituted upon the whole a pleasant dwelling. The smith, instead of knocking or calling, which would have drawn neighbours to doors and windows, drew out a <b>pass</b> <b>key</b> of his own fabrication, then a great and envied curiosity, and opening the door of his house, introduced his companion into his habitation.|$|E

60|$|It {{was late}} the {{following}} morning that a native houseman knocked upon {{the door of the}} room that had been assigned to Mrs. Billings and her grandson. Receiving no response he inserted his <b>pass</b> <b>key</b> in the lock, only to discover that another key was already there, but from the inside. He reported the fact to Herr Skopf, the proprietor, who at once {{made his way to the}} second floor where he, too, pounded vigorously upon the door. Receiving no reply he bent to the key hole in an attempt to look through into the room beyond. In so doing, being portly, he lost his balance, which necessitated putting a palm to the floor to maintain his equilibrium. As he did so he felt something soft and thick and wet beneath his fingers. He raised his open palm before his eyes in the dim light of the corridor and peered at it. Then he gave a little shudder, for even in the semi-darkness he saw a dark red stain upon his hand. Leaping to his feet he hurled his shoulder against the door. Herr Skopf is a heavy man--or at least he was then--I have not seen him for several years. The frail door collapsed beneath his weight, and Herr Skopf stumbled precipitately into the room beyond.|$|E
6000|$|When Father Barry {{reached the}} parsonage {{he found no}} use for a <b>pass</b> <b>key.</b> Pat Murphy, his {{faithful}} servant and acolyte, was watching for him just within the door. He drew the half-frozen priest across a small entry, to a large warmed apartment answering to-day as both study and dining-room. [...] "The rist of the house do be perishing," [...] the Irishman explained. The priest sank {{in front of a}} blazing coal fire, tossing his gloves to the table. He held his hands before the glow without comment. They were wonderful hands, denoting artistic temperament, but with fingers too pliant, too delicately slender for ascetic life. Philip Barry's hands seemed formed for luxury, and in accordance with their expression he had surrounded himself with both comfort and chaste beauty. In the large, low, old-fashioned room in which he sat there was no false note. Pictures, oriental rugs, richly carved chairs--all represented taste and expenditure, somewhat prejudicial to a priest's standing with his bishop. That the greater part of everything in the little house had arrived as a gift from some admiring parishioner but added to the aged superior's disapproval of esthetic influence. To-day Father Barry warmed his hands without the usual sense of comfortable home-coming. Pat Murphy observed that for once his master showed no interest in a row of flower boxes piled on the table.|$|E
