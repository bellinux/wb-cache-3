5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In pregnancy, women {{undergo a}} {{tremendous}} number of systemic and ocular changes. Physiological changes {{occur in the}} cardiovascular, hormonal, metabolic, hematologic and immunologic systems. Hormonal changes are among the most prominent systemic changes in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with the placenta, maternal endocrine glands and the fetal adrenal glands combining their productivity to make a high-powered hormone factory. Aims: To evaluate the various ocular changes taking place in pregnancy in women with no other co-morbid ocular or systemic diseases and to compare ocular changes in three trimesters of pregnancy with controls of non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Materials and Methods: The ocular changes occuring in varying stages of pregnancy in 225 <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were studied and compared with 75 healthy non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Results: Age was similar in the pregnant and non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> studied. Headache was significantly more common among <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> when compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Diplopia was not significantly different between pregnant and non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Intraocular pressure was significantly less among the <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> as compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Occurrence of conjunctival pigmentation was significantly more in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> when compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> There was no difference in corneal thickness when pregnant and non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were compared. Krukenberg's spindles were seen more commonly among <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> when compared to non <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Conclusion: Various ocular changes occur during a normal pregnancy. Knowledge of these changes can help to differentiate the physiological changes occurring in a normal pregnancy from ocular manifestation of systemic diseases.

5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between serum trace elements, antioxidant capacity index and hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP). Methods: Forty cases of normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> twenty-one <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with high blood pressure, twenty-eight <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with early stage of mild preeclampsia and twenty-two <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with early stage of severe preeclampsia were selected respectively. Then, the differences of blood routine examination and blood coagulation function of the four groups were compared. At the same time, the levels of the serum trace elements and oxidative stress related indexes in the placental villi tissue were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: The white blood cells and hematocrit of HDCP <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> {{were significantly higher than}} those of normal healthy pregnant women; platelet and fibrinogen levels were obviously lower than those of normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> while thrombin time was shorter than that of normal healthy pregnant women; levels of serum copper, zinc and manganese were also significantly lower than whose of normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> while iron level was distinctly higher than that of normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> The differences between groups were statistically significant. The activities of SOD and GSH-PX in the placental villi tissue of HDCP <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were significantly smaller than those of normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> while the Hcy level was higher than that of normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> The differences between groups were statistically significant.

5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem fetal extrusion were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the {{short amount of time}} elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman.</b> Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E

40|$|Background: Daily {{requirement}} of iodine increases during pregnancy making <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> a high-risk group for iodine deficiency disorders.

Methods: A sample of 73 <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> was studied over 28 weeks of gestation. The sample was divided into two groups: one comprising pre-eclamptic <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> (n= 32), and the other comprising healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> (n= 41). The SFCT was determined for all patients using EDI-OCT during pregnancy and at the third month of the postpartum period.

40|$|Pregnancy is {{a period}} {{characterized}} by a supraphysiological hormonal status, and greater anxiety proneness, {{which can lead to}} peripartum affective symptoms with dramatic consequences not only for the woman but also for the child. Clinical psychiatry is heavily hampered by the paucity of objective and biology-based intermediate phenotypes. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, a neurophysiological measure of sensorimotor gating, has been poorly investigated in relation to anxiety and in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> In the present study, the PPI of healthy non-pregnant women (n = 82) and late <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> (n = 217) was investigated. Age, BMI, depression and anxiety symptoms, tobacco use, and antidepressant medication were considered. We investigated and provided evidence of lower PPI: (i) in healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> compared to healthy non-pregnant controls, (ii) in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with anxiety disorders compared to healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> (iii) in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with anxiety disorders using SSRI compared to un-medicated <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with anxiety disorders, and (iv) in healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> carrying the COMT Val 158 Met Val/Val genotype compared to Met carriers. Altogether, a reduced sensorimotor gating as an effect of supraphysiological hormonal status, anxiety disorders, SSRIs, and catecholaminergic genotype, implicate the putative relevance of lower PPI as an objective biological correlate of anxiety proneness in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> These findings call for prospective studies to dissect the multifactorial influences on PPI in relation to mental health of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
