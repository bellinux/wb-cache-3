As a 4K video camera, it can be categorized as a pro-level video camera that can record in Cinema 4K mode (4096 x 2160) or standard 4K-UHD (3840 x 2160) using IPB compression in 100Mbit/s. In Full 1080p HD there are two options, 200Mbit/s in ALL-Intra compression, or 100Mbit/s with no recording time limit. The camera also provides [...]mov, mp4, AVCHD Progressive, and AVCHD video formats {{at a variety of}} frame rates according to the usage; and options for VFR (Variable Frame Rate) or Time Lapse/Stop Motion Animation without the need for <b>post-production</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E
40|$|Post-product studios which finalise {{the results}} of authorial {{audiovisual}} products {{are an important part}} of the media space. In this thesis, I am dealing with one of the phases of <b>post-production</b> film <b>processing</b> [...] the methodology of management and optimization of VFX projects, by which I mean the utilization of computer graphics in the creation of special visual effects in film and advertising. In order to optimize VFX projects I designed a sample project based on a typical, VFX postproduction which became the basis for the comparison of the general principles of the project management and actual procedure used in practice with the quest to optimize the management of the project. The purpose of this thesis is to establish a project management methodology for a VFX project which consists of four subsequent steps. The first step is the division of a VFX project into phases. The second step is the identification of auxiliary computer programmes for each phase, followed by an analysis of the risks and the evaluation of the optimal procedure. The first part of this thesis is devoted to the general definition of computer graphics and their use in post-production. The second part focuses on the development of the management methodology of VFX projects by testing it on a sample project...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVideo {{authoring}} activity typically {{consists of}} three phases: planning (pre-production), capture (production) and <b>processing</b> (<b>post-production).</b> The status quo is that these phases occur separately, with the latter two having {{a significant amount of}} "slack time", where the camera operator is watching the scene unfold during capture, and the editor is re-watching and navigating through recorded footage during post-production. While this process is well suited to creating polished or professional video, video clips produced by casual video makers as seen in online forums could benefit from some editing without the overhead of current authoring tools. We introduce LACES, a tablet-based system enabling simple video manipulations in the midst of filming. Seamless in-situ integration of video capture and manipulation forms a novel workflow, allowing for greater spontaneity and exploration in video creation...|$|R
30|$|Three {{papers in}} this special issue [9 – 11] {{address the problem of}} camera noise {{modeling}} and different aspects of noise reduction, ranging from post-processing steps for hardware solutions to purely signal <b>processing</b> <b>post-production</b> approaches. Available technologies for reducing noise in hardware include pixel binning [12, 13], where electrical charges of neighboring pixels are combined to form a superpixel. The benefits are faster readout speeds and improved signal-to-noise ratios albeit at the price of spatial resolution loss. Binning in color images is particularly challenging due to the presence of color filter array (CFA). To maintain color fidelity, the binning process combines neighboring pixels with the same color filter, such that the resulting superpixels form again a CFA, typically the Bayer pattern. The full-color image that is recovered from these subsampled sensor data by means of classical demosaicking is not only of lower resolution (compared to the case without binning), but suffers also from characteristic pixelization artifacts. Jin and Hirakawa provide in [9] a comprehensive characterization of pixel binning for color image sensors and propose post-capture signal processing steps to eliminate the binning artifacts. By a rigorous analysis, they prove that pixelization arises due to the mismatch between binning and demosaicking and that it cannot be eliminated simply by increasing the sensor resolution, but rather by a carefully designed binning-aware demosaicking approach.|$|R

40|$|Sustainability in {{the field}} of {{personal}} mobility is critical in alleviating social and consumption pressures of mass production processes, which are reliant on steel and petroleum based resources. This paper explores personal mobility in the urban environment, taking into account existing production methods and the environmental impact of raw material consumption. Furthermore, inertia for the uptake of alternative vehicles, specifically bicycles and Human Powered Vehicles (HPVs) is described, together with the current application of alternative production techniques to form these vehicles. The ‘Ajiro ’ concept has been achieved through the application of ‘action research ’ methodology, whereby active, grown experimentation and observation of bamboo has influenced the shape of the vehicle. This has led to a proposal that explores an agrarian approach to mass production with a process based on plant shape modification, with specific focus on the application of manipulating grown bamboo sections pre-harvesting to describe the structure of the vehicle, thereby avoiding energy intensive <b>post-production</b> <b>processing</b> of the material. 1...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{purity of}} any {{nanomaterial}} {{is one of}} the most important characteristic, which need to be considered for its biomedical or toxicological role. However, it has often been neglected, which needs to be considered for its active role in therapeutics or otherwise. Existence of residual contaminating foreign metals, unreduced metal ions, chemicals or other agents (from the precursor material used for nanomaterials synthesis) may actually be responsible for noxious actions rather than the actual nanomaterials itself and the quantity of contaminating materials are fully dependent upon the synthesis method used. Currently, numerous <b>post-production</b> nanomaterials <b>processing</b> methods are known to remove most of these precursor metal catalysts and chemical agents from nanomaterials; however, such purified nanomaterials may still have some amount of remaining substances. Therefore, the effects of such chemical impurities, residual metals and presence of counter ions on both potential biomedical and deleterious effects cannot be overlooked. Hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, electron transfer capability, surface smoothness/roughness/defects, oxidizability of nanomaterials in physiological conditions and counter ion effects are other essential physicochemical parameters of diverse nano objects that need to be considered to control their toxic potential while engineering nanomaterials for their biomedical applications. For instance, one of the recent studies used multiparametric methodology to understand high-content imaging coupled with gene expression analysis on fundamental pathways for evaluating cell-nanomaterial interactions. By employing this approach the effect of the surface charge and hydrophobicity of gold nanoparticles on cell-material interactions were parametrically evaluated followed by their validation through biochemical assays. Interestingly, the data evidently divulge that while surface hydrophobicity of nanomaterial does not essentially affect cellular uptake levels, nevertheless increased surface hydrophobicity was found to be associated with higher cell membrane damage and induction of autophagy, which had greater influence than the effect of surface charge ranging between − 50 and + 20  mV [109]. In another study, it has been confirmed that hydrophobic and hydrophilic graphene can differentially influence nano-bio interactions and their toxicity profile. Comparison between, highly hydrophobic pristine graphene and carboxyl functionalized hydrophilic graphene with monkey renal cells have revealed large accumulation of hydrophobic graphene on the cell membrane inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress leading to apoptosis, whereas functionalized hydrophilic graphene was internalized by the cells without causing any toxicity. These results were evident from confocal microscopy and cell function assays confirming significant importance of surface pacification to control strong hydrophobic interaction associated with toxicity effects of graphene through carboxyl functionalization. However, it is imperative to state that graphene is a non-biodegradable material with higher cellular internalization capacity. Therefore, the potential long-term hostile effects of functionalized hydrophilic graphene need to be explored yet to realize their full biomedical capabilities [110]. From the discussion, it can be clinched that the controlled experimental conditions and suitable functionalization may provide comparability across studies. This is imperative for reliable illustration of nanomaterial structure–activity correlations, which is prerequisite for the potential application of nanoparticles in medicine.|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, land management, {{government intervention}} in peri-urban land, and the striking decline of agricultural land have all affected farmers’ livelihoods {{and the capacity}} of locally supplied food for ever-growing cities. A growing body of literature {{has focused on the}} exploration of these issues in rural areas, which are believed to be the backbone of the national agriculture economy, and in peri-urban areas of large cities, which have experienced extreme changes during recent decades. But the issues are also relevant to peri-urban mid-sized cities where urbanization is in a different phase compared to the above areas. This study examines the main changes underway in the agrarian transition of peri-urban areas of Vinh city, a mid-sized city in the North Central Coast region of Vietnam. Vinh was chosen given its unique position in transforming from a mid-sized to a large city. This study explores the dynamics of agricultural production, {{and the role of the}} Vinh government in mediating urbanization and its impacts on farmers’ livelihoods. In order to attain the objectives, interviews with local leaders, and a survey with farmers were conducted, and a GIS database was also developed. 	The findings regarding agricultural production in the case study demonstrate that this mid-sized city, in the early phase of development, manifests itself as a duplicate of larger cities, escalating the threat of food accessibility from local sources. Duplication is in the sense that the peri-urban population in Vinh still depends largely on agriculture with a shift to commercial agriculture with higher value products despite the shrinkage of agricultural land. Agricultural production primarily uses manual family labor, and traditional products are substantially subsistent. Compared to larger cities, <b>post-production</b> activities (including <b>processing,</b> packaging, marketing, and delivery) and the organization of the agrofood supply chain in Vinh are underdeveloped due to minimum support from local and outside agencies. The case study confirms that as general trend in developing countries, Vietnam’s land policies favor the expropriation of agricultural land for industrialization and modernization. The findings also demonstrate the heterogeneity of land administration in Vietnam, structured from the ‘bottom-up’ mechanism, through which Vinh’s local authorities have the prerogative to not issue land use right certificates of agricultural land despite the national policy. This has occurred in order to control land markets to satisfy the city’s goal of transforming to an independent municipality. The situation is perpetuated by the absence of agricultural land legislations in a peri-urban context while contemporary legislation has been developed to address the rural areas because of their importance in the national agriculture economy. This is an issue for land management in Vietnam as well as in other developing countries. Finally, the findings on land expropriation in the peri-urban areas of Vinh city also confirm that direct government intervention through land expropriation in developing countries, with low compensation and lack of alternative vocational training, undermines farmers’ livelihoods and threatens the local food supply...|$|R
40|$|Visible facial {{blemishes}} can be annoying {{and embarrassing}} {{in our daily}} lives. This is particularly true when blemishes are permanently captured on video. For film and broadcast production, blemishes on actors/actresses may not be acceptable and must often be removed by <b>post-production</b> <b>processing.</b> Such processing can be incredibly slow and tedious, requiring a digital artist to "retouch" the video footage frame-by-frame. For amateur video editing, this manual processing is impractical with existing tools. This thesis presents a unique framework, referred to as Video Cosmetics (VC), designed to remove unwanted blemishes from video footage with minimal user assistance. Using the VC framework a user needs only to specify the blemish in an initial frame; the system then automatically tracks and removes the blemishes from subsequent frames. This task is accomplished by combining feature tracking, pixel classification, and temporally coherent image inpainting into a single processing framework. The result is an efficient post-production tool that substantially reduces {{the amount of time}} and effort needed to remove blemishes from video footage...|$|E
40|$|Single-wall carbon {{nanotubes}} {{offer the}} promise of a new class of revolutionary materials for space applications. The Carbon Nanotube Project at NASA Johnson Space Center has been actively researching this new technology by investigating nanotube production methods (arc, laser, and HiPCO) and gaining a comprehensive understanding of raw and purified material using a wide range of characterization techniques. After production and purification, single wall carbon nanotubes are processed into composites for the enhancement of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. This "cradle-to-grave" approach to nanotube composites has given our team unique insights into the impact of <b>post-production</b> <b>processing</b> and dispersion on the resulting material properties. We are applying our experience and lessons-learned to developing new approaches toward nanotube material characterization, structural composite fabrication, and are also making advances in developing thermal management materials and electrically conductive materials in various polymer-nanotube systems. Some initial work has also been conducted with the goal of using carbon nanotubes in the creation of new ceramic materials for high temperature applications in thermal protection systems. Human space flight applications such as advanced life support and fuel cell technologies are also being investigated. This discussion will focus on the variety of applications under investigation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn circulation, {{shedding}} of microparticles from {{a variety}} of viable cells can be triggered by pathological activation of inflammatory processes, by activation of coagulation or complement systems, or by physical stress. Elevated microparticle content (MPC) in donor blood might therefore indicate a clinical condition of the donor which, upon transfusion, might affect the recipient. In blood products, elevated MPC might also represent product stress. Surprisingly, the MPC in blood collected from normal blood donors is highly variable, which raises the question whether donor microparticles are present in-vivo and transfer into the final blood component, and how production methods and <b>post-production</b> <b>processing</b> might affect the MPC. We measured MPC using ThromboLUX in (a) platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of 54 apheresis donors and the corresponding apheresis products, (b) 651 apheresis and 646 pooled platelet concentrates (PCs) with plasma and 414 apheresis PCs in platelet additive solution (PAS), and (c) apheresis PCs before and after transportation, gamma irradiation, and pathogen inactivation (N[*]=[*] 8, 7, and 12 respectively). ThromboLUX-measured MPC in donor PRP and their corresponding apheresis PC samples were highly correlated (r[*]=[*] 0. 82, P[*]=[*]. 001). The average MPC in pooled PC was slightly lower than that in apheresis PC and substantially lower in apheresis PC stored with PAS rather than plasma. Mirasol Pathogen Reduction treatment significantly increased MPC with age. Thus, MPC measured in donor samples might be a useful predictor of product stability, especially if post-production processes are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) cassava-producing {{countries}} such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire have developed, in recent years, {{a renewed interest in}} cassava as an alternative food crop. This has led to a major expansion in cassava-based production systems in Nigeria and Ghana, whereas there has been a slower growth in Côte d'Ivoire (Nweke et al., 1998). This paper is based on the argument that the difference in various factors such as agricultural policies (i. e., trade and price policies, domestic production taxes or subsidies), location and technologies (production and processing) between Nigeria, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire the difference in the level of growth in cassava-based production systems. The paper examines, using the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM), the magnitude of the impact of these factors on the private and social profitability of cassava production and <b>post-production</b> <b>processing</b> in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria. The topic has not been examined in previous studies. The paper relies primarily on data for Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria from the Collaborative Study of Cassava in Africa (COSCA) survey. The baseline results demonstrate the similarity in efficiencies of production in these West African countries. The simulation findings indicated that, in Côte d'Ivoire, farmers benefited from the depreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate while farmers in Ghana and Nigeria suffered losses. Simulation results also indicated that Ivorian and Ghanaian cassava/maize farmers could benefit from growing IITA's improved variety and adopting mechanized processing methods.
