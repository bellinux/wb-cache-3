30|$|The {{results at}} the {{industry}} level {{are reported in}} columns 5 and 6 and are based on 6 industries in 259 regions during 1991 – 2009. In this disaggregated level, a separate <b>panel</b> <b>ID</b> was used for each industry and region, which means industry 1 in region 1 is different from industry 1 in region 2, and so on. 18 The coefficient estimates of the lagged dependent variable (θ) are 0.975 and 0.983 without and with structural change, respectively. These results also show that regional productivity at the industry level is converging to their own steady-state level. The speed of convergence {{is very close to}} the country level, i.e. 2  % without incorporating structural change and 1  % with structural change. These results also show that β coefficient will be overestimated if one {{does not take into account}} the effects of structural change, which is similar to the country-level results.|$|E
40|$|The {{forest sector}} is more {{embedded}} {{in the global economy}} than ever. With globally significant supplies of land and raw materials and favorable terms for foreign investors, developing countries – particularly in Africa – have become increasingly attractive trade partners and destinations for investors. Economic growth is anticipated to increase demand for energy, water, food and forest products (Toyne et al, 2002; White et al, 2007), trends which are already evident in the recent food and fuel crises. Increasing competition over land is placing new pressures over vast tracts of forest and woodland, areas often considered “under-utilized” by national governments despite their critical role in supporting local livelihoods. While increased demand for forest products and agricultural commodities in the context of forest tenure reforms and decentralized decision-making (Sunderlin et al, 2008; White and Martin, 2002) could create unprecedented economic opportunities for forest-dependent communities, increased “stakes” over forest resources and land will heighten governance challenges. This paper provides a conceptual framework for analyzing shifting patterns of tenure and rights in the forestry sector for a host of sectoral and extra-sectoral commodities shaping forests. It aims to provide a framing for case studies to be presented at a panel entitled, “Large-Scale Investments in the Forest Frontier: Customary Rights and Societal Stakes” (<b>Panel</b> <b>ID</b> No. 461). By presenting case studies from diverse contexts (Africa, Asia, Latin America) and sectors (agriculture, energy, forestry, mining), the utility of the framework will be explored while distilling key commonalities and differences in shifting patterns of customary rights and societal stakes associated with large-scale land and resource acquisitions in the global South...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracies}} of the MicroScan Pos ID and Rapid Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> systems (Baxter Diagnostic Inc., MicroScan Division, West Sacramento, Calif.) {{were compared}} {{with each other and}} with the accuracies of conventional methods for the identification of 25 Staphylococcus species and 4 subspecies. Conventional methods included those used in the original descriptions of species and subspecies and DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> uses a battery of 18 tests, and the Rapid Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> uses a battery of 42 tests for the identification of Staphylococcus species. The Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> has modified conventional and chromogenic tests that can be read after 15 to 48 h of incubation; the Rapid Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> has tests that use fluorogenic substrates or fluorometric indicators, and test results can be read after 2 h of incubation in the autoSCAN-W/A. Results indicated that both MicroScan systems had a high degree of congruence (greater than or equal to 90 %) with conventional methods for the species S. capitis, S. aureus, S. auricularis, S. saprophyticus, S. cohnii, S. arlettae, S. carnosus, S. lentus, and S. sciuri and, in particular, the subspecies S. capitis subsp. capitis and S. cohnii subsp. cohnii. The Rapid Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> system also had greater than or equal to 90 % congruence with conventional methods for S. epidermidis, S. caprae, S. warneri subsp. 2, S. xylosus, S. kloosii, and S. caseolyticus. For both MicroScan systems, congruence with conventional methods was 80 to 90 % for S. haemolyticus subsp. 1, S. equorum, S. intermedius, and S. hyicus; and in addition, with the Rapid Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> system congruence was 80 to 89 % for S. capitis subsp. ureolyticus, S. warneri subsp. 1, S. hominis, S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum, and S. simulans. The MicroScan systems identified a lower percentage (50 to 75 %) of strains of S. lugdunensis, S. gallinarum, S. schleiferi, and S. chromogenes, although the addition of specific tests to the systems might increase the accuracy of identification significantly...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 6 years, a revised {{classification}} of the streptococci and enterococci, {{based primarily on}} molecular techniques such as 16 S rRNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization, emerged. However, little attention was placed on routine physiological tests {{that could be used}} in food and clinical laboratories to differentiate between species of a new genus, Enterococcus, and fecal Streptococcus spp. The purpose of this study was to devise a convenient and reliable system to identify enterococci and fecal streptococci by using conventional procedures. Fifty-nine strains of 13 Enterococcus spp., including the type strains and many strains used by previous investigators, were characterized by using conventional tube tests, the API Rapid Strep system, and MicroScan Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panels.</b> Results were compared with each other and with previously published results. A comparison of conventional tube tests versus published tube test results yielded 17 discrepancies. Although not all tests were done with each of the three systems, 28 discrepancies between results obtained with the API system and those obtained with conventional tube tests were found. There were 24 discrepancies between results obtained with the MicroScan Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panel</b> and those obtained with conventional tube tests. There were 12 discrepancies between the results with the API Rapid Strep system and those with the MicroScan Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panels.</b> We devised flow charts of key tests that might be used to identify cultures without resorting to nucleic acid analysis and other labor- and equipment-intensive analyses...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} predict the ground {{movement}} using the GIS functions, the following data, such as calculation points, extraction panels and subsidence parameters should be prepared at first. Meanwhile, the input parameters for ground movement calculations could be separated into two categories. The first one is the generation of surface grid points for providing calculation points, including the distance of each grid point in the x and y directions, in which the number of points along the grid lines, the number of grid lines, point intervals along the grid lines, and the grid-line directions need to be established. The second one is entering the calculation data of ground movement, including the extraction <b>panel</b> sequence <b>ID,</b> seam upward angle, inclination of dip, subsidence factor, excavation thickness, horizontal-movement factor, angle of draw and time factor. Since the ground movement is calculated only with the above entering data, the calculation results of each panel would be uncertain once the input data are uncertain.|$|R

The vast majority of its scoreboards were sold to bottlers of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and other soft drinks throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The bottlers provided Electro-Mech scoreboards to schools, recreation parks, and other facilities where their soft drinks were served. In exchange, the facility operators signed contracts to exclusively stock vending machines and fountain dispensers with soft drinks purchased directly from the bottler for a number of years.

40|$|The {{effect of}} serial HIV- 1 {{infection}} {{on the development}} of the broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) response was studied in an individual, H 01 - 10366, with a serial HIV- 1 superinfection (SI), hence triple infection, and compared with the bNAb response in three superinfected as well as 11 monoinfected men who have had sex with men (MSM) from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Neutralization assays measuring heterologous neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers on a panel of six representative viruses from different HIV- 1 subtypes were performed on blood serum samples obtained approximate to 3 years after primary HIV infection (PHI) and longitudinally for H 01 - 10366. A bNAb response was defined as having a geometric mean neutralization titer (the reciprocal serum dilution giving 50 % inhibition of virus infection, inhibitory dilution (ID 50)) 100 and neutralizing > 50 % of viruses in the <b>panel</b> with an <b>ID</b> 50 titer 100. H 01 - 10366 quickly developed a potent NAb response against subtype B viruses before subtype B SI, but no broadening of the response occurred after the second subtype B infection or the third infection with CRF 01 _AE. When comparing H 01 - 10366 with matched monoinfected (N= 11) and superinfected (N= 3) individuals analyzed 3 years after PHI, we found that 5 of the 15 individuals (4 / 11 monoinfected, 1 / 4 SI) developed a bNAb response. However, there was no statistically discernible difference between the bNAb response and HIV- 1 SI.

Of these 310 isolates, 286 organisms were in the DCP data base and 269 were in the RFP data base. Use of the DCP panels resulted in 118 (41. 3 %) correct and 64 (22. 4 %) incorrect first choice identifications at {{greater than or equal to}} 85 % probability, 61 (21. 3 %) low-probability identifications, and 43 (15. 0 %) reports of unidentified organisms. The RFP system reported 135 (50. 1 %) correct and 25 (9. 3 %) incorrect identifications at greater than or equal to 85 % probability and 109 (40. 5 %) low-probability identifications. Unidentified isolates (DCP system only) and isolates producing low-probability first choice identifications (both systems) required supplementary biochemical testing. Over half (37 of 64 [57. 8 %]) of the DCP misidentifications were due to four commonly isolated, saccharolytic organisms (Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Xanthomonas maltophilia), while 7 of 25 (28 %) of misidentifications in the RFP system were due to P. fluorescens. Of note, the RFP system identified non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli within 2 h of panel inoculation, allowing additional conventional biochemical tests to be set up the same day on low-probability isolates, whereas only 13. 5 % of the DCPs could be read at 18 h, with the remainder requiring 42 h of incubation before reading. When organism identifications were recalculated with the updated RFP data base and revised software, only 8. 1 % of all 310 isolates were misidentified at greater than or equal to 85 % probability while 77. 1 % of the isolates were now correctly reported at this same high probability...|$|R
40|$|The genus Streptococcus, {{including}} the fecal streptococci, has received intensive scrutiny in recent years, {{resulting in a}} new genus Enterococcus, rearrangement of species within the genus, and addition of many new species. To clarify the roles of these bacteria in food microbiology, known strains were examined by using conventional tube tests and API Rapid Strep and MicroScan Pos <b>ID</b> <b>panels.</b> Identification schema were devised to identify 13 species of enterococci and S. bovis and S. equinus by using a minimum of supplemental tests. These schema were used for enterococcal species identification to pinpoint possible sources of fecal contamination. Enterococci were enumerated and isolates were identified from samples taken in three pork slaughtering plants {{at different stages of}} slaughter and at different sites on the pork carcasses. Enterococcal numbers varied with stage, site and plant. Enterococcus faecalis predominated at each sample category. Since Enterococcus faecium predominates in hog feces, source(s) other than fecal contamination was indicated. Processed pork also was examined. Spoiled processed pork sausage contained a predominance of E. faecium, whereas samples of fresh and expired pork contained relatively low numbers of enterococci. These were predominantly E. faecalis. fGTC and KF media were used to enumerate enterococci on the pork carcasses and on retail samples of pork, beef, and poultry. Significantly higher counts were obtained with fGTC agar than with KF agar for all sample types. Species distribution of presumptive-positive colonies on the two media were similar, and at least 95 % of colonies counted on fGTC agar were enterococci (except for samples in which shelf life had expired and lactobacilli predominated). The results indicated that fGTC agar is a superior medium for the isolation of enterococci in foods, except in products such as vacuum-packaged meats, where large numbers of lactobacilli are expected. The antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci from pork, water, and clinical sources also were examined. Isolates from all sources carried similar intrinsic resistance to certain classes of antimicrobials; the least amount of resistance was observed in isolates from pork samples. When antibiotic resistance was compared among enterococcal species, some differences were detected. Finally, four streptococcal grouping kits were compared for their abilities to accurately type the group Lancefield D...|$|R
