5|$|In 1874 he was {{appointed}} as lecturer in medicine at the Athenaeum Illustre in medicine, pathology and <b>pharmacodynamics,</b> and became a professor when the Athenaeum received university status and became the Municipal University of Amsterdam. He served as rector magnificus (dean) of the university in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the target effect of active substances are usually rather a matter of <b>pharmacodynamics</b> (concerning e.g. the physiological effects of drugs). An exception is topical administration, which generally means that both the application location and the effect thereof is local.|$|E
25|$|Ginkgo {{may have}} {{undesirable}} effects, especially {{for individuals with}} blood circulation disorders and those taking anticoagulants such as aspirin or warfarin, although recent studies have found ginkgo {{has little or no}} effect on the anticoagulant properties or <b>pharmacodynamics</b> of warfarin in healthy subjects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pharmacodynamics</b> are {{measured}} by measuring proteasome inhibition in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}}. The much greater sensitivity of myeloma cell lines and mantle cell lines to proteasome inhibition compared with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells {{and most other}} cancer cell lines is poorly understood.|$|E
25|$|The vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) is {{responsible}} for the <b>pharmacodynamics</b> of warfarin. VKORC1 along with CYP2C9 are useful for identifying the risk of bleeding during warfarin administration. Warfarin works by inhibiting VKOR, which is encoded by the VKORC1 gene. Individuals with polymorphism in this have an affected response to warfarin treatment.|$|E
25|$|Metabolites of {{ketamine}} including dehydronorketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and norketamine {{have been}} found to act as negative allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the KXa7R1 cell line (HEK293 cells transfected with rat nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes) with subanesthetic and nanomolar potencies (e.g., IC50 = 55nM for dehydronorketamine), whereas ketamine itself was inactive at the same concentrations (< 1nbsp&µM). These findings suggest that metabolites may contribute importantly to the <b>pharmacodynamics</b> of ketamine.|$|E
25|$|Toxicodynamics, termed <b>pharmacodynamics</b> in pharmacology, {{describes}} the dynamic interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and its biological effects. A biological target, {{also known as}} the site of action, can be binding proteins, ion channels, DNA, or a variety of other receptors. When a toxicant enters an organism, it can interact with these receptors and produce structural or functional alterations. The mechanism of action of the toxicant, as determined by a toxicant’s chemical properties, will determine what receptors are targeted and the overall toxic effect at the cellular level and organismal level.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, {{have been created}} for therapeutic use. They differ in both pharmacokinetics (absorption factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and <b>pharmacodynamics</b> (for example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (Na+) and water; renal physiology). Because they permeate the intestines easily, they are administered primarily per os (by mouth), but also by other methods, such as topically on skin. More than 90% of them bind different plasma proteins, though with a different binding specificity. Endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic corticoids have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called corticosteroid-binding globulin), whereas all of them bind albumin. In the liver, they quickly metabolize by conjugation with a sulfate or glucuronic acid, and are secreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharmacodynamics</b> of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. Water-soluble peptide hormones cannot {{penetrate}} the fatty cell membrane and only indirectly affect {{the nucleus of}} target cells through their interaction with the cell’s surface receptors. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. From there, the compound hormone-receptor diffuses into the nucleus, where it either alters the expression of genes or activates processes that send signals {{to other parts of}} the cell. Different types of AAS bind to the AAR with different affinities, depending on their chemical structure. Some AAS such as metandienone bind weakly to this receptor in vitro, but still exhibit AR-mediated effects in vivo. The reason for this discrepancy is not known.|$|E

500|$|Forensic {{toxicology}} is {{the study}} of the <b>pharmacodynamics,</b> or what a substance does to the body, and pharmacokinetics, or what the body does to the substance. [...] To accurately determine the effect a particular drug has on the human body, forensic toxicologists must be aware of various levels of tolerance that an individual can build up as well as the therapeutic index for various pharmaceuticals. [...] Toxicologists are tasked with determining whether any toxin found in a body was the cause of or contributed to an incident, or whether it was at too low a level to have had an effect. [...] While the determination of the specific toxin can be time-consuming due to the number of different substances that can cause injury or death, certain clues can narrow down the possibilities. [...] For example, carbon monoxide poisoning would result in bright red blood while death from hydrogen sulfide would cause the brain to have a green hue.|$|E

2500|$|Metal {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a well-established}} phenomenon and is common, affecting about 10–15% of the population. Contact with metals can cause immune reactions such as skin hives, eczema, redness and itching. Although {{little is known}} about the short- and long-term <b>pharmacodynamics</b> and bioavailability of circulating metal degradation products in vivo, there have been many reports of immunologic type responses temporally associated with implantation of metal components. [...] Individual case reports link hypersensitivity immune reactions with adverse performance of metallic clinical cardiovascular, orthopedic and plastic surgical and dental implants.|$|E
2500|$|Drug {{interactions}} may be {{the result}} of altered pharmacokinetics or <b>pharmacodynamics</b> due to one of the drugs involved. [...] Cisplatin, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, etoposide, and vinblastine are all potentially co-administered with docetaxel and did not modify docetaxel plasma binding in phase II studies. Cisplatin is known to have a complex interaction with some CYPs and has in some events been shown to reduce docetaxel clearance by up to 25%. Anticonvulsants induce some metabolic pathways relevant to docetaxel. CYP450 and CYP3A show increased expression in response to the use of anticonvulsants and the metabolism of docetaxel metabolite M4 is processed by these CYPs. A corresponding increase in clearance of M4 by 25% is observed in patients taking phenytoin and phenobarbital, common anticonvulsants.|$|E
2500|$|Pharmacogenomics is {{the study}} {{of the role of the}} genome in drug response. Its name ( [...] + genomics) {{reflects}} its combining of pharmacology and genomics. Pharmacogenomics analyzes how the genetic makeup of an individual affects his/her response to drugs. It deals with the influence of acquired and inherited genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) and <b>pharmacodynamics</b> (effects mediated through a drug's biological targets). The term pharmacogenomics is often used interchangeably with pharmacogenetics. Although both terms relate to drug response based on genetic influences, pharmacogenetics focuses on single drug-gene interactions, while pharmacogenomics encompasses a more genome-wide association approach, incorporating genomics and epigenetics while dealing with the effects of multiple genes on drug response.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of <b>pharmacodynamics</b> (what a drug does to the body), the {{hydrophobic}} effect is the major driving force for the binding of drugs to their receptor targets. [...] On the other hand, hydrophobic drugs {{tend to be more}} toxic because they, in general, are retained longer, have a wider distribution within the body (e.g., intracellular), are somewhat less selective in their binding to proteins, and finally are often extensively metabolized. In some cases the metabolites may be chemically reactive. [...] Hence it is advisable to make the drug as hydrophilic as possible while it still retains adequate binding affinity to the therapeutic protein target. For cases where a drug reaches its target locations through passive mechanisms (i.e., diffusion through membranes), the ideal distribution coefficient for the drug is typically intermediate in value (neither too lipophilic, nor too hydrophilic); in cases where molecules reach their targets otherwise, no such generalization applies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pharmacodynamics</b> is {{the study}} of the {{biochemical}} and physiologic effects of drugs (especially pharmaceutical drugs). The effects can include those manifested within animals (including humans), microorganisms, or combinations of organisms (for example, infection). <b>Pharmacodynamics</b> {{is the study}} of how a drug affects an organism, whereas pharmacokinetics {{is the study of}} how the organism affects the drug. Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects. <b>Pharmacodynamics</b> is sometimes abbreviated as PD and pharmacokinetics as PK, especially in combined reference (for example, when speaking of PK/PD models).|$|E
