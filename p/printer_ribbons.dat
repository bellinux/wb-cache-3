50|$|PFSweb, Inc. {{was founded}} in 1994 as Priority Fulfillment Services, Inc. (PFS) by Texas-based Daisytek International Corporation, a leading {{wholesale}} distributor of computer and office automation supplies such as <b>printer</b> <b>ribbons,</b> toner cartridges, and computer disks. The new unit was initially created to perform order-processing, fulfillment, and telemarketing services for other companies, due to a growing demand for outsourcing in this area. Soon after its formation under Daisytek, PFSweb was chosen to perform telemarketing and distribution services for IBM product lines throughout North America.|$|E
50|$|Single-strike and Multi-strike ribbons were {{an attempt}} to address issues in the ribbon's ink quality. Standard <b>printer</b> <b>ribbons</b> used the same {{principles}} as typewriter ribbons. The printer would be at its darkest with a newly installed ribbon cartridge, but would gradually grow fainter with each successive printout. The variation in darkness over the ribbon cartridge's lifetime prompted the introduction of alternative ribbon formulations. Single-strike ribbons used a carbon-like substance in typewriter ribbons transfer. As the ribbon was only usable for a single loop (rated in terms of 'character count'), the blackness was of consistent, outstanding darkness. Multi-strike nylon ribbons gave an increase in ribbon life, {{at the expense of}} quality.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, at age 14, Larry O'Connor began LRO Enterprises, a <b>printer</b> <b>ribbon</b> re-inking business, in his family's barn. A year later, LRO Enterprises reorganized into LRO Computer Sales {{and began}} selling {{computer}} memory chips via America Online. The company moved into its first facility in Woodstock, Illinois and hired its first employees.|$|R
5000|$|Carbon ribbons are on {{rolls and}} are fitted onto a spindle or reel holder within the <b>printer.</b> The used <b>ribbon</b> is rewound by a take-up spindle forming {{a roll of}} ‘used’ ribbon. It is termed a ‘one-trip’ ribbon because once it has been rewound the used roll is {{discarded}} and replaced with a new one. If one were to hold a strip of used carbon ribbon {{up to the light}} one would see an exact negative of the images that have been printed. The main benefit of using a one-trip thermal transfer ribbon is that providing the correct settings are applied prior to printing, an 100% density of printed image is guaranteed; compare this with a pre-inked ribbon on a dot matrix impact <b>printer</b> <b>ribbon</b> which gradually fades with usage.|$|R

50|$|Core {{was created}} under a {{different}} business model. Initially, it was marketed as an association and structured as a for-profit organization specifically for users of the IBM 5100 Series and IBM System/23. The objective was to sell by mail-order computer supplies, pre-developed (off-the-shelf) programs and hardware maintenance service. Supplies included <b>printer</b> <b>ribbons</b> and paper, diskettes, tape cartridges. Software ranged from simple mortgage interest calculations, word processing, games and utilities to advanced payroll, accounting and industry specific applications. Users wanted readily available, simple to install and support for software that was also low in cost. Core was able to fill this niche because IBM had developed the machines with engineering and scientific applications in mind, while business programs such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing were not generally available. Computer maintenance was an insurance program that provided on-site repairs and replacement parts, all provided by IBM service but {{at a lower cost}} than available directly from IBM.|$|E
5000|$|Leading Edge {{was founded}} in 1980 by Michael Shane. At the outset, they were a PC {{peripherals}} company selling aftermarket products such as Elephant Memory Systems brand floppy disk media ("Elephant. Never forgets") and <b>printer</b> <b>ribbons,</b> and acting as the sole North American distributor/reseller of printers from the Japanese manufacturer, C. Itoh, the most memorable being the popular low-end dot-matrix printer, [...] "The Gorilla Banana". In 1984 the company sold the computer aftermarket product line and sales division to Dennison Computer Supplies, a division of Dennison Manufacturing. In 1984, they began to use Daewoo parts, and in 1989, they were acquired by Daewoo, {{as part of their}} recovery from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. (Shane declared that the costs of a legal dispute with Mitsubishi lead to its bankruptcy.) In October, 1995, Daewoo sold the company to Manuhold Investment AG, a Swiss electronics company. Leading Edge had sold 185,000 of its PC clones in the United States in 1994, but in 1995 sales fell from 90,000 in the first half to almost none in the second half. By 1997 the company was defunct.|$|E
40|$|The {{project had}} three basic elements. It aimed at {{improving}} managem ent by developing {{a clearer understanding of}} the principles of economic resource alloca tion; by establishing a system to analyse existing farm records; and by preparing a comp uter program for this work. It was the first project {{of its kind in the}} agricultural sector in Mongolia, and acted as a preparatory phase for the UNDP/FAO project, MON/ 89 / 007, 'Agricultural Management Project', which was now in operationThe services of four consultants, in the fields of farm management, information monitoring, computerized farm planning systems, and microcomputer operations, we re provided. Detailed analysis of the farm management system, and the national sys tems of data recording and reporting, was undertakenThe consultants carried out a series of training courses, and four s taff members of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry undertook a study tour to China, Australia and Thailand, to acquaint themselves with technologies relevant to Mongolia, and particularly the use of computers in farm management, farm accounting, and livestock marketin gThe computer-based record system, `Mongolian Agricultural Data Colle ction and Data Analysis Package', was designed to be applicable under Mongolian condit ions, menu-driven and simple to use; the necessary computer equipment was also suppli ed. It was recommended that the translation into Mongolian of the program prompts be undert aken immediately, that the microcomputers be installed at the three projects sites, a nd that the staff be trained in basic computer operations. Particular importance should be given to acquiring a reliable supply of materials, such as floppy disks, paper and <b>printer</b> <b>ribbons,</b> for these machinesThe project has significantly improved the understanding of farm man agement and data-handling issues in the Ministry. It also identified a number of confli cts in Government policy for agriculture, the solutions for which lie outside the compe tence of the farm management projects; it would be necessary to harmonize policy in this res pectFinally, it was recommended that the Ministry organize multidiscipli nary management teams, involving specialists in a range of fields, including farm man agement, economics, crop and livestock production, and computer system...|$|E
50|$|A thermal {{transfer}} <b>printer</b> contains a <b>ribbon</b> cartridge {{that uses a}} wax ink. When the heating elements in the print head heat up, they melt the wax and transfer it to the paper, thus {{the need for the}} paper to be really smooth. This also means that the ribbon cannot be reused after the head runs over it, since the wax transfers off the ribbon to the paper.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} several {{technical}} applications for the Möbius strip. Giant Möbius strips {{have been used as}} conveyor belts that last longer because the entire surface area of the belt gets the same amount of wear, and as continuous-loop recording tapes (to double the playing time). Möbius strips are common in the manufacture of fabric computer <b>printer</b> and typewriter <b>ribbons,</b> as they let the ribbon be twice as wide as the print head while using both halves evenly.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{manufacturers}} implemented color dot-matrix impact printing {{through a}} multi-color ribbon. Color was achieved through a multi-pass composite printing process. During each pass, the print head struck a different {{section of the}} ribbon (one primary color). For a 4-color ribbon, each printed line of output required up to 3 passes depending on color. In some color printers, such as the Apple ImageWriter II and Star Micronics NX-1000C [...] "Rainbow" [...] or the optional color kits for the NEC Pinwriter series, the <b>printer</b> moved the <b>ribbon</b> vertically relative to the fixed print head assembly. In other models, the print head was tilted against a stationary ribbon.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic siphon recorder of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern strip chart recorders, a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact <b>printer</b> using a <b>ribbon</b> and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|R
