25|$|Significant {{cross-cultural}} variation {{has been}} observed in strong reciprocity behavior. In 2001, dictator game experiments were run in a 15 small scale societies across the world. The results of the experiments showed dramatic variation, with some groups mean offer as little as 26% and some as great as 58%. The pattern of receiver results was also interesting, with some participants in some cultures rejecting offers above 50%. Henrich and colleagues determined that the best predictors of dictator game allocations were {{the size of the}} group (small groups giving less) and market integration (the more involved with markets, the more participants gave). This study was then repeated with a different 15 small scale societies and with better measures of market integration, finding a similar <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> These results are consistent with the culture-gene coevolution hypothesis. A later paper by the same researchers identified religion as a third major contributor. Those people who participate in a world religion were more likely to exhibit strong reciprocity behavior.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness), including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy. The underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than those of controls. The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear. The overall <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> across studies indicates that people diagnosed with psychopathy demonstrate reduced MRI, fMRI, aMRI, PET, and SPECT activity {{in areas of the}} brain. Some recent fMRI studies have reported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions (positives and negatives). Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations. Meta-analyses have also found evidence of impairments in both vocal and facial emotional recognition for several emotions (i.e., not only fear and sadness) in both adults and children/adolescents.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{compared}} dyslexic children and specific language impaired (SLI) children on phonological skills and underlying processes, i. e. working memory and auditory perception. Problems with phonological skills and underlying processes occur in both dyslexic and SLI children.

What is the importance of phonological skills and underlying processes to reading achievement? Results show differences in degree of problems between dyslexic and SLI children. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> performance between groups differ.

50|$|For example, in an {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) study by Rees and colleagues, brain activity was recorded while participants completed a perceptual task. Here they examined the neural processing of meaningful (words) and meaningless (consonant string) stimuli both when attended to, and when these same items were unattended. While no difference in activation patterns were found between the groups when the stimuli were unattended, differences in neural processing were observed for meaningful versus meaningless stimuli to which participants overtly attended. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> suggests that ignored stimuli are not processed to the level of meaning, i.e. less extensively than attended stimuli.

50|$|A host {{of studies}} have found a Dm effect when {{presenting}} words as stimuli. However, experiments using pictures or abstract figures have found less consistent Dm effects. Experiments using a continuous recognition paradigm have found a Dm effect for pictures of everyday objects.

A similar <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> is described by Fox, Michie and Coltheart, (1990). Coupling the results of Dm effects for words and common pictures and the lack of Dm effects for abstract figures suggests the Dm effect may be contingent on using meaningful stimuli or some pre-existing knowledge of the stimuli.|$|E
