One {{of the main}} issues of the procedure has been the actio (similar to the English word [...] "act"). In the procedure of the legis actiones the actio included both procedural and substantive elements. Because during this procedure the Praetor had granted, or denied, litigation by granting or denying, respectively, an actio. By granting the actio the praetor in the end has created claims. I.e. a procedural act caused substantive claims to exist. Such <b>priority</b> (<b>procedure</b> over substance) is contrary to {{what we think of}} the relationship nowadays. But it has not only been an issue of priority and whether the one serves the other. Since the actio had been composed of elements of procedure and substance it was difficult to separate both parts again.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a neural network-based job priority assigner system for a job scheduling environment. Scheduling deals with the allocation of resources over time to perform a collection of tasks. Scheduling problems arise in domains as diverse as manufacturing, computer processing, transportation, health care, space exploration, and education. In {{the case of a}} neural network (NN) based scheduler, once the job attributes are properly trained for a specified schedule, it will never miss that related scheduling pattern for that particular job. An NN based scheduling procedure can successfully overcome the local minima of its error surface. This paper reports on research which established that a back propagation neural network-based <b>priority</b> <b>procedure</b> would recognize jobs from a job queue by estimating each job’s priority.

Determining the road maintenance priority is considered as a multi-criteria decision making problem. Recent <b>priority</b> <b>procedure</b> offered by the Department of Public Works and previous researches only consider technical aspects such as pavement condition and daily traffic. However, non-technical factor such as political intervention {{plays a significant role}} in determining priority. This paper suggests a comprehensive assessment framework that enables to take a number of technical and non-technical factors into consideration. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to evaluate these roads with respect to prescribed criterions. Five proposed road which funded by provincial government were subjected into criterions with diverse metrics that serve as multi-objective decision environment where AHP play an appropriate role and consistently lead toward the final decision.

40|$|Previous {{experience}} {{has shown that}} real-time, traffic-responsive signal control {{has the ability to}} improve traffic operations in urban areas when compared to traditional fixed-time control. However, most of these experiences have focused primarily on the impact on private automobiles. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a fully distributed, real-time, traffic-responsive model named SPPORT (Signal <b>Priority</b> <b>Procedure</b> for Optimization in Real-Time) that explicitly considers the impacts of transit vehicles. This model is unique in two ways. First, the model explicitly considers the interference caused to the general traffic by transit vehicles stopping in the right of way to board and discharge passengers. Second, when considering priority passage for transit vehicles, the potential effects that such preferential treatment might have on other traffic is explicitly quantified. This paper describes the structure of the model and demonstrates it capabilities on an isolated intersection for a range of traffic demands and with and without transit vehicles. The rule-based signal optimization procedure provided delay reductions for most of the traffic conditions examined when compared to both fixed-time and traffic actuated control. While the results reported in this paper are limited to an isolated intersection, the model is capable of being applied to a network of signals. Evaluation of its performance on a corridor has been conducted and will appear in the literature in the near future. Dion and Hellinga...|$|E
40|$|Directive 2013 / 32 /EU {{established}} the common standards which the EU Member States {{are obliged to}} incorporate into their national legislations in order to regulate the procedure for deciding on asylum applications. Asylum proceedings are {{to be carried out}} by national authorities but states are obliged to comply with the standards set out in this Directive. The asylum procedure is initiated upon the request of an interested party and its aim is to examine whether a third-country national or a stateless person has met the requirements for obtaining a refugee status. Before examining the justifiability of the asylum application, it is essential to determine which EU Member State is responsible for examining the application, which is established by applying the Dublin rules. If it is established that the state of the applicant's current location is not the state responsible for examining the asylum application, the applicant will be transferred to the respective state. Then, the responsible state is obliged to institute the first instance procedure and examine the submitted application within the prescribed time limits. The examination is carried out in a regular court proceeding, unless there are reasons for instituting a special proceeding (a <b>priority</b> <b>procedure,</b> an admissibility procedure, an accelerated procedure, and a border procedure). Under this Directive, the applicant is guaranteed the right to remain in the territory of the deciding EU Member State, as long as the final decision at first instance is pending, and some other procedural guarantees aimed at ensuring that the decision on asylum has been rendered by observing the rules of fair proceedings. On the other hand, the applicant has certain obligations, the most important of which are the obligations to appear before the competent state authority, to submit the available documents, to agree to being photographed and fingerprinted, etc. If dissatisfied with the first instance decision, applicants may challenge the decision by filing an appeal with the competent national court. During the appeal proceedings, {{they have the right to}} remain in the territory of the EU Member States, except in cases involving a number of explicitly prescribed situations.

The <b>procedure</b> of project <b>priorities</b> defining cannot take place without any previous preparation, which among others includes good knowledge about our own information system and organization, the analysis of the current state of this information system, and a survey and the analysis of the business system architecture.

The complexity and importance of the problem call for analytical methods rather than intuitive decisions. The personnel selection problem requires the application of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods for robust recruitment. This paper has to objectives; first to proposed a MCDM method for personnel selection system based on Analytic Hierarchy Process and Genetic Algorithm (AHP-GA) and second, to apply this algorithm on a real case from an organization. As related to the first objective, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to solve the MCDM problem. It has been applied in numerous situations with impressive results. However, AHP has been also criticized mainly in <b>priority</b> derivation <b>procedure.</b> One of the main problems in current AHP as <b>priority</b> derivation <b>procedure</b> is; inconsistency of the judgment, accuracy and performance of the prioritization method.

The new model minimizes Euclidian distance of Least Squire Method as objective function. Effectiveness of new proposed model is verified by comparing model results with other prioritization methods in the literature. For the second objective the proposed framework is exploited to solve personal selection problem reported in an earlier study.

Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) {{is one of the}} most well known branches of decision making and it is referring to making decision in the presence of multiple criteria. MCDM problem are common occurrences in everyday life. In 1977, Saaty introduced Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to solve the MCDM problem. The AHP is widely used for MCDM. Since AHP has been introduced, it has been applied in numerous situations with impressive results.

The AHPEC gives better result compare to the other prioritization methods based on accuracy of derived priorities. The comparison is based on the value of Total Deviation (TD) which is measure accuracy o the solution.
