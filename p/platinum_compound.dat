The three major <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> (cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin) have a similar pharmacokinetics profile and mechanism of action, but the differences in their chemical structure are responsible for their different antitumor activity and toxicity. In this review, we have described the main characteristics of cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, focusing on their toxic effects and possible strategies to prevent them to improve the clinical outcomes in pediatric cancer patients. The underlying mechanism of each platinum-related toxicity is shown together with the clinical manifestations. Furthermore, possible preventive strategies are suggested to reduce the negative impact of <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> on {{the quality of life of}} children with cancer. Cisplatin seems to be mostly ototoxic and nephrotoxic, carboplatin mainly produces myelosuppression, whereas oxaliplatin induces predominantly peripheral sensory neurotoxicity. In contrast, nausea and vomiting can be linked to all <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds,</b> although cisplatin exerts the strongest emetic effect.

This study included 160 patients treated with cisplatin and carboplatin for malignant solid diseases from 2007 to 2014.

The ligand binds to the metal ions in a bidentate fashion through the two nitrogen atoms in all prepared complexes. The reactivity of the complexes with the model nucleobase 9 -ethylguanine was studied.

40|$|AbstractDevelopment of {{resistance}} to <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> may involve not only overexpression of defence mechanisms but also alterations in cellular response to the drug-induced genotoxic stress. To investigate the cellular bases of response to <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds,</b> we examined the profile of gene expression of ovarian carcinoma cells exhibiting sensitivity (A 2780) or resistance (A 2780 /BBR 3464) to <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds.</b> Using display PCR, we found that acquisition {{of resistance}} to the multinuclear platinum complex BBR 3464 was associated with modulation of several transcripts, including up-regulation of the major substrate of protein kinase C (PKC), the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). This feature was associated with PKCα down-regulation. To explore the role of PKCα in cellular sensitivity to <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds,</b> resistant cells were transfected with a PKCα-containing vector. PKCα-overexpressing resistant cells exhibited a decrease in sensitivity to cisplatin, whereas no significant change in sensitivity to BBR 3464 was observed. A number of approaches designed to modulate the function or expression of PKCα support that the isoenzyme {{may play a role in}} determining resistance only to cisplatin but not to BBR 3464, which is known to activate a different pathway of cell response. In conclusion, in spite of PKCα down-regulation in our model, its regulatory function was not apparently implicated in the development {{of resistance to}} <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> and the present results do not support a general role of PKCα as a determinant of the resistance status...|$|R

A {{dissertation}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2015 Major Director: Nicholas P Farrell, Ph. D., Professor, Department of Chemistry <b>Platinum</b> anticancer <b>compounds</b> with cis geometry, similar to cisplatin, have been explored to circumvent the cisplatin resistance; however, they were not considered broadly active in cisplatin cells due to exhibiting similar or same cell death mechanism as cisplatin. <b>Platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> with trans geometry were less studied due to transplatin being clinically inactive; but with few structural modifications, they resulted in unaffected cytotoxic activities in cisplatin resistant cells with structural modification by exhibiting different modes of DNA binding. This research focused on further exploring and establishing structure-activity relationship of two promising non-classical series of <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> with trans-geometry: trans-platinum planar amine (TPA) compounds and noncovalently binding polynuclear <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> (PPC-NC). During this research, further optimizations of the reactivity of TPA compounds were accomplished by modifying the leaving carboxylate groups.

We obtained the uptake ratio from each scan and calculated the retention index:uptake ratio = region of interest uptake/contralateral normal lung uptake; retention index = (delayed ratio - early ratio) /early ratio. After 201 Tl scintigraphy, 12 patients received chemotherapy consisting of <b>platinum</b> <b>compounds</b> and nine were treated with chemoradiation.
