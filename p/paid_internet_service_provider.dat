The ruling right-wing coalition’s larger party, Fidesz made their proposal public on October 21, which is meant to extend the existing telecommunications tax to Internet usage.

[...] Flake received $22,700 in donations from <b>paid</b> lobbyists representing <b>Internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> and tech firms to sponsor the anti-privacy legislation. In April 2017, the legislation passed both GOP-controlled houses, allowing ISPs to sell consumer browsing history and other information without the user's consent.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{economic}} {{implications of a}} transition from a neutral to a non-neutral network. A mathematical model with an end to end ecosystem is developed, which includes a backbone <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> that provides connectivity for the content providers. The model also includes internet users that pay an access <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> for connectivity {{to interact with the}} content providers, advertisers that pay the content <b>providers,</b> and access <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> that charge the internet users for their connectivity. In the non-neutral regime, the content providers can pay the access <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> to access specialized services, a priority lane. The model is solved in a non-cooperative two stage game, and where the backbone and access <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> maximize their individual profits. Our analysis shows that the non-neutral unregulated regime always improves social welfare, investment and innovation levels, and lowers the congestion levels. We also show that the backbone <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> is always better off in the non-neutral regime, and therefore reduce the benefit of the other players. The result for the other players is generally positive in favor of a non-neutral regime, but much more ambiguous, especially for the access <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> We also show that moderate regulation can increase social welfare. However, even moderate regulation might severely impair individual players, and too much regulation may also impair the non-neutral regime so that the overall social welfare is worse than in the neutral regime. </p...|$|R
