5|$|USB2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip (HSIC) is a chip-to-chip {{variant of}} USB2.0 that {{eliminates}} the conventional analog transceivers found in normal USB. It was adopted {{as a standard}} by the USB Implementers Forum in 2007. The HSIC physical layer uses about 50% less power and 75% less board area compared to traditional USB2.0. HSIC uses two signals at 1.2V and has a throughput of 480Mbit/s. Maximum <b>PCB</b> <b>trace</b> length for HSIC is 10cm.

25|$|As soon as any {{connection}} within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength {{of the highest}} specified frequency (e.g., at 100MHz the wavelength is 3m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3cm) design properties radically change.

25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component.

In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E

Contrary to Integrated Circuits (ICs), the layout of <b>PCB</b> <b>traces</b> can be changed rather late in a product's design. Therefore, it is interesting to equip the PCB designer with simple tools that predict the immunity of his <b>PCB</b> <b>traces.</b> In this article, we compare two simulations of field-to-long line coupling based on Taylor's model. Firstly, the line is meshed into electrically short Taylor cells and numerically simulated using Kron's method. Secondly, we use one modified Taylor cell, which does not need meshing and is a closed-form, analytical result. The two simulations turn out to be equally precise on a straight microstrip line, the meshed simulation being more flexible, the simulation using a modified Taylor cell being faster...|$|R

Conventionally, the radiated emissions (REs) of electrically short <b>PCB</b> <b>traces</b> are estimated using expressions developed based on electric/magnetic dipole antenna. In this study, a novel method was proposed to estimate RE from electrically long <b>PCB</b> <b>traces.</b> In this method, the differential-mode (DM) RE was estimated using the transmission-line theory and dipole antenna model, whereas the common-mode (CM) RE was computed {{by a combination of}} imbalance difference model and a dipole antenna. Conceptually, the electrically long trace was chunked into multiple electrically short segments and the fields of each segment were superimposed to obtain the net radiated fields. Additionally, closed-form expressions were derived to estimate the DM REs from electrically long <b>PCB</b> <b>traces</b> based on dipole antenna model. On the other hand, CM RE was predicted by line integration of CM current distribution which was approximated using imbalance difference model and asymmetrical dipole antenna model. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using compact single-sided PCB by comparing the computed results with the measured results taken in a semi-anechoic chamber, and a good agreement with accuracy more than 90 % was observed for upper bounds of the REs...|$|R

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} clock {{speeds of}} {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) have imposed many challenges on the circuit designers, {{one of which is}} to pass the electromagnetic compatibility compliance testing for radiated emissions. It is essential to predict PCB radiated emissions prior to a compliance test with the aim to save cost and time.

In this paper, a prediction model is developed based on travelling wave antenna model to predict Differential Mode (DM) radiated emission from a high-speed <b>PCB</b> <b>traces</b> above a ground plane while Common Mode (CM) radiated emission is predicted based on monopole antenna model.

50|$|Bead probe {{can be used}} in {{circuits}} {{where the}} pin-pitch is too fine to allow standard test pads. This is becoming more common as pin pitches continue to reduce, particularly in embedded devices. Typically bead probe widths are the width of the PCB traces with a length of about three times this. This allows a high degree of flexibility in their positioning, and can in some cases be applied retrospectively to existing layouts.Because of their small size, bead probes do not affect the signal quality of the signals transferring within the <b>PCB</b> <b>trace.</b> This is especially useful in high speed input/output (HSIO) interconnects, where a standard test pad would interfere with the signal.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} {{situations}} where the tiny leakage of current through the insulating surfaces of a wire or <b>PCB</b> <b>trace</b> would otherwise cause error in the measurements or functionality of the device.

This is typically achieved using a voltage buffer/follower that matches the guard voltage to the wire voltage. The leakage from the shield to other circuit elements is of little concern as it is being sourced from the buffer which has a low output impedance.|$|E
