60|$|The Admiral {{visited her}} once in Simon's Bay, {{and she was}} bad, even for a flat-iron gunboat {{strictly}} designed for river and harbour defence. She sweated clammy drops of dew between decks {{in spite of a}} preparation of <b>powdered</b> <b>cork</b> that was sprinkled over her inside paint. She rolled in the long Cape swell like a buoy; her foc's'le was a dog-kennel; Judson's cabin was practically under the water- line; not one of her dead-bights could ever be opened; and her compasses, thanks to the influence of the four-inch gun, were a curiosity even among Admiralty compasses. But Bai-Jove-Judson was radiant and enthusiastic. He had even contrived to fill Mr. Davies, the second-class engine-room artificer, who was his chief engineer, with the glow of his passion. The Admiral, who remembered his own first command, when pride forbade him to slacken off a single rope on a dewy night, and he had racked his rigging to pieces in consequence, looked at the flat-iron keenly. Her fenders were done all over with white sennit which was truly white; her big gun was varnished with a better composition than the Admiralty allowed; the spare sights were cased as carefully as the chronometers; the chocks for spare spars, two of them, were made of four-inch Burma teak carved with dragons' heads that was one result of Bai-Jove-Judson's experiences with the Naval Brigade in the Burmese war; the bow-anchor was varnished instead of being painted, and there were charts more than the Admiralty scale supplied. The Admiral was well pleased, for he loved a ship's husband - a man who had a little money of his own and was willing to spend it on his command. Judson looked at him hopefully. He was only a Junior Navigating Lieutenant under eight years' standing. He might be kept in Simon's Bay for six months, and his ship at sea was his delight. The dream of his heart was to enliven her dismal official gray with a line of gold-leaf and perhaps a little scroll-work at her blunt barge-like bows.|$|E

The cork processing industry is highly resource-efficient, with the only residue, <b>cork</b> <b>powder,</b> which is too minor in quantity for agglomerate production. This work studied the usage of <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> for the production of added-value products via polyol liquefaction. Liquefactions were performed in a reactor using a mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) and glycerol as solvents, which were catalyzed by the addition of sulphuric acid.

Polyurethane foams were prepared by combining polyol mixtures with a catalyst, surfactant, blowing agent, and polymeric isocyanate. Mechanical tests of the produced foams were conducted, and compressive modulus of elasticity and compressive stress at 10 % deformation were determined. The results show that the best conditions for obtaining high liquefaction yields are as follows: 160 ºC for 1 h; glycerol-to-PEG 400 ratio of 1 : 9; cork-to-solvent ratio of 1 : 6; and 3 % H 2 SO 4 catalyst addition. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated that the lignocellulosic fractions of the cork were more selectively dissolved during acidified polyol liquefaction than the suberin.

Therefore, reinforcing strategies must be considered to increase the mechanical performance, especially when high content of <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> is added to the formulation. Coconut fibres have several advantages, such as, low density, renewable source, low cost and biodegradability. The use of these fibres on the reinforcement of CPC materials will not only contribute to improve the mechanical performance but also for increasing the amount of natural component present on the final composition. The main goal of this work was to prepare HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites reinforced with discontinuous coconut fibres (5 and 10 wt. %) with and without the addition of coupling agent (2 wt. %) by extrusion. The developed reinforced cork based composites were characterized regarding its morphology and mechanical performance. Optical micrographs have shown a homogeneous distribution of the fibres. The coupling agent effect on CPC performance was also investigated. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the reinforced composites were significantly improved with the addition of coupling agent. The use of 10 wt. % of coconut fibres in the presence of coupling agent promote an increase on maximum tensile strength of around 41 % comparing with the HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the tensile fractured specimens confirmed that the use of coupling agent promoted the interfacial adhesion between the fibres and the thermoplastic matrix.

Although strength is acceptable for 10 % cement replacement with cork ash (5 % loss at 90 days, compared to control), most durability properties (tested up to 6 months according to test type) reduced performance probably due to a broader pore structure caused by coarse particles in the ash which tested non pozzolanic.

Cork boiling wastewater (CBW) is an aqueous and complex effluent of the cork industry which is produced during the boiling of the cork planks. CBW contains organic materials such as phenolic.

The samples prepared from chemical activation of the biomass residues show reasonably high removal efficiencies along with fast rate of adsorption, which are in fact comparable to commercial carbons. The analysis of the carbon samples after adsorbing the analgesic showed that adsorbent–adsorbate affinity is stronger in hydrophobic carbons of basic character that contain a well-developed microporosity. These characteristics are however not sufficient for an overall performance of a carbon in acetaminophen removal. The carbon must also have a well interconnected pore network (to facilitate the accessibility of acetaminophen molecules, thus speeding up adsorption kinetics) and an adequate chemical composition, which ultimately leads to a high adsorption capacity.

There are many processes described in the literature to increase the toughness, {{one of the most common}} being the use of rubber particles. In the present study, natural micro particles of cork were used with the objective to increase the impact resistance of a brittle epoxy adhesive. The idea is for the cork particles to act like crack stoppers and absorb impact leading to higher absorption of energy. The influence of the cork particle size and amount were studied. Particles of cork ranging from 38 to 250 µm were mixed in the epoxy adhesive Araldite® 2020 from Huntsman. The amount of cork in the adhesive was varied between 1 and 5 % by weight. Surface treatment (low pressure plasma) was applied to the <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> to assess the effect of the interaction adhesive-cork with several degrees of adhesion. This evaluation was made using impact tests and it was evident that impact absorption was related to the size and amount of cork particles in the resin, considering a uniform particle distribution. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|High density {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) and <b>cork</b> <b>powder</b> were compounded in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder {{to obtain}} cork-polymer composites (CPC) with improved properties. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) {{was used as}} initiator agent, and suberin or lignin isolated from cork enhanced filler-matrix bonding and promoted mechanical reinforcement with environmental benefits. The novel composites were characterised in terms of dimensional stability, evolution of morphology, thermal and mechanical properties and their performance was {{compared with that of}} composites containing polyethylene-grafted maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA) as coupling agent. As expected, composites with coupling agent present higher mechanical properties, lower water uptake and thickness swelling variation. Suberin acts as plasticizer with antioxidant benefits, while lignin works as a coupling agent, improving tensile modulus and maximum strength. Increasing lignin content does not improve the mechanical properties but improves thermal stability. The work was performed within the project of Corticeira Amorim S. G. P.
