2500|$|On August 30, 1928, the Marion Palace Theatre {{opened to}} a packed house for two performances. At the first performance, Colonel George B. Christian gave a brief opening address. The father of President Warren G. Harding's secretary, George B. Christian Jr., the elder Christian was {{actively}} involved in Marion's civic life. His remarks included a short history of theatres in Marion, and he praised {{the beauty of the}} building. John Eberson then made a few remarks and introduced Young. He presented Young with a bag of birdseed, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the stuffed pigeons that Eberson had installed to create the feeling of being outdoors at the Palace. The entertainment began with organ music by Banks Kennedy, a well-known Chicago organist. He had written a new composition, which he titled [...] "Everybody's Welcome to the Palace." [...] Next was a theatre overture, [...] "A Night in the Clock Store," [...] by the Palace Orchestra under the direction of Elmer Newstrom. Four vaudeville acts followed: Harry Kahne, a nationally known mental wizard; Tilyou and Rogers, a comedy team; Johnny Mack and Company (including Ethel Dunton, Dolly Moran and Shirley Manion); and the Castlemans, a trio of entertainers. Following the live acts, a Metro-Goldwin-Mayer silent picture, Excess Baggage (1928 film), starring William Haines, Josephine Dunn and Ricardo Cortez, was shown. The film is now lost. The owner had hoped to open the theatre with the new [...] "talkie" [...] equipment. While the theatre was <b>pre-wired</b> for sound motion pictures, the equipment did not arrive until the following year.|$|E

5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social <b>pre-wiring</b> hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior.

Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|R

50|$|By the 1980s cable {{television}} was well-established {{as the most}} popular multi-channel television reception system in Ireland.

5000|$|The long-running nature versus nurture {{debate is}} about whether human {{behaviour}} {{is determined by}} the environment, either prenatal or during a person's life, or by a person's genes.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} nature of specific phobias, describes the range of stimuli that commonly act as phobic stimuli, and then continues by discussing theories of the aetiology of phobias and the most common forms of treatment. Traditional theories of phobias have alluded to learning through classical conditioning or the biological <b>pre-wiring</b> of phobic responses {{as a result of}} evolutionary pressures. However, it is now agreed that different subtypes of phobias may have different aetiologies and be acquired through quite different psychological mechanisms. Arguably the most successful forms of treatment for specific phobias are exposure therapies, including flooding, counterconditioning and systematic desensitization. These have been supplemented more recently by one-session rapid treatments that combine principles of both behavioural and cognitive therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{house is}} hardly ever {{adequate}} {{to support the}} requirements of aging people and shelter them when they lose their autonomy. Home automation effectively encourages the independence of vulnerable users in their own homes, but its application is highly expensive because houses are not designed to accommodate it. The added value of home automation {{is not to be}} found in energy efficiency only, but also in creating new humanenvironment interactions for vulnerable users. This paper aims at reflecting on the possibility to design “inclusive houses” fitted with the necessary <b>pre-wiring</b> for basic home automation, as well as with all the necessary features for a dwelling to adapt to its users’ changing requirements over time. This will be possible by supplementing the preset systems installed during the construction phase. When a home is future-proofed for home automation, the home becomes a place where people can live in any stage of their lives, also when some skills are hampered by ageing. Usually the requirements of the tenants evolve at the same speed as technology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a device that}} creates ubiquitous interactive graphics in a real world environment {{without the need for}} <b>pre-wiring</b> surfaces or requiring users to carry or wear any special devices. Called the Everywhere Displays projector, or ED-projector, this device employs steerability as the key principle to achieve the promise of ubiquitous computing and augmented reality. The ED-projector uses an LCD projector with a steerable mirror to project graphics onto any pre-calibrated surface, while warping the projected image to correct for oblique distortion. Three different methods to determine this warping function are given. To sense user interaction with the projected image, the ED-projector employs a pan/tilt/zoom camera and a motion-based computer vision system to track the user's hand and touch-like gestures. We propose a system software structure that ties together steering, display, and sensing. Three implemented applications demonstrate the notion of ubiquitously "painting" the real world with interactive graphics, {{in the context of a}} futuristic office, an augmented assembly task, and a ubiquitous computer game. The observation of hundreds of users performing the assembly task suggests that the traditional desktop paradigm is inadequate for ubiquitous interaction and that new conceptual widgets and interaction paradigms must be developed...|$|R
