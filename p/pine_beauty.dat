40|$|To control {{insect pests}} with a virus, it is {{important}} to determine the optimum time for the treatment. However, before analysing this problem, a realistic model for the uninfected host must be developed.

40|$|The {{community}} {{composition of}} Carabid beetles, some species {{of which are}} known predators of <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth, was examined within a Scottish plantation forest. Sites differing in soil type and the species of trees planted were sampled with pitfall traps in most weeks of a 3 -year period. There were faunal differences between sites with lodgepole pine on deep peat and other sites in the study (lodgepole pine on iron-pan soil, species mixture of lodgepole and Scots pine, and pure stands of Scots pine). In general deep peat sites supported fewer species and individuals of carabids. Three Carabus species were implicated as likely predators of Panolis flammea pupae and each was less abundant on the sites with lodgepole pine. It is suggested that the susceptibility to <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth of lodgepole pine growing on deep peat substrates is at least partly attributable to impoverished predator faunas...|$|E
40|$|Multispecies sex {{pheromone}} trapping (trapping of {{more than}} one species in the same trap) for the pine shoot moth Rhyacionia buoliana, the pine moth, Dendrolimus pini, the nun moth, Lymantria monacha, the <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth, Panolis flammea and the pine sawflies Diprion pini and Neodiprion sertifer was evaluated. The catch from traps baited with the pheromone of a single species was compared with the catch from traps baited with pheromones for several species. The catch in the multispecies traps was significantly reduced in comparison with the single species traps for Dendrolimus pini, L. monacha and N. sertifer. Neodiprion sertifer was most likely inhibited by the Diprion pini pheromone. A follow-up study of Dendrolimus pini and L. monacha showed no pheromonal interference between them. Further studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of multispecies monitoring. However, for practical applications a slight decrease in catch, due to pheromonal interference, could probably be tolerated as long as the catch reflects total population density...|$|E
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly apparent that many pathogen populations, including those of insects, show high levels of genotypic variation. Baculoviruses {{are known to be}} highly variable, with isolates collected from the same species in different geographical locations frequently showing genetic variation and differences in their biology. More recent Studies at smaller scales have also shown that virus DNA profiles from individual larvae can show polymorphisms within and between populations of the same species. Here, we investigate the genotypic and phenotypic variation of an insect baculovirus infection within a single insect host. Twenty four genotypically distinct nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) variants were isolated from an individual <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth, Panolis flammea, caterpillar by in vivo cloning techniques. No variant appeared to be dominant in the population. The Pafl NPV variants have been mapped using three restriction endonucleases and shown to contain three hypervariable regions containing insertions of 70 - 750 bp. Comparison of seven of these variants in an alternative host, Mamestra brassicae, demonstrated that the variants differed significantly in both pathogenicity and speed of kill. The generation and maintenance of pathogen heterogeneity are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Larvae of the <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth Panolis flammae (Denis & Schiffermuller) were {{reared in}} sleeve cages on five {{different}} seed origins (provenances) of pole stage Pinus contorta {{in the field}} in each of four years from 1985 to 1988. Survival varied significantly between the years. In those years when survival was high, significant differences between tree provenance were not found. However, between provenance significant differences were found in larval weight and stage of development. In the years when survival was low, the results seen in good years were reversed. Significant differences attributable to provenance were found but these were not reflected in significant differences between larval weight or development. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the proportion surviving and larval weight, which was not the case in those years where larval survival was high. The results are discussed in light of the pest status of P, flammea in Britain and in view of current silvicultural policies. The use of trees resistant to insect attack as part of an integrated pest management programme is highlighted and the need to coordinate laboratory and field studies so as to control for environmental variation discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth (Panolis flammea D&S, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were reared {{individually}} from egg {{hatch to}} pupation {{on one of}} three host plants, Pinus sylvestris (native host plant), Pinus contorta (Central Interior seed origin - good quality introduced host) and P. contorta (Alaskan seed origin - poor quality introduced host). After emerging from the pupae the adult moths were confined to a Skeena River seed origin of P. contorta. Female pupal weight and adult life span were significantly higher on P. sylvestris than on the two lodgepole pine seed origins. Development time was, however, not significantly different between treatments, but larval mean relative growth rate {{was found to be}} negatively correlated with birth weight and positively correlated with pupal weight. The time to emerge from the pupa was also not significantly different between treatments. However, there were marked differences between the genders. Male moths lost a significantly greater proportion of their weight over the pupal stage but lived significantly longer as adults than the females. Female moths emerged from the pupal stage significantly sooner than male moths. There was no apparent advantage of lai-ge birth size when looked at in terms of subsequent performance. These results are discussed in light of current life history theory...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth, Panolis flammea (Denis & Schifferm√ºller), is {{a recent}} but {{persistent}} pest of lodgepole pine plantations in Scotland, but exists naturally at low levels within remnants and plantations of Scots pine. To test whether separate host races occur in lodgepole and Scots pine stands and to examine colonization dynamics, allozyme, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and mitochondrial variation were screened within a range of Scottish samples. RAPD analysis indicated limited long distance dispersal (FST = 0. 099), and significant isolation by distance (P < 0. 05); but that colonization between more proximate populations was often variable, from extensive to limited exchange. When compared with material from Germany, Scottish samples {{were found to be}} more diverse and significantly differentiated for all markers. For mtDNA, two highly divergent groups of haplotypes were evident, one group contained both German and Scottish samples and the other was predominantly Scottish. No genetic differentiation was evident between P. flammea populations sampled from different hosts, and no diversity bottleneck was observed in the lodgepole group. Indeed, lodgepole stands appear to have been colonized on multiple occasions from Scots pine sources and neighbouring populations on different hosts are close to panmixia. A. J. Lowe, B. J. Hicks, K. Worley, R. A. Ennos, J. D. Morman, G. Stone and A. D. Wat...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that populations of microparasites vary genotypically {{at a variety}} of spatial scales, including within host individuals. Understanding this fine-scale structuring of microparasite populations requires descriptions of the relative fitness of individual genotypes isolated from natural mixed infections. Here we examine whether differences between virus genotypes isolated from a single host individual translate into phenotypic differences, and discuss the processes by which such variation might be maintained. Twenty-five genotypic variants of a nucleopolyhedrovirus (Baculoviridae) have been identified and purified from a single <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth (Panolis flammea) larva. The phenotypes of four genotypes were compared. Genotypes differed in three phenotypic traits, each predicted to be an important component of fitness: pathogenicity, speed of kill and yield. Variation in pathogenicity was described by seven-fold differences in LD 50 and by differences in the slopes of the fitted dose‚Äì response curves. Mean speed of kill of the genotypes differed by up to 36 h. Two genotypes produced 65 % higher yields, over and above any differences predicted by a significant intra-genotypic relationship between yield and speed of kill. Inter-genotypic trade-offs between virus phenotypic traits, which could promote the co-existence of genotypes, were not found. Mechanisms that may promote the co-existence of competing virus genotypes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{genotypic}} relatedness {{of persistent}} baculovirus infections within UK populations of Mamestra brassicae {{was assessed by}} sequencing amplified regions from polyhedrin and ie 1. Most populations harboured Mamestra brassicae (Mb) nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) which showed very little genotypic variation between populations. However, one population harboured a virus that closely resembled a baculovirus found previously only in <b>Pine</b> <b>Beauty</b> Moth (Panolis flammea) populations in Scotland. Persistent baculoviruses that had emerged spontaneously as lethal, overt infections from two of the insect populations were compared with the type strain of MbNPV and a mixture of P. flammea (Pafl) NPV strains, isolated from a single host, by bioassay in virus-free Spodoptera exigua larvae. Reactivated baculoviruses were as pathogenic as the stock virus and showed phenotypic characteristics closest to the type strain they most resembled genetically. Sequence data from the insect host cytochrome oxidase genes were compared and showed {{a high degree of}} sequence conservation between populations and {{it was not possible to}} determine whether the persistent baculovirus infections had arisen on many occasions or whether they represented a single initial infection that had spread with the host. However, the presence of two distinct virus genotypes in separate M. brassicae populations suggests multiple colonisations of the host are a possibilit...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of many DNA virus populations in nature is unknown, {{but for those}} that have been studied it {{has been found to be}} relatively high. This is particularly true for baculoviruses, a family of large double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the larval stages of insects. Why there should be such heterogeneity within these virus populations is puzzling and what sustains it is still unknown. It has long been recognized that some baculoviruses have a relatively wide host range, but the effect of different host species on the genotypic structure of a baculovirus population has received little attention. We provide evidence that infection of different insect species can influence the {{genetic diversity}} of a Panolis flammea nucleopolyhedrovirus (PaflNPV) population, isolated from the <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth. Variable regions of the PaflNPV genome were sequenced and novel ORFs were identified on each of the enlarged fragments. The roles of these orfs and the implications of their presence or absence within different genotypes are discussed. The variable fragments were also labelled with 32 P and used as polymorphic genetic markers of genotype abundance. The proportion of polymorphic loci changed after passage in different insect species and this varied among species, suggesting a role for host selection of pathogen genotypes in the field as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity. These results have wide-ranging implications for understanding the ecology of insect‚Äìvirus interactions in the natural environment and the evolution of baculovirus life history strategies...|$|E
40|$|The genus Panolis is a {{small group}} of noctuid moths with six {{recognized}} species distributed from Europe to East Asia, and best known for containing the widespread Palearctic pest species P. flammea, the <b>pine</b> <b>beauty</b> moth. However, a reliable classification and robust phylogenetic framework for this group of potentially economic importance are currently lacking. Here, we use morphological and molecular data (mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16 S ribosomal RNA, nuclear gene elongation factor- 1 alpha) to reconstruct the phylogeny of this genus, with a comprehensive systematic revision of all recognized species and a new one, P. ningshan sp. nov. The analysis results of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferring methods for the combined morphological and molecular data sets are highly congruent, resulting in a robust phylogeny and identification of two clear species groups, i. e., the P. flammea species group and the P. exquisita species group. We also estimate the divergence times of Panolis moths using two conventional mutation rates for the arthropod mitochondrial COI gene with a comparison of two molecular clock models, as well as reconstruct their ancestral areas. Our results suggest that 1) Panolis is a young clade, originating from the Oriental region in China in the Late Miocene (6 - 10 Mya), with an ancestral species in the P. flammea group extending northward to the Palearctic region some 3 - 6 Mya; 2) there is a clear possibility for a representative of the Palearctic clade to become established as an invasive species in the Nearctic taiga...|$|E
