The aim {{of this investigation was}} to find the relationship of certain <b>chromatic</b> <b>colours</b> with certain quality of tastes, but the general phenomena of synesthesia and the symbolism of Mediterranean were involved in that relationship. One group of schizophrenic patients from Rijeka and one group of healthy individuals from Rijeka were included in this investigation. Specific questionnaire with four <b>chromatic</b> <b>colours</b> (3 elementary: red, blue and yellow and I secondary- green) has been used in this research. There is the certain accordance between these groups relating to red and sweet i. e. blue and salty, but there is less difference due to green and certain quality of taste (schizophrenic patients preferred green and acid and healthy individuals preferred green and bitter). There is difference according to yellow and certain sense of taste : schizophrenic patients connected yellow with acid, bitter and sweet, but healthy individuals mostly connected yellow with acid. The strong connection between red and sweet i. e. blue and salty was general conclusion of this research. The connection between blue and salty could be result of consciousness of live at the Adriatic coast i. e. in Mediterranean. The advice after this investigation is: to extend this research at Middle Europe according to maybe experience of synesthesia and to avoid limitation and general conclusions...|$|R

40|$|The {{noise in}} color images which is {{referred}} to as chromatic noise represents a distribution within three spectral bands and contributes to chromatic and achromatic visual effects. The chromatic noise depends very strongly on the spatial frequency response of the visual system. Therefore, this study characterizes the variation in <b>perceived</b> <b>chromatic</b> noise level and generates the noise field to add to the color image samples. From these degraded images, we found that noise in low spatial frequencies is much more disturbing than in the medium and high spatial frequency regions.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} related to colour reproduction in the darker regions of the print. The limitations to the printer’s colour gamut restrict the ability to replicate {{a vast number of}} colours that can be achieved with printmaking and paint colourants. And despite the options in rendering intents, the reproduction of out of gamut colour immediately becomes a trade off between colour accuracy and maintaining the relationships between adjacent colours. Many problematic colours are predominantly seen in the darker, yet still <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> regions of the gamut. Furthermore, dark colours tend to be printed by mixing the chromatic ink colourants with high proportions of black ink. The black then dominates the printed colour, leading to a smaller perceivable gamut of printed dark colour. Here distinctions between hues with perceivable differences in blackness tend to be lost in print despite observers still being able to perceive hue difference at 20 % lightness level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>perceived</b> {{speed of}} <b>chromatic</b> motion was {{investigated}} for gratings that stimulate each chromatic mechanism [L−M and S−(L+M) ] in isolation and for gratings that stimulate both chromatic systems. The observers' task consisted of adjusting {{the speed of}} a drifting achromatic grating to match the perceived speed of an isoluminant chromatic grating, drifting at 8 deg/s (temporal frequency of 4 Hz). Every observer reported a substantial decrease in <b>perceived</b> speed for <b>chromatic</b> gratings modulated along the S−(L+M) (blue–yellow) cardinal axis compared to other directions in color space. One observer even reported motion standstill for gratings modulated along this axis. Further testing demonstrates that the perceived speed of an isoluminant chromatic grating depends solely {{on the extent to which}} it stimulates the L−M (red–green) mechanism. Thus, under the conditions that were tested, the S−(L+M) postreceptoral mechanism does not appear to contribute significantly to determining the <b>perceived</b> speed of <b>chromatic</b> motion...|$|R

Using measurements of the chromatic statistics of natural environments, we show that the retina balances inputs from the two (red and blue) stimulated colour channels, as would be expected from theoretical optimal behaviour.

40|$|Most mammals have dichromatic {{colour vision}} {{based on two}} {{different}} types of cones: a short-wavelength-sensitive cone and a long-wavelength-sensitive cone. Comparing the signal from two cone types gives rise to a one-dimensional chromatic space when brightness is excluded. The so-called ‘neutral point’ refers to the wavelength that the animal cannot distinguish from achromatic light such as white or grey because it stimulates both cone types equally. The question is: how do dichromats <b>perceive</b> their <b>chromatic</b> space? Do they experience a continuous scale of colours or does the neutral point divide their chromatic space into two colour categories, i. e. into colours of either short or long wavelengths? We trained horses to different colour combinations in a two-choice behavioural experiment and tested their responses to the training and test colours. The horses chose colours according to their similarity/relationship to rewarded and unrewarded training colours. There was no evidence for a categorical boundary at the neutral point or elsewhere.

For animals that rely on crypsis to avoid predators, one solution is to alter their behaviour or appearance to maximize crypsis {{in ways that are}} specific to different types of predator. We tested whether dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion transvaalense) showed different behavioural responses, including colour change, towards multiple predators (bird and snake models) that detect and capture prey in different ways, and whether these antipredator responses varied geographically. Chameleons consistently used the same body postures (lateral compression and flipping to {{the opposite side of the}} branch) and displayed similar <b>chromatic</b> (<b>colour)</b> contrast against the natural background in response to both predator types. However, they became significantly more achromatically contrasting (brighter) in the presence of the snake compared to the bird. This relative difference in achromatic contrast towards the two types of predator was consistent among populations. There were also significant differences in both absolute achromatic and chromatic contrast among populations despite very similar light environment, background coloration and habitat structure.

40|$|Based {{on our own}} {{observations}} and on scientific and scholarly references this paper discusses the appearance of colour constancy and the adaptation of colour and lightness in space. It presents {{part of an ongoing}} work, the aim of which is to formulate a spatially based colour knowledge. Our scientific approach is holistic and mainly directed towards colour and light phenomena as such, not towards underlying physiological processes. Earlier research has discussed lightness perception in colours very near neutral grey, with so low chromaticness that you can ignore the hue. In our research we have found that surfaces with nominally <b>chromatic</b> <b>colours</b> under special circumstances can be perceived as white and thus serve as anchors for perception of other colours in the field of vision. We also discuss how distinctions are made between perceived colours caused by on the light colour and such caused by the surface qualities. What we call adaptation is not limited to basic perception.

40|$|Andersen and Hardeberg {{proposed}} the Hue Plane Preserving Colour Correction (HPPCC) [1], which maps RGBs to XYZs using {{a set of}} linear transforms, where each transform is learned and applied in a subregion of colour space, defined by two adjacent hue planes. A hue plane is a geometrical half-plane defined by the neutral axis and a <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour.</b> A problem with the original HPCC method is that the selection of chromatic colors was a user defined choice (and the user might choose poorly) and the method as formed was not open to optimization. In this paper we present a flexible method of hue plane preserving colour correction which we call Hue Plane Preserving Colour Correction using Constrained Least Squares (HPPCC-CLSQ). This colorimetric characterization method is also based {{on a series of}} 3 by 3 matrices, each responsible for the transformation of a subregion, defined by two adjacent hue planes, of camera RGB values to the corresponding subregion of estimated colorimetric XYZ values. The matrices are constrained to white point preservation. In this new formulation, the subregions can flexibly be chosen in number and position in order to regularize and optimize the results, whilst constraining continuity crossing the hue planes. The method is compared to a choice of other state-of-the-art characterization methods and the results show that our method consistently gives high colorimetric accuracy for both synthetic and real camera data...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinct}} behaviours {{of animals}} and the varied habitats in which animals live place different requirements on their visual systems. A trade-off exists between resolution and sensitivity, with these properties varying across the retina. Spectral sensitivity, which affects both achromatic and <b>chromatic</b> (<b>colour)</b> vision, also varies across the retina, though the function of this inhomogeneity is less clear. We previously demonstrated spatially varying spectral sensitivity of double cones in the cichlid fish Metriaclima zebra owing to coexpression of different opsins. Here, we map the distributions of ganglion cells and cone cells and quantify opsin coexpression in single cones to show these also vary across the retina. We identify an area centralis with peak acuity and infrequent coexpression, which may be suited for tasks such as foraging and detecting male signals. The peripheral retina has reduced ganglion cell densities and increased opsin coexpression. Modeling of cichlid visual tasks indicates that coexpression might hinder colour discrimination of foraging targets and some fish colours. But, coexpression might improve contrast detection of dark objects against bright backgrounds, which might be useful for detecting predators or zooplankton. This suggests a trade-off between acuity and colour discrimination in the central retina versus lower resolution but more sensitive contrast detection in the peripheral retina. Significant variation {{in the pattern of}} coexpression among individuals, however, raises interesting questions about the selective forces at work...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work {{described in this}} thesis embodies {{a number of studies}} designed to investigate human vision with emphasis on aspects of the pupil response and chromatic mechanisms in relation to the <b>perceived</b> <b>chromatic</b> afterimages. The aim of the first study was to establish the relationship between the perception of chromatic afterimages and the corresponding involuntary pupil responses. We started by designing and developing a new, computer-based, psychophysics program and employed it to measure the strength and duration of <b>perceived</b> <b>chromatic</b> afterimages in normal trichromats and in colour deficient observers. The dynamic luminance noise technique was used to isolate colour signals and to elicit pupil responses to coloured stimuli of known photoreceptor contrast. A model was developed to explain the afterimage results obtained in the normal trichromats and in colour deficient subjects. The model and the pupil colour responses provided an understanding of luminance and colour processing in dichromats that also helped to explain previously reported pupil colour responses. The model also predicts the colour confusion lines and the characteristics of pupil colour responses in dichromats at any given background chromaticity. In the second study, we investigated and compared pupil responses to visual stimuli that isolate photopic luminance and colour in both the sighted and blind region of the visual fields on subjects with either acquired or congenital homonymous hemianopia. The measured pupil responses in the blind hemifield of patients with acquired cortical damage are either absent or of reduced amplitude when compared to those measured in the corresponding regions of the sighted field, whereas the patients with congenital loss of visual field show similar and even enhanced pupil responses when compared to their sighted hemifield. These results suggest that in the absence of normal functioning of the direct geniculostriate projection, other projections to midbrain nuclei or to extrastriate regions can be enhanced and these include the pupillary pathways. These findings suggest that early damage to the brain might be partly compensated for by reorganising the strength of neural projections to the remaining, non-compromised visual areas. The purpose of the last study was to examine whether melanopsin contributes to the dynamic pupil light reflex responses in humans. A light source containing of four primary components was employed to generate pupillary stimuli that isolate luminance, colour or combined rod and melanopsin. Normal trichormats, rod deficient subjects, one subject with retinitis pigmentosa, one rod monochromat, three subjects with Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) and one subject with Optic Neuritis were investigated using this approach. The results from the LHON subjects suggest not all classes of ganglion cells are affected uniformly in LHON, and that the pupil light reflex responses mediated through rod photoreceptors were affected the least. The characteristics of the pupil responses to the rod/melanopsin stimulus from the rod monochromat and the retinis pigmentosa subjects suggest that melanopsin does not contribute to dynamic pupil light reflex response in humans...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{calibration}} experiments were run {{in order to}} determine the effect of the colour of suspended sediment on the response of optical backscatter sensors (OBS). Munsell notation describes the properties of soil and sediment colour using the three parameters, hue, chroma, and value, which represent, respectively, the spectral position, lightness level, and amount of pure <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> present. The exposure of the OBS to Munsell Soil Chart patches revealed that the OBS is sensitive to variations in Munsell value and not Munsell hue or chroma. Since OBS output decreased with darkness level (and increased with lightness level and Munsell value), it is suggested that the level of blackness of particles acts to absorb the near-infrared (IR) signal of the OBS, modifying its output. A strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 984) was found between the observed and predicted OBS outputs of varying concentrations and ratios of black and white suspended sediment. The OBS output was predicted using a linear mixture-model incorporating end-member calibrations of black and white sediment (similar to Green and Boon [Green, M. O., Boon, J. D., III, 1993.

40|$|Whereas {{humans have}} {{three types of}} cone photoreceptor, birds have four types of single cones and, unlike humans, are {{sensitive}} to ultraviolet light (UV, 320 - 400 run). Most birds {{are thought to have}} either a violet-sensitive single cone that has some sensitivity to UV wavelengths (for example, many non-passerine species) or a single cone that has maximum sensitivity to UV (for example, oscine passerine. species). UV sensitivity is possible because, unlike humans, avian ocular media do not absorb UV light before it reaches the retina. The different single cone types and their sensitivity to UV light give birds the potential to discriminate reflectance spectra that look identical to humans. It is clear that birds use UV signals for a number of visual tasks, but there are few studies that directly demonstrate a role for UV in the detection of chromaticity differences (i. e. colour vision) as opposed to achromatic brightness. If the output of the violet/UV cone is used in achromatic visual tasks, objects reflecting more UV will appear brighter to the bird. 11, however, the output is used in a chromatic mechanism, birds will be able to discriminate spectral stimuli according to the amount of reflected light in the UV part of the spectrum relative to longer wavelengths. We have developed a UV 2 ̆ 7 colour blindness 2 ̆ 7 test, which we have given to a passerine (European starling) and a non-passerine (Japanese quail) species. Both species learnt to discriminate between a longwave control of orange vs red stimuli and UV vs 2 ̆ 7 non-UV 2 ̆ 7 stimuli, which were designed to be impossible to differentiate by achromatic mechanisms.

A completely automated system means a computer will perforin the entire task from low level detection to higher level motion analysis. Since conventional system practically using human power to monitor and did not applicable for a long hour monitoring, thus automated system had been created to replace the conventional system. This thesis focuses on a method to detect and classify a moving object that pass through the surveillance area boundary. Moving object is detected by using combination of two frame differencing and adaptive image averaging with selectivity. Technically, this method estimate the motion area before updates the background by taking a weighted average of non-motion area of the current background altogether with non-motion area of the current frame of the video sequence. This step had created a focus of attention for higher level processing and it helps to decrease computation time considerably. The output of a motion-based detector is essentially a collection of foreground that might correspond to the moving objects. But usually the output image produced from this process contaminated with noise and shadow. As a solution, morphological operation has been employed as an approach to remove noise from the foreground object. Mutual shadow that exists with the object had been abolished by combining <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> values with lightness variable. Then, standardized moment invariant is employed to extract the features for each moving blobs. To recognize these blobs, the calculated moment values are fed to a support vector machine module that is equipped with trained extracted moment values for human and vehicle silhouettes.

The main experimental paradigm {{to investigate the}} issues is within that of simulated shape from shading. 3 -D impressions are induced by projecting space-modulated illuminations onto flat surfaces (displays), varying the colours and layout of the displays and the colour and modulation of the illumination. Study I includes four experiments investigating three types of space- modulated illumination. All experiments confirmed earlier findings that <b>chromatic</b> <b>colour</b> and complex display layout with reflectance edges crossed by illumination edges enhances shape from shading. In Study II the impressions of shape from shading and real 3 -D objects were compared between persons with deutan colour vision deficiencies and normals. As predicted, the deutans show fewer and less distinct 3 -D impressions in situations with their specific "problem colours" red and green. They also show a generally lower tendency for 3 -D impressions, interpreted as a generally weaker colour constancy. Study III presents the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon; a novel twofold ambiguous shape from shading situation, continuously alternating between two different 3 -D impressions coupled with different colour attributions. One solution is of an object with two clear surface colours, the other one of an object with greyish (desaturated) colours in coloured illumination which means classical colour constancy. The phenomenon illustrates the visual processes of separating reflectance and illumination characteristics and may provide a useful experimental setting to study colour constancy. In Study IV the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon {{is found to be}} robust as to chromaticness and different luminance contrasts for both normals and deutans. However, the deutans show slower shifts between percepts and a less pronounced desaturation of colour, which indicates a weaker colour constancy. The studies add evidence to the contribution of colour to 3 -D shape perception, validated in a novel way by the results on "colour-blinds". The AMBEGUJAS phenomenon provides further support that the factors affecting shape from shading and the deutans different impressions are to be understood with reference to colour constancy. The deutans different impressions compared to normals are remarkable per se, but probably with very limited implications to everyday life. Diss.
