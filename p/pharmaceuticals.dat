5|$|Lactacystin, {{a natural}} product {{synthesized}} by Streptomyces bacteria, {{was the first}} non-peptidic proteasome inhibitor discovered and is widely used as a research tool in biochemistry and cell biology.

This discovery helped to establish the proteasome as a mechanistically novel class of protease: an amino-terminal threonine protease.|$|E
