5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as {{a limited time}} offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E

25|$|Glass is {{characterized}} by a high degree of corrosion-resistance. Because of its high water-resistance it is often used as <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> material in the pharma industry since most medicines are preserved in a watery solution. Besides its water-resistance, glass is also very robust when being exposed to chemically aggressive liquids or gases. While other materials like metal or plastics quickly reach their limits, special glass-types can easily hold up.|$|E

In 2004, the FDA approved CO as <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> method, declaring that CO does not mask spoilage odor. Despite this ruling, the process remains controversial for fears that it masks spoilage. In 2007, a bill was introduced to the United States House of Representatives to label modified atmosphere carbon monoxide packaging as a color additive, but the bill died in subcommittee. The process is banned in many other countries, including Japan, Singapore, and the European Union.|$|E

50|$|The flight {{instrumentation}} system {{is composed of}} a <b>primary</b> instrumentation <b>package</b> and an auxiliary <b>package.</b> The <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> instrumentation measures those parameters critical to all engine static firings and subsequent vehicle launches. These include some 70 parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and valve positions for the engine components, with the capability of transmitting signals to a ground recording system or a telemetry system, or both. The {{instrumentation system}} is designed for use throughout {{the life of the}} engine, from the first static acceptance firing to its ultimate vehicle flight. The auxiliary package is designed for use during early vehicle flights. It may be deleted from the basic engine instrumentation system after the propulsion system has established its reliability during research and development vehicle flights. It contains sufficient flexibility to provide for deletion, substitution, or addition of parameters deemed necessary as a result of additional testing. Eventual deletion of the auxiliary package will not interfere with the measurement capability of the <b>primary</b> <b>package.</b>|$|R

Lastly, tertiary packaging is that used to support bulk storage, shipping, and handling of product in the distribution supply chain.
