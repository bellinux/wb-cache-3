40|$|We {{determine}} the multiple sub-game perfect Nash equilibria arising in the Rubinstein bargaining game when both players make <b>prior</b> <b>claims</b> {{on the so-called}} cake i. e. pre-commit to accept at least {{a certain percentage of}} the cake subject to forfeiting a fixed percentage c of the cake (to a third party) if, setting aside their claim, they accept below the <b>prior</b> <b>claim</b> level. This is a study in the treatment of discontinuity, which requires the expanded apparatus of pseudo-fixed points and quasi Nash equilibria (permitting innitesimal tolerance). We show how to interpret the smallest and largest equilibrium as divisions in a long-term bargaining game with the termination condition that Player- 2 (respectively Player- 1) is free to choose the final division. It is shown that under the <b>prior</b> <b>claims</b> regime it is not optimal to claim too much; moreover to sustain the standard equilibrium requires a limited penalty, and otherwise the Nash equilibrium shifts upwards for Player- 1 to 1 Γ c Γ ffi [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Justice Thomas {{wrote in}} his {{separate}} opinion (which was joined in part by Justice Scalia) that the case should be dismissed because the Establishment Clause doesn't apply {{to the states and}} its subdivisions, but only to Congress.

Justice Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion (which was joined in part by Justice Scalia) in which he dealt with points raised by Justice Kagan in her dissent.

30|$|In this paper, the Jeffreys priors for the step-stress {{partially}} accelerated {{life test}} with Type-II adaptive progressive hybrid censoring scheme data are considered. Given a density function family satisfied certain regularity conditions, the Fisher information matrix and Jeffreys priors are obtained. Taking the Weibull distribution as an example, the Jeffreys priors, posterior analysis and its permissibility are discussed. The results, which present that how the accelerated stress levels, censored size, hybrid censoring time and stress change time etc. affect the Jeffreys priors, are obtained. In addition, a theorem which shows {{there exists a}} relationship between single observation and multi observations for <b>permissible</b> <b>priors</b> is proved. Finally, using Metroplis with in Gibbs sampling algorithm, these factors are confirmed by computing the frequentist coverage probabilities.|$|R

40|$|The {{incentives}} to exercise growth options, referred to here as timing ventures, are {{distorted by the}} presence of a <b>prior</b> <b>claim</b> to venture value. This distortion is the underinvestment problem of Myers (1977). The solution to the optimal timing problem does two things: (i) it indicates the time to undertake the venture when it is optimal to do so, or (ii) it indicates when the venture finishes out of the money in the sense of having zero time value. This solution depends on whose value is being maximized. If there is a <b>prior</b> <b>claim</b> to venture value, the solution that maximizes the value of the residual claim exercises later than the solution that maximizes the value of the venture. However, this levered venture finishes out of the money before the value maximizing time. Myers (1977), in a seminal contribution to corporate finance, showed that {{in the presence of a}} <b>prior</b> <b>claim</b> to value, owners of a value increasing investment opportunity may choose to forego the opportunity if they have to contribute the capital to undertake it. Myers coined the terms “growth option ” and “real option ” for such investment opportunities and the distortion in investment incentives has come to be known as the underinvestment problem...|$|R
