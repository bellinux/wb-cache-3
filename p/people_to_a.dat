To escape them and save the life of his successor the Chola emperor sends his son along with the Chola <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> secret territory. The refugees take along an idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{is looking}} for Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman), a woman whom he has met by chance on two previous occasions only for her to die both times.

5|$|The film {{begins with}} an episode in 1279AD, when the {{successor}} of the last great Chola Emperor, pending invasion, sends his <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mystery location, to survive the threat. The story resumes with an archaeologist, a coolie {{and a member of}} the army going in search of the archaeologist's father to the ruined city that was the place the exiled Chola Prince retreated to. An expedition is promptly arranged, and on the course they stumble on the lost Chola civilization and its king and find unexplained links between them and the culture. The shocking events and the problems that arise forms the crux of the story.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, when Wollstonecraft {{published}} the Rights of Woman, she extended {{many of the}} arguments she had begun in Rights of Men.

In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its <b>people.</b> <b>To</b> <b>a</b> great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E

25|$|In 685, {{minister}} Gar Tsenye Dompu (Mgar Bstan-snyas-ldom-bu) {{died and}} his brother, Gar Tridring Tsendrö (Mgar Khri-‘bring-btsan brod) {{was appointed to}} replace him. In 692, the Tibetans lost the Tarim Basin to the Chinese. Gar Tridring Tsendrö defeated the Chinese in battle in 696, and sued for peace. Two years later in 698 emperor Tridu Songtsen reportedly invited the Gar clan (who numbered more than 2000 <b>people)</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hunting party and had them massacred. Gar Tridring Tsendrö then committed suicide, and his troops joined the Chinese. This brought to an end {{the influence of the}} Gar.|$|E
25|$|The {{trophic level}} of an {{organism}} is the position it occupies {{on the food}} chain. Fisheries have been systematically overfishing high trophic predatory fish. This {{can result in a}} process called fishing down the food web, whereby the mean trophic level of available marine organisms decreases and the fishing effort must shift towards lower trophic organisms, such as jellyfish. According to the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly, if fishing down the food web continues it will in time reduce <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diet of jellyfish sandwiches and plankton soup.|$|E
25|$|Graham was {{interested}} in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists from around the world; with the largest representations of nations ever held until that time. Over 157 nations were gathered in 2000 at the RAI Convention Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At one revival in Seoul, South Korea, Graham attracted {{more than one million}} <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single service. He appeared in China in 1988—for Ruth, this was a homecoming, since she had been born in China to missionary parents. He appeared in North Korea in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Japanese rugby made a {{surprisingly}} speedy {{recovery in the}} post-war period, despite massive damage to infrastructure, {{and the death of}} many players. In September 1945, {{less than a month after}} the end of the war, an advertisement for rugby players in Hokkaido managed to draw no less than fifty <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> meeting. On 23 September 1945, the first post-war schools match was held in Kyoto. Kobe Steel encouraged the game amongst its workers at the end of 1945, believing it would raise their morale, and set a precedent for the later heavy corporate involvement in Japanese rugby.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{education}} was also strictly reviewed. At first, she simply attempted to revise clerical studies, proposing a reform of religious schools. This reform never progressed beyond the planning stages. By 1786, Catherine excluded all religion and clerical studies programmes from lay education. By separating the public interests {{from those of}} the church, Catherine began a secularisation of the day-to-day workings of Russia. She transformed the clergy from a group that wielded great power over the Russian government and its <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> segregated community forced to depend on the state for compensation.|$|E
25|$|Tuyến {{decided to}} emulate {{communist}} propaganda techniques. He sent some elderly <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Saigon camp to pose as refugees, and then ordered {{the police to}} stage a noisy arrest scene. His staff took photographs of the incident and distributed pamphlets claiming that communists had infiltrated the camps. This fear-mongering campaign prompted refugees to disperse {{for fear of being}} arrested for being communists. Tuyến targeted a clandestine newspaper run by anti-Diệm nationalist intellectuals, by printing counterfeit copies of the magazine with communist propaganda substituted in place of the real content. He then circulated the fake copies and then had the outlet banned for being communist.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} of outcomes {{is inherent in}} democracy, which makes all forces struggle repeatedly for the realization of their interests, being the devolution of power {{from a group of}} <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> set of rules. Western democracy, as distinct from that which existed in pre-modern societies, is generally considered to have originated in city states such as Classical Athens and the Roman Republic, where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in the West at the beginning of late antiquity. The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain {{how long it will}} take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up a significant portion of its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E
25|$|Very few {{traditional}} kisaeng houses {{continue to}} operate in South Korea, and many traditions and dances {{are considered to be}} lost forever. Some South Korean businesses continue to escort visiting foreign business <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> kisaeng house, but these locations are mostly modern interpretations of old kisaeng houses. The oldest traditional kisaeng house in Korea, Ohjinam (오진암), was closed in 2010. Today the kisaeng's evolution and impact on Korean society is receiving new attention as Koreans increase efforts to rediscover and revitalize their cultural and historical heritage. However, this interest is focused almost entirely on the historical kisaeng of the Joseon period, and not on the traces of the kisaeng which endure today.|$|E
