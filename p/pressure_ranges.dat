500|$|Cirrus {{clouds are}} formed when water vapor {{undergoes}} deposition at high altitudes where the atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>ranges</b> from 600mbar at [...] {{above sea level}} to 200mbar at [...] above sea level. These conditions commonly occur {{at the leading edge}} of a warm front. Because humidity is low at such high altitudes, this genus-type tends to be very thin.Cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals that originate from the freezing of super cooled water droplets in regions where air temperature is lower than -20°C or -30°C.Cirrus usually occur in fair weather.They are formed when it is high enough to be cold and freeze the water drops into ice. They sometimes may be caused by turbulence and wind shear, or by upper-tropospheric convection. Sometimes they are like blown out ice-crystals spreading from the top of a dying cumulonimbus.|$|E

40|$|The {{intermediate}} <b>pressure</b> <b>range</b> {{stands for}} an important condition for ultrafiltration operations where permeate flux falls below that predicted from a linear flux-pressure relationship {{but does not}} reach the limiting flux. Optimal performance of ultrafiltration might be achieved on {{the upper end of}} the intermediate <b>pressure</b> <b>range</b> because the maximum permeate flux will be obtained at the lowest possible pressure.
