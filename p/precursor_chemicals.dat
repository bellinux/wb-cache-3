25|$|To {{combat the}} {{diversion}} of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals,</b> China implemented several regulations on the control of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> between 1992 and 1998, including adoption of the 1988 U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in 1993. Additionally, the Government further improved regulations to strengthen control of ephedrine during 1999 and 2000.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{availability}} of the <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals,</b> traffickers produce large amounts of crystal methamphetamine. Although much of the crystal methamphetamine is consumed locally, some is available for shipment to other markets throughout Southeast Asia. Several ports in southern China serve as transit points for crystal methamphetamine transported by containerized cargo to international drug markets.|$|E
25|$|Also, reports {{indicate}} that acetic anhydride is diverted from China to morphine/heroin refineries found in the Golden Triangle. Domestically, Chinese officials express concern over {{the increasing number of}} synthetic drug production operations in their country. Seizures of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> in China increased from 50 metric tons in 1991 to 383 metric tons in 1997; only 300 metric tons were seized in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Some {{laboratory}} {{operators in}} China mix MDMA powder, imported from Europe, with substances, such as caffeine and ketamine, while making the Ecstasy tablets. Given {{the availability of}} the <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> needed, open source reporting in 2006 indicates that MDMA tablets in China cost only US$0.06 to produce, while the tablets sell for as much as US$36 in the city of Shanghai.|$|E

25|$|Phosphorus {{can reduce}} {{elemental}} iodine to hydroiodic acid, {{which is a}} reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. For this reason, red and white phosphorus were designated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration as List I <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> under 21 CFR 1310.02 effective on November 17, 2001. In the United States, handlers of red or white phosphorus are subject to stringent regulatory controls.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the BBC {{reported}} {{that use of}} MDMA had decreased in the UK in previous years. This {{may be due to}} increased seizures during use and decreased production of the <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> used to manufacture MDMA. Unwitting substitution with other drugs, such as mephedrone and methamphetamine, as well as legal alternatives to MDMA, such as BZP, MDPV, and methylone, are also thought to have contributed to its decrease in popularity.|$|E
25|$|Manufacture {{of crystal}} methamphetamine (ice, shabu, bingdu) is {{facilitated}} by the availability of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals,</b> such as pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. The unrestricted availability of these chemicals in the country facilitates the production of large quantities of crystal methamphetamine. Seizure information indicates that methamphetamine laboratories are located in provinces along the eastern and southeastern coastal areas. Many of the traffickers for the clandestine crystal methamphetamine laboratories are from organized crime groups based in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan.|$|E
40|$|Semi-analytical {{solutions}} for a cubic autocatalytic reaction, with linear decay and a <b>precursor</b> <b>chemical,</b> are considered. The model is coupled with diffusion and considered in a one-dimensional reactor. In this model the reactant is supplied by two mechanisms, diffusion via the cell boundaries and decay of an abundant <b>precursor</b> <b>chemical</b> {{present in the}} reactor. The Galerkin method is used to approximate the spatial structure of the reactant and autocatalyst concentrations in the reactor. Ordinary differential equations are then obtained as an approximation to the governing partial differential equations and analyzed to obtain semi-analytical results for the reaction-diffusion cell. Singularity theory and a local stability analysis are {{used to determine the}} regions of parameter space in which the different types of bifurcation diagrams and Hopf bifurcations occur.

25|$|China is of {{paramount}} importance in global cooperative efforts to prevent the diversion of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals.</b> With its large chemical industry, China remains a source country for legitimately produced chemicals that are diverted for production of heroin and cocaine, as well as many amphetamine-type stimulants. China and its neighbor India are the leading exporters of bulk ephedrine in the world. China produces over 100,000 metric tons of acetic anhydride each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. China is also the second largest producer of potassium permanganate in the world.|$|E
25|$|Hurt {{economically}} by Peruvian Air Force interdiction {{efforts in}} the mid-1990s, drug traffickers are now using land and river routes as well as aircraft to transport cocaine paste and, increasingly, refined cocaine to consumers around {{and out of the}} country. The Air Bridge Denial program was suspended in April 2001 after the Peruvian Air Force and strength of the U.S. DEA misidentified a civilian aircraft as a drug trafficker and shot it down, killing two American citizens on board. Peru continues to arrest drug traffickers and seize drugs and <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals,</b> destroy coca labs, disable clandestine airstrips, and prosecute officials involved in narcotics corruption.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Crichton {{published}} two novels. The first, Binary, {{relates the}} story of a villainous middle-class businessman, who attempts to assassinate the President of the United States by stealing an army shipment of the two <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> that form a deadly nerve agent. The second, The Terminal Man, is about a psychomotor epileptic sufferer, Harry Benson, who in regularly suffering seizures followed by blackouts, conducts himself inappropriately during seizures, waking up hours later with no knowledge of what he has done. Believed to be psychotic, he is investigated; electrodes are implanted in his brain, continuing the preoccupation in Crichton's novels with machine-human interaction and technology. The novel was adapted into a film directed by Mike Hodges and starring George Segal, Joan Hackett, Richard A. Dysart and Donald Moffat, released in June 1974. However, neither the novel nor the film was well received by critics.|$|E

500|$|The {{compound}} {{thought to}} be responsible for the toxicity of raw L.torminosus is the pungent-tasting [...] velleral present at a concentration of 0.16mg/g mushroom. Velleral is a breakdown product of stearyl-velutinal. Broken lactifers—specialized hyphal cells that produce the mushroom's latex—leak the <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> whose breakdown products act as the defensive agents toxic to humans, effectively deterring certain vertebrates that might consume the mushroom. The lactarane-type sesquiterpene lactone 15-hydroxyblenninA is one of several sesquiterpenes produced by the species. Other lactaranes are found in various Lactarius species, such as blenninA in L.deliciosus and L.blennius, and lactarorufinN in Lactarius rufus. Fungal sesquiterpenes are commonly produced as toxins to defend against predation, and as a result some have chemical properties that may have applications in medicinal chemistry.|$|E
500|$|All {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} the surface of Triton was acquired {{from a distance of}} 40,000km by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during a single encounter in 1989. [...] The 40% of Triton's surface imaged by Voyager 2 revealed blocky outcrops, ridges, troughs, furrows, hollows, plateaus, icy plains and few craters. Triton is relatively flat; its observed topography never varies beyond a kilometer. There are relatively few impact craters on Triton. Recent analysis of crater density and distribution has suggested that in geological terms, Triton's surface is extremely young, with regions varying from an estimated 50million years old to just an estimated 6million years old. 55% of Triton's surface is covered with frozen nitrogen, with water ice comprising 15–35% and dry ice (aka. frozen carbon dioxide) forming the remaining 10–20%. The surface shows deposits of tholins, organic compounds that may be <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> to the origin of life.|$|E
500|$|UN Secretary-General Ban {{in early}} October {{publicly}} recognized {{many of the}} challenges of the weapons destruction effort, in particular the dangerous nature of chemical arms destruction during a civil war, especially in urban areas such as Damascus, Aleppo, and Homs. [...] "Heavy artillery, air strikes, mortar barrages and the indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas are commonplace and battle lines shift quickly," [...] he wrote. Ban added that the most challenging phase of the destruction effort would begin in November, when OPCW and UN experts begin destroying Syria's estimated 1,000 tons of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> and chemical weapons. In order to do so, they will need to cross battle lines between governments and rebel forces. The Syrian government and Western-backed opposition forces have pledged cooperation with chemical disarmament, but Al Qaeda-linked rebel groups, including Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have not.|$|E
