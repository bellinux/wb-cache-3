40|$|As {{a result}} of {{agreements}} negotiated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), traditional trade protection measures such as tariffs and quotas are falling away. But to some extent they are being replaced by domestic technical regulations that permit countries to bar products from entering their markets if the products do not meet certain standards. To become and remain competitive, producers and suppliers must meet the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements set by importers’ governments in importing countries. Some SPS measures are very simple and specific, but others are combined in extremely complex systems like the requirements governing the import of plants and plant products for entry in to the European Union (EU). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> system currently used by the National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) of South Africa with regard to exports of agricultural produce to the European market and to develop an effective and efficient strategy to ensure compliance with the European Union’s phytosanitary regulations. The expansion of world trade has placed a huge responsibility on the National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) of South Africa to facilitate safe agricultural trade with its international trading partners. After putting the phytosanitary constraints/ weaknesses faced by the South African Export Regulatory System into perspective, numerous aspects of the export process were considered in this study. The NPPO of South Africa does experience capacity constraints in its phytosanitary export regulatory system mostly due to the recent restructuring of the Department of Agriculture (DOA). This information, combined with background information obtained from the personal experience of the author as a plant health officer for the past ten years at the Department of Agriculture and the analysis of questionnaires indicated that the current <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> system are the most fundamental impediment to accessing foreign markets. This is followed by an evaluation of the export certification system to identify the major challenges experienced by the NPPO officials in <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> to the European markets. Lack of fundamental scientific knowledge and the inability to interpret the phytosanitary import requirements of the European market were identified as the elementary barriers to phytosanitary compliance. Finally, the accuracy of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> is of paramount importance for international trade. If credibility is lost, this can result in stricter and lengthier inspection procedures in importing countries and eventually loss of markets. This study resulted in the development of a certification guide to equip the NPPO of South Africa with the necessary technical assistance to ensure compliance with the European Union’s phytosanitary regulations. This standard operating procedure (SOP) is currently in used by the certification officials of the DOA. Dissertation (MInstAgrar) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Mango {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and best paid {{tropical}} fruits in worldwide markets, its exportation is regulated within a phytosanitary quality control for killing the “fruit fly”. Thus, mangoes must be subject to hot-water treatment process that involves their immersion in hot water over a period of time. In this work, field measurements, analytical and simulation studies are developed on available hot-water treatment equipment called “Original” that only complies with United States phytosanitary protocols. These approaches are made to characterize the fluid-dynamic and thermal behaviours that occur during the mangoes’ hot-water treatment process. Then, analytical model and Computational fluid dynamics simulations are developed for designing new hot-water treatment equipment called “Hybrid” that simultaneously meets with both United States and Japan <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certifications.</b> Comparisons of analytical results with data field measurements demonstrate that “Hybrid” equipment offers a better fluid-dynamic and thermal performance than “Original” ones...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractAutomation in {{agriculture}} should improve plant health, product quality, and production efficiency. However the actual use of electronic identification tools {{in agriculture}} is limited. Therefore, I review here electronic identification applications to support plant health and production and agricultural sustainability. The major points are as follows: (1) {{there is a}} tenfold increase of literature on the application of radio frequency identification in agriculture from 2000 – 2004 to 2005 – 2009. (2) Development of quick response code and radio frequency identification solutions are improving automated systems. (3) There is a major advancement in associating thermal sensors to electronic tags to preserve food quality and to manage temperature-controlled supply chain. Whereas tests with biosensors used for biological or chemical alerts are limited. (4) Agrochemical tagging, using radio frequency identification tags, improve plant health management and environmental monitoring. (5) While <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certifications</b> are mandatory in high-cost cultivation systems and a need for risk management may promote radiofrequency identification (RFID) systems, the lack of specific economic analyses may discourage farmers and investors...|$|R
40|$|The {{oligonucleotide}} primers, PCL 1 and PCL 2, were synthesized for Phaeomoniella chlamydospora {{from the}} variable internal transcribed spacers ITS 1 and ITS 2 of the ribosomal DNA, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR amplification) with PCL 1 and PCL 2 produced a 325 -bp fragment from isolates of Pa. chlamydospora. Amplification of this fragment was achieved from {{as little as}} 16 pg of fungal DNA. The specific primers also amplified a 325 -bp fragment from infected grapevine tissue.

40|$|The {{ability of}} National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPOs) and their {{affiliated}} laboratories to quickly and reliably detect and identify organisms {{is critical for}} the effective performance of phytosanitary measures.

The procedures included those currently {{used by the}} state regulatory laboratories of Oregon and California, {{as well as new}} tests developed to determine juvenile viability for the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> of fumigated grass seed. Eleven seed lots of Agrostis tenuis (bentgrass) and Dactylis glomerata (orchardgrass) naturally infested with varying levels of juveniles of Anguina were individually analyzed. Only one procedure, a new live recovery test, yielded nematodes in all 11 samples and is recommended as the best method for use by regulatory agencies. In comparison, although the other three extraction procedures resulted in greater numbers of Anguina agrostis juveniles per gram of seed, they failed to yield any nematodes in as many as four seed lots with low infection levels...|$|E
40|$|During <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> {{of three}} grapevine clones (one of Gorgollosa {{and two of}} Mances de Tibus) {{received}} at IMIDA from the Balearic Islands (Spain), we observed discrepancies between symptoms on Cabernet Franc indicator plants {{and the results of}} ELISA testing for viruses associated with grapevine leafroll. According to DAS-ELISA analysis (Bioreba, Nyon, Switzerland), the three clones were free from GLRaV- 1 and GLRaV- 3 but positive for GLRaV- 2. However, in four consecutive seasons on indicator rootstocks, symptom severity led to a suspicion that other leafroll viruses might be present; in our experience, symptoms produced by GLRaV- 2 infection alone are rarely as severe as those that were observed. Testing of the clones with real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan ® probes (Osman et al., 2007) detected Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 4. Using similar real-time PCR methods we confirmed the presence of GLRaV- 2 but we did not detect either GLRaV- 1 or GLRaV- 3. Moreover we could also detect Grapevine fanleaf virus...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNew {{methods for}} better {{identification}} of timber geographical origin would constitute an important technical {{element in the}} forest industry, for <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> procedures or {{in the chain of}} custody developed for the certification of timber from sustainably managed forests. In the case of the European white oaks, a detailed reference map of chloroplast (cp) DNA variation across the range exists, and we propose here to use the strong geographical structure, characterized by a differentiation of western vs. eastern populations, for the purpose of oak wood traceability. We first developed cpDNA markers permitting the characterization of haplotype on degraded DNA obtained from wood samples. The techniques were subsequently validated by confirming the full correspondence between genotypes obtained from living tissues (buds) and from wood collected from the same individual oak. Finally, a statistical procedure was used to test if the haplotype composition of a lot of wood samples is consistent with its presumed geographical origin. Clearly, the technique cannot permit the unambiguous identification of wood products of unknown origin but can be used to check the conformity of genetic composition of wood samples with the region of alleged origin. This could lead to major applications not only in the forest industry but also in archaeology or in palaeobotany...|$|E
40|$|Tracking and tracing {{systems are}} being demanded by {{customers}} {{such as the}} major Australian supermarket chains, superior food service chains and globally in export markets such as the European Union and Asia. This includes the ability to track products as they move to downstream customers and to traceback where products have been sourced for feedback and to resolve problems. To continue to access these global premium priced markets Australian food organisations need to ensure they meet changing customer requirements. Traditionally information communication technologies to provide tracking and tracing systems {{have been set up}} for larger business and industry sectors that warrant the costs of development. Small business cannot always afford to invest in the infrastructure to establish through chain and industry wide netchain based systems. This problem is compounded where businesses are fragmented and spread over large geoographical areas even if they have similar requirements. An action learning approach was taken to identify what is needed in setting up tracking and tracing systems to address biosecurity issues in three small business based netchains (livestock 'A' and fruits 'B' and 'C'). In the livestock 'A' sector fears of a global pandemic has heightened the need for tracking and traceablity processes, combined with preventative actions and rigorous bio-security protocols (e. g. traceability of traffic properties). For fruit 'B' and 'C' movements of produce across state and national borders requires <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> to provide assurance to minimize or eradicate the spread of diseases and pests. Concerns or delays in tracking and tracing can result in perishable produce becoming unsalable. A system was identified to suit small businesses and those in niche market industries. The system was based on deployment through the internet. The system had to link in with existing business information systems and business methods, be reliable, able to be tailored to address biosecurity issues and effective in meeting customer requirements. Results presented compare the use of the tracking and tracing system across the three different sectors (animal and horticultural products) and states of Australia. Findings are presented on what was learnt in the process including: identifying business in chains and networks to work collaboratively with; catalysts needed to get commitment to change; and support systems needed for successful implementation across multiple small businesses linked in netchains...|$|E
40|$|Varieties with {{resistance}} to both cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) can reverse food and income security threats affecting {{the rural poor}} in Eastern and Southern Africa. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture is leading a partnership of five national (Malawi, Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) cassava breeding programs to exchange the most elite germplasm resistant to both CMD and CBSD. This poster documents {{the process and the}} key learning lessons. Twenty to 25 stem cuttings of 31 clones comprising of 25 elite clones (5 per country), two standard checks (Kibandameno from Kenya and Albert from Tanzania), and four national checks (Kiroba and Mkombozi from Tanzania, Mbundumali from Malawi, and Tomo from Mozambique) were cleaned and indexed for cassava viruses at both the Natural Resources Institute in the United Kingdom and Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services, in Kenya. About 75 in-vitro plantlets per clone were sent to Genetic Technologies International Limited, a private tissue culture lab in Kenya, and micro-propagated to ≥ 1500 plantlets. Formal procedures of material transfer between countries including agreements, import permission and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> were all ensured for germplasm exchange. At least 300 plantlets of each elite and standard check clones were sent to all partner countries, while the national checks were only sent to their respective countries of origin. In each country, the in-vitro plantlets were acclimatized under screen house conditions and transplanted for field multiplication as a basis for multi-site testing. Except for Tomo, a susceptible clone, all the clones were cleaned of the viruses. However, there was varied response to the cleaning process between clones, e. g. FN- 19 NL, NASE 1 and Kibandameno responded slowly. Also, clones responded differently to micro-propagation protocols at GTIL, e. g. Pwani, Tajirika, NASE 1, TME 204 and Okhumelela responded slowly. Materials are currently being bulked at low disease pressure field sites in preparation for planting at 5 - 8 evaluation sites per country. The process of cleaning, tissue culture mass propagation, exchange and local hardening off/bulking has been successful for the majority of target varieties. Two key lessons derived from the process are that adequate preparations of infrastructure and trained personnel are required to manage the task, and that a small proportion of varieties are recalcitrant to tissue culture propagation...|$|E
40|$|Plant seed {{identification}} is routinely performed for seed certification in seed trade, <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certification</b> for the import and export of agricultural commodities, and regulatory monitoring, surveillance, and enforcement. Current {{identification is}} performed manually by seed analysts with limited aiding tools. Extensive expertise {{and time is}} required, especially for small, morphologically similar seeds. Computers are, however, especially good at recognizing subtle differences that humans find difficult to perceive. In this thesis, a 2 D, image-based computer-assisted approach is proposed. The size of plant seeds is extremely small compared with daily objects. The microscopic images of plant seeds are usually degraded by defocus blur due to the high magnification of the imaging equipment. It is necessary and beneficial to differentiate the in-focus and blurred regions given that only sharp regions carry distinctive information usually for identification. If the object of interest, the plant seed in this case, is in- focus under a single image frame, the amount of defocus blur can be employed as a cue to separate the object and the cluttered background. If the defocus blur is too strong to obscure the object itself, sharp regions of multiple image frames acquired at different focal distance can be merged together to make an all-in-focus image. This thesis describes a novel non-reference sharpness metric which exploits the distribution difference of uniform LBP patterns in blurred and non-blurred image regions. It runs in realtime on a single core cpu and responses much better on low contrast sharp regions than the competitor metrics. Its benefits are shown both in defocus segmentation and focal stacking. With the obtained all-in-focus seed image, a scale-wise pooling method is proposed to construct its feature representation. Since the imaging settings in lab testing are well constrained, the seed objects in the acquired image can be assumed to have measureable scale and controllable scale variance. The proposed method utilizes real pixel scale information and allows for accurate comparison of seeds across scales. By cross-validation on our high quality seed image dataset, better identification rate (95 %) was achieved compared with pre- trained convolutional-neural-network-based models (93. 6 %). It offers an alternative method for image based identification with all-in-focus object images of limited scale variance. The very first digital seed identification tool of its kind was built and deployed for test in the seed laboratory of Canadian food inspection agency (CFIA). The proposed focal stacking algorithm was employed to create all-in-focus images, whereas scale-wise pooling feature representation {{was used as the}} image signature. Throughput, workload, and identification rate were evaluated and seed analysts reported significantly lower mental demand (p = 0. 00245) when using the provided tool compared with manual identification. Although the identification rate in practical test is only around 50 %, I have demonstrated common mistakes that {{have been made in the}} imaging process and possible ways to deploy the tool to improve the recognition rate...|$|E
