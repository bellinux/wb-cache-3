5|$|Given the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous <b>positions</b> <b>to</b> third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.|$|E
5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many administrative <b>positions</b> <b>to</b> senatorial {{rank and}} thus opening these offices {{to the old}} aristocracy, {{and at the same}} time elevating the rank of already existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, so that by the end of the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E

Shifting left again <b>to</b> the third <b>position</b> (<b>to</b> the hundreds place) gives 9 or 900. Each time one shifts a number one <b>position</b> <b>to</b> the left, it is multiplied by 10. Each time one shifts a number one <b>position</b> <b>to</b> the right, it is divided by 10. This applies to single-digit numbers or multiple-digit numbers.|$|R

5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate.

This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure <b>positions</b> <b>to</b> sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
