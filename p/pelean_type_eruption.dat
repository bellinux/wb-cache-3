30|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{frequently}} {{associated with the}} release of low-viscosity magma with a composition of basalt to basaltic andesite (e.g., Houghton and Gonnermann 2008; Taddeucci et al. 2015). A burst of overpressurized gas slugs has been considered as a possible mechanism for triggering major Strombolian eruptions (e.g., Blackburn et al. 1976; Chouet et al. 2003; James et al. 2009; Parfitt 2004; Ripepe 1996; Vergniolle and Gaudemer 2015). Recently, a variety of eruption styles have been reported. For instance, at Stromboli Volcano, Italy, eruption styles are classified into three <b>types.</b> <b>Type</b> 0 <b>eruptions</b> are gas-dominated, <b>Type</b> 1 <b>eruptions</b> are dominated by coarse ballistic clasts, and <b>Type</b> 2 <b>eruptions</b> consist of an ash-rich plume (Leduc et al. 2015; Patrick et al. 2007). Some part of the ash emitted by a <b>Type</b> 2 <b>eruption</b> falls back to the vent, which covers the vent as debris. This recycling process has also been recognized through the morphological observation of ash grains (D’Oriano et al. 2014). Reheating causes groundmass crystallization, sintering/welding, and a color change (D’Oriano et al. 2013). Such debris prevents the gas and magma flows in the conduit and may contribute to the generation of a viscous plug at a shallow conduit, which in turn affects the eruption styles (Capponi et al. 2016; Gaudin et al. 2017). Although its origin is controversial, the existence of a viscous plug has been suggested by the textural, geochemical, and rheological analysis of ejected pyroclasts and bombs (e.g., Gurioli et al. 2014; Lautze and Houghton 2007; Leduc et al. 2015).|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} <b>types</b> of <b>eruptions.</b> The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic <b>eruptions</b> are another <b>type</b> of volcanic <b>eruption,</b> {{driven by the}} compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which {{is driven by the}} superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.|$|R
5|$|There are two <b>types</b> of <b>eruptions</b> {{in terms}} of activity, {{explosive}} eruptions and effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels magma and tephra.
