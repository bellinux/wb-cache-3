50|$|The {{approach}} minimums for LNAV {{approaches are}} {{higher than that of}} ILS approaches, and RNAV approaches that incorporate vertical guidance. Aircraft executing an LNAV instrument approach must descend incrementally rather than follow a fixed glide slope. This is called a 'non-precision' approach to distinguish it from a precision approach in which there is electronic vertical (slope) guidance down to a decision altitude (DA). In the case of the non-precision approach, the aircraft can descend only to what is referred to as a minimum descent altitude (MDA). An MDA segment is flown until the airport is in sight and the pilot can land. If the airport is not in sight by the time the pilot reaches a missed approach <b>point</b> (<b>MAP)</b> on the MDA, the aircraft must execute a missed approach.|$|E
50|$|The minimum descent {{altitude}} (MDA) is {{the lowest}} altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided. Unlike with DH or DA, a missed approach need not be initiated immediately upon reaching the altitude. A pilot flying a non-precision approach may descend to the MDA and maintain it until reaching the missed approach <b>point</b> (<b>MAP),</b> then initiate a missed approach if the required visual reference was not obtained. An aircraft must not descend below the MDA until visual reference is obtained, and which the aircraft can land while performing normal maneuvers, which differs slightly from a DH/DA in that while the missed approach procedure must be initiated at or prior to the DH/DA, because of its vertical momentum, during a precision approach an aircraft may end up descending slightly below the DH/DA {{during the course of}} the missed approach.|$|E

40|$|Chaotic itinerancy is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} in high-dimensional dynamic systems, by which an orbit successively itinerates over low-dimensional semi-stable invariant sets in a chaotic manner.

The method of <b>Point</b> <b>Mapping</b> under Cell Reference, denoted as PMUCR in short, was a numerical method developed for the global analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems with the aim to retain the accuracy of <b>Point</b> <b>Mapping</b> Method but enhance its computational efficiency. The method is extended to be able compute both stable and unstable invariant sets in high-dimensional dynamical systems by taking the virtue of the cell structure and incorporate with PIM-triple method.

A generic error criterion is developed for comparing two {{different sets of}} points based on the Euclidean distance measure. The point sets can be chosen as (i) two different sets of <b>map</b> <b>points</b> acquired with different mapping techniques or different sensing modalities, (ii) two sets of fitted curve <b>points</b> to <b>maps</b> extracted by different mapping techniques or sensing modalities, or (iii) a set of extracted <b>map</b> <b>points</b> {{and a set of}} fitted curve points. The error criterion makes it possible to compare the accuracy of maps obtained with different techniques among themselves, as well as with an absolute reference. Guidelines for selecting and optimizing the parameters of active snake contours and SOMs are provided using uniform sampling of the parameter space and particle swarm optimization (PSO A demonstrative example from ultrasonic mapping is given based on experimental data and compared with a very accurate laser map, considered an absolute reference. Both techniques can fill the erroneous gaps in discrete <b>point</b> <b>maps.</b> Snake curve fitting results in more accurate maps than SOMs because it is more robust to outliers. The two methods and the error criterion are sufficiently general that they can also be applied to discrete <b>point</b> <b>maps</b> acquired with other mapping techniques and other sensing modalities.
