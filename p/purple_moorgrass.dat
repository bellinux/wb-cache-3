50|$|Western {{blanket bog}} and {{heathland}} {{are the most}} common vegetation of Connemara National Park. The boglands are situated in the wet low lying environments whereas the blanket bog exists within the drier mountain atmosphere. <b>Purple</b> <b>moorgrass</b> is the most bountiful plant, creating colorful landscapes throughout the country side. Carnivorous plants {{play an important role in}} the park's ecosystem, the most common being sundew and butterworts trap. Bogs hold very little nutrients so many plants obtain their energy from the digestion of insects. Other common plants include lousewort, bog cotton, milkwort, bog asphodel, orchids and bog myrtle, with a variety of lichens and mosses.|$|E
40|$|As a {{third part}} of a series of papers on the ground-living true bugs of Hungary, the species {{belonging}} to the lace bug genus Acalypta Westwood, 1840 (Insecta: Heteroptera: Tingidae) were studied. Extensive materials collected with Berlese funnels during about 20 years all over Hungary were identified. Based on these sporadic data of many years, faunistic notes are given on some Hungarian species. The seasonal occurrence of the species are discussed. The numbers of specimens of different Acalypta species collected in diverse plant communities are compared with multivariate methods. Materials collected with pitfall traps between 1979 – 1982 at Bugac, Kiskunság National Park were also processed. In this area, only A. marginata and A. gracilis occurred, both in great number. The temporal changes of the populations are discussed. Significant differences could be observed between the microhabitat distribution of the two species: both species occurred in very low number in traps placed out in patches colonized by dune-slack <b>purple</b> <b>moorgrass</b> meadow; Acalypta gracilis preferred distinctly the Pannonic dune open grassland patches; A. marginata occurred in almost equal number in Pannonic dune open grassland and in Pannonic sand puszta patches...|$|E
