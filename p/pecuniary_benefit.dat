40|$|We find non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> of {{business}} ownership {{to be an}} important consideration in explaining small business formation. Using a variety of data sources, we show that the overwhelming majority of small businesses do not match the theoretical concept of an entrepreneur. Specifically, nearly all small businesses do not grow, do not want to grow, do not innovate, and do not want to innovate. Second, using new data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics, we show that a majority of small business owners report that non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> (e. g., being one’s own boss, having flexibility over one’s schedule) were the primary reason that they started their business. Third, we embed non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> into a standard model of occupational choice that abstracts from other traditional channels of risk, ability, and liquidity constraints. This simple model generates predictions consistent with many aspects of the data: we find that the propensity to start a small business is still positively correlated with individual wealth despite the omission of binding capital constraints; small businesses will be concentrated in industries with lower returns to scale; and we show a wage firm-size premium even without assumed differences in productivity among firms or workers.

The sample was limited to those in paygrades E 4 -E 6, with 5 - 10 years of service, and who had less than one year remaining in their commitment. Psychological, economic, organizational, and personal/demographic characteristics were investigated to determine their effect on the enlistees' career decision. A multivariate logit regression model was estimated utilizing these explanatory variables: Single/Wo/Dep., Single/W/Dep., Married/Wo/Dep., Black, Hispanic, YOS, Technical, Medical, Admin/Supply, Probability of Alternative, and Composite variables for satisfaction with work environment, and satisfaction with <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits.</b> The result indicates that there were significant differences in the factors affecting the intended and actual reenlistment decisions.

40|$|We embed {{a simple}} incomplete-contracts model of {{organization}} design {{in a standard}} two-country perfectly-competitive trade model to examine how the liberalization of product and factor markets affects the ownership structure of firms. In our model, managers {{decide whether or not}} to integrate their firms, trading off the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits</b> of coordinating production decisions with the private benefits of operating in their preferred ways. The price of output is a crucial determinant of this choice, since it affects the size of the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefits.</b> In particular, non-integration is chosen at "low" and "high" prices, while integration occurs at moderate prices. Organizational choices also depend on the terms of trade in supplier markets, which affect the division of surplus between managers. We obtain three main results. First, even when firms do not relocate across countries, the price changes triggered by liberalization of product markets can lead to significant organizational restructuring within countries. Second, the removal of barriers to factor mobility can lead to inefficient reorganization and adversely affect consumers. Third, "deep integration" - the liberalization of both product and factor markets - leads to the convergence of organizational design across countries. Contracts; Firms; Globalization...|$|R

60|$|As to Lucius Mason and the {{arrangement}} of his affairs with his step-brother a very few concluding words will suffice. When Joseph Mason left the office of Messrs. Round and Crook he would gladly have sacrificed all hope of any eventual <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefit</b> from the possession of Orley Farm could he by doing so have secured the condign punishment of her who had so long {{kept him out of}} his inheritance. But he soon found that he had no means of doing this. In the first place he did not know where to turn for advice. He had quarrelled absolutely with Dockwrath, and though he now greatly distrusted the Rounds, he by no means put implicit trust in him of Hamworth. Of the Rounds he suspected that they were engaged to serve his enemy, of Dockwrath he felt sure that he was anxious only to serve himself. Under these circumstances he was driven into the arms of a third attorney, and learned from him, after a delay that cut him to the soul, that he could take no further criminal proceeding against Lady Mason. It would be impossible to have her even indicted for the forgery,--seeing that two juries, at the interval of twenty years, had virtually acquitted her,--unless new evidence which should be absolute and positive in its kind should be forthcoming. But there was no new evidence of any kind. The offer made to surrender the property was no evidence for a jury whatever it might be {{in the mind of the}} world at large.|$|E
60|$|What you {{say about}} the quarrel in the United States is sophistical. No doubt, {{taxation}} may, and perhaps in some cases must, press unequally, or apparently so, on different classes {{of people in a}} state. In such cases there is a hardship; but, in the long run, the matter is fully compensated to the over-taxed class. For example, take the householders of London, who complain so bitterly of the house and window taxes. Is it not pretty clear that, whether such householder be a tradesman, who indemnifies himself in the price of his goods,--or a letter of lodgings, who does so in his rent, --or a stockholder, who receives it back again in his dividends,--or a country gentleman, who has saved so much fresh levy on his land or his other property,--one way or other, it comes at last pretty nearly to the same thing, though the pressure for the time may be unjust and vexatious, and fit to be removed? But when New England, which may be considered a state in itself, taxes the admission of foreign manufactures in order to cherish manufactures of its own, and thereby forces the Carolinians, another state of itself, with which there is little intercommunion, which has no such desire or interest to serve, to buy worse articles at a higher price, it is altogether a different question, and is, in fact, downright tyranny of the worst, because of the most sordid, kind. What would you think of a law which should tax every person in Devonshire for the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefit</b> of every person in Yorkshire? And yet that is a feeble image of the actual usurpation of the New England deputies over the property of the Southern States.|$|E

What money will it earn for a man in after life?--is a question which will be asked; and which it is folly to despise. For if the only answer be: [...] "None at all," [...] a man {{has a right to}} rejoin: [...] "Then let me take up some pursuit which will train and refresh my mind as much as this one, and yet be of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefit</b> to me some day." [...] If you can find such a study, by all means follow it: but I say that this study too may be of great practical benefit in after life. How much money have I, young as I am, seen wasted for want of a little knowledge of botany, geology, or chemistry. How many a clever man becomes the dupe of empirics for want of a little science. How many a mine is sought for where no mine could be; or crop attempted to be grown, where no such crop could grow. How many a hidden treasure, on the other hand, do men walk over unheeding. How many a new material, how many an improved process in manufacture is possible, yet is passed over, for want of a little science. And for the man who emigrates, and comes in contact with rude nature teeming with unsuspected wealth, of what incalculable advantage to have if it be but the rudiments of those sciences, which will tell him the properties, and therefore the value, of the plants, the animals, the minerals, the climates with which he meets? True--home-learnt natural history will not altogether teach him about these things, because most of them must needs be new: but it will teach him to compare and classify them as he finds them, and so by analogy with things already known to him, to discover their intrinsic worth.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{scarcely}} any mode in which political institutions are more morally mischievous--work greater evil through their spirit--than by representing political {{functions as a}} favor to be conferred, a thing which the depositary is to ask for as desiring it for himself, and even pay for as if it were designed for his <b>pecuniary</b> <b>benefit.</b> Men are not fond of paying large sums for leave to perform a laborious duty. Plato had a much juster view of the conditions of good government when he asserted that the persons who should be sought out to be invested with political power are those who are personally most averse to it, and that the only motive which can be relied on for inducing the fittest men to take upon themselves the toils of government is the fear of being governed by worse men. What must an elector think when he sees three or four gentlemen, none of them previously observed to be lavish of their money on projects of disinterested beneficence, vying with one another in the sums they expend to be enabled to write M.P. after their names? Is it likely he will suppose that it is for his interest they incur all this cost? And if he form an uncomplimentary opinion of their part in the affair, what moral obligation is he likely to feel as to his own? Politicians are fond of treating it as the dream of enthusiasts that the electoral body will ever be uncorrupt: truly enough, until they are willing to become so themselves; for the electors, assuredly, will take their moral tone from the candidates. So long as the elected member, in any shape or manner, pays for his seat, all endeavours will fail to make the business of election any thing but a selfish bargain on all sides. [...] "So long as the candidate himself, and the customs of the world, seem to regard the function of a member of Parliament less as a duty to be discharged than a personal favor to be solicited, no effort will avail to implant in an ordinary voter the feeling that the election of a member of Parliament is also a matter of duty, and that he is not at liberty to bestow his vote on any other consideration than that of personal fitness." ...|$|E
