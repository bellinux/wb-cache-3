50|$|The overall sound {{blocking}} {{capacity of}} a partition with Acoustiblok added cannot be calculated by simply adding 26 to the STC rating of a partition as found in reference sources, due to mechanical and acoustical variations in different partition wall and floor/ceiling designs, {{as well as the}} fact that STC is a logarithmic calculation and therefore cannot simply be summed. The most reliable comparative indicator of Acoustiblok's performance in practical application is laboratory measurement of the acoustical <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> partitions. Field-measured sound isolation can vary considerably from lab measurements in any sound isolation protocol. This is generally due to installer error and flanking sound pathways, not {{as a result of the}} material failure in the field.|$|E

Of particular interest is the alternative that the observations come from Poisson distributions with different parameters.

This paper improves on Graph-Cut algorithm based on characteristics of Watershed. The basic theory is to insert watershed into Graph-Cut to conduct pre-segmentation on image. With watershed, image is divided into regions which have different sizes and pixel color similarities. Images processed by watershed algorithm are converted into weighted undirected graph; and then translate energy function on pixel into that graph on separate regions after pre-segmentation. <b>Performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> programs has proved that the improved Graph-Cut algorithm can increase workload of user interaction mark effectively.
