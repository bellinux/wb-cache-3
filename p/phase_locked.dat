25|$|By convention, {{the term}} {{oscillators}} usually denotes integrated circuits (ICs) that supply single output frequencies. MEMS oscillators include MEMS resonators, sustaining amps, and additional electronics to set or adjust their output frequencies. These circuits often include <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> loops (PLLs) that produce selectable or programmable output frequencies from the upstream MEMS reference frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Phase {{resetting}} {{occurs when}} input to a neuron or neuronal ensemble resets {{the phase of}} ongoing oscillations. It is very common in single neurons where spike timing is adjusted to neuronal input (a neuron may spike at a fixed delay in response to periodic input, which {{is referred to as}} phase locking) and may also occur in neuronal ensembles when the phases of their neurons are adjusted simultaneously. Phase resetting is fundamental for the synchronization of different neurons or different brain regions because the timing of spikes can become <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> to the activity of other neurons.|$|E
25|$|IC design can {{be divided}} into the broad {{categories}} of digital and analog IC design. Digital IC design is to produce components such as microprocessors, FPGAs, memories (RAM, ROM, and flash) and digital ASICs. Digital design focuses on logical correctness, maximizing circuit density, and placing circuits so that clock and timing signals are routed efficiently. Analog IC design also has specializations in power IC design and RF IC design. Analog IC design is used in the design of op-amps, linear regulators, <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> loops, oscillators and active filters. Analog design is more concerned with the physics of the semiconductor devices such as gain, matching, power dissipation, and resistance. Fidelity of analog signal amplification and filtering is usually critical and as a result, analog ICs use larger area active devices than digital designs and are usually less dense in circuitry.|$|E
40|$|Background Working memory (WM) deficits are a core {{feature of}} schizophrenia. Recent {{electrophysiological}} {{evidence indicates that}} the brain systems for visual encoding are especially impaired. However, patients still achieve performance levels clearly above chance, which indicates the existence of residual mechanisms supporting WM encoding. The present study presents evidence that alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> of the electroencephalogram is a marker for such residual cognitive mechanisms. Methods Alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> during encoding into WM was compared between 17 patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 17 healthy control subjects. Results of <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> were correlated with accuracy. A median split based on alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> in patients {{was used to compare}} accuracy between control subjects and patients with high and low alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking.</b> Results Alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> increased with WM memory load in both EOS and control subjects, although alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> was generally reduced in EOS. Furthermore, for EOS, a positive correlation between alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> and performance was obtained. Additionally, patients exhibiting high <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> did not differ in performance from control subjects. Conclusions These results provide the first evidence for a relationship between alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> and visual WM encoding. This neural mechanism seems to be preserved in some patients with schizophrenia and then allows them to attain normal performance levels...|$|R

25|$|A <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to}} the difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E

40|$|Perception {{of speech}} at {{multiple}} temporal scales {{is important for}} the efficient extraction of meaningful phonological elements. Individuals with developmental dyslexia have difficulty in the accurate neural representation of phonological aspects of speech, across languages. Recently, it was proposed that these difficulties might arise in part because of impaired <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> to the slower modulations in the speech signal (< 10 Hz), which would affect syllabic parsing and segmentation of the speech stream (the “temporal sampling” hypothesis, Goswami, 2011). Here we measured MEG responses to different rates of amplitude modulated white noise in adults with and without dyslexia. In line with the temporal sampling hypothesis, different patterns of <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> to amplitude modulation at the delta rate of 2 Hz were found when comparing participants with dyslexia to typically-reading participants.
