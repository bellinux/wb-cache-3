2500|$|Some {{difficulty}} {{has arisen}} since {{the passing of}} the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only [...] "intended to afford {{to the members of the}} medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined". It is obvious that it cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can only be used as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, gum benzoin, tragacanth, gum arabic, ammonium carbonate, beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for <b>precipitated</b> <b>sulphur,</b> is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs by C.G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.|$|E

In the same time, the patient had been suffered from hypothyoidism, and her skin changes were misdiagnosed, because it was thought that they are associated with her endocrine disorder. Suddenly, beside the erythema, her skin became hyperkeratotic, with widespread scaling over the trunk and limbs, and crusted lesions appeared on her scalp and ears. The microscopic examination of the skin scales with potassium hydroxide demonstrated numerous scabies mites and eggs.

40|$|Sulphur {{compounds}} {{are considered}} {{as the most}} hazardous non-hydrocarbons in reservoir fluids, because of their corrosive nature, deleterious effects of petroleum products and tendency to plug porous medium which may impair formation productivity. Precipitation and deposition of elemental sulphur within reservoirs, near well bore region may significantly reduce the inflow performance of sour-gas wells and thus affect economic feasibility negatively. Studies have sought that almost all deep sour reservoirs <b>precipitate</b> elemental <b>sulphur</b> either occurring {{as a result of}} decomposition of H 2 S to give elemental sulphur or occurring as indigenous usually referred to as native sulphur as a dissolved species. Uncontrollable elemental sulphur induced formation damage {{has been one of the}} profit hurting syndromes that occurs in deep water sour gas reservoir. Meanwhile many correlations have been formulated thermodynamically to predict the occurrences of elemental sulphur but little information related to effect of its saturation on gas production and its corresponding formation damage. This paper presents an improved model for predicting elemental sulphur saturation and corresponding formation damage around the well bore. Results show that the minimum pore spaces blockage time was over-estimated by previous formulatio...|$|R
40|$|In situ bioprecipitation (ISBP), which {{involves}} immobilizing the metals as precipitates (mainly sulphides) in the solid phase, {{is an effective}} method of metal removal from contaminated groundwater. This study investigated the stability of metal precipitates formed after ISBP in two different solid-liquid matrices (artificial and natural). The artificial matrix consisted of sand, Zn (200 mgL- 1), artificial groundwater and a carbon source (electron donor). Here {{the stability of the}} Zn precipitates was evaluated by manipulation of redox and pH. The natural system matrices included aquifer material and groundwater samples collected from three different metal (Zn and Co) contaminated sites and different carbon sources were provided as electron donors. In the natural matrices, metal precipitates stability was assessed by changing aquifer redox conditions, sequential extraction, and BIOMET® assay. The results indicated that, in the artificial matrix, redox manipulation did not impact the Zn precipitates. However the sequential pH change proved detrimental, releasing 58 % of the precipitated Zn back into liquid phase. In natural matrices, the applied carbon source largely affected the stability of metal precipitates. Elemental analysis performed on the precipitates formed in natural matrix showed that the main elements of the <b>precipitates</b> were <b>sulphur</b> with Zn and Co. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
30|$|To obtain {{high-quality}} FeS 2, {{the synthesis}} {{was carried out}} using different reaction recipes. All reagents used in our work are of analytical grade from J & K Scientific (Edwardsville, Nova Scotia Canada). Firstly, gelatin of 0.54 g was dissolved in 30 mL hot deionized (DI) water. The gelatin here can be easily adsorbed onto Fe(OH) 2, thus providing an encapsulation for FeS 2 nanocrystal during the reaction. In this way, it can prevent the diffusion of S 2 - ions, S and H 2 S {{to the surface of}} Fe(OH) 2, and the aggregation of nanoparticles into large microparticles [19]. Therefore, gelatin {{plays a key role in}} the size uniformity and stabilization of FeS 2 nanocrystals. Secondly, 1.5 mmol FeCl 2 [*]·[*] 4 H 2 O was dissolved in 5 mL DI water and then added to the gelatin solution drop by drop at room temperature to avoid the oxidation of Fe 2 +. By adding NaOH powder, the pH of the solution was then slowly adjusted to about 12. The overdosing OH- at this stage provides an alkaline environment, thus facilitating the reaction processes. NaOH has a significant influence on the reaction between S and water and hence the quality of FeS 2 nanocrystals [20]. During this process, the transparent solution changed from light yellow to light green gradually, and then separated out into dark green flocculent <b>precipitates.</b> Lastly, <b>sulphur</b> powder was added to the homogenous solution, which was magnetically stirred for over an hour. The final concentration of gelatin was about 1.5 % w/v. The prepared mixture was sealed in a stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for a certain reaction time before being naturally cooled down to room temperature. The black product was then centrifuged and washed using DI water and alcohol for several times to remove the excess polymer and ions [19]. The phase-pure and crystalline nanocrystals was then acquired and dispersed in ethanol to avoid oxidation.|$|R
40|$|Chlorine- and sulphur-bearing {{compounds}} in fumarole discharges of the La Fossa crater at Vulcano Island (Italy) can be modelled by a mixing process between magmatic gases and vapour from a boiling hydrothermal system. This allows estimating the {{compounds in}} both endmembers. Magma degassing cannot explain the time variation of sulphur and HCl {{concentrations in the}} deep endmember, which are more probably linked to reactions of solid phases at depth, before mixing with the hydrothermal vapours. Based on the P^T conditions and speciation of the boiling hydrothermal system below La Fossa, the HCl and Stot contents in the hydrothermal vapours were used to compute the redox conditions and pH of the aqueous solution. The {{results suggest that the}} haematite magnetite buffer controls the hydrothermal fO 2 values, while the pH has increased {{since the end of the}} 1970 s. The main processes affecting pH values may be linked to Na^Ca exchanges between evolved seawater, feeding the boiling hydrothermal system, and local rocks. While Na is removed from water, calcium enters the solution, undergoes hydrolysis and produces HCl,lowering the pH of the water. The increasing water^rock ratio within the hydrothermal system lowers the Ca availability, so the aqueous solution becomes less acidic. Seawater flowing towards the boiling hydrothermal brine dissolves a large quantity of pyrite along its path. In the boiling hydrothermal system, dissolved <b>sulphur</b> <b>precipitates</b> as pyrite and anhydrite, and becomes partitioned in vapour phase as H 2 S and SO 2. These results are in agreement with the paragenesis of hydrothermal alteration minerals recovered in drilled wells at Vulcano and are also in agreement with the isotopic composition of sulphur emitted by the crater fumaroles...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Marmara Denizi’nin doğusunda yer alan Gemlik Körfezi en derin yeri - 113 m olan yarı kapalı bir havza olup, drenaj alanında pek çok endüstriyel ve evsel atık alması sebebiyle antropojenik kirlilik riski altındadır. Bu çalışmada Gemlik Körfezi’nin  - 71 ile - 105 m aralığındaki su derinliğinden alınmış üç karotta yapılan jeokimyasal analizlerle ağır metal kirliliğinin ve organik kirliliğin boyutları ve zamansal gelişimi araştırılmıştır.   Karotlarda µ-XRF karot tarayıcısı ile çoklu element, çok sensörlü karot log alıcısı (MSCL) fiziksel özellikler ve ICP-MS yöntemi ile ağır metaller analiz edilmiştir. Çökellerin toplam organik karbon (TOK) ve toplam inorganik karbon (TİK) analizleri ile organik maddenin δ 13 C ve δ 15 N, C ve N element analizleri yapılmıştır. Karotların tarihlendirilmesi radyonüklid (210 Pb ve 137 Cs) ve hızlandırılmış kütle spektrometresi (AMS) radyokarbon yöntemiyle gerçekleştirilmiştir.   İnce taneli homojen koyu gri-kahverengi çamurdan oluşan M- 17, MNTKI- 13 ve M- 18 karotları, sırasıyla son 250, 260 ve 200 yılı kapsamakta ve üst kısımlarında 1985 – 1995 yılları arasında çökelmiş kokolit laminalı bir birim içermektedir. Ayrıca MNTKI- 13 karotunda 1930 ve M- 18 karotunda 1985 yıllarında olasılıkla Kocadere deltasından taşınmış iki kütle akması birimi tespit edilmiştir. Kütle akması birimlerinde Ti ve Zr zenginleşmesine karşın; Th, La, Nb ve Rb’deki fakirleşme, kaba silt tane boyundaki bu birimlerin rutil, titanit ve zirkon gibi ağır mineral içeriğinin zengin olmasından ileri gelmektedir. Karotların kokolit laminalı biriminde % 4 ’e varan TOK içeriğindeki artış, burada yaklaşık olarak 1965 ’te oluşan oksijensiz dip suyu koşullarından hemen sonra başlamıştır. Yaklaşık 1995 sonrası çökellerdeki organik maddenin kökeninin karasal olmasına karşın; 1985 - 1995 yılları arasındaki organik maddenin kökeni denizeldir. Kokolitli birimin çökelmesine de neden olan bu dönemdeki alg patlamaları, endüstriyel ve evsel atık kaynaklı besin elementi (P ve N) girdisine ve ötrifikasyona işaret etmektedir. δ 15 N değerleri 1930 ’dan günümüze olan zaman aralığında göreceli olarak daha yüksektir. Özellikle son 40 yılda körfezde bol besin elementi olduğunun bilinmesine karşın; nitrojen izotop oranının yüksek olması denitrifikasyon sürecinin baskın olduğunu göstermektedir. K, Rb ve Li’un 1840 - 1980 yılları arasında göreceli olarak zenginleşmesi, bu yıllar  arasında yüksek erozyona ve kurak bir iklime; son 40 yıl içerisinde fakirleşmesi ise  azalan erozyona ve yağışlı bir iklime işaret etmektedir. As, Sb, Bi, Cu, Pb, Zn ve Cd  ve Th konsantrasyonları yaklaşık 1975 yılından itibaren antropojenik olarak hızla  artmaktadır. Cd önemli derecede zenginleşme gösterirken (zenginleşme faktörü, EFmax= 6), Zn ve Sb orta derecede zenginleşme göstermektedir (EF= 2. 2 – 2. 3). Metal değerleri 1980 ’den itibaren eşik değerlerini aşmaya başlamıştır.  Mo, 1965 ’ten itibaren, kısmen anoksik dip suyu koşullarının gelişmesi ve antropojenik girdilerle birlikte artmaya başlamış ve çok yüksek miktarda zenginleşme göstermiştir (EFmax= 50). Sb, S (EFmax = 3. 6) ve U (EFmax= 3) da kısmen diyajenetik, kısmen antropojenik kirlilik nedeniyle Mo’e göre daha az zenginleşmiştir. Gemlik Gulf, {{which is}} a semi- {{enclosed}} inlet with maximum depth of 113 m {{in the eastern part}} of the Sea of Marmara, is under the risk of anthropogenic pollution from different industrial and municipial pollution sources in its drainage basin.   In this study, the extent and temporal evolution of the heavy metal and organic pollution were investigated using a wide range of analyses of three cores located in different water depths ranging from - 71 m to - 105 m. The cores were analyzed using µ-XRF core Scanner, Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL)  and Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP – MS) for sediment metal concentrations. analysis of δ 13 C and δ 15 N mass spectrometric and elemental C and N analyses of bulk oganic matter and total organic carbon (TOC) and inorganic carbon (TIC) analyses of sediments were also carried out. The chronology of the cores were determined using radionuclide (210 Pb and 137 Cs) and Accelarated Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analyses.   Cores M- 17, MNTKI- 13 and M- 18 cover the last 250, 260 and 200 years, respectively, and include dark grey brown clayey – silt sized mud with some red brown mass-flow units and a coccolithopore ooze-bearing unit near the top. The lithological and geochemical correlation between the cores was done according to the chronology of the core MNTKI – 13 that was determined from radionuclide dating. Therefore, age models for the two other cores (M 17 and M 18) were created according to these correlations. Thus, the bottom of the coccolithopore ooze-bearing unit was dated at 1985 and it was revealed that this unit deposited between 1985 and 1995. Two mass flow units identified in cores M- 18 and MNTKI- 13 were probably originated from Kocadere delta during years 1985 and 1930 respectively.  The gray brown unit of MNTKI - 13 deposited between years 1945 and 1950.  Enrichment of Ti and Zr and depletion of other lithophile crustal elements (Th, La, Nb ve Rb) in these units are due to heavy mineral (rutile, titanite and zirconium) -rich silt size detrital influx. The red – brown color and high magnetic susceptibility values (25 uSI) of the mass units indicate the presence of Fe-oxides. These mass flow units are characterized with increasing trends of elements such as K, Ti, Mn, Zr and Fe that are associated with terrigenous material input, whereas decreasing trends of Ca and total inorganic carbon content due to dilution of biogenic material input. On the other hand, the Ca and total inorganic carbon content increase in coccolithopore ooze bearing unit, whereas K, Ti, Mn, Zr and Fe content as well as magnetic susceptibility values decrease due to dominance of biogenic material deposition.   The gray – brown unit of MNTKI- 13 which deposited between the years 1945 and 1950 reveal low magnetic susceptibility, high Ca and total inorganic carbon content and is distinguished in the radiography as a dark color band. These results indicate that this unit is a diagenetic carbonate cementation zone.     Increase of TOC to 4 % in the coccolith ooze unit follows the establishment anoxia in bottom waters soon after the year 1965.   The origin of organic matter that was deposited after the year 1995 is of terrestrial end-member, whereas it is of marine end – member in the coccolithopore unit that deposited between the years 1985. A high content of terrestrial organic matter (C/N = 50) is transported to the centre of the Gemlik Bay with the 1930 mass flow. Algal blooms after 1985 indicate high nutrient input (N and P) and eutrophication caused by industrial and domestic discharge to the gulf as well as sewage and fertilizers used in agricultural activities. High organic matter content and nutrient input to the Gemlik gulf leading to the organic pollution since 1930 s is caused mainly by the industries in the gulf area such as Sümerbank Filature Factory built in 1937, olive oil and fertilizer production. Therefore the anoxic conditions that developed at the sea bottom after the year 1965 {{which is a}}lso revealed by the Mn depletion onset in sediments, is caused by the high rate of organic matter input from industrial and domestic effluents that are consuming oxygen in water column coupled with the natural stratification in water column preventing the renewal of oxygen. Hence, both of these processes lead to oxygen deficiency in bottom waters. δ 15 N content is relatively higher after year 1930, reaching maximum values during the last 40 years in the gulf. If the oxygen levels decrease in bottom waters and the conditions become reducing, the reduction of NO 3 - leads the remnant NO 3 - to be enriched in δ 15 N. Because the denitrifying bacteria prefers the light isotope to heavy isotope (isotope fractionation) for its metabolism during nitrate reduction reaction (denitrification) for obtaining energy. Such high δ 15 N values indicate that denitrification has been an important process after 1930 s until present, in relation with anoxic bottom water conditions. Low δ 15 N contents between the years 1830 – 1930 (‰ 2, 5 - 3) indicate that the denitrification was not so common and the bottom waters were relatively more oxic. The oxygen content in waters increases due to decreasing temperatures and consequently increasing rate of water circulation. Relative enrichment of K, Rb and Li during 1840 - 1980 indicate that relatively arid climatic conditions prevented forest expansion and lead to the erosion that transported these lithophile elements to the gulf within clastic minerals. Their depletion during the last 40 years indicate more humid climate conditions and more precipitation leading to forest expansion and less erosion. These results are supported by climatic δ 18 O data from a lake in the central part of Turkey. Similarly K, Ti, Fe and Zr show decreasing trends during approximately 1915 according to the XRF data, in cores M- 17 and M- 18. This depletion period is correlated with the increasing precipitation identified from the δ 18 O curve from the same lake.   The origin of crustal - derived, lithophile elements in Gemlik Gulf sediments such as Rb, Li, Ti, Nb, La, Zr and Th is felsic gneiss and granites of Paleozoic - Triassic age of Karakaya unit and granites of Oligo - Miocene age that outcrop in Armutlu peninsula and the surrounding region.   Concentrations of heavy metals such as As, Sb, Bi, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and Th increase abruptly after 1975 due to anthropogenic pollution. Cd is significantly enriched (enrichment faxtor, EFmax= 6) among them, whereas the enrichments of Zn and Sb are moderate (EF= 2. 2 – 2. 3), with all heavy metal concentrations rising above treshold level (EF= 2) starting around the year 1980. Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) values show a similar trend with enrichment factors (EFs) according to the onset of pollution. Geoaccumulation index of Cd reaches above extreme pollution treshold (Igeo= 5) in 1995 followed by a decreasing trend up to present.   Mo (EFmax= 50), together with U (EFmax = 3), S (EFmax = 3. 6), and Sb, is highly enriched after 1965, which is due in part to diagenesis under anoxic bottom waters and in part to increased anthropogenic pollution. Calcophile semi-metals such as S, As, Zn, and Sb as well as elements such as Mo and U become enriched under anoxic bottom water conditions. Increasing total organic carbon content (up to 4 % in coccolithopore ooze bearing unit) as well as depletion of Mn in sediments indicate development of anoxic conditions. Thus, Mo, and S shows high correlation with total organic carbon content. The onset of enrichment of Mo and S indicate the onset of anoxic bottom water conditions development as 1965. Because Mo, and uranium <b>precipitates</b> with <b>sulphur</b> and become enriched in sediments under reducing conditions.   The enrichment of Cd, Mo and Th in Gemlik Gulf sediments is also possibliy, partially caused by the usage of phosphate fertilizers for agriculture in Gemlik Gulf drainage basin. Because phosphate fertilizers contain these elements. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
