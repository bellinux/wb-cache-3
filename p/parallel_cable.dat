50|$|The printer {{side of the}} {{interface}} quickly became an industry de facto standard, but manufacturers used various connectors on the system side, so a variety of cables were required. For example, NCR used the 36-pin micro ribbon connector {{on both ends of}} the connection, early VAX systems used a DC-37 connector, Texas Instruments used a 25-pin card edge connector and Data General used a 50-pin micro ribbon connector. When IBM implemented the parallel interface on the IBM PC, they used the DB-25F connector at the PC-end of {{the interface}}, creating the now familiar <b>parallel</b> <b>cable</b> with a DB25M at one end and a 36 pin micro ribbon connector at the other.|$|E
5000|$|... 16-bit {{versions}} of the game were released in 1988 for the Atari ST and Amiga home computers. Except for the music, which was done by Dave Lowe, the Atari ST version was done entirely by Archer MacLean. He used the bitmap editor NeoChrome to draw background graphics and sprites. Coding was done in assembler on a PC-based development system that cross-compiled the 800 KBytes of source code in seven seconds and transferred the program to the RAM of the Atari ST via a <b>parallel</b> <b>cable.</b> Development took six months. The subsequent port to Amiga took just seven days thanks to MacLean avoiding operating system calls as much as possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} cloning a disk {{is to have}} both the source and destination disks present in the same machine, but this is often not possible. Disk cloning programs can link two computers by a <b>parallel</b> <b>cable,</b> or save and load images to an external USB drive or network drive. As disk images {{tend to be very}} large (usually a minimum of several hundred MB), performing several clones at a time puts excessive stress on a network. The solution is to use multicast technology. This allows a single image to be sent simultaneously to many machines without putting greater stress on the network than sending an image to a single machine.|$|E
40|$|A short {{computer}} program, fully documented, is presented, for the step-by-step {{dynamic analysis}} of isolated cables or couples of <b>parallel</b> <b>cables</b> of a cable-stayed bridge, connected {{to each other}} and possibly with the deck of the bridge, by very thin pretensioned wires (cross-ties) and subjected to variation of their axial forces due to traffic or to successive pulses of a wind drag force. A simplified SDOF model, approximating the fundamental vibration mode, is adopted for every individual cable. The geometric nonlinearity of the cables is taken into account by their geometric stiffness, whereas the material nonlinearities of the cross-ties include compressive loosening, tensile yielding, and hysteresis stress-strain loops. Seven numerical experiments are performed. Based on them, it is observed that if two interconnected <b>parallel</b> <b>cables</b> have different dynamic characteristics, for example different lengths, thus different masses, weights, and geometric stiffnesses, too, or if one of them has a small additional mass, then a single pretensioned very thin wire, connecting them {{to each other and}} possibly with the deck of the bridge, proves effective in suppressing, by its hysteresis damping, the vibrations of the cables...|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the bridge is a variant of Santiago Calatrava's {{pioneering}} 1992 design of a cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge in Seville, Spain. In the Serreria bridge, the pylon is curved backward (angle of the pylon was determined by {{an analysis of the}} counter forces against the cable stays) and also back-stayed to concrete counterweights in the roadway. The aesthetic effect of the Serreria bridge arises in part from the curved pylon and the 29 <b>parallel</b> <b>cables</b> supporting the bridge deck, accented at night by spot lighting of the cables and the pylon. The bridge deck has two carriageways, three lanes each for cars and one additional lane for a tramway, and another for pedestrian and cycle traffic, this last along the middle spine of the deck by the cable stays. Although the <b>parallel</b> <b>cables</b> and curved pylon are essentially in one vertical plane (see photos of the cables), because of the changing curvature of the pylon, like that of a planar spiral curve form, there might be an optical illusion when the bridge is view from the side (e.g., see side view photo above) that the pylon and the cables may appear to be not planar.|$|R

50|$|The 1571 {{built into}} the European plastic-case C128 D {{computer}} is electronically identical to the stand-alone version, but 1571 version integrated into the later metal-case C128 D (often called C128 DCR, for D Cost-Reduced) differs a lot from the stand-alone 1571. It includes a newer DOS, version 3.1, replaces the MOS Technology CIA interface chip, of which only a few features were used by the 1571 DOS, with a very much simplified chip called 5710, and has some compatibility issues with the stand-alone drive. Because this internal 1571 {{does not have an}} unused 8-bit input/output port on any chip, unlike most other Commodore drives, {{it is not possible to}} install a <b>parallel</b> <b>cable</b> in this drive, such as that used by SpeedDOS, DolphinDOS and some other fast third-party Commodore DOS replacements.|$|E
