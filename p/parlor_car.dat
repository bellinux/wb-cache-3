5|$|The Disneyland Railroad today {{operates}} {{four sets}} of train cars, {{as well as a}} <b>parlor</b> <b>car.</b> The combine car from the railroad's former Retlaw 1 passenger train, one of the DRR's two original train sets, was Walt Disney's favorite train car on the railroad, as it brought back memories from his youth working as a news butcher on the Missouri Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|An {{option to}} ride on {{a seat in the}} tenders of the DRR's {{locomotives}} is available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the start of each operating day. The option to ride in the DRR's Lilly Belle <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> is also available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station when a Disneyland employee is available to monitor the passengers aboard it and no heavy rain is falling. The DRR's roundhouse, which cannot normally be viewed by the public, is made available for viewing to participants of specific runDisney events where the race course organized for the runners goes past the facility.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E
50|$|In 1906 {{the company}} owned and {{operated}} 405 cars: 144 passenger <b>cars,</b> 6 <b>parlor</b> <b>cars,</b> 17 electric locomotives, 221 freight cars, 5 mail cars and 12 repair service cars.|$|R
50|$|Both Tavern-Lounge cars (789 and 790) survive. Once used as <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> by the Long Island Rail Road, {{they were}} later {{acquired}} by Metro-North, which still uses them in business trains.|$|R
50|$|The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio ordered {{additional}} {{chair and}} <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> from ACF in 1947 but otherwise made few {{changes to the}} trains equipment. The new cars seated 68 and 31, respectively.|$|R
5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three freight cars. In {{addition to the}} coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), the railroad {{had at least one}} <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> and several Brill-built observation cars. Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open-air cars for excursion service. Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of gondola cars for coal traffic. The railroad continued to maintain a standard gauge gondola fleet {{in the last years of}} its existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{attraction}} originated as {{a concept}} created by Walt Disney, who drew inspiration from the ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad built in his backyard. The Disneyland Railroad first {{opened to the public}} at Disneyland's grand opening on July 17, 1955. Since that time, multiple alterations have been made to its route, including the addition of two large dioramas in the late 1950s and mid-1960s. Several changes have also been made to its rolling stock, including the conversion of one of its train cars into a <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> in the mid-1970s, and the switch from diesel oil to biodiesel to fuel its locomotives in the late 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Sunrise Special (1922â€“1942) ran {{during the}} summer, NY Penn to Montauk on Fridays and {{westbound}} Mondays. In summer 1926 it ran daily. All <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> (no coaches) from 1932 to 1937.|$|E
25|$|The Cannonball, a Friday-only 12-car {{train to}} Montauk running May through October, with two all-reserved <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> with full bar service. Since May 24, 2013 it has {{originated}} at Penn Station with a Sunday evening return from Montauk; only the westward train stops at Jamaica. The two rear cars ("Hamptons Reserve Service") have reserved seating and exclusive bar service. The {{name is a}} nod to the Cannon Ball, the all-year train to Amagansett/Montauk from the 1890s until the 1970s. It carried <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> and standard-fare coaches and ran weekday afternoons from Long Island City, then from Penn Station until 1951.|$|R
60|$|The long express {{had rolled}} into the great depot and the porters were busy {{brushing}} up the passengers in the <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> and gathering together their baggage--and incidentally, the tips which were forthcoming.|$|R
50|$|The {{first batch}} of E-class {{carriages}} were built between 1906 and 1911, with 38 AVE 1st class cars, 16 ABVE 1st/2nd class cars, 39 BVE 2nd class cars, 25 DVE guard's vans, 10 ESBV, 2 EES and 2 EEB mail vans, 6 Sleeping <b>cars</b> and 2 <b>Parlor</b> <b>cars,</b> a State Car {{was built in}} 1912, with a similar design {{to that of the}} <b>Parlor</b> <b>cars.</b> The DVE, EEB and EES classes were 60.16 ft long, the remainder 71 ft. All had wooden bodies, clerestory roofs and six-wheel bogies. On his website, Peter J. Vincent notes that he suspects the 'E' classification referred to 'Express'.|$|R
25|$|The Spirit of Progress was {{launched}} on 17 November 1937 in {{a blaze of}} publicity, which included dramatic footage being taken of the new train racing Airco DH.4 aeroplane VH-UBZ Spirit of Melbourne on its demonstration run to Geelong. In an elaborate launch ceremony at Spencer Street station, Premier Albert Dunstan opened the <b>Parlor</b> <b>Car</b> with a gold key.|$|E
25|$|For the 70th anniversary VicTrack, the Department of Infrastructure, and the Victorian Government {{funded the}} {{restoration}} of the remaining carriages for use on a special train. Eight original carriages were assembled; and <b>Parlor</b> <b>Car,</b> Dining Car, brake van 1 CS, and diesel locomotives B74 and S303 were repainted into VR livery. The Seymour Railway Heritage Centre operated train ran from Melbourne to Albury on 25 November 2007.|$|E
25|$|More capital {{improvement}} projects {{took place}} during the late 1990s. In 1998, the railroad began to replace its aging diesel and <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> fleet, which dated from the 1940s and 1950s, by purchasing new bi-level coaches. In doing so the railroad also began to install the rest of its stations with completely ADA-accessible high-level platforms. Some of these stations were closed rather than upgraded due to low patronage.|$|E
25|$|The railway still uses vintage <b>parlor</b> <b>cars,</b> {{the oldest}} four built in 1881 and predating WP by 17 years, and four new cars built in 2007 {{follow the same}} 19th century design. At least three cars have {{wheelchair}} lifts.|$|R
50|$|While {{the road}} was in operation, it was noted for a high {{standard}} of service. Beginning in 1913, the company had three <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> on its limited trains. This continued until World War I, when they were converted for freight service.|$|R
60|$|The {{passengers}} were already getting their belongings together, {{and in the}} <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> the porters were brushing off the people and, incidentally, pocketing various tips. Then the train rolled into the Grand Central Depot, now called the Grand Central Terminal.|$|R
25|$|For most of {{its history}} LIRR has served commuters, but it had many named trains, some with all-first class seating, parlor cars, and full bar service. Few of them lasted past World War II, but some names were revived during the 1950s and 1960s as the {{railroad}} expanded its east end <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> service with luxury coaches and Pullman cars from railroads that were discontinuing their passenger trains.|$|E
25|$|To {{mark the}} 50th {{anniversary of the}} first train, a {{commemorative}} train organised by the Australian Railway Historical Society ran on 14 November 1987. With the original 1937 S type carriages still in regular service with V/Line (and painted in V/Line's tangerine livery) the 50th anniversary train instead consisted of the last remaining set of air-conditioned blue and gold E type carriages then operated by V/Line, hauled by R707, with <b>Parlor</b> <b>Car</b> Norman the only vehicle in the train from the original Spirit of Progress consist.|$|E
25|$|Northern Pacific 1102, {{a heavyweight}} Railway Post Office car {{built by the}} Pullman Company in 1914 as a <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> named Reba. It was later rebuilt by the NP into NP 631, an 86-seat heavyweight coach, and in 1947 as a triple combine car with a fifteen-foot RPO section. In 1965 it was {{refitted}} by the NP's Signal Department {{for use as a}} training car. The car has been rebuilt to its triple combine configuration and gives demonstrations of how the U.S. Mail used to move by rail at the Minnesota Transportation Museum in Saint Paul, Minnesota.|$|E
500|$|Budd built 40 Amfleet I [...] "Amclub" [...] club cars, {{similar to}} {{traditional}} <b>parlor</b> <b>cars.</b> These cars had a snack {{bar in the}} center, 18 club seats in a 2Ã—1 configuration, and 23 coach seats. These cars provided first class service on select trains. Amtrak later referred to these as [...] "split" [...] Amclubs; club cars rebuilt with all-club style seating were called [...] "full" [...] Amclubs.|$|R
25|$|During {{the summer}} the {{railroad}} offers special summer package ticket deals to {{places such as}} Long Beach, Jones Beach, the Hamptons, Montauk, and Greenport. Passengers traveling to the Hamptons and Montauk on the Cannonball can reserve {{a seat in the}} all-reserved <b>Parlor</b> <b>Cars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The premier New York-Boston {{passenger}} train was the Merchants Limited, leaving Grand Central and South Station at 5 PM. Also prominent was the Yankee Clipper, with 1 PM departures. For many years these trains carried no coaches; only <b>parlor</b> <b>cars</b> and dining and lounge cars.|$|R
2500|$|The Ohio Railway Museum in Worthington {{operates}} on about one mile of former Columbus, Delaware and Marion right-of-way. The museum's collection includes a preserved CD <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> numbered 501. Until 1969, another [...] segment of CD track, {{leading to a}} power plant, was used in Marion.|$|E
2500|$|From 1956 {{some key}} {{changes to the}} consist occurred. VR and the New South Wales Government Railways {{introduced}} a new daylight connecting service between Melbourne and Sydney, the Intercapital Daylight, and the <b>Parlor</b> <b>Car</b> {{was removed from the}} Spirit and transferred to the new day train. At the same time, VR introduced open, [...] "saloon" [...] style Z type carriages which later began to supplement the original compartment carriages of 1937 in the Spirit consist.|$|E
2500|$|A {{total of}} 35 cars was ordered. [...] The first 14, cars 50-63, {{came from the}} American Car and Foundry and were deluxe cars with coach seating at the front and <b>parlor</b> <b>car</b> chairs at the back. [...] The {{remaining}} 21 cars, numbered 64-84, came from Pullman and had all coach seating with a small baggage section at the rear. [...] Delivery of the new high-speeds began in July 1931 and they were an immediate success, {{making it possible for}} IR to reduce running times on some of its routes and economize on its operations.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys had}} {{obtained}} seats in advance {{in one of}} the <b>parlor</b> <b>cars,</b> and soon they made themselves comfortable. They talked over what had happened while their visitors had been with them, and presently commenced to discuss the expected hunting on and around Snowshoe Island.|$|R
50|$|Late 1937 saw {{all of the}} {{original}} order of twelve carriages delivered, bar one of the first-class sitting cars, No.4. The other eight sitting cars entered service on 14 November 1937; the Dining and <b>Parlor</b> <b>cars</b> on the 17th, and the steel CE van on the 18th.|$|R

2500|$|Much of the Chippewas {{equipment}} came second-hand {{from its}} more famous cousin. The original Chippewa operated with two coaches, a {{railway post office}} (RPO), dining car, and <b>parlor</b> <b>car.</b> As part of a reshuffling of equipment on the Milwaukee Road in late 1948 the Chippewa received the [...] "Beaver Tail" [...] parlors made famous by the original Hiawatha. Motive power was provided by Class A 4-4-2 steam locomotives between Chicago and Milwaukee, and by the Class F3 Pacifics north. Dieselization came in 1950 with Erie-builts from Fairbanks-Morse. Later diesels included EMD E7s, EMD FP7s, and finally EMD GP9s. The train received newer equipment in 1948, including third-generation Beaver Tail parlors. These cars were removed in 1951 along with the full dining car.|$|E
