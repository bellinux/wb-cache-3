The retention times of various low-boiling compounds relative to water were measured on the collection columns {{to determine which}} compounds would be lost during the water removal step employed after sampling aqueous materials. Compounds eluted fastest from Tenax GC precolumns and slowest from <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q,</b> with retention times on Chromosorb 102 generally intermediate. Thus, loss of low-boiling compounds relative to water was greatest on Tenax GC and limited {{the use of this}} polymer for quantitative study of samples containing low-boiling volatile compounds. The residual water in <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> precolumns employed in the usual procedure for collection of volatile materials by entrainment from aqueous systems, could be completely eluted in 15 min with a N₂ purge of 30 ml/min at 55 °C. without appreciable loss of collected organic compounds. Retention times of high-boiling organic compounds were determined on the precolumns, and those containing Tenax GC had shorter times than Chromosorb 102 or <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q.</b> Under conditions employed for unloading trapped compounds from precolumns, fewer compounds remained on Tenax GC precolumns. Thus, Tenax GC appeared to be the trapping polymer of choice in investigations involving high-boiling compounds. Back flushing of <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q,</b> Chromosorb 102, and Tenax GC precolumns during unloading was essential in order to recover the trapped organics within the time allotted for unloading at 135 °C. At 280 °C back flushing on Tenax GC was not necessary to insure unloading since retention times were well within the unloading period.

The head-space technique was compared with the injection of the complete liquid culture medium, and solvent extracts thereof, into the gas chromatograph. Volatile fatty acids could be detected by all three methods, whereas alcohols produced by C. perfringens and P. acnes were detectable only in the head-space chromatograms. Both FFAP and <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> were used as gas chromatography stationary phase. <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> was found more suitable than FFAP for the separation of alcohols.

40|$|Measurement of the {{permanent}} gases in the atmospheres of mission targets is a major objective. A 16 meter long Porapak N column was used on the Venus probe and required a rather high carrier gas flow rate. The researchers have, therefore, surveyed commercial porous polymer types which had some ability to resolve nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon monoxide gases. <b>Porapaks</b> N and <b>Q</b> appeared superior to most. Batch to batch variation, however, was quite wide, so the researchers learned how to synthesize porous polymer and investigated some of the factors affecting the separations. A polymer was synthesized which was superior to all commercial products and allowed at least a 50 % reduction in length and flow rate of carrier gas. Similar studies were made concerning the separation of hydrocarbons and new porous polymers have been synthesized which represent significant improvements in time of analysis, column, and carrier gas flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Gravid {{females of}} the common green bottle fly, Lucilia sericata Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae), readily locate {{recently}} deceased vertebrates as oviposition sites, particularly when these animals have been injured. We investigated semiochemical and visual cues that mediate attraction of gravid females to fresh rat carrion. Female flies were more strongly attracted to incised rat carrion than to intact carrion. They were also attracted to <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> headspace volatile (HSV) extract of incised rat carrion. Analyzing aliquots of <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> HSV extract by gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection revealed nine components [phenol, para- and/or meta-cresol (could not be separated), guaiacol, dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), phenylacetaldehyde, (E) - 2 -octenal, nonanal, and tetramethyl pyrazine] that consistently elicited responses from blow fly antennae. In laboratory experiments, a synthetic blend of these nine components was as attractive to gravid females as <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> HSV extract, but blend attractiveness was due entirely to DMTS. In both laboratory and field experiments, increasing doses of DMTS attracted increasingly more flies. Coupled with DMTS, carrion-type color cues (dark red, black) were more effective than bright color cues (white, yellow) in attracting flies. In field experiments, dark traps baited with DMTS captured a total of 214 calliphorid flies (200 L. sericata, 10 Lucilia illustris Meigen, three Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy, one Calliphora vomitoria L.), {{all of which were}} gravid females.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to evaluate the suitability of the ultrasonic flexural plate wave (FPW) device as the detector in a gas chromatograph (GC). Of particular interest is the detection of nitrous oxide (N 2 O). From experimental results we conclude analyte detection is achieved through two mechanisms: changes in gas density, and mass loading of the device membrane due to the sorption of gas molecules. Reducing the dead volume of the FPW chamber increased the FPW response. A comparison of the FPW response {{to that of the}} surface acoustic wave (SAW) detector provided with the GC (made by MSI, Microsensor Technologies, Inc.), shows that for unseparated N 2 O in N 2, the FPW exhibits a sensitivity that is at least 550 times greater than that of the SAW device. A <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> column was found to separate N 2 O from its carrier gas, N 2 or He.

The traceability to the WMO scale was tested by calibrating the GC-ECD/AA-F 1 analyser using five SF 6 standards provided by the WMO/Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Central Calibration Laboratory (CCL) for SF 6 (NOAA, United States of America). After calibration by various methods, the GC-ECD/AA-F 1 accurately estimated the mole fraction of SF 6 in the working standard prepared by the World Calibration Centre for SF 6 operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) /Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). Among the calibration methods, the two-point calibration method emerged to be the most economical procedure in terms of the data quality and measurement time. It was found that the KRISS scale of SF 6 /N 2 was biased by 0. 13 ppt when compared to the WMO scale of SF 6 /air; this bias is probably due to a different matrix...|$|E
30|$|The {{content of}} CH 4 and CO 2 in biogas were {{measured}} weekly using a Hach Carle 400 AGC gas chromatograph (Model 04131 -C, Chandler Engineering, Houston, TX, USA) configured {{for the application}} 131 -C. The application uses a column (1 / 8 inches) composed of 1.8  m (805 porapak N[*]+[*] 205 <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q),</b> 2.1  m (80 % molecular sieve 13 X[*]+[*] 20 % molecular Sieve 5 A), and 1.8  m (80 % OV- 101 on chromosorb WHP). The column and thermal conductivity detector were operated at 85  °C with a helium gas flow rate of 30  mL min− 1. The GC Calibration was performed weekly with a certified gas standard (27.3 % CO 2, 1.01 % N 2, 71.69 % CH 4, 0.53 % H 2 S). The quantification regression equation has been generated using the same certified gas standards. The linear quantification regression equation covered the range from 0.001 to 100 % (pure gas injection) with an R 2 value of 0.9991, 0.9988, and 0.9968 for CH 4, CO 2, and H 2 S. Additionally and routinely, the GC performance checkup during any gas test was conducted at the beginning, every five injections, {{and at the end}} of the analysis of each batch of gas samples. This checkup was conducted by injecting triplicate samples of the certified gas standard at the beginning and injecting one standard gas sample after every five injections of unknown samples until the end of the analysis.|$|E

Triplicate, 5 g wet soil samples were sealed with rubber septa {{stoppers}} in 30 ml tubes; 3 ml distilled deionized (DDI) water {{were added to}} the tube and purged with N 2 to maintain anaerobic conditions. Two milliliters of acetylene gas (C 2 H 2; approximately 10 % headspace) was injected into the tubes to block the conversion from N 2 O to N 2, and the tubes were then shaken for 1 h to disperse the gas. After shaking, a DEA solution (0.202 g KNO 3 L− 1, 0.25 g chloramphenicol L− 1, and 0.360 g C 6 H 12 O 6 L− 1) purged with oxygen-free N 2 gas was added to the tubes. Samples were shaken and incubated at room temperature. Headspace gas was collected at 1 h intervals for about 5 h. The potential denitrification rate was calculated from the steepest portion of curve produced when cumulative N 2 O evolution was plotted against time. The sampled gas was injected in a Shimadzu GC- 14 -A ECD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> column (Waters Associates, Inc., Milton, Massachusetts, USA). The operation temperatures for the column, injection port, and detector were set at 70 °C, 120 °C, and 230 °C, respectively. A 10 ppm standard concentration gas (Scott Specialty Gases, Inc., Plumsteadville, Pennsylvania, USA) was used to calibrate the measurement, and results were reported as N 2 O-N produced per gram of dry weight soil, per hour.|$|E
30|$|The {{reactant}} pulses {{were introduced}} into the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed using a fixed volume sample loop. Using this system, the catalysts (typically 0.50  g) were reduced in situ in a flow of hydrogen (40  cm 3  min− 1) by heating to 673  K {{at a rate of}} 10  K min− 1. The catalyst was held at this temperature for 2  h. The catalyst was then purged with argon (40  cm 3  min− 1) for 30  min and the catalyst was cooled in flowing argon to 293  K. The adsorbate gases were admitted by injecting pulses of known size (typically 24  μmol) into the argon carrier-gas stream, and hence onto the catalyst. The residence time of the pulse in the catalyst bed was ~ 1.5  s. In all cases, the whole pulse was analysed by on-line GC. For co-adsorption studies, the gases were mixed in the gas manifold prior to injection into the carrier gas. The amount of gas adsorbed, from any pulse, was determined from the difference between the peak area of a calibration pulse sent directly to the GC from the sample volume, and the peak area obtained following the injection of pulses of comparable size onto the catalyst. The detection limit for adsorption was 0.3  μmol g− 1. Adsorption measurements were typically repeated three times and the values reported are the average. Standard deviation on the amount adsorbed was typically less than ± 8 %. Adsorptions were followed using a gas chromatograph fitted with a thermal conductivity detector and Molecular Sieve 5 A and <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> columns.|$|E
40|$|Alcohol {{metabolism}} {{in humans}} {{has been studied}} by examining blood, urine and breath samples taken at frequent intervals for 3 hours after an alcohol load of 0. 5 ml/kg in a fasting condition. A gas chromatographic method was developed for the simultaneous estimation of acetaldehyde, ethanol and acetone levels in blood and urine specimens and various column packings were investigated. <b>Porapak</b> <b>Q</b> was the most suitable material and the method finally adopted used the headspace gas phase over urine or perchlorate precipitated blood specimens to which had been added sodium sulphate to displace the volatile components from the aqueous phase. Protein precipitation was {{necessary in order to}} prevent the loss of acetaldehyde from the blood samples. A gas sampling valve was fitted to enable similar determinations in breath samples but was not used in this study. Assays by enzymatic methods were developed for lactate, pyruvate, B-hydroxybutyrate, glucose and glycerol utilising the changes in concentration of NADH which was measured by fluorometry and the merits of converting NAD+ to a fluorescent compound was examined. Twenty male and eight females volunteered for the study. Blood samples were obtained from an intravenous catheter, a procedure supervised by a physician. Blood alcohol levels were monitored by breath tests with an electrochemical device, (an Alcolimiter) for detecting ethanol. Alcohol concentration in urine samples were measured and compared to the blood levels and the diuretic effect of alcohol was noted. These findings, together with those reported in the literature have been discussed together with their significance in interpreting disturbances of metabolism when alcohol is consumed. More assays are thought to be required including those for blood acetate, blood triglycerides with free fatty acids and some hormones. It is considered that the use of labelled compounds could add a new dimension to the in vivo investigations on human volunteers...|$|E
