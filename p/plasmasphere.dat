5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the <b>plasmasphere</b> is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E

50|$|The <b>plasmasphere,</b> or inner {{magnetosphere}}, is {{a region}} of the Earth's magnetosphere consisting of low energy (cool) plasma. It is located above the ionosphere. The outer boundary of the <b>plasmasphere</b> {{is known as the}} plasmapause, which is defined by an order of magnitude drop in plasma density. The <b>plasmasphere</b> was discovered in 1963 by Don Carpenter from the analysis of VLF whistler wave data. Traditionally, the <b>plasmasphere</b> has been regarded as a well behaved cold plasma with particle motion dominated entirely by the geomagnetic field and hence corotating with the Earth.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 {{satellite}} observations from the THEMIS mission {{have shown that}} density irregularities such as plumes or biteouts may form. It {{has also been shown}} that the <b>plasmasphere</b> does not always co-rotate with the Earth. The plasma of the magnetosphere has many different levels of temperature and concentration. The coldest magnetospheric plasma is most often found in the <b>plasmasphere,</b> a donut-shaped region surrounding the Earth. But plasma from the <b>plasmasphere</b> can be detected throughout the magnetosphere because it gets blown around by electric and magnetic field. Data gathered by the twin Van Allen Probes show that the <b>plasmasphere</b> also limits highly energetic ultrarelativistic electrons from cosmic and solar origin from reaching low earth orbits and the surface of the planet.|$|E

40|$|Processes which confine photoelectrons to the <b>plasmasphere</b> (e. g., collisional {{backscattering}} {{from the}} thermosphere and magnetic trapping due to pitch angle redistribution through Coulomb collisions in the <b>plasmasphere)</b> tend {{to increase the}} steady state photoelectron flux in the <b>plasmasphere</b> above the amplitude level that {{would otherwise have been}} attained. Theoretical calculations are presented of steady state photoelectron fluxes in the <b>plasmasphere,</b> for specified atmospheric and ionospheric conditions. (Observational plasma line intensity data for these conditions exist and will be compared elsewhere.) General features of the angular distribution are presented and compared with observations. The transparency of the <b>plasmasphere</b> and the backscattering properties of the thermosphere are investigated. The buildup effect due to collisional backscatter alone is calculated, and the combined buildup effect of pitch angle diffusion and backscatter is estimated. It is found that the inclusion of these effects increases the steady state photoelectron flux amplitude in the <b>plasmasphere</b> by about 50 % over the value obtained when the buildup effects are neglected. The calculated steady state photoelectron fluxes in the <b>plasmasphere</b> are in good agreement with the available observations...|$|E
