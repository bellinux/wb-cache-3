5000|$|The {{guernsey}} {{came into}} being as a garment for fishermen who required a warm, hard wearing, yet comfortable item of clothing that would resist the sea spray. The hard twist given to the tightly <b>packed</b> <b>wool</b> fibres in the spinning process and the tightly knitted stitches, produced a finish that would [...] "turn water" [...] and is capable of repelling rain and spray.|$|R
60|$|It is observable, {{by a very}} {{critical}} account of the wool produced annually in Romney marsh, in the county of Kent, and published in the said Plan of the English Commerce, that the fleeces of wool of those large sheep, generally weigh above four pounds and a half each. It is computed thus; first he tells us that Romney marsh contains 47,110 acres of land, that they feed 141,330 sheep, whose wool being shorn, makes up 2,523 <b>packs</b> of <b>wool,</b> the sum of which is, that every acre feeds three sheep, every sheep yields one fleece, and 56 fleeces make one <b>pack</b> of <b>wool,</b> all which comes out to 2,523 <b>packs</b> of <b>wool,</b> twenty-three fleeces over, every pack weighing two hundred and forty pounds of wool. Vide Plan, &c. p. 259.|$|R

50|$|Packaging of wool has {{not changed}} much for centuries except that the early <b>wool</b> <b>packs</b> were made from jute, prior {{to the use of}} {{synthetic}} fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several kilograms each. In the 1960s polypropylene and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose fibres from these packs caused contamination of the wool in the bale and led to nylon becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia, In South Africa woven paper was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost. Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a 280 mm label sewn onto the top flap of the <b>wool</b> <b>pack</b> for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, woolclasser stencil number and bin code. Each bale of <b>wool</b> <b>packs</b> contains 50 packs that measure 70 x 70 cm x 98 cm and have 46 cm flaps.|$|R
50|$|The wool {{producer}} {{is responsible}} for ensuring that the shearing shed is ready for shearing by testing the equipment, cleaning, disinfecting the shed and supplying emery papers, <b>wool</b> <b>packs</b> etc.|$|R
60|$|If, then, {{they run}} over to France a hundred {{thousand}} <b>packs</b> of <b>wool</b> yearly, which I take to be the least, all this amounts to twenty-eight millions of fleeces together; the other two millions of fleeces may justly be deducted for {{the difference between the}} quantity of wool taken from the sheep that are killed, which we call fell wool, and the fleece wool shorn.|$|R
50|$|Nigel Roderick Brown, ONZM (born 1949) is a New Zealand painter {{living in}} coastal Southland {{whose work is}} mainly {{about the history of}} New Zealand and its natives. As a young boy he spent much of his life growing up in a <b>packing</b> shed (<b>wool</b> shed or fruit packing shed - rural) in Tauranga. This may have {{influenced}} his strong symbolism of iconic New Zealand items (Weetbix,Pavlova, Black singlet, muscly NZ man).|$|R
60|$|I {{have met}} with {{some people who have}} made {{calculations}} of the quantity of wool which is sent annually from Ireland to France, and they have done it by calculating, first how many <b>packs</b> of <b>wool</b> the whole kingdom of Ireland may produce; and this they do again from the number of sheep which they say are fed in Ireland in the whole. How right this calculation may be I will not determine.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, Eliza's part in {{introducing}} Victoria's first fine-wool Saxon Merinos is commemorated, in a gravestone memorial (Coordinates: -36.843703, 145.624385) on Forlonge Memorial Road, Euroa, Victoria. It is {{a slab of}} granite {{in the shape of}} a <b>wool</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wool</b> <b>Pack</b> {{was adapted}} by the BBC as a 90-minute film {{entitled}} A Stranger on the Hills, televised in 1970 as a three-part series for children. It starred Raymond Millross as Nicholas Fetterlock, with Godfrey Quigley and Thelma Barlow as his parents.|$|R
60|$|I {{come next}} to the {{consumption}} at home, and here indeed the proof lies heavy upon ourselves; nothing but an unaccountable supreme negligence of our own apparent advantages can {{be the cause of}} the whole grievance; such a negligence, as I think, no nation but the English are, or can be guilty of; I mean no nation that has the like advantage of a manufacture, and that has a hundred thousand <b>packs</b> of <b>wool</b> every year unwrought up, and a million of people unemployed.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Chemical Engineering Journal [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] present study compares the influence of organic and hydraulic shock loadings on the performance of submerged aerated filters (SAFs) <b>packed</b> with <b>wool,</b> as a novel media and Kaldnes rings media in terms of total organic carbon (TOC), suspended solids (SS) and ammonia removal. The SAFs continued to achieve an average of more than 95 % TOC removal, 100 % of SS removal efficiency and 99. 8 % ammonia removal even when subject to shock loads. The ammonia removal was more sensitive than the other parameters, which was attributed to the slow growth of nitrifying bacteria, which are poor competitors for space and substrate. SAF <b>packed</b> with <b>wool</b> had a better capacity to overcome hydraulic shock than the SAF with Kaldnes, attributed to the better filtration properties, however, both SAFs exhibited rapid return to normal operation conditions after both short and longer shock loading. On doubling the organic load, the reactors responded differently, rapidly coping with the shock but were less stable. The longer-term organic shock loading caused a greater disturbance until sufficient biomass had grown to compensate, suggesting that mass transfer is less important than growth kinetics...|$|R
60|$|Shefford strolled {{outside and}} made the {{acquaintance}} of Withers's helper, a Mormon named Whisner. He was a stockily built man past maturity, and his sun-blistered face and watery eyes told of the open desert. He was engaged in weighing sacks of wool brought in by the Indians. Near by stood a framework of poles from which an immense bag was suspended. From {{the top of this}} bag protruded the head and shoulders of an Indian who appeared to be stamping and <b>packing</b> <b>wool</b> with his feet. He grinned at the curious Shefford. But Shefford was more interested in the Mormon. So far as he knew, Whisner was the first man of that creed he had ever met, and he could scarcely hide his eagerness. Venters's stories had been of a long-past generation of Mormons, fanatical, ruthless, and unchangeable. Shefford did not expect to meet Mormons of this kind. But any man of that religion would have interested him. Besides this, Whisner seemed to bring him closer to that wild secret cañon he had come West to find. Shefford was somewhat amazed and discomfited to have his polite and friendly overtures repulsed. Whisner might have been an Indian. He was cold, incommunicative, aloof; and there was something about him that made the sensitive Shefford feel his presence was resented.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the foot}} of this calculation, there are a hundred {{thousand}} <b>packs</b> of <b>wool</b> produced in Ireland every year, which {{we ought to take}} off, and which, for want of our taking it off, is carried away to France, where it is wholly employed to mimick our manufactures and abuse our trade; lessening thereby the demand of our own goods abroad, and even in France itself. This, therefore, is a just reproach to our nation, and they are certainly guilty of a great neglect in not taking off that wool, and more effectually preventing it being carried away to France.|$|R
50|$|Foxton {{was named}} after Sir William Fox, and {{has a history of}} flax stripping, which was used to make <b>wool</b> <b>packs,</b> matting, and rope. Other {{industries}} associated with the town have included clothing manufacture and sawmilling. The town is known for producing the soda drink Foxton Fizz., although the products are now made in Putaruru.|$|R
5000|$|The woolclasser {{oversees the}} duties of the woolpresser during the entire shearing. The presser ensures that the <b>wool</b> <b>pack</b> is free of any {{contaminants}} before he places it into the wool press and secures it there. He then carries the wool from the selected wool bin, removing any contamination, before placing it into the press.|$|R
5000|$|A wool bale is a {{standard}} sized and weighted <b>pack</b> of classed <b>wool</b> compressed by the mechanical means of a wool press. This is the regulation required method of packaging for wool, to keep it uncontaminated and readily identifiable. A [...] "bale of wool" [...] is also the standard trading unit for wool on the wholesale national and international markets.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where {{large numbers of}} sheep are kept for wool, sometimes many thousands in a flock, shearing sheds are vital to house the necessary shearing equipment, {{and to ensure that}} the shearers and /or crutchers have a ready supply of dry, empty sheep. The shed also provides space where the wool is classed and pressed into approved <b>wool</b> <b>packs</b> and stored to await transport to market.|$|R
30|$|Lipids were {{extracted}} {{according to}} Folch method (Folch et al. 1957), with some modifications. 15  mg of lyophilized cells were extracted with 3  mL of {{a mixture of}} chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v) (Wältermann et al. 2000). The mixture was incubated at room temperature with shaking for 2  h. The crude extract was filtered through a Pasteur pipette <b>packed</b> with glass <b>wool</b> (1.5  cm <b>packing)</b> to separate the cell debris and salts and afterwards evaporated to dryness.|$|R
50|$|Following {{damage caused}} by a {{windstorm}} in 1933 the rear verandah was enclosed and extended and the kitchen built in its present location. At about this time the originally corrugated iron gabled roof was also replaced by a corrugated iron hipped roof. In about 1942 an air raid shelter was excavated {{to the east of}} the rear of the house, but there is now no clear above ground evidence of this feature. Another notable feature of the house is the use of laced hoop iron to provide screening for the verandah. The hoop iron was originally used at the wool scour to bind <b>wool</b> bale <b>packs</b> and <b>wool</b> bales. Townspeople found the material ideal to create shaded semi-enclosed verandahs. The technique was once seen on most Ilfracombe houses, but now survives only at the Langenbaker house.|$|R
40|$|Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} in bilaterally placed sensory {{structures of}} insects {{may be considered}} maladaptive; natural selection should favour a symmetrical system. Among bushcrickets or katydids, threshold hearing sensitivity is, in part, dependent {{on the size of}} the auditory spiracle in the prothorax. We tested the degree of natural asymmetry in the hearing system of the ensiferan orthopteran Requena verticalis by measuring the size of the auditory spiracle of females. Naturally occurring asymmetry approached 8 %, which translates to a hearing bias at a threshold of only 0. 8 dB. Auditory asymmetry of females was experimentally exaggerated by <b>packing</b> cotton <b>wool</b> into either the right or left auditory spiracle. We made neurophysiological recordings from the ascending auditory T-fibre in the neck connective and found that the left–right bias created by this operation approximated 5 dB; this is greater than that found in nature.

50|$|He made a {{name for}} himself {{designing}} and striking medals for Dutch honorary societies, and kept the presses for these societies, striking medals on request and engraving the names of the prize winners himself. On his death the presses were often purchased back at great expense by the societies. The Teylers Stichting (English: Teylers Foundation) had him design a prize medal in 1778 that is still used. At 1000 guilders the manufacture of the coin stamps was costly -a consequence of the size of the medals, which matched the ambitions of the new Foundation. Another receipt in the archive of Teylers Stichting testifies to the great care Holtzhey took when sending the medals, which were securely <b>packed</b> in <b>wool</b> to protect them from shaking. After Holtzhey's death the Foundation purchased the stamp press for the Teylers prize medal from the Holtzhey estate for 100 guilders.|$|R
40|$|A {{convenient}} {{method for}} measuring the clean colour (Y and Y-Z) and photostability Δ(Y-Z) of small samples of fleece wool (0. 5 g) is described. Scoured wool samples are compressed to a constant density in disposable polymethyl methacrylate spectrophotometer cells and the wool colour is measured using a standard textile laboratory reflectance spectrophotometer. <b>Packing</b> scoured <b>wool</b> into cells ensures that the irradiated fibre surface is robust and individual fibres are unable to move relative to one another during irradiation and measurement. A UVB (280 – 320 nm) source was used to ensure all samples regardless of initial yellowness were yellowed following exposure and photobleaching was avoided. An apparatus capable of irradiating up to 48 scoured wool samples in one batch is described. The precision of photostability measurements was assessed and the relative error in Δ(Y-Z) was 5. 7 %. An initial study on 75 fleece wool samples with a high range of initial yellowness showed a moderate linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 68) between initial yellowness and Δ(Y-Z). <br /...|$|R
50|$|Bromley {{had reached}} {{the peak of his}} power and {{influence}} and reaped both prestige and wealth, not all of it from judicial sources. In 1580 he was licensed to import 200 <b>packs</b> of <b>wool</b> annually from Ireland, an opportunity that reinforced his natural inclination to side with the Shropshire towns against the monopolistic claims of Chester. The following year, Drake made him a present of captured Spanish gold plate on his return from circumnavigating the earth. In 1582 he was able to use his influence with the queen to thwart attempts to shift production of cloth from Welsh wool back into Wales and to move the staple to Chester, winning the approbation of the merchants and municipalities of Shrewsbury and Oswestry, who had most to lose from the proposed changes. Shrewsbury's council voted 20 marks for a piece of plate in gratitude for his political support. In 1585 he obtained the right to grant licences for alnage, or supervision of the quality of woollen cloth - a position of mutual advantage for himself and his regional allies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{land use}} survey of 1877 {{recorded}} 529381 acres of farmland, of which 355016 acres was permanent grass and 174365 acres was arable land, with additionally 1384 acres of orchards, 896 acres of market gardens and 487 acres of nursery grounds. In around 1870, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described the agriculture of the county: The estates, in general, are large; but the farms, on the average, are under 100 acres. Leases commonly run eleven years. Husbandry has undergone much improvement; {{but is still}} in need of much more. Wheat was formerly a famous produce; but is now less cultivated than before. Potatoes have considerable attention, and average about 10 tons per acre. Cheese is a main produce; and is exported, to all parts of England and to the Continent, {{to the amount of}} about 12,000 tons a year. Butter also is made in considerable quantity. Much {{attention has been paid to}} the breed of cows. About 65,000 sheep are kept, yielding about 1,250 <b>packs</b> of <b>wool</b> a year.|$|R
60|$|Now it chanced that Roger Vanderwater {{was lying}} ill in his palace {{at the other}} end of Kingsbury--not the dire illness that strikes down you and me, brothers; just a bit of biliousness, mayhap, or no more than a bad {{headache}} because he had eaten too heartily or drunk too deeply. But it was enough for him, being tender and soft from careful rearing. Such men, <b>packed</b> in cotton <b>wool</b> all their lives, are exceeding tender and soft. Believe me, brothers, Roger Vanderwater felt as badly with his aching head, or THOUGHT he felt as badly, as Tom Dixon really felt with his arm torn out by the roots.|$|R

50|$|In 1776 he {{returned}} to Manchester, and lived at No. 6, Deansgate, opposite the <b>Wool</b> <b>Pack.</b> At this time Mr. Smith, a Manchester merchant, whose warehouse was in Hunter's lane, agreed to form a partnership with him and build a spinning factory in Yorkshire, which had a ready supply of water power. But just as arrangements were reaching a conclusion Mr. Smith was unfortunately drowned at Blackpool. After this disappointment, in 1777 Highs went to Nottingham to construct spinning-machines for Messrs. Stanfield & Hallam, or Bancroft & Hallam, and in 1778/79, he made machines at Kidderminster, for various manufacturers, among them, Messrs. Pardoe, Lea & Co.|$|R
