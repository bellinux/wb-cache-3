Research concerning their presence in microorganisms, physiological functions, structural characteristics and feasible biotechnological applications has tended to focus on <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidases</b> (POs) of several fungi, especially white-rot fungi [Morozova et al. 2007, Rodriguez-Couta and Toca-Herrera 2006]. In contrast the expression of POs and structurally related non-enzymatic blue multicopper protein structures in prokaryotes has not been so widely investigated [Claus 2003]. As the majority of <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidases</b> described in literature have been isolated from higher fungi, the cellular function for these oxygen-requiring enzymes in eukaryotic systems was typically related to oxidative polymerization and depolymerisation of lignin [Kawai et al. 1988, O'Malley et al. 1993], but also to formation of carposomes linked with synthesis of cell wall-associated pigments [Thurston 1994], sporulation [Leonowicz et al. 2001] and plant pathogenesis [Bar-Nun and Meyer 1989]. Similarities to the occurrence of prokaryotic <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidases</b> can also be considered [Faure et al. 1994] reported prokaryotic PO activity in Azospirillum lipoferum which lives, comparable to several soil fungi, in association with the plant rhizosphere and promotes plant growth. This bacterial PO was determined to be expressed in combination with physiological processes like cell pigmentation and the activation of phenolic plant ingredients. Within our previous studies, nitrogen-fixing cultures of the non-symbiotic Azotobacter chroococcum SBUG 1484, isolated from composted earth, exhibited PO activity when growing with nutritional deficiencies, especially depletion of exogenous nitrogen sources [Herter et al. 2011]. Interestingly, cell-associated PO production in A. chroococcum cells appeared in conjunction with an increased formation of a brown-black pigment identified as melanin. These observations were made concurrently with morphological alteration during the life-cycle of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484, in which cell bodies shortened, encapsulated and development of cysts occurred.|$|R

40|$|Extracellular phenol oxidases play an {{important}} role in the soil carbon cycle. The effects of a field-scale summer drought manipulation on extracellular litter and soil <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity, soluble phenolic compounds and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were examined for an upland Calluna heathland on a peaty podsol in North Wales. Litter and organic soil <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity was found to be positively correlated with moisture content. Thus in shallow organic soils, which are sensitive to drying during periods of low rainfall, drought may inhibit soil <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity as a result of water limitations. The release of soluble phenolic compounds and DOC from the droughted plots was found to be lowered during the drought period and elevated outside of the drought period. It is hypothesized that these changes may be a result of the reduced ability of extracellular phenol oxidases to process recalcitrant polyphenolic material under drought conditions. A drying incubation carried out with litter and soil cores from the same site suggests that extracellular <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity displays an optimal moisture level.

Both larval growth index and pupal growth index declined with treatment. However the hot extract with 3 -butenyl isothiocyanate as the predominant compound had a more deleterious effect as at 3125 ppm the larvae were unable to complete their development. The nutritional indices too were more adversely affected with hot extract as compared to cold extract. The RGR, RCR, ECI and ECD declined significantly with increase in concentration of the hot hexane extract. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, SOD and catalase decreased while that of phosphatases, GSTs, <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidases</b> increased during the initial treatment duration but decreased on prolonged treatment of the larvae with LC 50 concentration of hot extract. A similar trend was observed for glutathione and lipid peroxides but a decrease in ascorbate content was observed as compared to control. The findings reveal a toxic effect of 3 -butenylisothiocyanate rich hot hexane extract of B. juncea on S. litura larvae...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fungal laccases are <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidases</b> widely {{studied for}} their use in several {{industrial}} applications, including pulp bleaching in paper industry, dye decolourisation, detoxification of environmental pollutants and revalorization of wastes and wastewaters. The main difficulty in using these enzymes at industrial scale ensues from their production costs. Elucidation of the components and the mechanisms involved in regulation of laccase gene expression is crucial for increasing the productivity of native laccases in fungi. Laccase gene transcription is regulated by metal ions, various aromatic compounds related to lignin or lignin derivatives, nitrogen and carbon sources. In this manuscript, most of the published results on fungal laccase induction, as well as analyses of both the sequences and putative functions of laccase gene promoters are reviewed. Analyses of promoter sequences allow defining a correlation between the observed regulatory effects on laccase gene transcription {{and the presence of}} specific responsive elements, and postulating, in some cases, a mechanism for their functioning. Only few reports have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying laccase regulation by different stimuli. The reported analyses suggest the existence of a complex picture of laccase regulation phenomena acting through a variety of cis acting elements. However, the general mechanisms for laccase transcriptional regulation are far from being unravelled yet...|$|R
40|$|Background:The {{temporal}} and spatial control of the transition from vegetative to parasitic growth is critical to any parasite, but {{is essential to the}} sessile parasitic plants. It has been proposed that this transition in Striga spp. is controlled simply by an exuded oxidase that converts host cell-surface phenols into benzoquinones which act as developmental signals that mediate the transition. An understanding of this mechanism may identify the critical molecular events that made possible the evolution of parasitism in plants. Results:PoxA and PoxB are identified as the only apoplastic <b>phenol</b> <b>oxidases</b> in Striga asiatica seedlings, and the genes encoding them have been cloned and sequenced. These peroxidase enzymes are capable of oxidizing the 60 known inducing phenols into a small set of benzoquinones, and it is these quinones that induce parasitic development. Analysis of the reaction requirements and comparisons to host enzymes, however, lead us to argue that PoxA and PoxB are not necessary for host recognition. Conclusions:A new model is proposed where constitutive production of an activated oxygen species (in the case of Striga, H 2 O 2) mediates host recognition. This strategy would allow a parasite to exploit abundant host enzymes to produce the diffusible recognition signals by converting a standard host defense into a parasitic offense...|$|R
