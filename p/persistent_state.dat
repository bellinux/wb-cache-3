40|$|In {{the present}} work we study {{a class of}} {{generalised}} inner states of the cipher RC 4, the so-called <b>persistent</b> <b>states.</b> The RC 4 stream cipher is {{the most widely used}} software-based stream cipher and the existence of such a state would be a significant weakness of the cipher. We describe the Tabular model and using the model we prove the periodicity of these states. Then we study a new type of relationship between the tabular model and the equivalences on linearly ordered sets and we prove the regularity of the matrix determined by such an equivalence. Afterwards we apply the obtained result to the theory of <b>persistent</b> <b>states</b> and we prove that there exists no reachable persistent k-state for k equal to 2, 3, 4 in the specific case. Moreover, we present some new unreachable <b>persistent</b> <b>states.</b> Finally, we indicate the cryptanalytical significance of the <b>persistent</b> <b>states.</b> Department of AlgebraKatedra algebryFaculty of Mathematics and PhysicsMatematicko-fyzikální fakult...|$|R

Three simulations are described illustrating that the behavior of <b>persistent</b> <b>states</b> in the models corresponds roughly to the behavior of conscious states people experience when performing similar tasks.

50|$|The {{transport}} layer transfers data between source and destination processes. Generally, two connection modes are recognized, connection-oriented or connectionless.
