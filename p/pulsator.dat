25|$|The roAp stars {{oscillate}} in high-overtone, low-degree, non-radial pressure modes. The usual {{model that}} is used to explain the behavior of these pulsations is the oblique <b>pulsator</b> model. In this model the axis of pulsation is aligned with the magnetic axis, which can lead to modulation of the amplitude of the pulsation, depending on the orientation of the axis to the line of sight, as it varies with rotation. The apparent link between the magnetic axis and the pulsation axis gives clues {{to the nature of the}} driving mechanism of the pulsations. As the roAp stars seem to occupy the main sequence end of the δ Scuti instability strip, it has been suggested that the driving mechanism may be similar, i.e. the opacity mechanism operating in the Hydrogen ionization zone. No standard pulsation model can be made to excite oscillations of the roAp type using the opacity mechanism. As the magnetic field appears to be important, research has taken this into account in deriving non-standard pulsation models. It has been suggested that the modes are driven by the suppression of convection by the strong magnetic field near the magnetic poles of these stars which would account for the alignment of the pulsation axis with the magnetic axis. An instability strip for the roAp stars has been calculated which agreed with the positions on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of the roAp stars discovered up to that point, but predicted the existence of longer period pulsators amongst the more evolved roAp stars. Such a <b>pulsator</b> was discovered in HD 177765 which has the longest pulsation period of any roAp star at 23.6 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|The first iron lung {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of polio victims was invented by Philip Drinker, Louis Agassiz Shaw, and James Wilson at Harvard, and tested October 12, 1928, at Children's Hospital, Boston. The original Drinker iron lung was powered by an electric motor attached to two vacuum cleaners, and worked by changing the pressure inside the machine. When the pressure is lowered, the chest cavity expands, trying to fill this partial vacuum. When the pressure is raised the chest cavity contracts. This expansion and contraction mimics the physiology of normal breathing. The design of the iron lung was subsequently improved by using a bellows attached directly to the machine, and John Haven Emerson modified the design to make production less expensive. The Emerson Iron Lung was produced until 1970.

40|$|Aims. We aim to {{determine}} the theoretical instability strips of white dwarfs with diverse H and He content in their atmospheres, from a solar composition to a H-depleted atmosphere. <b>Pulsators</b> with mixed H-He atmospheres are indeed known to exist, {{and these are the}} white dwarfs in cataclysmic accreting systems of the GW Lib type. We thus also aim {{to determine}} the range of periods of excited pulsation modes, and to qualitatively compare these to the observed periods in GW Lib white dwarf <b>pulsators.</b> Methods. In the first full nonadiabatic stability analysis of <b>pulsators</b> of this kind, we applied a time-dependent convection treatment and an energy leakage argument to compute, for cooling models of white dwarfs with various masses and envelope compositions, the location of the blue and the red edges, as well as the properties of pulsation modes. Results. We find that our derived instability strips form a true continuum in the log g-Teff plane and that their individual location depends uniquely on the assumed atmospheric composition, from the solar composition models at low effective temperatures to the H-depleted models at much higher temperatures. Taking into account our previous results from the ZZ Ceti (pure H atmosphere) and V 777 Her (pure He atmosphere) white dwarf <b>pulsators,</b> this implies that all of these instability domains are connected via the same fundamental driving mechanism. Applying our results to the case of white dwarf <b>pulsators</b> of the GW Lib type, we find that our theoretical instability strips can qualitatively account for all of the known cases. The computed range of periods of excited modes also compares qualitatively very well to the observed ones. Conclusions. The GW Lib <b>pulsators</b> are very similar in nature to ZZ Ceti and V 777 Her white dwarfs. It is the diverse chemical compositions in their atmosphere and envelope that defines their specific pulsation properties. Beyond GW Lib <b>pulsators,</b> white dwarfs can sometimes exhibit mixed H-He atmospheres, such as in the recently found proto-He white dwarf <b>pulsators.</b> Our results open the way towards quantitative asteroseismology of these various kinds of white dwarfs.
