40|$|In anesthetized rats, massive {{bleeding}} to a severe condition of hemorrhagic shock (invariably leading to death within 30 min) was obviously {{associated with a}} dramatic decrease in tissue blood flow and with profound modifications of several blood parameters leading to metabolic acidosis: decrease in arterial and venous pH, bicarbonate and BE, decrease in arterial pCO 2 and in venous pO 2 and SO 2, increase in arterial pO 2, venous pCO 2 and venous lactate. The i. v. bolus injection of <b>protirelin</b> <b>tartrate</b> (TRH-T, 4 mg/kg), which produces a prompt and sustained reversal of the shock condition, caused a rapid increase in venous pO 2, pCO 2 and SO 2; on the other hand, arterial and venous pH, bicarbonate and BE continued to decrease [...] and venous lactate to increase {{during the first few}} minutes after treatment. However venous pCO 2 and lactate, as well as arterial and venous pH, returned to the pre-bleeding values within 60 min after treatment. The data are in keeping with the TRH-T-induced improvement of circulatory and respiratory functions, with mobilization of the residual blood from its capillary pooling and consequent immission of acid metabolites into the blood stream...|$|E
40|$|An {{extremely}} severe hypovolemic shock {{was produced}} in urethane-anesthetized rats by massive bleeding. In such preterminal conditions (mean arterial pressure = 19 - 25 mmHg; pulse pressure = 10 - 18 mmHg; death of all saline-treated animals in 26. 16 +/- 3. 18 min) the i. v. injection of <b>protirelin</b> <b>tartrate</b> (TRH-T) within 5 min after shock induction promptly and dose-dependently improved arterial pressure, pulse pressure and respiration, the dose of 4 mg/kg ensuring survival for 402. 01 +/- 39. 45 min {{without the need for}} the restoration of blood volume. The injection of TRH-T 20 min after shock induction, on the other hand, was ineffective. The concurrent administration of morphine (2. 5 mg/kg i. v.) partially antagonized the effect of TRH-T; however, if the dose of the peptide was increased, its effect was restored. The effect of TRH-T in haemorrhagic shock was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} volume of residual circulating blood. The present data (i) confirm that TRH-T improves cardiovascular function and greatly prolongs survival in an otherwise irreversible model of haemorrhagic shock; (ii) show that this effect is associated with mobilization of residual blood and that respiratory function is greatly improved as well; (iii) indicate that the anti-shock effect of TRH-T is partially antagonized by morphine in a surmountable way. Finally, on the basis of our results, it appears that TRH-T has to be given rapidly after shock induction to be effective...|$|E
