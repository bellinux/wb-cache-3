The coursework and write-up were done at the University of Oslo.,The thesis assesses the contribution of dictionary-making in Ndebele on the standardisation of the language. The production of the monolingual Ndebele dictionary,Isichazamazwi SesiNdebele (ISN), raised a number of issues that have implications on the standardisation of Ndebele. There was the question of whether to keep Ndebele close to Zulu as the former has always depended on the latter for grammar books, dictionaries, and even creative literature. Actually, Ndebele in Zimbabwe is taught alongside Zulu conï¬ rming the belief held by many that Ndebele is a dialect of Zulu. Previously only Zulu was offered at secondary school in the place of Ndebele. Basing the ISN entirely on the Ndebele language corpus meant the exclusion of Zulu. The possibility of abandoning Zulu poses two problems: ï¬rst, Zulu is prestigious among the Ndebele and abandoning it might lead to the rejection of the ISN; and second, if Zulu is no longer setting the standard, then a new norm should be found. The corpus showed that Ndebele has regional varieties, contrary to often-held views, making the choice of a norm for a standard a difficult one. Language standardisation as part of language planning is usually sanctioned by government departments or similarly authorised language boards, but other agents of standardisation like lexicographers are equally important. That is why the thesis focuses {{on the role of the}} ISN on the standardisation of Ndebele. Although editors of the ISN claimed to be descriptive in their dictionary, no dictionary can be entirely descriptive. Editors had to make decisions on vocabulary selection, on senses, pronunciation,spelling and terminology, as well as which loanwords to include and how to spell them. In that way, the standardising role of the ISN on Ndebele is a by-product of the dictionary-making process rather than the purpose of making the dictionary. Areas of standardisation investigated include vocabulary, terminology and orthography in chapters 6, 7 and 8 respectively. On Ndebele vocabulary, loanwords pose some challenges. Partial language purism has been observed on loanwords in Ndebele. Words from Zulu and other Nguni languages are accepted in Ndebele while those from other African languages tend to be resisted. There is also resistance to loanwords from European languages like English and from Afrikaans although many words from these languages have become part of the Ndebele lexicon. The language situation in Zimbabwe where African languages are conï¬ned to the unoficial domain has led to an underdevelopment of terminology in almost all the ï¬elds. The focus has been on term development in linguistics, literature, law, and in the natural sciences. The various possible ways of term-development in Ndebele were discussed. The lack of updated rules on Ndebele orthography poses problems to writers and the same problems were faced in the compilation of the ISN. Word division of compounds poses serious problems and the editors of the ISN did not resolve the inconsistency. The spelling of loanwords is problematic too. The ISN lemmatised words with, a symbol representing a sound that some Ndebele speakers believe should not be part of the Ndebele phonology. I have shown in this research some loanwords that have come into the language and the challenges they posed in spelling and word division. The thesis covers and combines aspects of language planning, lexicography and corpus linguistics. Approaches from these seemingly distinct disciplines were harmonised and exploited in answering language standardisation problems in Ndebele. Sociolinguistics has no unifying theory, neither have language planning and lexicography. In this research, I did not attempt to conï¬ ne myself to any particular theory or approach, but I used relevant aspects from a number of theoretical approaches. The Ndebele language corpus is the main source of linguistic evidence in the form of concordances. Those aspects of the Ndebele language that have undergone or need to undergo standardisation as a result of the inï¬‚ uence of the ISN are shown in the thesis. Problem areas in Ndebele lexicography are highlighted, problems that lexicographers have to address in future works. Finally, I have shown that Zulu has not been dropped entirely as the norm for Ndebele, even if the ISN claims to be corpus-based. This illustrates the editorsâ€™ concern for sociolinguistic factors over purely linguistic factors in their decisions. Therefore, decisions made in the ISN as well as on Ndebele language standardisation were inï¬‚uenced more by sociolinguistic reality as perceived by editors than purely academic and linguistic factors.,The funding for the thesis was made available through the Norwegian Education Loan Fund, the Quota <b>Programme</b> <b>loan</b> and grant.

40|$|The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund {{have been}} active in Africa for several decades. In the early 1980 s both {{institutions}} expanded the role that they play in the restructuring of African economies through the introduction of structural adjustment <b>loans.</b> These <b>programme</b> <b>loans</b> sought to {{provide the basis for}} sustainable economic expansion following a period of near economic collapse in the region. In the case of the Fund, public expenditure reducing and expenditure switching policies were encouraged. The Bank, also, was active in these areas and focused on long-term measures to restore efficiency to the ailing economies. These policies, although not novel, were implemented on a large scale were perceived to have a pervasive influence on the economic and social performance of African countries. It was theorised by some that such programme lending would have a long-run beneficial impact on social development. However, other authors, observers and researchers have criticised the activities of the Bretton Woods institutions. First, the loans have been heavily criticised in the past for the supposedly heavy handed nature that Bank and Fund staff use in implementing their programmes. The main idea is that the institutions have too much leverage when bargaining with African governments to undertake reforms. Second, {{it has been said that}} the use of <b>programme</b> <b>loans</b> will have adverse consequences for national welfare. UNICEF, the main critic, has pointed out, and provided evidence, to indicate that vulnerable groups in society may suffer under adjustment schemes. This thesis looks at the areas of macroeconomic reforms and the impact that they may have on one part of the social area: the health sector. The thesis examines the pre-adjustment situation in Sub Saharan Africa and reviews the role and the tools that the Bank and the Fund have at their disposal to tackle economic problems. The thesis then moves on to explore the linkages between these policy weapons and changes in health care development. In order to fully understand the implications for Africa considerable attention is devoted to exploring the health problems that the region faces and the health care delivery systems and health conditions that are prevalent in many of the countries. The last part of the thesis provides an aggregate study and a case study analysis of the impact of adjustment in Africa. Although, it is determined that the impact, overall, has not been unfavourable, recommendations for the future design of adjustment programmes is offered in the conclusion...|$|R
50|$|In February 2003 the Government of Trinidad and Tobago took a {{decision}} to establish the CARICOM Trade Support (CTS) Programme. Partly crafted by Mr. Kenneth Valley, Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Trade, the CTS <b>Programme</b> provides <b>loans</b> to finance business development projects {{in order to help}} CARICOM States improve their trade capacity, enhance the performance of their individual economies and to strengthen the competitiveness among private sector firms. Loans are provided on an interest-free basis and must be used for the purposes of procuring technical assistance services which are to be delivered by consultants. The Programme was launched on October 29, 2004 with a revolving fund loan in the amount of TT$100 million to be disbursed on an interest free basis to firms in CARICOM, except those located in Trinidad and Tobago. The TT$100 million (US$16 million or J$1 billion (at the 2004 exchange rate)) loan facility is just one component of the programme however. Other components of the trade support programme include the facilitation of investment by firms from Trinidad and Tobago in CARICOM member-states through joint ventures and strategic alliances; as well as the provision of technical inputs from national and regional private sector umbrella bodies. Administered by Trinidad and Tobago's Ministry of Trade and Industry the programme has already approved loans for private sector firm in St. Kitts & Nevis, Antigua & Barbuda, Grenada, and more recently in Suriname (the Sunspot company) and Jamaica (for the Pulse Investment Company Ltd.). The latter two companies received loans totalling US$180,000 for the purposes of restructuring to ensure enhanced profitability and to develop an export marketing <b>programme.</b> <b>Loans,</b> in amounts ranging from US$6,000 to US$100,000, approved under the CTS programme will be disbursed by the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (RBTT) and the bank will also be responsible for administering loan repayments and the securitization of loan funds.|$|R
