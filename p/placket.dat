25|$|The <b>placket</b> of {{the shirt}} {{is the part}} that holds the buttons and the button holes. This is highly {{regarded}} as {{the focal point of}} the dress shirt when worn casually. Unfortunately due to the lack of reinforcement, the weight of the collar will cripple the <b>placket</b> throughout the day. No amount of starch, ironing, pressing nor does the type of fabric matter when it comes to combating the collapse.|$|E

25|$|Wegner's next {{idea was}} to produce a sports shirt, {{which was to be}} made from white knitted cotton pique with short sleeves and a buttoned <b>placket</b> like Ren√© Lacoste's shirts. Launched at Wimbledon in 1952, the Fred Perry tennis shirt was an {{immediate}} success.|$|E
25|$|A {{high quality}} {{traditional}} shirt has long tails, extending {{almost to the}} knees at the back, and so has seven or eight buttons. The vertical strip of fabric running down the front opening is called the <b>placket,</b> and gives a more symmetrical appearance to the joint between the left side, on top, and the right. This left over right order is also seen in waistcoat and coat fastenings, though women's clothing buttons the other way (right over left). The buttonholes, aligned vertically, are placed on the <b>placket,</b> though the top button and buttons {{at the bottom of}} stiff fronts are aligned horizontally. The buttonholes {{are one of the few}} places where the difference between hand and machine stitching can be observed while the shirt is being worn, and fashion designers sometimes use contrasting thread here or on the buttons themselves for extra impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of each}} pocket {{is usually}} adorned with a {{matching}} shirt button, as are the bottoms of the alforza pleats. Vertical rows of adjusting buttons are often seen, one on each side, at the bottom hem. While most versions of the design have no <b>placket</b> covering the buttons, a few newer designs do.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} density {{functional}} theory {{study on the}} shape and arrangement of small BN domains embedded into single-walled carbon nanotubes. We show a strong tendency for BN hexagon formation at the simultaneous inclusion of B and N atoms {{within the walls of}} carbon nanotubes. The work emphasizes the importance of a correct description of the BN-C frontier. We suggest that a BN-C interface will be formed preferentially with the participation of N-C bonds. Thus, we propose a new way of stabilizing the small BN inclusions through the formation of nitrogen-terminated borders. The comparison between the obtained results and the available experimental data on the formation of BN <b>plackets</b> within the single-walled carbon nanotubes is presented. The mirror situation of inclusion of carbon <b>plackets</b> within single-walled BN nanotubes is considered within the proposed formalism. Finally, we show that the inclusion of small BN <b>plackets</b> inside the CNTs strongly affects the electronic character of the initial systems, opening a band gap. The nitrogen excess in the BN <b>plackets</b> introduces donor states in the band gap, and it might, thus, result in a promising way for n-doping single-walled carbon nanotubes. 1...|$|R
50|$|Some styles button or {{are tied}} at the {{shoulder}} seam and have <b>plackets</b> rather than slits. The opening may be centered on the chest, or positioned off center.|$|R
50|$|In the 15th and 16th centuries, men {{and women}} both wore {{decorative}} stomachers (often called placards or <b>plackets)</b> with open-fronted doublets and gowns. The form and style of these stomachers {{in combination with the}} headgear is often used to date paintings to a certain time period.|$|R
2500|$|The sideless surcoat of the 14th century became fossilized as a {{ceremonial}} costume for royalty, usually with an ermine front panel (called a plackard or <b>placket)</b> and a mantle draped from the shoulders; {{it can be}} seen in variety of royal portraits and as [...] "shorthand" [...] to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period.|$|E
2500|$|The {{more formal}} {{marcella}} {{version of the}} shirt fastens with matching shirt studs. These are most commonly in silver or gold settings, featuring onyx or mother-of-pearl; various geometrical shapes are worn, e.g., circles (most common for studs), octagons, or rectangles (most common for cufflinks). [...] There has been no consistent fashion preference for gold or silver, but studs with mother-of-pearl are more formal and therefore often associated with white tie. The soft-front pleated version of the shirt should be fastened with mother-of-pearl buttons, typically supplied with the shirt on a separate strip of fabric. Alternatively, a fly-front shirt, appropriate with both the marcella and pleated bibs, conceals the <b>placket</b> for a more minimalistic look.|$|E
2500|$|Black tie {{offers more}} leeway. Shirts may be soft (not starched), {{which gives the}} options of unstarched {{marcella}} or a pleated front, {{as well as the}} white tie shirts, which may also be worn with black tie. [...] The collar is still sometimes a stiff high wing collar (common in America, though the attached variety is more popular there), or a turndown collar (more frequently seen in Britain). In past decades, particularly the 1970s, ruffled shirt fronts were made fashionable by Will Hunter, although they are now out of favour. Dress-studs are optional, and are onyx set in either silver or gold if used; otherwise the buttons are normally concealed under a <b>placket.</b> Cufflinks tend to be as simple and understated as possible, and harmonise with, if not match, the studs.|$|E
5000|$|Front closures: Some {{garments}} {{are made}} with front closures, similar to fly openings on men's trousers and button <b>plackets</b> on men's shirts, but may retain a feminine cut. Other garments (such as uniform dresses for service workers like waitresses and cleaners, for example) may feature a front zipper, but concealed in a seam or flap of fabric.|$|R
50|$|A center {{back seam}} or back seam runs {{vertically}} down the center-back of a garment. It {{can be used}} to create anatomical shaping to the back portion of a garment particularly through the waist area and hips. It can also be used for styling and functional purposes involving pleats, vents, flare toward the hem or for back closures such as buttoned <b>plackets</b> or zippers.|$|R
50|$|The name zipper {{was created}} in 1923 by B.F. Goodrich, who used the device on their new boots. Initially, boots and tobacco pouches were the primary use for zippers; it took another twenty years before they caught on in the fashion industry. About the time of World War II the zipper {{achieved}} wide acceptance for the flies of trousers and the <b>plackets</b> of skirts and dresses.|$|R
2500|$|A shirt {{has several}} {{components:}} A one-piece back, {{which is usually}} pleated, gathered, or eased into a section of fabric in {{the upper part of}} the back behind the neck and over the shoulders known as the yoke (either one-piece or seamed vertically in the middle); one-piece sleeves with plackets at the wrist, or else short-sleeved (cut off above the elbow), though this is not traditional; a band of fabric around each wrist known as a cuff; the collar, a strip around the neck, which is normally a turndown collar, with the strip folded down away from the neck, leaving two points at the front, the width of which is known as the spread; [...] and finally two front panels which overlap slightly down the middle on the <b>placket</b> to fasten with buttons (or rarely shirt studs).|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "unique" [...] {{care for}} {{precision}} and symmetry expresses French classicism and is, according to Marie-Claude Siccard, a {{paradigm of the}} care for quality in luxury products. In particular, {{a lot of attention}} is given to the regularity of stitches and the matching of patterns. On a typical striped ready-to-wear shirt and unlike most other makes, the <b>placket</b> is matched with the front, the face of the collar with the bottom, the collar stripes line up with the yoke stripes, the yoke stripes with the sleeve stripes, the sleeve stripes with the sleeve <b>placket</b> stripes, and finally the shade of yarn used for the buttonholes is matched to the stripe, the whole process creating the feeling the shirt is all one piece. [...] The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made one-quarter inch longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam gusset. The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance. [...] Instead, a free floating stiffener aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned. The shirts are stitched with twin rows of single-needle tailoring, sewn one row at a time for minimum puckering and maximum fit. There are twenty stitches per inch. Buttons are made from Australian mother-of-pearl, cut {{from the surface of the}} oyster shell for added strength and greater color clarity. For formal shirts, bibs are hand pleated. Though its traditional ready-to-wear shirts are trim, the company has also introduced in 2009 a [...] "slim fit" [...] line.|$|E
2500|$|The cream {{alternate}} uniforms {{were introduced}} in February 2012 {{as a tribute to}} the Braves' first season in Atlanta in 1966. The jersey includes the [...] "Braves" [...] script across the breastplate, but the player number replaces the tomahawk underneath the [...] "Braves" [...] script on the left <b>placket.</b> Player numbers and the [...] "Braves" [...] script are in red with a navy blue border. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a cream nameplate. The jersey has a thin, navy piping about the collar and down the front of the jersey. There is no piping around the sleeves. The cream pants include piping identical to the jersey down the outside seam. The left sleeve of the jersey has a [...] "crossed tomahawk" [...] logo that replaces the [...] "screaming Indian" [...] logo that appeared on the 1966 jerseys. The new logo has two, primarily red, crossed tomahawks. Underneath the tomahawks is a blue circle outlined in red, with [...] "1876" [...] in red above (commemorating the year the franchise was founded), and [...] "Atlanta Braves" [...] in white below. The cream uniforms are paired with the standard home cap and are worn for Saturday and Sunday home games.|$|E

50|$|Commonly, {{adaptive}} {{clothes that}} are made with this accommodation are one-piece jumpsuits that feature back zippers. In many cases, they are made with zippers that have one or more unusual features {{in order to make}} them unlike regular clothes, and therefore harder to remove. Often, they are designed to appear in front with classic designs, such as faux buttons and <b>plackets,</b> collars, or T-shirt-like prints, while the backs have closures that must be open to remove the garment.|$|R

50|$|Coloured {{clothing}} {{had been}} around cricket since the late 1970s with the inception of Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket however in club cricket circles and {{at the local level}} many organisations dared not steer away from the traditional whites that have been seen gracing cricket grounds for almost two centuries. In the 1998-99 season the Port Stephens cricket club did just that and boldly went where no other club had dared, into the coloured clothing realm. Adopting a Sky Blue shirt adorned with Navy <b>plackets</b> on the sleeves the Shire side initiated an image that would resonate nearly two decades on. With this new image the club needed a new identity and the Port Stephens Pythons were born.|$|R
