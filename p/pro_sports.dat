25|$|That the Drillers {{inflated}} their announced attendance {{came as no}} surprise, as it is {{a common}} practice in <b>pro</b> <b>sports,</b> but part way through the season {{the degree to which the}} Drillers did became public and the numbers did not paint a rosy picture. It was exposed that while the club was announcing attendance in the 5,800 range, when the actual was only ~4,200. Coupled with even the announced figures falling far short of the previously stated 8,000 break even point, there were questions abound about how long Wojcicki could continue bankrolling the team.|$|E

25|$|Rocky RoadRunner is the mascot of the RoadRunners. Rocky, who {{has been}} with the team for decades, is a {{mainstay}} from the early years in the desert. His service dates back all the way to 1967. The ECHL team brought a major change of the entire costume, most notably the skin, which turned a bright yellow compared to a shade of brown in previous years. Furthermore, rather than continuing the more lifelike version of previous years, the ECHL's version chose to make a more cartoonish version of Rocky. The 2007–08 ECHL Season coincided with Rocky's 40th year of service, which was by far the oldest mascot in the history of any <b>pro</b> <b>sports</b> team in Arizona.|$|E
25|$|The 1994 World Cup {{revolutionized}} {{television coverage}} of {{sports in the}} United States through the sponsored scoreboard and game clock that were constantly shown on screen throughout the game. Television sports coverage in the US had long been dependent upon commercial breaks, a feature suitable for sports such as baseball, basketball, ice hockey and American football (which all have breaks in the action), but long considered incompatible with soccer, due to the long stretches of uninterrupted play. Variations on it were quickly incorporated into virtually every team sports broadcast by the decade's end. The first American <b>pro</b> <b>sports</b> broadcaster to do this was Fox Sports which won national rights to broadcast the NFL's National Football Conference from CBS 6½ months before the 1994 World Cup began.|$|E

The league never came to fruition, but Conacher organized what became the first professional football team in Canada. He captained the team, based out of Toronto, which was known as the Crosse and Blackwell Chefs following a sponsorship with a local food products company.

The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0–10. The team's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 of 2007 stood as their last until Week 3 of the 2009 season. From the time the Lions recorded a win over the Denver Broncos in 2007 to reach 6–2, the team went 5–47 over their following 52 games (including all of 2008 and 2009) before winning four games in a row {{at the end of the}} 2010 season.|$|E

500|$|From {{an early}} age Hutson was {{interested}} in business. [...] "At the university , I was the only athlete in the business school," [...] he said. [...] "The only reason I wanted to play <b>pro</b> <b>sports</b> was to get a stake." [...] While both were students at Alabama, he partnered with Bear Bryant to operate a laundromat in Tuscaloosa called Captain Kidd Cleaners. However, neither were educated in laundering, and they sold the business after two years. While in Green Bay, Hutson opened the Packer Playdium bowling alley, which proved so successful that he twice considered retirement from football to fully dedicate his time to its operation. He then started the Hutson Motor Car Co. dealership and in 1951 purchased Chevrolet and Cadillac agencies in Racine, Wisconsin. [...] "I never aimed for automobiles," [...] said Hutson.

An introductory commercial was quickly filmed, which featured the manifesto as narration, scenes of local basketball players in various outdoor locations around the city, and ended with a scene displaying a black, waving flag with the motto written on it.

However, the city of Houston filed a counterclaim to force the Rockets to stay at the Summit, saying that if the Rockets did not honor their contract, then they might [...] "have no incentive to honor any new agreement with the city of Houston to play in a new downtown sports arena". The validity of the lease was eventually upheld, and in April 1997, Lanier announced that the Rockets and Watson would have to agree to share control of the new arena equally, or lose access to it altogether. After both parties agreed to the terms, a bill that authorized increased taxes to pay for a new arena was signed into law in July, by then-Governor George W. Bush.|$|E
