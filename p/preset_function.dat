The {{virtually}} multiple mouse wheels {{is a new}} input device; however, as it has not {{yet been}} supported by application software, the left scroll and right scroll can only operate a few software functions. In this study, computer software is combined with a virtually multiple mouse wheel to intercept left and right scroll signals in the background, which are converted into the start signal of software and sent to the application software in order that software functions can be operated.

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{is devoted}} to the study of a process algebra {{oriented}} towards processes in Place/Transition Nets (PTN in short). The processes are described by special kind of terms, termed here as PN terms. Since the time we have been dealing with Petri Nets some of the myths have survive. One of the myth is that Petri Nets are not very well suited for to be treated in de/compositional way [4]. Another myth is connected with an absence of non interleaved semantics of Petri Nets. Our treatment of Petri Nets in this work is aimed at disproving the myths. In the paper we introduce syntax and semantics of PN terms; we define the semantics by PT nets, and based on that two equivalence relations are defined on PN terms. The latter make a provision to validate some algebraic laws to hold on PN terms. Finally the algebra APT is defined. Keywords: Place/Transition Nets, PN terms, E-(B-) terms, Process Algebra, E-open terms, B-open terms. 1 Place/Transition Nets 1 By Place/Transition Net(PTN in short) we mean in this work a kind of Petri Net with multiple arcs, tokens without individualities and with unbounded capacities of places.

Second, though its assumptions are weaker than parametric models, model estimates still have good statistical properties, and the efficiency of statistical tests does not suffer greatly.

40|$|Possibilities to {{influence}} the deep drawing process during its duration are limited and generally consist of influences at the flange of the thin sheet, mainly by the contact pressure (the blank holding force). The common characteristics of previous investigations were setting of the fixed values of the blank holding force or the holder's pressure within the ironing tool. The objective {{of this investigation was}} the continuous setting of the variable pressure during the sliding process, via the <b>preset</b> <b>functions,</b> in order to analyze the variable pressure influence on the ironing process. This is why an experimental computerized device was designed and constructed for analyzing the influence of the variable contact pressure on the sliding process of the model strip during the flat-die test. The multi-parameter experiment was conducted; various materials of the tested pieces were applied (primarily thin sheet made of Al alloys and low-carbon steels sheet, with and without coating); different versions of the tool's contact elements were used, with various friction regimes and influential parameters (variable contact pressure during the sliding process, etc.). This experimental device practically represents a simulator for realization and studying of the physical model of an important segment of the ironing process in the completely realistic conditions (materials, tools, etc.). The aim was to find the optimal combination of the variable contact pressure and the tribological parameters, so that the punch force, as one of the process output parameters, would have the minimal value, as well as to avoid the undesired effects during the forming (difficult sliding of the flange, appearance of thin sheet's wrinkling, structural destruction, etc.). Understanding the mutual dependence of the holder's variable pressure and other influences should enable improvement of the ironing process control and should contribute to better understanding of the phenomena occurring at the thin sheet's flange...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this investigation, the {{performance}} of the simplified Flexibility-Based Fiber Model (FBFM), proposed in Part I of this study, is evaluated. The proposed model relies on calculating the inelastic lengths at the ends of the Reinforced Concrete (RC) beam-column member in every load increment and using <b>preset</b> flexibility distribution <b>functions</b> along the inelastic lengths to integrate the overall element response. The model eliminates the need for monitoring the responses of many segments distributed along the member length which results in a significant reduction in computations. The model performance is evaluated in this study on a one element level of a beam-column element and on a structure level of a 3 -story frame. The selected structures are subjected to static pushover, static cyclic and earthquake loading conditions. The results of the proposed model are compared with the outcomes of the conventional FBFMs. The comparison is achieved using global performance parameters such as the maximum drift ratios and local performance parameters such as the maximum strains in steel and concrete at the plastic hinge regions. The analysis conducted indicates that the proposed model is capable of describing with satisfactory accuracy and computational efficiency the response of RC frame structures...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with finite identifiability of languages from positive data. We focus on the characterization of finite identifiability [Mukouchi (1992), Lange and Zeugmann (1992) ], which uses definite finite tell-tale sets (DFTTs for short), finite subsets of languages which are uniquely characteristic for them. We introduce <b>preset</b> learners, learning <b>functions</b> that explicitly use (collections of) DFTTs, and, in cases where there exist only finitely many DFTTs for each language, strict preset learners which in each case use this whole finite collection. We also introduce the concept of fastest learner, a learner which comes up with the right conjecture on any input string that objectively leaves only the right choice of language. We study the use of minimal DFTTs and their influence on the speed of finite identification. We show that: (a) {{in the case of}} finite collections of finite sets—finding a minimal DFTT is polynomial time computable, while finding a minimal-size DFTT is NP-complete; (b) in the general case—finite identifiability, minimal strict preset finite identifiability and fastest finite identifiability are shown to be mutually nonequivalent. In the end we mention the relevance of this work for dynamic epistemic logic...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, a {{reliable}} and computationally efficient beam-column model is proposed for seismic analysis of Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames. The model is a simplified version of the Flexibility-Based Fiber Models (FBFMs), which rely on dividing the element length into small segments and dividing the cross section of each segment into concrete and steel fibers. In the proposed model, only the two end sections are subdivided into fibers and uniaxial material models that consider the various behavioral characteristics of steel and concrete under cyclic loading conditions are assigned for the cross section fibers. The proposed model is simpler than the FBFMs as {{it does not require}} monitoring the responses of many segments along the element length, which results in a significant reduction in computations. The inelastic lengths at the ends of the proposed model are divided into two inelastic zones; cracking and yielding. The inelastic lengths vary according to the loading history and are calculated in every load increment. The overall response of the RC member is estimated using <b>preset</b> flexibility distribution <b>functions</b> along the element length. A flexibility factor η is utilized to facilitate selecting the proper flexibility distribution shape. The proposed model is implemented into the computer program DRAIN- 2 DX...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between the cake and depth filtration of poly-disperse spherical particles is examined by comparing experimentally measured cake permeability to the permeability predictions of analytical models. In the experiments, {{the influence of the}} cake forming history on the cake permeability is investigated, where the parameters as (i) different filtration materials, (ii) test suspension flow rates, and (iii) particle concentrations in the suspension are varied. The permeability models are given as product of <b>preset</b> constant, porosity <b>function</b> and square of characteristic particle size. For the poly-disperse porous media, the characteristic particle size has to account for the distribution of particle sizes which is typically accomplished through the use of various moments of the distribution. Clearly, the size distribution function of particles forming the cake has to be utilized which is obtained after correcting the original distribution function of particles used in the test suspension for the particles which pass through the cake. This implies that the particles have to be counted after the test suspension passes the filtering material. Following this framework, a set of experiments is carried out to determine the permeability of poly disperse cake. For each experiment, the permeability is also evaluated analytically using four different long-established models in combination with different averages for the particle diameter of the poly disperse particle sample, trying to identify an averaging rule for which the analytical predictions are most close to the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{suitability}} of a mathematical-model Y = f({Xi}) in serving a purpose whatsoever (should be <b>preset</b> by the <b>function</b> f specific input-to-output variation-rates, i. e.) can be judged beforehand. We thus evaluate here the two apparently similar models: YA = fA(SRi,WRi) = (SRi/WRi) and: YD = fd(SRi,WRi) = ([SRi,WRi] - 1) = (YA - 1), with SRi and WRi representing certain measurable-variables (e. g. the sample S and the working-lab-reference W specific ith-isotopic-abundance-ratios, respectively, for a case as the isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)). The {{idea is to}} ascertain whether fD should represent a better model than fA, specifically, for the well-known IRMS evaluation. The study clarifies that fA and fD should really represent different model-families. For example, the possible variation, eA, of an absolute estimate as the yA (and/ or the risk of running a machine {{on the basis of}} the measurement-model fA) should be dictated by the possible Ri-measurement-variations (u_S and u_W) only: eA = (u_S + u_W); i. e., at worst: eA = 2 ui. However, the variation, eD, of the corresponding differential (i. e. YD) estimate yd should largely be decided by SRi and WRi values: ed = 2 (|m_i |x u_i) = (|m_i | x eA); with: mi = (SRi/[SRi - WRi]). Thus, any IRMS measurement (i. e. for which |SRi - WRi| is nearly zero is a requirement) should signify that |mi| tends to infinity. Clearly, yD should be less accurate than yA, and/ or even turn out to be highly erroneous (eD tends to infinity). Nevertheless, the evaluation as the absolute yA, and hence as the sample isotopic ratio Sri, is shown to be equivalent to our previously reported finding that the conversion of a D-estimate (here, yD) into Sri should help to improve the achievable output-accuracy and -comparability.
