5000|$|The first attested use of {{the term}} [...] "safety razor" [...] is in a patent {{application}} for [...] "new and useful improvements in Safety-Razors", filed in May 1880 by Fredrik and Otto Kampfe of Brooklyn, New York, and issued the following month. This differed from the Henson design in distancing the blade from the handle by interposing, [...] "a hollow metallic blade-holder having a preferably removable handle and a flat plate in front, to which the blade is attached by clips and a <b>pivoted</b> <b>catch,</b> said plate having bars or teeth at its lower edge, and the lower plate having an opening, for the purpose set forth", which is, to [...] "insure a smooth bearing for the plate upon the skin, while the teeth or bars will yield sufficiently to allow the razor to sever the hair without danger of cutting the skin." [...] The Kampfe Brothers produced razors under their own name following the 1880 patent and improved the design in a series of subsequent patents. These models were manufactured under the [...] "Star Safety Razor" [...] brand.|$|E

The wrestler then <b>pivots</b> 180° and <b>catches</b> the opponent in a ¾ facelock with their free arm before falling {{down into the}} cutter. This move {{is commonly known as}} the Twist of Fate, and is associated with Jeff and Matt Hardy, as well as the latter's former real-life girlfriend, Lita.|$|R

ClarkThis report {{presents}} the methods {{to determine the}} minimum number of collectors to accurately measure the coefficient of uniformity and the average depth of applied water from fixed plate and moving plate center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems. This research conducted an uniformity analysis and an average depth analysis. In the uniformity analysis, catch can collected data from center pivot system tests were divided into base sets of 60 data points. Each base set was further divided into subsets of 30 data points each. T-tests were {{used to compare the}} CU values from the base data sets with CU values from each of the subsets. In the average depth analysis, center <b>pivot</b> system <b>catch</b> can data were divided into base sets with 20 data points. Each base data set was divided into 19 subsets. The 1 st subset was generated by removing an exterior data point from the base set which was identified by number 1. The 2 nd subset was generated by removing other exterior data point (identified by number 20) from the previously generated subset (1 st subset). In this manner, a total of 19 subsets for each base set were generated by removing an exterior point from each previous subset. The percent difference (change) in average depth of each subset from the value of the average depth of the base set was calculated. The percent difference in average depth was then plotted against the associated number of collectors. Both analyses documented that a {{decrease in the number of}} collectors from the original density of collectors is acceptable to determine the uniformity and averaged depth of applied water from center pivot spans. Results from the uniformity analysis demonstrated that 20 collectors were as effective as 60 collectors to quantify the uniformity of a system. The depth analysis showed that 9 to 12 collectors may be needed to measure the average depth of a system (or a portion of a system) to within 5 % to 7. 5 % of the true value...|$|R
