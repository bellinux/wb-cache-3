Field Marshal Terauchi gave Sukarno the freedom to proceed with preparation for Indonesian independence, free of Japanese interference. After much wining and dining, Sukarno's entourage was flown back to Jakarta on 14 August.

25|$|On the Tibetan leader's journey {{home from}} his year in China, Khampa and Amdowa clan leaders {{informed}} {{his chief of staff}} of their plans to rebel against the Chinese in retribution for land confiscation and attacks on monasteries. But all was relatively quiet in Lhasa and in April 1956 he received a Chinese delegation to inaugurate the <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Committee</b> for the Autonomous Region of Tibet: a 51-man committee composed mostly of Tibetans. Meanwhile, open rebellion began with the massacre of a Communist garrison in Kham which left an estimated 800 Chinese dead, sparking air strikes that killed more Tibetans. In addition, the CIA met with the Dalai Lama's two brothers Thubten Jigme Norbu and Gyalo Thondup in India and offered to train a pilot group of six Khampas in guerrilla warfare and radio communications in Saipan. They were smuggled out of Tibet and would later be parachuted back in to train others and to report back to the CIA on the insurgency's progress and needs.|$|E

25|$|The beatification process {{opened in}} several places in several {{independent}} processes. The informative process opened in Liège on 16 April 1913 and concluded in December 1918 after World War I since the conflict posed a slight disruption to the cause. Another process - one of two supplementary processes - opened on 14 July 1928 in Rome and closed on 5 March 1930 while the second of these spanned from 25 March 1934 to 15 June 1935 also in Rome. Theologians also assumed charge of all of her spiritual writings and approved them on 22 July 1925 while issuing further approval on two more occasions on 26 March 1930 and 1 February 1939 after a greater evaluation of them. The formal introduction to the cause came on 2 July 1941 under Pope Pius XII and she was titled henceforth as a Servant of God. An apostolic process was opened in Rome on 20 March 1942 and closed on 15 July 1943 while another was held in Liège from 24 July 1942 until 8 October 1943. An apostolic rogatory process was opened in Toulouse on 18 June 1942 and closed on 14 April 1943 while a second one opened in Madrid on 5 July 1942 and closed on 25 February 1943.

Those who were affected fled from the rural areas to Dutch-controlled cities, a move many Indonesians saw as proof of pro-Dutch sentiments. There was evidence, however, that Chinese Indonesians were represented and participated in independence efforts.

500|$|The Regional Flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region {{features}} a stylized, white, five-petal Bauhinia blakeana flower {{in the center}} of a red field. On each petal is a red star; the stars demonstrate that Hong Kong residents love their motherland while the overall flag design signifies the link re-established between post-colonial Hong Kong and China while demonstrating the [...] "One country, two systems" [...] political principle applied to the region. The flag of Hong Kong was adopted on 16 February 1990. On 10 August 1996, it received formal approval from the <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Committee,</b> a group which advised the People's Republic of China (PRC) on Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997.

The lotus was chosen as the floral emblem of Macau. The Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge is a bridge linking the Macau Peninsula and the island of Taipa. The bridge is one of the most {{recognizable}} landmarks of the territory. The water beneath the lotus and the bridge symbolize Macau's position as a port and its role played in the territory. The five five-pointed stars echo the design of the national flag, symbolizing the relationship Macau has with its mother country. The design was chosen on 15 January 1993 by a committee that was drafting the Basic Law for the Macau SAR and was formally adopted by the Macau SAR <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Committee</b> on 16 January 1999.

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Tsering Shakya, some Tibetan {{government officials}} feared that plans were being laid for a Chinese abduction of the Dalai Lama, and spread word {{to that effect}} amongst the inhabitants of Lhasa. On 10 March, several thousand Tibetans surrounded the Dalai Lama's palace {{to prevent him from}} leaving or being removed. The huge crowd had gathered in response to a rumor that the Chinese communists were planning to arrest the Dalai Lama when he went to a cultural performance at the PLA's headquarters. This {{marked the beginning of the}} uprising in Lhasa, though Chinese forces had skirmished with guerrillas outside the city in December of the previous year. Although CCP officials insisted that the “reactionary upper stratum” in Lhasa was responsible for the rumor, there is no way to identify the precise source. At first, the violence was directed at Tibetan officials perceived not to have protected the Dalai Lama or to be pro-Chinese; attacks on Hans started later. One of the first casualties of mob was a senior lama, [...] Pagbalha Soinam Gyamco, who worked with the PRC as a member of the <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, who was killed and his body dragged by a horse in front of the crowd for two kilometres.|$|E

In this capacity, the 10th Panchen Lama visited several Chinese regions where [...] "he saw nothing but misery and desolation." [...] In 1962, he met with Westerners in Lhasa, the capital of the current Tibet Autonomous Region. [...] He affirmed to them his desire to [...] "fulfill his revolutionary duty towards the people" [...] and to [...] "live the life of a good Buddhist." [...] The Panchen Lama returned to Beijing on Mao's orders. During the voyage, throngs of Tibetans begged him to [...] "end all the deprivation and hardships we've suffered." [...] In Beijing, he asked the Great Helmsman directly to [...] "put an end to the abuses committed against the Tibetan people, to increase their food rations, to provide adequate care for the aged and the infirm, and to respect religious liberty."

[...] In the 1980s, {{with the support of}} the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Soka Gakkai created the exhibition [...] "Nuclear Arms: Threat to Our World," [...] which attempted to raise public awareness of the grave consequences of nuclear weapons and toured different parts of the world. In 2007, [...] the Soka Gakkai International launched a grassroots antinuclear campaign called [...] "People’s Decade for Nuclear Abolition" [...] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the antinuclear declaration made by Toda. The exhibition [...] "From a Culture of Violence to a Culture of Peace: Toward a World Free From Nuclear Weapons" [...] was created as its initial project.

Chong Yiu Shing applied for permanent residency on his behalf. At the time of Chong's birth, another major right of abode case had already been set in motion, and would eventually reach the CFA as Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration. Following the unfavourable ruling for the Director of Immigration in that case, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong (then Tung Chee Hwa) sought and on 26 June 1999 obtained an interpretation of Articles 22(4) and 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law from the NPCSC.

This article discusses the relevance to this case of the 1999 Interpretation and the <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Committee's</b> Opinion which it referred to.

Such legislative intent is consistent with, and converges with, the common understanding of the Chinese and British Governments of the intent behind the relevant provisions in the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 that correspond to Art 24 (2).
