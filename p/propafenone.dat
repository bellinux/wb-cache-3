40|$|The class Ic {{anti-arrhythmic}} agent, flecainide {{is known}} to inhibit the transient outward K current (Ito) selectively in human atrium. We studied the effects of <b>propafenone,</b> another class Ic anti-arrhythmic agent, on K currents in human atrial myocytes using a whole-cell voltage-clamp method. <b>Propafenone</b> inhibited both Ito and the sustained or ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K current (Isus or Ikur) evoked by depolarization pulses. The concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC 50) was 4. 9 [*]μM for Ito and 8. 6 [*]μM for Isus. <b>Propafenone</b> blocked Ito and Isus in a voltage- and use-independent fashion and accelerated the inactivation time constant of Ito [from 28. 3 to 6. 7 [*]ms at 10 [*]μM propafenone]. The steady-state inactivation curve for Ito was unaffected by <b>propafenone.</b> <b>Propafenone</b> {{did not affect the}} initial current at depolarizing potentials, but it did produce a block that increased as a function of time after depolarization (time constant of 3. 4 [*]ms). This suggests that <b>propafenone</b> preferentially blocked Ito in the open state. <b>Propafenone</b> had no significant effect on the rate at which Ito recovered from inactivation at − 80 [*]mV suggesting that <b>propafenone</b> dissociates rapidly from the channel.

40|$|The {{atrioventricular}} node (AVN) {{is an important}} part of the conduction system in the heart and is a significant site of antiarrhythmic drug action. The class 1 antiarrhythmic <b>propafenone</b> is effective in treating a variety of arrhythmias, including those involving the AVN. In this study, we have investigated the effects of <b>propafenone</b> on ionic currents in single rabbit AVN cells, focusing in particular on those on L-type calcium current (ICa,L). With a standard K-based internal dialysis solution, exposure to 5 [*]μM <b>propafenone</b> reduced significantly the amplitude of ICa,L. In spontaneously active AVN myocytes, action potential upstroke velocity was decreased by <b>propafenone</b> exposure, consistent with the observed change in ICa,L. By use of a Cs-based internal dialysis solution to record ICa,L selectively, voltage clamp test pulses were applied from a holding potential of − 40 [*]mV to + 10 [*]mV (stimulation frequency 0. 33 [*]Hz). <b>Propafenone</b> 5 [*]μM reduced mean ICa,L density at + 10 [*]mV from − 9. 58 ± 1. 05 [*]pA/pF to − 4. 19 ± 0. 60 [*]pA/pF (P< 0. 002). A range of <b>propafenone</b> concentrations were applied which reduced ICa,L in a dose-dependent manner (IC 50 1. 7 [*]μM). When test pulses were applied to a range of potentials, <b>propafenone</b> reduced ICa,L at each potential without significantly affecting the activation curve for this current. Thus, <b>propafenone</b> reduced ICa,L conductance, without affecting the voltage-dependent activation properties of the current. ICa,L block by <b>propafenone</b> exhibited tonic-, use- and frequency-dependent characteristics.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 46 -year-old man who {{developed}} syncope, a widened QRS interval, and depressed left ventricular systolic function during <b>propafenone</b> therapy for atrial fibrillation.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{efficacy}} of combined therapy with <b>propafenone</b> and mexiletine for control of sustained ventricular tachycardia. Background. Combination antiarrhythmic drug therapy may enhance efficacy and lead to control of ventricular arrhythmias in some patients. Few reports have studied the combination of class IB and class IC drugs. Thus, this study was designed to investigate a combination of mexiletine and <b>propafenone</b> in patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia. Methods. Sixteen patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia had their clinical arrhythmia induced by programmed stimulation. Procainamide and <b>propafenone</b> alone failed to prevent reinduction of tachycardia in all. Mexiletine was subsequently added to <b>propafenone</b> and programmed stimulation was repeated. Results. With combination therapy ventricular tachycardia was noninducible in three patients (19 %). A fourth who had presented with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia had slow bundle branch reentry (cycle length 500 ms) induced, in the other 12, tachycardia cycle length increased from 262 ± 60 ms at baseline to 350 ± 82 ms with <b>propafenone</b> and to 390 ± 80 ms with <b>propafenone</b> plus mexiletine (p < 0. 0001 compared with baseline). Hemodynamic deterioration requiring defibrillation occurred in six patients at baseline study, in five taking <b>propafenone</b> and in two taking both drugs. Conclusions. The combination of <b>propafenone</b> and mexiletine is effective in suppressing the induction of ventricular tachycardia in some patients refractory to procainamide and <b>propafenone</b> alone. In those in whom ventricular tachycardia could still be induced, the rate was slower and hemodynamically tolerated...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} intravenous <b>propafenone</b> was studied in 10 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in 2 patients with a concealed accessory pathway. During electrophysiologic study, the effect of <b>propafenone</b> on the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway was determined, {{as well as its}} effect during orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. <b>Propafenone</b> caused significant increases in the accessory pathway refractory period, both in the anterograde direction (290 ± 19 versus 474 ± 50 ms, p < 0. 05) and in the retrograde direction (238 ± 15 versus 408 ± 44 ms, p < 0. 05). Complete anterograde accessory pathway conduction block occurred in four patients. Sustained AV reentrant tachycardia was inducible in 11 patients before administration of <b>propafenone.</b> Drug infusion during AV reentrant tachycardia promptly ter- minated arrhythmia in 10 of these 11 patients and caused slowing of AV reentrant tachycardia in the remaining patient. Before <b>propafenone,</b> sustained atrial fibrillation was inducible in six patients and nonsustained atrial fibrillation in four patients. After <b>propafenone,</b> no patient had inducible sustained atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, <b>propafenone</b> caused a marked decrease in peak ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. Eight patients have been treated with oral <b>propafenone</b> and followed up for 12 ± 2 months.

40|$|<b>Propafenone</b> was {{administered}} during electrophysiologic testing {{to determine its}} efficacy and safety for terminating and preventing reinduction of paroxysmal supraventricular reentrant tachycardia. Four men and 10 women (mean age 50 years, range 28 to 69) were studied. Five patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia, three had a concealed accessory pathway with AV reentrant tachycardia and six had tachycardia due to reentry within the AV node. In the five patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, <b>propafenone</b> terminated reentrant tachycardia in three (the tachycardia was reinducible in one) and had no effect in two. In the three patients with a concealed accessory pathway, <b>propafenone</b> terminated reentrant tachycardia in all three and prevented reinduction of the tachycardia in two. In the six patients with tachycardia due to reentry within the AV node, <b>propafenone</b> terminated and prevented reinduction of reentrant tachycardia. <b>Propafenone</b> {{had no effect on}} blood pressure, heart rate, PA interval, AV node refractoriness or rate of reentrant tachycardia. <b>Propafenone</b> significantly (p < 0. 05) prolonged the AH, HV, QRS and ventriculoatrial intervals and decreased the AV node Wenckebach rate. Of the nine patients receiving long-term oral <b>propafenone</b> therapy, eight had a reduction of at least 90 % in reentrant tachycardia during a mean follow-up period of 14. 5 months (range 11 to 22); all eight patients had had noninducible reentrant tachycardia after intravenous <b>propafenone.</b> One patient had increased frequency of reentrant tachycardia; this patient had had inducible reentrant tachycardia after intravenous <b>propafenone.</b> In conclusion, intravenously administered <b>propafenone</b> terminated reentrant tachycardia in 85 % of patients and prevented reinduction in 71 %, with no adverse hemodynamic effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} on the inhibitory effect of <b>propafenone</b> in vascular smooth muscle is sparse. <b>Propafenone</b> acts through blockage of voltage-dependent cardiac Na+ channels, L-type Ca 2 + channels, voltage-sensitive K+ (Kv) channels, as well as β-adrenergic receptors in the heart. The introduction of different chemical groups in the benzyl moiety of <b>propafenone</b> influences pharmacological properties of newly developed derivate of <b>propafenone.</b> Here we investigated the effect of new ortho-chloro derivate of <b>propafenone</b> (5 OCl) on the vascular tone of precontracted rat aorta. 5 OCl produced endothelium-independent relaxation of rat aorta. In order to test the involvement of different ion channels in 5 OCl mechanism of action, antagonist of Na+, lidocaine, KV channels, 4 -aminopyiridine (4 -AP) and L-type Ca 2 + channels, nifedipine were used. All tested antagonists of ion channels did not influence the relaxation of rat aorta induced by high a concentration of 5 OCl (≥ 10 μM), but antagonized the relaxation induced by low concentrations of this <b>propafenone</b> derivate. Thus, 5 OCl derivate has comparable potency and efficacy as <b>propafenone.</b> According to its interaction with lidocaine, 4 -AP and nifedipine it seems that 5 OCl partly shares the mechanism of action with <b>propafenone.</b> The mechanism of vasodilatation induced by high micromolar concentration of 5 OCl is not defined and further investigations are necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrophysiologic}} {{effects and}} response to programmed ventricular stimulation of intravenous <b>propafenone,</b> an experimental antiarrhythmic agent, were studied {{in a group of}} 14 patients with both clinical and induced sustained ventricular tachycardia. Twelve of the 14 patients had not responded to conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy. <b>Propafenone</b> had no significant effect on sinus cycle length (836 ± 170 ms before and 750 ± 124 ms after <b>propafenone),</b> P wave duration (108 ± 24 ms before and 106 ± 23 ms after <b>propafenone)</b> or PR interval (181 ± 45 ms before and 194 ± 53 ms after <b>propafenone).</b> QRS duration and ventricular effective refractory periods increased significantly (109 ± 20 to 130 ± 21 ms and 235 ± 24 to 256 ± 19 ms, respectively). Ventricular tachycardia remained inducible or occurred spontaneously in 13 of 14 patients after propa- fenone administration. Neither mode of initiation nor mode of termination of ventricular tachycardia was predictably altered. Additional forms of ventricular tachycardia were seen in six patients. Cycle length of ventricular tachycardia was 303 ± 73 ms before and 346 ± 143 ms after <b>propafenone</b> (p = NS). In conclusion, intravenous <b>propafenone</b> does not significantly affect sinus rate, intraatrial conduction or atrioventricular conduction. Ventricular refractoriness and intraventricular conduction are prolonged. The mode of initiation, mode of termination and ventricular tachycardia cycle length are not predictably altered, but ventricular tachycardia occasionally occurs spontaneously after <b>propafenone.</b> Intravenous <b>propafenone</b> rarely prevents induction of ventricular tachycardia in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} <b>propafenone</b> (10 (- 7) to 10 (- 4) M) were studied on guinea-pig isolated atrial and ventricular muscle fibres obtained from untreated animals and animals pretreated with <b>propafenone,</b> 3 and 10 mg kg- 1, for 28 days. In untreated atria <b>propafenone</b> produced a dose-dependent {{decrease in the}} rate and maximum following frequency, prolonged the sinus node recovery time and reduced the maximum chronotropic responses to isoprenaline. In untreated atrial and ventricular muscle fibres <b>propafenone</b> depressed action potential amplitude and Vmax, reduced the resting membrane potential and prolonged the action potential duration (APD) and the effective refractory period, lengthening the effective refractory period relative to APD. <b>Propafenone</b> depressed the amplitude and Vmax and shortened {{the duration of the}} slow action potentials induced by isoprenaline and caffeine in K-depolarized papillary muscles. Pretreatment with <b>propafenone</b> reduced atrial rate, but did not modify the action potential characteristics compared to the values obtained in untreated atria. Further addition of <b>propafenone</b> produced similar but more marked changes in untreated atria. In ventricular muscle fibres pretreated with 3 mg kg- 1, action potential characteristics before and after further addition of <b>propafenone</b> were similar to those obtained in untreated fibres. However, muscles pretreated with 10 mg kg- 1 exhibited a significant prolongation of the APD compared to that in untreated muscles or those pretreated with 3 mg kg- 1; further addition of <b>propafenone</b> shortened the APD even when this parameter was of similar value to those observed in the other two series of experiments. It is concluded that even though the effects of <b>propafenone</b> {{are similar to those of}} quinidine (class I antiarrhythmic), it also exhibited class II and class IV actions.
