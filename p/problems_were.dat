5|$|In China, {{a three-year}} survey from 2010 to 2013 (using COLOSS questionnaires) showed colony losses of 10.1% on average. Comb renewal and queen <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> {{identified}} as significant risk factors.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was pushed forward by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> {{as difficult as}} the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> more difficult, and B3 <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> those that had only been completed once.|$|E
40|$|The {{geodetic}} <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced by}} Harary et al. In order to model some social network problems, a similar <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> introduced {{in this paper}} and named the strong geodetic <b>problem.</b> The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved for complete Apollonian networks. It is also proved that in general the strong geodetic <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> NP-complete...|$|R

5|$|Around 2000, {{the town}} saw a growth in {{residential}} {{drug and alcohol}} rehabilitation treatment centres, with attendant crime and social problems.

50|$|For most typed calculi, {{the type}} inhabitation <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> very hard.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{construct}} {{a class of}} finitely presented groups where the isomorphism <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solvable but the commensurability <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> unsolvable.

These are first examples of such a contrastive complexity behavior {{with respect to the}} isomorphism problem. 1...|$|R
40|$|The symbol {{grounding}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the <b>problem</b> of specifying a semantics for the representations {{employed by}} a {{physical symbol system}} {{in a way that}} is neither circular nor regressive. The quantum system identification <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the <b>problem</b> of relating observational outcomes to specific collections of physical degrees of freedom, i. e., to specific Hilbert spaces. It is shown that with reasonable physical assumptions these <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> equivalent. As the quantum system identification <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> demonstrably unsolvable by finite means, the symbol grounding <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> similarly unsolvable...|$|R
5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} the first flight of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude in ground effect. As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E
5|$|However, when Collins {{returned}} to the ASC facility in April 2001 for a year-long maintenance docking, multiple welding defects {{were found in the}} bow and escape tower sections of the submarine (the two sections constructed by Kockums), while almost no <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> found in the welding of the four Australian-built sections. Repairing these welds quadrupled the time Collins spent in dock.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E

30|$|When {{introducing}} attribute information, several <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> specially {{considered in}} this work. The first <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to represent facial attributes. The second <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{to incorporate the}} attribute representation in the metric learning model. Since the attributes are labeled according to different protocols across databases and problems, the third <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to adapt and transfer the attribute-enhanced metric learning model for general application scenario.|$|R
5|$|<b>Problems</b> <b>were</b> {{also found}} with the Littlejohn adaptor fitted to the 2-pounder to {{increase}} its range and penetration power; after they had been fitted the adapters could not be removed, and could only fire specially designed armour-piercing rounds, which took time to manufacture.|$|E

Most of the <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> attributed to the incline elevators being installed in the station, and to the ventilation fans along the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The Chilean {{government}} delayed their naval plans after {{a financial}} depression {{brought on by}} the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake and a drastic fall in the nitrate market in 1907, but these economic <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> not enough to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina. While Argentina's principal concern was with Brazil, Chile also wished to respond to Peruvian military acquisitions.|$|E
40|$|A {{singular}} non-self-adjoint {{boundary value}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> considered. This <b>problem</b> has a discontinuous coefficient with a spectral parameter in the boundary condition. Some solutions of the eigenvalue equation are given. The discrete spectrum is studied and the resolvent is obtained.

40|$|A Eulerian {{approach}} {{is applied to}} the finite element modelling of neo-Hookean rubber material. Two major <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> encountered. The first <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the construction of a n algorithm to calculate stresses in the rubber material from velocities instead of displacements. This <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved with a n algorithm based on the definition of the velocity gradient. The second <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the convection of stresses through the finite element mesh. This <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved by adapting the so-called Taylor-Galerkin technique. Solutions for both <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> implemented in a finite element program and their validity is shown by test problems.

5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> noted, including {{a lack of}} the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E
5|$|The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was {{originally}} {{scheduled to open}} on May 8, 2011, one week after that of Kings Island. On May 24, 2011, after <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> discovered during testing, Canada's Wonderland announced on their Facebook page that it would {{open to the public}} later that day, but it was quickly closed again when further mechanical <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> discovered. From May 24 to mid-June 2011, the ride was intermittently closed because of a variety of problems, most of which have since been resolved. At the beginning of October 2011, the hydraulic dampers used on the Knott's Berry Farm model were added {{to reduce the amount of}} swing movement even more.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany {{combinatorial}} <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> NP-complete {{for general}} graphs.

On the other hand, very few <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> known to be NP-complete for series–parallel graphs or partial k-trees. These include the subgraph isomorphism problem and the bandwidth problem. However, these <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> NP-complete even for trees. In this paper, we show that the edge-disjoint paths <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> NP-complete for series–parallel graphs and for partial 2 -trees although the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> trivial for trees and can be solved for outerplanar graphs in polynomial time...|$|R
