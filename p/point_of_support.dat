25|$|The bassoon is held diagonally {{in front}} of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily {{supported}} by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a seat strap attached {{to the base of the}} boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or a neck strap or shoulder harness attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a balance hanger is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.|$|E
25|$|Precession can be {{demonstrated}} by placing a spinning top with its axis horizontal and supported loosely (frictionless toward precession) at one end. Instead of falling, as might be expected, the top appears to defy gravity by remaining with its axis horizontal, when {{the other end of}} the axis is left unsupported and the free end of the axis slowly describes a circle in a horizontal plane, the resulting precession turning. This effect is explained by the above equations. The torque on the top is supplied by a couple of forces: gravity acting downward on the device's centre of mass, and an equal force acting upward to support one end of the device. The rotation resulting from this torque is not downward, as might be intuitively expected, causing the device to fall, but perpendicular to both the gravitational torque (horizontal and perpendicular to the axis of rotation) and the axis of rotation (horizontal and outwards from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support),</b> i.e., about a vertical axis, causing the device to rotate slowly about the supporting point.|$|E

500|$|Wellesley reached Ahmednuggur {{later the}} same day after a [...] march and {{immediately}} ordered an escalade assault on the town rather than enter into a time-consuming siege. The walled town, which was garrisoned by 1,000 Arab mercenaries, upwards of 60 cannon and one of Scindia’s infantry battalions {{under the command of}} French officers, was captured with minimal losses after a brief action. The adjacent fort's defenders capitulated four days later once the walls were breached by British artillery. With the fortification providing a logistics base and <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for future operations into Maratha territory, Wellesley installed a garrison and headed north towards the Nizam's city of Aurungabad. Along the way he captured Scindia’s other possessions south of the Godavari and established a series of guarded bridges and ferries along the river to maintain his communication and supply lines.|$|E
2500|$|During the Christian Reconquista, the {{primitive}} frontier of the County of Portugal with the Kingdom of León extended along the left {{bank of the}} Sabor River, to its confluence with the Angueira River. This link was watched by various sentinel outposts: the Castle of Milhão, the Castle of Santulhão (both today long disappeared), the Castle of Outeiro de Miranda (in ruins) and in the eastern edge, the Castle of Algoso. The remainder of the principal defense occurred in the northwest, across the protector of the Castles of Penas Róias, Mogadouro and Bragança. Sometime during the 12th century, D. Mendo Rufino (or Bofino), master of the lands of [...] "Ulgoso" [...] by donation of D. Afonso Henriques, ordered {{the construction of a}} fortress, in order to watch and guard the frontier with the Kingdom of León. From information during the 1258 Inquirições, Mendo Rufino (who was one of the supporters of Afonso Henriques against D. Teresa) constructed the castle in exchange for the village of Vimioso. During this period of uncertainty that is the transition between Afonso Henriques reign as first Portuguese monarch, and the exercise of regal power by Sancho I, the castle became an important link with loyal nobility, which had ties to the corte of León, but harboured loyalties with the Portuguese. As the [...] "head" [...] of the Terra da Miranda, Algoso was an important fortress; a [...] "nuclear <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> with the regal authority" [...] in this peripheric region.|$|E

60|$|The {{reader is}} {{probably}} {{familiar with the}} structure of an ordinary astronomical observatory. The building is usually cylindrical in shape, with a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from the interior. The telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the centre, and a clockwork arrangement compensates for the earth's rotation, and allows a star once found to be continuously observed. Besides this, there is a compact tracery of wheels and screws about its <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> by which the astronomer adjusts it. There is, of course, a slit in the movable roof which follows {{the eye of the}} telescope in its survey of the heavens. The observer sits or lies on a sloping wooden arrangement, which he can wheel to any part of the observatory as the position of the telescope may require. Within it is advisable to have things as dark as possible, in order to enhance the brilliance of the stars observed.|$|E

60|$|After breakfast we {{proceeded}} on our journey. As my {{object was}} merely {{to see a}} little of the interior scenery, we returned by another track, which descended into the main valley lower down. For some distance we wound, by a most intricate path, {{along the side of the}} mountain which formed the valley. In the less precipitous parts we passed through extensive groves of the wild banana. The Tahitians, with their naked, tattooed bodies, their heads ornamented with flowers, and seen in the dark shade of these groves, would have formed a fine picture of man inhabiting some primeval land. In our descent we followed the line of ridges; these were exceedingly narrow, and for considerable lengths steep as a ladder; but all clothed with vegetation. The extreme care necessary in poising each step rendered the walk fatiguing. I did not cease to wonder at these ravines and precipices: when viewing the country from one of the knife-edged ridges, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> was so small that the effect was nearly the same as it must be from a balloon. In this descent we had occasion to use the ropes only once, at the point where we entered the main valley. We slept under the same ledge of rock where we had dined the day before: the night was fine, but from the depth and narrowness of the gorge, profoundly dark.|$|E

6000|$|But that, I found, was by {{no means}} so easy a matter as descending. I had got down partly by the mean and illegitimate device of letting my feet slide; to get back I must somehow secure a firm and certain {{foothold}} in the loose lava. To my surprise and horror there was none to be found. The soft and creamy pumice-stone seemed nowhere to afford a single solid <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> I struggled in vain to recover my balance; at last, to my dismay, I stumbled and fell--fell, as I feared, towards the Floor of the Hawaiians, that yawned a full hundred and twenty feet of sheer depth in the crater below me. With a wild lunge I clutched for support at the plant in the cranny. It broke short in my hand, and my one chance gone, I rolled down rapidly to the very bottom. I didn't exactly tumble down the entire sheer height in a single fall; if I had I shouldn't be here to tell you. I broke the force of the descent somewhat by digging my hands and feet with frantic efforts into the loose wall of rotten lava. But before I could realize precisely what was happening I lost my head. The world reeled round me; my eyes closed. Next moment I was aware of a horrid thud, and a fierce blow against some hard surface. I knew then just where I had landed. I had fallen or rolled by stages the whole way down the crag, and was lying on my side on the Floor of the Hawaiians! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{tone was}} not that of {{imperious}} command, but of quiet self-possession and assurance of the right, blended with benignity. Romola, vibrating to the sound, looked round at the figure {{on the opposite side}} of the bed. His face was hardly discernible under the shadow of the cowl, and her eyes fell at once on his hands, which were folded across his breast and lay in relief on the edge of his black mantle. They had a marked physiognomy which enforced the influence of the voice: they were very beautiful and almost of transparent delicacy. Romola's disposition to rebel against command, doubly active in the presence of monks, whom she had been taught to despise, would have fixed itself on any repulsive detail as a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> But the face was hidden, and the hands seemed to have an appeal in them against all hardness. The next moment the right-hand took the crucifix to relieve the fatigued grasp of Fra Luca, and the left touched his lips with a wet sponge which lay near. In the act of bending, the cowl was pushed back, and the features of the monk had the full light of the tapers on them. They were very marked features, such as lend themselves to popular description. There was the high arched nose, the prominent under-lip, the coronet of thick dark hair above the brow, all seeming to tell of energy and passion; there were the blue-grey eyes, shining mildly under auburn eyelashes, seeming, like the hands, to tell of acute sensitiveness. Romola felt certain they were the features of Fra Girolamo Savonarola, the prior of San Marco, whom she had chiefly thought of as more offensive than other monks, because he was more noisy. Her rebellion was rising against the first impression, which had almost forced her to bend her knees.|$|E
60|$|Knots.--There can be {{no doubt}} that every knot in a rope weakens its power of {{resisting}} a sudden jerking strain. How great a loss of strength results from a knot we cannot undertake to estimate, but that the loss is a very serious one the following statement will show: these ropes which we report will resist the strain of fourteen stone falling eight feet, will not resist it if there is a knot in any one of them; or even if the knots used in attaching them to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> or to the weights, be roughly or carelessly made. The rope in these cases breaks at the knot, for two reasons; partly because of the folds, as they cross in the knot, are strained suddenly across each other, and one of them is cut through; and partly because the rope is so sharply bent that the outer side of each fold in the knot is much more stretched than the inner side, so that the strain comes almost entirely upon one side only of each fold. For the first reason, we found it necessary to put a pad of some kind inside the knot--leather, linen, or a little tow or waste rope will do. For the second reason we preferred knots in which the folds are least sharply bent round each other; that is, in which the curves are large. We therefore conclude that--1st. No knot, which is not absolutely necessary, ought to be allowed to remain on the rope: 2nd. The tighter and harder a knot becomes, the worse it is: 3rd. The more loose and open a knot is made, the better it is:--and we append diagrams of those knots which we found by experiment weaken the rope least. For Alpine ropes, only three sorts of knots are ever required, and we suggest one of each kind:--No. 1 is for the purpose of joining two ends. No. 2 is for the purpose of making a loop at one end. No. 3 is for the purpose of making a loop in the middle when the ends are fastened. No. 4 is a knot, of which we give a diagram in order that no one may imitate it. It is one of those which most weaken the rope. The only one which seemed to be equally injurious is the common single knot, of which no diagram is necessary. As the topes which we have recommended are very liable to become untwisted, unless the loose ends are secured, we advise travellers, in order to avoid knots, to have the ends of every piece of rope bound with waxed twine. It should also be known that it is very unsafe to join two pieces of rope by looping one end through the other, so that when the jerk comes, they will be strained across each other as two links of a chain are strained across each other. Unless a pad of some kind divides the loops, one will cut the other through.|$|E

6000|$|And again, of the axioms of mechanics: “As we admit no such [...] propositions, {{other than}} as truths inductively {{collected}} from [...] observation, even in geometry itself, it {{can hardly be}} expected [...] that, in a science of obviously contingent relations, we should [...] acquiesce in a contrary view. Let us take one of these axioms and [...] examine its evidence: for instance, that equal forces [...] perpendicularly applied at the opposite ends of equal arms of a [...] straight lever will balance each other. What but experience, we may [...] ask, in the first place, can possibly inform us that a force so [...] applied will have any tendency to turn the lever on its centre at [...] all? or that force can be so transmitted along a rigid line [...] perpendicular to its direction, as to act elsewhere in space than [...] along its own line of action? Surely this is so far from being [...] self-evident that it has even a paradoxical appearance, which is [...] only to be removed by giving our lever thickness, material [...] composition, and molecular powers. Again, we conclude, that the two [...] forces, being equal and applied under precisely similar [...] circumstances, must, if they exert any effort at all to turn the [...] lever, exert equal and opposite efforts: but what a priori [...] reasoning can possibly assure us that they do act under precisely [...] similar circumstances? that points which differ in place are [...] similarly circumstanced as regards the exertion of force? that [...] universal space may not have relations to universal force—or, at all [...] events, that {{the organization of the}} material universe may not be [...] such as to place that portion of space occupied by it in such [...] relations to the forces exerted in it, as may invalidate the [...] absolute similarity of circumstances assumed? Or we may argue, what [...] have we to do with the notion of angular movement in the lever at [...] all? The case is one of rest, and of quiescent destruction of force [...] by force. Now how is this destruction effected? Assuredly by the [...] counter-pressure which supports the fulcrum. But would not this [...] destruction equally arise, and by the same amount of counteracting [...] force, if each force simply pressed its own half of the lever [...] against the fulcrum? And what can assure us that it is not so, [...] except removal of one or other force, and consequent tilting of the [...] lever? The other fundamental axiom of statics, that the pressure on [...] the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> is the sum of the weights ... is merely a [...] scientific transformation and more refined mode of stating a coarse [...] and obvious result of universal experience, viz., that the weight of [...] a rigid body is the same, handle it or suspend it in what position [...] or by what point we will, and that whatever sustains it sustains its [...] total weight. Assuredly, as Mr. Whewell justly remarks, ‘No one [...] probably ever made a trial for the purpose of showing that the [...] pressure on the support is equal to the sum of the weights.’ ... But [...] it is precisely because in every action of his life from earliest [...] infancy he has been continually making the trial, and seeing it made [...] by every other living being about him, that he never dreams of [...] staking its result on one additional attempt made with scientific [...] accuracy. This would be as if a man should resolve to decide by [...] experiment whether his eyes were useful for the purpose of seeing, [...] by hermetically sealing himself up for half an hour in a metal [...] case.” ...|$|E
