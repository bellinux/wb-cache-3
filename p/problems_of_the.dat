5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in the summer of 1914, Alderson was placed in charge of the 1st Mounted Division and all troops in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk but was soon requested for command of the newly formed First Canadian Contingent due to his experience in South Africa commanding Canadian troops. Personally selected by Sir Sam Hughes, Canadian Minister of Militia, Alderson met the first shipments of Canadian troops in October and almost immediately came into conflict with their minister. Hughes had preceded his men and insisted that the Canadian contingent was not only fully trained and battle ready but also equipped with the best weaponry available. Alderson however saw his charges differently, commenting on the poor quality of the politically appointed officers, the low degree of training and the operational <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ross rifle, a weapon personally approved by Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Besides the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> partial aether-dragging hypothesis, {{another major}} problem arose with the Michelson–Morley {{experiment}} (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment {{should have given}} a positive result. However, {{the result of this}} experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|Both {{boats were}} {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1909, with U-4 commissioned in August and U-3 in September. During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy the diving <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U-3-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.|$|E
5000|$|Three years later, in his 1903 book, Du Bois {{used the}} phrase first in his introduction, titled [...] "The Forethought", writing: [...] "This meaning is not without {{interest}} to you, Gentle Reader; for <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twentieth Century is <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> color line". <b>The</b> phrase occurs again in the book's second essay, [...] "Of <b>the</b> Dawn <b>of</b> Freedom", at both its beginning and its end. At <b>the</b> outset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essay, Du Bois writes: [...] "The <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century is <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color-line - <b>the</b> relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darker to <b>the</b> lighter races <b>of</b> men in Asia and Africa, in America and <b>the</b> islands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea". At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essay, Du Bois truncates his statement to: [...] "The <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century is <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color-line", the more frequently quoted version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentiment.|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city as a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> press launch day, a more {{positive}} response was expected from the 20,000 {{members of the public}} who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; less than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers – were returned with fresh orders. Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.|$|E

5|$|Doug Flutie {{made his}} NFL {{debut in the}} fourth quarter for the Chicago Bears. The Bears took an early 14–0 lead after Mike Tomczak's 37-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Willie Gault. The play occurred after Ervin Randle's recovery of a Calvin Thomas fumble was nullified due to an offsides penalty on Craig Swoope. While the Buccaneers' defense improved later in the game, it was not enough to overcome the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injury-battered offense. Nathan Wonsley suffered a broken neck while making a tackle on the opening kickoff. This was followed by injuries to Jerry Bell, Phil Freeman, Craig Swoope, and Willie Gillespie. Calvin Magee played with a prior injury, as did James Wilder and Leonard Harris, though both were forced to leave the game. With Gerald Carter left as the only experienced receiver, the Bears keyed on him, and with Bell, Wonsley and Wilder out, the Buccaneers could not run.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty {{serving as}} a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the financial <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as Minister for Defence following the 1998 federal election, John Moore {{decided that the}} only way to solve the various <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Collins class was for an independent report to be prepared on them.

40|$|This work {{lies within}} the post-nietzschean theme {{regarding}} <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> “community”. “We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge —and with good reason.

5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the Japanese surrender, the Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups were disbanded by the Japanese. Command structures and membership vital {{for a national}} army were consequently dismantled. Thus, rather than being formed from a trained, armed, and organised army, the Republican armed forces began to grow in September from usually younger, less trained groups built around charismatic leaders. Creating a rational military structure that was obedient to central authority from such disorganisation, {{was one of the}} major <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolution, a problem that remains through to contemporary times. In the self-created Indonesian army, Japanese-trained Indonesian officers prevailed over those trained by the Dutch. A thirty-year-old former school teacher, Sudirman, was elected 'commander-in-chief' at the first meeting of Division Commanders in Yogyakarta on 12 November 1945.|$|E

5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it still did not appreciate the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E
