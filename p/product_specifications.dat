The company's products can now be found in major Greek supermarket chains. A postal-delivery system for their products has been established to reach the internal Greek market. The delivery is free inside Greece and the meat is packed in special polystyrene packaging with dry ice to preserve freshness.|$|E

Wyeth recommended that women who had Norplant capsules from those lots implanted use backup contraception until they determined the clinical relevance of the atypically low levels of levonorgestrel release.|$|E

In order to solve the geometrical <b>specification</b> problems of <b>product</b> functional requirements and the ambiguity problems of <b>product</b> <b>specification,</b> this paper utilizes a new method based on dynamic description logic to describe the fundamental concepts of geometrical specification. It analyzes the geometrical features of geometrical <b>product</b> functional <b>specification.</b> By establishing {{the model of the}} operations, describing the input and output parameters in the specification and verification process, and analyzing the preconditions and results of the executions of specification operator and verification operator, the paper simplifies the operation results and overcomes the shortcomings of ambiguity and inconsistency in <b>product</b> <b>specification</b> process. Finally, it takes the specification process of perpendicularity as an example to prove the feasibility and validity of this method...|$|R
