A {{wide spectrum of}} well-defined colors is accomplished by varying the ac voltage. The passive films are stable in the ambient and in aqueous chloride, perchlorate, and sulfate solutions. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses indicate that the <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> are compact and do not show fractures or cracks. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the colored <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> demonstrates that their surface-chemical composition depends on the ac polarization voltage. The main constituents of the <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> are Tiz+, O 2 -, and F- (z varies from 4 to 2 depending on the film's depth). Fluoride in the film originates from decomposition of NH 4 BF 4, and it accumulates at the inner metal/passive-film interface. XPS depth profiling shows that the higher the ac voltage applied, the thicker the passive film formed. Electrochemical properties of the colored Ti <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> are determined by recording polarization curves in the 2 ̆ 2120. 8 to 3. 2 V range as well as Tafel plots in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) region in 1. 0 M aqueous H 2 SO 4.
