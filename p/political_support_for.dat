In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} new {{generation}} of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny's {{relationship}} with Kwame Nkrumah, {{the leader of}} neighboring Ghana, degraded considerably following Guinea's independence, due to Nkrumah's financial and <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Sékou Touré. After Sékou Touré convinced Nkrumah to support the secessionist Sanwi in Côte d'Ivoire, Houphouët-Boigny began a campaign to discredit the Ghanaian regime. He accused Nkrumah of trying to destabilise Côte d'Ivoire in 1963, and called for the Francophone states to boycott the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) conference scheduled {{to take place in}} Accra. Nkrumah was ousted from power in 1966 in a military coup; Houphouët-Boigny allowed the conspirators to use Côte d'Ivoire as a base to coordinate the arrival and departure of their missions.|$|E
5|$|These changes {{brought the}} {{customary}} rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.

The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.|$|E

Trailers from Class 65 and Class 67 were taken into use, and for a short period a Class 91 trailer. On 28 August 1985, passenger traffic on the line was terminated and the two remaining trains were retired. Reasons for the termination included a lack of sufficient <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> financing new trains, and also that Class 64 was no longer suitable for use. The last two trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Club and are stored at Garnes Station, part of the Old Voss Line.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{proposal}} {{had called}} for locating the station in Ny-Ålesund due to its topographical advantage. In January 1964, ESRO started informal discussions with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated {{that they had no}} initial objections. By then, supported by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, ESRO instead proposed situating the station at Longyearbyen because it was less remote and would incur lower costs. This was opposed by Norwegian authorities; mining in Ny-Ålesund had ceased after the 1963 Kings Bay Affair and the authorities wanted permanent activity in the town. An official request was made by ESRO in February, and in May, official <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the project was awarded. The main motivation was to establish a permanent space technology center in Norway that could stimulate further scientific growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{attempted}} {{to build up}} a base of <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of the}} King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E

50|$|In 1917, the Eastern {{front of}} the Entente Powers {{completely}} collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated. Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories, and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. During the Italian battles, the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence. On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. At the last Italian offensive, the Austro-Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply, and fought without any <b>political</b> <b>supports</b> <b>for</b> a de facto non-existent empire.

5|$|However, Claiborne {{was offered}} a {{position}} as a land surveyor in the new colony of Virginia, and arrived at Jamestown, {{on the north shore}} of the James River in 1621. The position carried a 200acre (80hectare) land grant, a salary of £30 per year, and the promise of fees paid by settlers who needed to have their land grants surveyed. His political acumen quickly {{made him one of the}} most successful Virginia colonists, and within four years of his arrival he had secured grants for 1,100acres (445hectares) of land and a retroactive salary of £60 a year from the Virginia Colony's council. He also managed to survive the March 1622 attacks by native/Indian Powhatans on the Virginia settlers that killed more than 300colonists. His financial success was followed by political success, and he gained appointment as Councilor in 1624 and Secretary of State for the Colony in 1626. Around 1627, he began to trade for furs with the native Susquehannock Indians from further north on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and two of its largest tributaries, the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers. To facilitate this trade, Claiborne wanted to establish a trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay, which he intended to make the center of a vast mercantile empire along the Atlantic Coast. Claiborne found both financial and <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Kent Island venture from London merchants Maurice Thomson, William Cloberry, John de la Barre, and Simon Turgis.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{implemented}} by the NRA and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Very large numbers of regulations were generated under the authority granted to the NRA by the Act, {{which led to a}} significant loss of <b>political</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Roosevelt and the New Deal. The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). The National Industrial Recovery Act is widely considered a policy failure, both in the 1930s and by historians today. Disputes over the reasons for this failure continue. Among the suggested causes are that the Act promoted economically harmful monopolies, that the Act lacked critical support from the business community, and that it was poorly administered. The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest. The NIRA had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led Congress to pass the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The Act was also a major force behind a major modification of the law criminalizing making false statements.|$|E
