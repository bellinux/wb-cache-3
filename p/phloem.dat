5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} bark {{is known as}} the <b>phloem</b> and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the <b>phloem</b> is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating <b>phloem</b> cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E
5|$|In {{vascular}} plants, the xylem and <b>phloem</b> are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots {{are often}} adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots.|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and <b>phloem</b> feeders.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the stems and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new <b>phloem</b> and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually {{the growth of a}} tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E
5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The {{precursor}} to tomato systemin is transcribed as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the <b>phloem</b> in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the <b>phloem</b> parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E
5|$|Despite its slow {{metabolism}} rate, the Sunda slow loris has a high-energy diet. Its slow lifestyle {{may be due}} to {{the energy}} costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets. The largest amount of time is spent eating <b>phloem</b> sap (34.9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing plant parts (31.7%), and fruits (22.5%). It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects. Gum is taken by licking wounds on trees. They are also known to feed on molluscs, including the giant land snail Achatina fulica, and birds' eggs.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the <b>phloem.</b> The <b>phloem</b> sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the <b>phloem</b> sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, <b>phloem</b> sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the <b>phloem</b> sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of <b>phloem</b> bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi lack an {{efficient}} {{system for the}} long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the xylem and <b>phloem</b> in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar {{to the roots of}} plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{infestation}} is detected, quarantines {{are typically}} imposed by state or national government agencies disallowing transport of ash firewood or live plants outside {{of these areas}} without permits indicating the material has been inspected or treated (i.e., heat treatment or wood chipping) to ensure no live emerald ash borer {{are present in the}} bark and <b>phloem.</b> In urban areas, trees are often removed once an infestation is found to reduce emerald ash borer population densities and the likelihood of further spread. Urban ash are typically replaced with non-ash species such as maple, oak, or linden to limit food sources. In rural areas, trees can be harvested for lumber or firewood to reduce ash stand density, but quarantines may apply for this material, especially in areas where the material could be infested.|$|E
5|$|Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of {{mammalian}} chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in vitro, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), {{which is}} able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin {{as well as several}} blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the <b>phloem</b> sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.|$|E
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary <b>phloem</b> and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic <b>phloem</b> pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
25|$|In some eudicot {{families}} (Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Thymelaeaceae), <b>phloem</b> also develops on {{the inner}} side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between external <b>phloem</b> and internal <b>phloem</b> or intraxylary <b>phloem</b> is made. Internal <b>phloem</b> is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external <b>phloem</b> and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions. In some other families (Amaranthaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Salvadoraceae), the cambium also periodically forms inward strands or layers of <b>phloem,</b> embedded in the xylem: Such <b>phloem</b> strands are called included <b>phloem</b> or interxylary <b>phloem.</b>|$|E
25|$|In an adult, the <b>phloem</b> originates, {{and grows}} {{outwards}} from, meristematic {{cells in the}} vascular cambium. <b>Phloem</b> is produced in phases. Primary <b>phloem</b> is laid down by the apical meristem and develops from the procambium. Secondary <b>phloem</b> is laid down by the vascular cambium {{to the inside of}} the established layer(s) of <b>phloem.</b>|$|E
25|$|Siphonosteles can be ectophloic (<b>phloem</b> present only {{external}} to the xylem) or they can be amphiphloic (with <b>phloem</b> both external and internal to the xylem). Among living plants, many ferns and some Asterid flowering plants have an amphiphloic stele.|$|E
25|$|While {{movement}} {{of water and}} minerals through the xylem is driven by negative pressures (tension) most of the time, movement through the <b>phloem</b> is driven by positive hydrostatic pressures. This process is termed translocation, and is accomplished by a process called <b>phloem</b> loading and unloading.|$|E
25|$|Elm <b>phloem</b> {{necrosis}} (elm yellows) is {{a disease}} of elm trees that is spread by leafhoppers or by root grafts. This very aggressive disease, with no known cure, occurs in the Eastern United States, southern Ontario in Canada, and Europe. It is caused by phytoplasmas which infect the <b>phloem</b> (inner bark) of the tree. Infection and death of the <b>phloem</b> effectively girdles the tree and stops {{the flow of water}} and nutrients. The disease affects both wild-growing and cultivated trees.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phloem</b> from {{silver birch}} has been {{also used to}} make flour in the past.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phloem</b> of {{pine trees}} {{has been used}} in Finland as a {{substitute}} food in times of famine and even in good years in the northeast. Supplies of <b>phloem</b> from previous years helped stave off starvation in the great famine of the 1860s. <b>Phloem</b> is dried and milled to flour (pettu in Finnish) and mixed with rye to form a hard dark bread, bark bread. The least appreciated was silkko, a bread made only from buttermilk and pettu without any real rye or cereal flour. Recently, pettu has again become available as a curiosity, and some have made claims of health benefits. However, its food energy content is low relative to rye or other cereals.|$|E
25|$|Aphids passively feed on sap of <b>phloem</b> {{vessels in}} plants, {{as do many}} of their fellow members of Hemiptera such as scale insects and cicadas. Once a <b>phloem</b> vessel is punctured, the sap, which is under pressure, is forced into the aphid's food canal. Occasionally, aphids also ingest xylem sap, which is a more dilute diet than <b>phloem</b> sap as the {{concentrations}} of sugars and amino acids are 1% {{of those in the}} <b>phloem.</b> Xylem sap is under negative hydrostatic pressure and requires active sucking, suggesting an important role in aphid physiology. As xylem sap ingestion has been observed following a dehydration period, aphids are thought to consume xylem sap to replenish their water balance; the consumption of the dilute sap of xylem permitting aphids to rehydrate. However, recent data showed aphids consume more xylem sap than expected and they notably do so when they are not dehydrated and when their fecundity decreases. This suggests aphids, and potentially, all the phloem-sap feeding species of the order Hemiptera, consume xylem sap for another reason than replenishing water balance.|$|E
25|$|In the embryo, root <b>phloem</b> {{develops}} independently in {{the upper}} hypocotyl, which lies between the embryonic root, and the cotyledon.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{molecules}} such as sugars, amino acids, certain hormones, {{and even}} messenger RNAs are transported in the <b>phloem</b> through sieve tube elements.|$|E
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and <b>phloem</b> in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary <b>phloem</b> to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary <b>phloem,</b> the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is found}} in many {{different}} parts of plants, it has been seen only in specific cell types, including {{the areas of the}} <b>phloem.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similarly, adelgids also feed on plant <b>phloem.</b> Adelgids are {{sometimes}} described as aphids, but are more properly classified as aphid-like insects, {{because they have}} no cauda or cornicles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phloem</b> tissue {{consists}} of conducting cells, generally called sieve elements, parenchyma cells, including both specialized companion cells or albuminous cells and unspecialized cells and supportive cells, such as fibres and sclereids.|$|E
25|$|During the plant's growth period, usually {{during the}} spring, storage organs {{such as the}} roots are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The {{movement}} in <b>phloem</b> is multidirectional, whereas, in xylem cells, it is unidirectional (upward).|$|E
25|$|For long distances, {{relocation}} occurs via {{the stream}} of fluid in <b>phloem</b> vessels, but, for short-distance transport, a unique system of coordinated polar transport directly from cell to cell is exploited. This short-distance, active transport exhibits some morphogenetic properties.|$|E
25|$|BCTV is {{transmitted}} to nymphs of beet leafhoppers when they {{feed on the}} <b>phloem</b> of plants that are infected with the virus. Even though the leafhopper is infected with the virus, the virus does not replicate within the leafhopper and causes no harm to them. BCTV cannot {{be passed on to}} their offspring. The only way for offsprings to be infected with the virus is if they fed on any plants infected with the BCTV. Once the beet leafhoppers ingest the virus, it moves from their digestive tract to the salivary glands. Once the infected leafhoppers migrate and feed on healthy plants, they transmit the virus by eating the <b>phloem.</b> The infected beet leafhoppers are able to infect various plants {{for the rest of their}} lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Female beetles {{initiate}} attacks. As they chew {{into the}} inner bark and <b>phloem,</b> pheromones are released, attracting male and female beetles to the same tree. The attacking beetles produce more pheromones, resulting in a mass attack that overcomes the tree’s defenses, and results in attacks on adjacent trees.|$|E
25|$|Starch {{granules}} {{appear and}} grow throughout the day, as the chloroplast synthesizes sugars, and are consumed {{at night to}} fuel respiration and continue sugar export into the <b>phloem,</b> though in mature chloroplasts, it is rare for a starch granule to be completely consumed or for a new granule to accumulate.|$|E
25|$|Secondary growth {{encompasses}} all {{growth in}} diameter, {{a major component}} of woody plant tissues and many nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of sweet potato have secondary growth but are not woody. Secondary growth occurs at the lateral meristems, namely the vascular cambium and cork cambium. The former forms secondary xylem and secondary <b>phloem,</b> while the latter forms the periderm.|$|E
