40|$|Abstract—Counting and {{identifying}} neighboring active nodes are two fundamental operations in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). In this paper, we propose two mechanisms, Power based Counting (Poc) and Power based Identification (<b>Poid),</b> which achieve fast and accurate counting and identification by allowing neighbors to respond simultaneously to a poller. A key observa-tion that motivates our design is {{that the power of}} a superposed signal increases with the number of component signals under the condition of constructive interference (CI). However, due to the phase offsets and various hardware limitations (e. g., ADC saturation), the increased superposed power exhibits dynamic and diminishing returns as the number of component signals increases. This uncertainty of phase offsets and diminishing returns property of the superposed power pose serious challenges to the design of both Poc and <b>Poid.</b> To overcome these challenges, we design delay compensation methods to reduce the phase offset of each component signal, and propose a novel probabilistic estimation technique in cooperation with CI. We implement Poc and <b>Poid</b> on a testbed of 1 USRP and 50 TelosB nodes, the experimental results show that the accuracy of Poc is above 97. 9 %, and the accuracy of <b>Poid</b> is above 96. 5 % for most cases. In addition to their high accuracy, our methods demonstrate significant advantages over the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of substantially lower energy consumption and estimation delay.

5|$|The {{national}} French standard until 1799 {{was based}} on a famous artefact called the , which probably dates back to {{the second half of the}} 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238kg. The set is now shown in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The total nominal value of the set is 50 marcs de Troyes or marcs de Paris, a mark being 8ounces. The ounce <b>poids</b> de marc had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59g. The <b>poids</b> de marc was used as a national French standard for trading, for gold, silver and jewels, and for weighing medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the French Revolution, the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.|$|E
5|$|Until 1875, the French {{government}} {{owned the}} prototype metre and kilogram, {{but in that}} year the Convention of the metre was signed, {{and control of the}} standards relating to mass and length passed to a trio of inter-governmental organisations, the senior of which was the General Conference on Weights and Measures (in French the Conférence générale des <b>poids</b> et mesures or CGPM). During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the CGPM cooperated with a number of other organisations, and by 1960 it had responsibility for defining temporal, electrical, thermal, molecular and luminar measurements, while other international organisations continued their roles in how these units of measurement were used.|$|E

Kubin residents retain their links with the Thursday Island, Bamaga and Cowal Creek (Injinoo) communities and with their help have established a number of business enterprises. Services in Kubin include an Ibis store, health centre, a school (Tagai College), RTC with Mualgau Knowledge Centre, post office, disability services, a childcare centre, police service, Mualgal Mineral Arts Centre and Torres Strait Island Regional Council office.

Three members of the Hammond Island community who protested against the removal were arrested without charge by police armed with revolvers.|$|R

Milman suggested that the new mission should be named St Pauls, after the famous St Paul's Cathedral in London. In November 1912, 36,000 acres of land on Moa Island were officially gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve by the Queensland Government, exclusive of the land already gazetted for the South Sea Islanders. Many other Torres Strait Islands were gazetted as Aboriginal reserves at the same time. In 1922, the name of the settlement at Adam was changed to <b>Poid.</b>|$|R
40|$|Regression {{analysis}} was used to estimate the dependence of CPUE and average weight of bigeye on the temperature of surface water, the temperature of water at hook depth, the depth of the hook and the depth of thermocline. Hydrological data, catch and effort data and length/weight data were collected during four cruises of the Polish longliner WIECZNO from 1981 to 1985. The vessel operated in the Central Atlantic (37 oN- 09 oS and 15 oW- 38 oW). A total of 220 sets were analysed. Bigeye tuna was represented in 59 % of sets. The daily CPUE of bigeye ranged up to 620 kg/ 1000 hooks in different years. The average length and weight of bigeye was 130 cm and 45. 5 kg respectively. Since standard longlines with 5 -hook baskets were used, the prevailing depth range for bigeye was 60 - 100 metres. The most efficient water temperature at hook depth was 12 - 16 o C. Statistically significant dependencies were found between CPUE and hook depth, CPUE and the depth of thermocline and CPUE and surface temperature. The dependence between average weight of fish and water temperature at hook depth was also significant.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an archaeological {{examination}} of the colonial history of the Mualgal people (the Indigenous people of Mua, western Torres Strait, northeastern Australia) from their first entanglements with the London Missionary Society {{in the late nineteenth}} century, to their later supposed "absorption" into the Queensland State bureaucracy following {{the turn of the twentieth}} century. The two case studies considered - Totalai and <b>Poid</b> - are seminal ancestral village sites for the Mualgal today. They offer a rare opportunity for researchers to examine changing Mualgal traditions of the colonial era with relatively fine-grained temporal resolution. Occupation of each village during this colonial period was short (although an even earlier village at Totalai has a pre-colonial antiquity) and relates to a different phase in Torres Strait's colonial history: the indirect "rule" of the LMS years (c. 1871 - 1904) and the colonial authority of the Queensland Government Protectors (c. 1904 - 1950). The key question pursued in this thesis is essentially an issue of representation, and, more specifically, the difficulties archaeologists confront in conceptualizing the actions of Indigenous peoples when writing about mission- and reserve-based entanglements. For the most part, archaeologies of Indigenous missions and reserves in Australia have been approached in academia through one dominant theoretical lens: hegemony. While such approaches have undoubtedly elicited important insights into dynamics of power relations within institutional settings, I argue that hegemonic and related frameworks are inadequate to address how Indigenous peoples approach and think about their own post-contact past. In part, this inadequacy reflects the ways in which archaeologists interested in power dynamics have, for the main, overlooked Indigenous notions of material culture and landscape - a reflection that unconsciously mirrors a researcher's own preunderstanding or preconceptions. Such oversights have broader disciplinary and political implications, not least of which is the potential to reinforce a general perception that missions and reserves were in essence Western places of quarantining (and cultural incarceration and rehabilitation), of steps towards cultural extinction ("the dying pillow" trope) and disconnection, to the neglect of a counter, Indigenous view of a rich, Indigenous postcontact history of emplaced cultural vitality and dynamism. In this sense, missions cannot and should not be reduced to institutional spaces, but recognised as personal places that have been and continue to be socially and culturally experienced. This thesis, therefore, attempts to investigate these "other" narratives of mission and reserve-based entanglements; that is, it aims to depart from narratives highlighting rupture and control, toward an analysis that explores and traces themes that transcend and connect. I attempt to do so archaeologically through the perspective of "biography", and in particular, the biographies of "traditional" Mualgal objects and places as they became involved in new sets of social relations and political fields, taking on new kinds of cultural relevance. In tracing the biographies of Mualgal things through time, I argue that the histories of Totalai and <b>Poid</b> involve histories of both loss and regeneration, of colonial relationships and ancestral entanglements, and of displacement and emplacement in complex iterations that link Mualgal people today with Mualgal people as they once were...|$|R
