40|$|The pulling-into-step {{transients}} of a syncllronous motor {{are represented}} by a secondorder ordinary nonlinear differential equation. Already H. E. Edgerton has given formulae for critical conditions of the pulling-into-step by the differential analyzer. But these formulae are not accurate enough. Then using a phase plane method, this paper dealt sufficiently with the effect of saliency, and calculated the conditions exactly by dint of a digital computer. Consequently, we obtained {{the conclusion that the}} phase plane equations are classified into two cases according to the relatability of the coefficients; i. e. a whether a limit cycle exists or not. When a limit cycle exists in a phase plane, the longitudinal mean value is equal to the value of the rate of β to κ. In addition, the relations of β to critical κ under the condition where b and g are parameters, are as follows : 1) The curve of it is illustrated by the saturated one, which is considerahly different from the Edgerton’s curve. 2) The influence of g upon the curve is larger, that of b is smaller.

40|$|In this paper, the {{capability}} to use unstandard gears and their effect {{on the performance of}} the gear pumps are investigated. These effects include pump flow rate, trapped volume between two meshing gears, and <b>pulsation</b> flow rate <b>factor.</b> Equations for the pump flow rate are derived and a computer program has been written to evaluate all parameters and performance. The gear used in this work is unstandard one with correction factor of (+ 0. 5). The simulation results showed that the theoretical flow rate increases when unstandard gears are used.

A {{logistic regression analysis}} was performed {{to determine whether or}} not the decrease in arterial pulse amplitude during FMD remained a predictor of IHD even after adjustment for age, FMD, the value of arterial <b>pulsation,</b> coronary risk <b>factors,</b> and sex. The results of comparison are represented as box plots (middle hash of the box indicating the median; 25 th– 75 th percentiles represented by end caps of the box; whiskers extend to the last observed value).

Data analyses were performed using the PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and JMP Pro 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) software packages.|$|R
40|$|Simple {{converter}} structure, inherent {{short-circuit protection}} and regenerative capability {{are the most}} important advantages of current-source inverters (CSI’s) which have made them suitable for medium-voltage high-power drives. Usually in grid-connected gas turbine generators or pumped storage hydro power plants, efficient and reliable current-source load-commutated inverters (LCI’s) with thyristor switches are employed. Also, this type of CSI is widely used in very large drives with power ratings of tens of megawatts to supply wound-field synchronous motors (WFSM’s). However, LCI’s suffer from some disadvantages such as large torque <b>pulsations,</b> poor power <b>factor,</b> and start-up criticalities. In this paper, a novel multilevel-based CSI is proposed. The proposed converter consists of one LCI and one CSI bridge with self-turn-off switches along with a voltage clamping circuit. The CSI switches are forced commutated; hence, a voltage clamping circuit is employed to limit voltage spikes caused by current variations in inductive paths during commutation transients. Drastic reduction in harmonic distortion of stator current and improved fundamental power factor are achieved by the proposed topology. In addition, torque pulsations are reduced remarkably for normal and starting operating conditions. Comprehensive analysis of the proposed structure is presented and the design of converter components is elaborated. ...|$|R
40|$|Using the NORSTAR {{riometer}} and CANOPUS magnetometer arrays we {{have investigated}} the modulation of high energy electron precipitation by ULF waves in the Pc 5 frequency band. We conducted two separate studies of Pc 5 activity in the riometers. The first is an independent survey of three riometer stations in the Churchill line (one at each sub-auroral, auroral, and typical polar cap boundary latitudes) in which we identified all riometer Pc 5 -band pulsations over 11 years. All had a corresponding magnetometer pulsation implying that a magnetic pulsation, is {{a necessary condition for}} a riometer pulsation (in the Pc 5 Band). We find seasonal and latitude dependencies in the occurrence of riometer <b>pulsations.</b> By a <b>factor</b> of two, there are more riometer pulsations occurring in the fall-winter than the spring-summer. At higher latitudes there is a tendency towards noon pulsations during the spring-summer, suggesting that the criteria for riometer pulsations is affected by the dipole tilt. Our second study was based on the previous magnetometer study of Baker et al.  (2003). Using the database of Pc 5 activity from that study we were able to select the riometer Pc 5 pulsations which adhere to the strict Pc 5 definition in the magnetometer. We find that roughly 95...|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian Network Code FIKS {{from the}} Norwegian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Statnett, states that {{synchronous}} generators ≥ 25 MVA {{must have a}} static excitation system. It also includes requirements on the step time response and the available field winding ceiling voltage of the excitation system. An improved brushless excitation system is in operation in some pilot power plants. A rotating thyristor bridge is controlled via Bluetooth. The step time response is as fast as conventional static excitation systems. However, a ceiling voltage factor of 2 requires the thyristor bridge to operate at firing angles about 60 degrees. High torque <b>pulsations,</b> low power <b>factor</b> and low utilization of the exciter is the end result. New power electronic interfaces on the shaft results in a betterutilization of the designed exciter and improves the mechanical performance {{as well as the}} controllability of the generator field winding. Permanent magnet rotating exciters increase the field forcing strength of the synchronous generator, yielding improved transient stability (Fault Ride-Through req.). Brushless exciters also reduces regular maintenance of the generator. The thesis includes experiments on a state of the art synchronous generator test setup including constructed PM exciter and different power electronic solutions. Some investigations has been done on industrial power plants as well...|$|R

Our second study was based on the previous magnetometer study of Baker et al. (2003). Using the database of Pc 5 activity from that study we were able to select the riometer Pc 5 pulsations which adhere to the strict Pc 5 definition in the magnetometer. We find that roughly 95 % of the riometer pulsations occurred in the morning sector compared to 70 % in the magnetometer. Given a magnetometer pulsation at Gillam in the morning sector, there is a 70 % chance of there being a corresponding riometer pulsation. The morning sector probabilities at Rankin (geomagnetic (PACE) latitude 74 °) and Pinawa (61 °) are 3 % and 5 %, respectively. These statistics suggest there is a localized region in the pre-noon magnetosphere where Pc 5 band ULF activity can modulate high energy electron precipitation. We also find that riometer pulsations display a K p selection towards mid (i. e. 3 ? 4) activity levels which mimics the product of the K p dependence of high-energy electron fluxes on the dawn side (from CRRES) and all magnetic Pc 5 activity. A superposed epoch analysis revealed that the elevated electron flux needed to produce a riometer pulsation is most likely provided by substorm injections on the nightside. We also find that the amplitude of modulated precipitation correlates well with the product of the background absorption and the magnetic pulsation amplitude, again leading to the idea that a riometer pulsation needs both favorable magnetospheric electron flux conditions and large enough magnetic Pc 5 wave activity. We further separate our pulsations into field line resonances (FLRs), and non-field line resonances (non-FLRs), as identified in the Baker et al. (2003) survey. We find that FLRs are more efficient at modulating particle precipitation, and non-FLRs display an amplitude cutoff below which they do not interact with the high energy electron population. We conclude that the high energy electron precipitation associated with Pc 5 pulsations is caused by pitch angle scattering (diffusion) rather than parallel acceleration. We suggest two future studies that are natural extensions of this one. Keywords. Energetic Particles/Precipitating; Wave-Particle Interactions; Auroral Phenomen...|$|R
