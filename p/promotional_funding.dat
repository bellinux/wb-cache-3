An artistic director also functions as a resource for the directors who are working to mount productions at the theatre and can provide support, counsel, and/or artistic input where requested. The artistic director may be called to assume the production should the director become unable to complete his/her duties. Artistic directors are frequently regarded as the artistic representatives of theatre companies and are often required to speak about their theatre to the press.

40|$|This study {{presents}} organizational {{regulations for}} {{the execution of}} research and development projects, the concept of scientific-technical tasking, and the engineering design for a low-speed axial-flow compressor test stand of large dimensions. The test stand is to be installed at Dresden in the former gas turbine test hall of KAB AG. The axial-flow compressor test stand is to meet the requirements of three points-of-main-effort: 1. Research of complex phenomena in compressor aerodynamics; 2. Verification of numerical schemes; 3. Testing of new design concepts for compressor blades. The operational unit will be financed largely from third party <b>funds</b> through <b>promotional</b> projects and industry contracts; it is also available for university research and teaching purposes. The State of Lower Saxony is actively supporting the project and has agreed to allocate <b>promotional</b> <b>funds.</b> The industry firms MTU, ABB Baden and BMW/Rolls-Royce have decided in a Memorandum of Understanding with binding force the kind of cooperation and financial support to be provided to the TU Dresden for installation of the compressor. A cooperation agreement with the Institute for Propulsion Technology of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), Cologne, represents technical support to the TU Dresden in matters of measuring technique. Initially, the compressor will be equipped with conventional measuring instruments permitting not only measurements of performance map data and stage characteristics but also of the three-dimensional flow in the absolute system. An extension to measurements in the rotating system has already been taken into account in the design. Depending on the scientific task, special measurement methods will be applied later, including laser anemometry, boundary-layer probes, and unsteady measuring techniques.

Water samples were collected in Spring 2008 from the Jiaozhou Bay and its adjacent area and fractionated into total dissolved (< 0. 45 mu m), colloidal (10 kDa- 0. 45 mu m) and cutoff (< 10 kDa) fractions with the cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFF) system. The excitation-emission-matrix (EEM) spectral properties, the absorbance values at 254 nm (A(254)) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the DOM were observed having the colloidal ratios of 8. 7 %, 6. 2 %, and 2. 2 %, respectively, and exhibiting a decreasing trend. Total dissolved carbohydrates (TCHO) and total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA) comprised 24 % of the bulk DOC. Among them, the free monosaccharides (MCHO) and dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA were the major fractions, followed by polysaccharides (PCHO) and dissolved free amino acids (DFAA). Colloidal TCHO and THAA concentrations were 3. 2 mu M C and 0. 3 mu M, respectively. They comprised similar to 35 % of the colloid organic carbon (COC), among which PCHO and DCAA were the dominating fractions.

Adding the goal of being active into the model made age and activity level no longer significant but gender and education remained significant factors.

40|$|In low-income countries, {{the use of}} tax {{revenues}} to fund tourism promotions is motivated {{in part by the}} belief that tourism growth will improve income distribution by expanding demand for relatively low-skilled labor. We examine this belief for the case of Thailand, a highly tourism-intensive economy, using a new and specifically designed applied general equilibrium model. Thailand's tourism boom, fueled in part by a series of publicly <b>funded</b> <b>promotional</b> campaigns, has coincided with a period of worsening inequality. We find that growth of inbound tourism demand raises aggregate household income, but worsens its distribution. This is because tourism sectors are not especially labor-intensive in the Thai context, and because the expansion of foreign tourism demand creates general equilibrium effects that undermine profitability in tradable sectors (such as agriculture) from which the poor derive a substantial fraction of their income. These results indicate that tourism growth is not a panacea for other goals of development policy; to address inequality, additional policy instruments are required. We explore this implication with the example of a lump-sum tax imposed at different rates for rich and poor households. In addition, we examine the robustness of our main results with respect to alternative factor market assumptions relevant to the Thai economy.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{examines}} {{different strategies}} in providing {{free access to}} online scholarly chemical publications. The scope of accessibility {{is illustrated by the}} analysis of the content dynamics in the directory Free Full-Text Journals in Chemistry that comprises links to online journals with at least one-year free content. Two snapshots taken in 2004 and 2005 have shown that about half of the journals increased amount of their free content, mainly by addition of current issues in 2004 - 2005. In most cases, URLs of the sources were stable through the period investigated. Only 5 % of journals disappeared from the Web or became fully paid. A recent report [1] composed on behalf of the European Commission examines the scientific publication system in Europe. The report confirms the essential role of digital journals and emphasizes the need for a wider public access to the electronic primary literature. In this paper we analyse the scope and tendencies in accessibility of chemistry journals from the user's point of view. The main user’s criterion for the accessibility is &quot;free vs. paid&quot;, while the sources of free access are different (Open Access initiative, publisher's <b>promotional</b> strategy, government's <b>funding,</b> etc.). A reader can presently retrieve a lot of free peer-reviewed journals from the Web. Researchers in life sciences are in the most favourable position.

Methods used in this study entail purposive sampling for nomination of the departments’ directors and chief planners, simple random sampling for selection of ministry’ officers. Data were collected through interview guide for directors and chief planners while questionnaires for ordinary officers. Study findings revealed that 77. 5 percent of the respondents do not implement performance appraisal system and 73. 8 percent never perform scheme of service. The findings also disclosed 72. 5 percent of the employees were not promoted. Also employees responded that their institution by 78. 8 percent do not allocate fund for promotion purpose.
