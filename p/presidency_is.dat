5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E
5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's vice <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> most {{remembered for}} a {{leadership}} crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because {{of their personal}} dislike for him, Wilson's advisers and wife Edith sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president's condition {{to prevent him from}} assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and Congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume the presidency for fear of setting a precedent. Without strong leadership in the executive branch, the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and effectively returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall is also the only known Vice President of the United States to have been exclusively targeted in an assassination attempt while in office.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Texas {{separated}} from Mexico in 1836; Tyler, {{a firm believer}} in manifest destiny, saw its annexation as providing an economic advantage to the United States, and worked diligently to make it happen. He initially sought election to a full term as president, but after failing to gain the support of either Whigs or Democrats, he withdrew in support of Democrat James K. Polk, who favored annexation. Polk won the election, and Tyler signed a bill to annex Texas three days before leaving office. Under Polk, the process was completed. After the American Civil War began in 1861, Tyler won election to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death. Although some have praised Tyler's political resolve, his <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> generally held in low regard by historians. He is considered an obscure president, with little presence in American cultural memory.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} <b>Presidency</b> <b>is</b> {{administrative}} and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising {{the work of the}} Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of COREPER and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence {{in the work of the}} Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.|$|E

It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the President of the European Union. The presidency's function is to chair meetings of the Council, determine its agendas, set a work programme and facilitate dialogue both at Council meetings and with other EU institutions. The <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> currently (as of July 2017) held by Estonia.|$|E

At the same time, nascent democratic institutions withered, opposition and labor activities were suppressed, and national interests at times were sacrificed to benefit supporters and relatives of Carías or major foreign interests.|$|E

25|$|The Presidency of the Church (commonly {{called the}} First <b>Presidency)</b> <b>is</b> a quorum {{consisting}} {{of at least}} one apostle (the President of the Church) and two or more high priests.

The Presidency of the Church presides over the entire church, and only the President of the Church is authorized to use all priesthood keys within the church. The members of this quorum are usually the President of the Church and his first and second counselors. The First Presidency may be expanded to allow for additional counselors, when needed.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{political}} {{leader of the}} state was Josip Broz Tito, but there were several other important politicians, particularly after Tito's death: see the list of leaders of communist Yugoslavia. In 1974, Tito was proclaimed President-for-life of Yugoslavia. After Tito's death in 1980, the single position of president was divided into a collective Presidency, where representatives of each republic would essentially form a committee where the concerns of each republic would be addressed and from it, collective federal policy goals and objectives would be implemented. The head of the collective <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> rotated between representatives of the different republics. The head of the collective <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> considered {{the head of state}} of Yugoslavia. The collective <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> ended in 1991, as Yugoslavia fell apart.|$|R
