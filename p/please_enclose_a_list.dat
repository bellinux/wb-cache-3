Her marriage with the Viscount Radnor was celebrated very quietly on page 231. (We <b>enclose</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of the principal churches in London.)

After the ceremony the old trustee took Lord and Lady Radnor to a small wedding breakfast at <b>an</b> hotel (we <b>enclose</b> <b>a</b> <b>list).</b> During the breakfast a sudden faintness (for which we had been watching for ten pages) overcame him. He sank back in his chair, gasping. Lord and Lady Radnor rushed to him and sought in vain to tighten his necktie.
