25|$|Arthur Janov's primal therapy, {{which has}} been an {{influential}} post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapy</b> in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, {{he does not have}} a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it. Janov writes in The Primal Scream (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Techniques used in {{conversion}} therapy {{prior to}} 1981 in the United States and Western Europe included ice-pick lobotomies; chemical castration with hormonal treatment; aversive treatments, such as [...] "the application of electric {{shock to the}} hands and/or genitals"; [...] "nausea-inducing drugs ... administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli"; and masturbatory reconditioning. More recent clinical techniques used in the United States have been limited to counseling, visualization, social skills training, <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapy,</b> and spiritual interventions such as [...] "prayer and group support and pressure", though there are some reports of aversive treatments through unlicensed practice {{as late as the}} 1990s.

2500|$|In his {{influential}} book, Client-Centered Therapy, {{in which}} he presented the client-centered approach to therapeutic change, psychologist Carl Rogers proposed there are three necessary and sufficient conditions for personal change: unconditional positive regard, accurate empathy, and genuineness. Rogers believed {{the presence of these}} three items in the therapeutic relationship could help an individual overcome any troublesome issue, including alcohol abuse. To this end, a 1957 study compared the relative effectiveness of three different psychotherapies in treating alcoholics who had been committed to a state hospital for sixty days: a therapy based on two-factor learning theory, client-centered therapy, and <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Though the authors expected the two-factor theory to be the most effective, it actually proved to be deleterious in outcome. Surprisingly, client-centered therapy proved most effective. It has been argued, however, these findings may be attributable to the profound difference in therapist outlook between the two-factor and client-centered approaches, rather than to client-centered techniques per se. The authors note two-factor theory involves stark disapproval of the clients' [...] "irrational behavior" [...] (p.350); this notably negative outlook could explain the results.|$|E
2500|$|Transference-focused {{psychotherapy}} (TFP) {{is a form}} of <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapy</b> {{dating to}} the 1960s, rooted in the conceptions of Otto Kernberg on BPD and its underlying structure (borderline personality organization). Unlike in the case of traditional psychoanalysis, the therapist plays a very active role in TFP. In session the therapist works on the relationship between the patient and the therapist. The main focus is on the patient's emotions concerning their relationship with the therapist and the therapist's use of psychodynamic techniques (e.g., interpretation). The therapist will try to explore and clarify aspects of this relationship so the underlying object relations dyads become clear. Some limited research on TFP suggests it may reduce some symptoms of BPD by affecting certain underlying processes, and that TFP in comparison to dialectical behavioral therapy and supportive therapy results in increased reflective functioning (the ability to realistically think about how others think) and a more secure attachment style. [...] Furthermore, TFP {{has been shown to be}} as effective as DBT in improvement of suicidal behavior, and has been more effective than DBT in alleviating anger and in reducing verbal or direct assaultive behavior. Limited research suggests that TFP appears to be less effective than schema-focused therapy, while being more effective than no treatment.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the precarious position of psychoanalysis, a therapeutic approach which historically has defined itself by freedom from constraint and counted treatment length {{not in terms}} of number of sessions but in terms of years, in today's era of empirically validated treatments and brief structured interventions. The evidence that exists for the effectiveness of psychoanalysis as a treatment for psychological disorder is reviewed. The evidence base is significant and growing, but less than might meet criteria for an empirically based therapy. The author goes on to argue that the absence of evidence may be symptomatic of the epistemic difficulties that psychoanalysis faces in the context of 21 st century psychiatry, and examines some of the philosophical problems faced by psychoanalysis as a model of the mind. Finally some changes necessary in order to ensure a future for psychoanalysis and <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapies</b> within psychiatry are suggested...|$|R

5000|$|Schema therapy blends CBT with {{elements}} of Gestalt therapy, object relations, constructivist and <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapies</b> {{in order to}} treat the characterological difficulties which both constitute personality disorders and which underlie many of the chronic depressive or anxiety-involving symptoms which present in the clinic. Young said that CBT may be an effective treatment for presenting symptoms, but without the conceptual or clinical resources for tackling the underlying structures (maladaptive schemata) which consistently organize the patient's experience, the patient is likely to lapse back into unhelpful modes of relating to others and attempting to meet their needs. Young focused on pulling from different therapies equally when developing schema therapy. The difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and schema therapy is the latter [...] "emphasizes lifelong patterns, affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with special emphasis on limited reparenting". He recommended this therapy would be ideal for clients with difficult and chronic psychological disorders. Some examples would be eating disorders, personality disorders and criminal offenders. He has also had success with this therapy in relation to depression and substance abuse.|$|R

People with this disorder are compelled to steal things, generally things of little or no value. This disorder usually begins during puberty and usually last until late adulthood; in some cases lasts throughout the person's life.

Individuals with the disorder are usually referred for treatment due to the comorbid psychiatric complaints rather than kleptomanic behaviour per se.

A wide variety of therapeutic strategies have been proposed for its treatment, among them psychoanalytic oriented psychotherapy, behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. Some medications that are used for people diagnosed with kleptomania are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers and opioid antagonists. There is evidence from numerous case studies that a variety of cognitive behavioral therapy techniques are effective in the treatment of kleptomania and it is favored over other approaches such as psychodynamic and <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapies.</b> Studies to date suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy when used in combination with medication, is more effective than medication alone...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} homosexuals who want to change their sexual orientation. It is noted that many ego-dystonic homosexuals who want to become heterosexual, despite e ncouragement from psychotherapists to accept their homosexuality, are turning to self-help groups {{in an effort to}} change their sexual orientation. Studies that have attempted to change sexual orientation are reviewed in this paper. Problems with defining and measuring change in sexual orientation are considered and the importance of therapies for changing sexual orientation is discussed. Studies involving <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapies</b> are reviewed. Several studies on behavior therapies are examined, including studies of aversion therapy, classical conditioning, and systematic desensitization. Studies dealing with group therapy are discussed under the headings of heterogeneous groups, homogeneous groups, and self-help groups. Problems associated with each type of therapy are noted. The paper concludes that studies in which changes in sexual orientation seem most complete involve a change in lifestyle whereby the person takes on a new social and sexual identity. It is asserted that psychotherapists can offer better help to homosexuals desiring to change their sexual orientation as aspects of sexual identity and lifestyle are more fully addressed.

40|$|Background: There is {{a gap in}} the {{research}} literature on the effectiveness of long-term <b>psychoanalytic</b> <b>therapies</b> (LPT). Aim: To present a systematic review of studies dealing with LPT effectiveness and published from 1970 onward. Methods: A systematic literature search for studies dealing with the effectiveness of individual LPT in ambulatory, adult patients. Data about the overall effectiveness of LPT, its impact on symptom reduction, and its effect on personality changes were pooled both at treatment termination and at follow-up, using effect sizes (ESs) and success rates. Results: We found 27 studies (n = 5063). Psychotherapy yielded large mean ESs (0. 78 at termination; 0. 94 at follow-up) and high mean overall success rates (64 % at termination; 55 % at follow-up) in moderate/mixed pathology. The mean ES was larger for symptom reduction (1. 03) than for personality change (0. 54). In severe pathology, the results were similar. Psychoanalysis achieved large mean ESs (0. 87 at termination; 1. 18 at follow-up) and high mean overall success rates (71 % at termination; 54 % at follow-up) in moderate pathology. The mean ES for symptom reduction was larger (1. 38) than for personality change (0. 76). Conclusion: Our data suggest that LPT is effective treatment for a large range of pathologies, with moderate to large effects. (HARV REV PSYCHIATRY 2009; 17 : 1 – 23. ...|$|R
