50|$|<b>Pramocaine</b> (INN and BAN, {{also known}} as pramoxine or pramoxine HCI) is a topical {{anesthetic}} discovered at Abbott Laboratories in 1953 and used as an antipruritic. During research and development, <b>pramocaine</b> hydrochloride stood out among a series of alkoxy aryl alkamine ethers as an especially good topical local anesthetic agent. Pharmacologic study revealed it to be potent and of low acute and subacute toxicity, well tolerated by most mucous membranes and of a low sensitizing index in humans. Like other local anesthetics, <b>pramocaine</b> decreases the permeability of neuronal membranes to sodium ions, blocking both initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. Depolarization and repolarization of excitable neural membranes is thus inhibited, leading to numbness.|$|E
50|$|Topical anesthetics {{are used}} to relieve pain and itching caused by {{conditions}} such as sunburn or other minor burns, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and minor cuts and scratches. The popular itch creams Gold Bond and some forms of calamine lotion use <b>pramocaine</b> hydrochloride to numb sensitive skin, as does the pain relief variant of Neosporin and some formulations of Sarna. The hydrochloride salt form of <b>pramocaine</b> is water-soluble.|$|E
40|$|Interactions between bovine {{and goat}} β-lactoglobulin and {{tetracaine}} and <b>pramocaine</b> were investigated with isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography and molecular modelling. Tetracaine and <b>pramocaine</b> binding to lactoglobulin is an entropy driven endothermic reaction. In this work, {{we found that}} determined association constants and thermodynamic parameters indicate that <b>pramocaine</b> has a higher affinity to lactoglobulin than tetracaine. Crystal structures that were determined with resolutions {{in the range from}} 1. 90 to 2. 30 Å revealed in each case the presence of a single drug molecule bound in the β-barrel in a mode similar to that observed for 14 - and 16 -carbon fatty acids. The position of the ligand in the β-barrel indicates the optimal fit of 6 -carbon aromatic rings to the binding pocket and the major role of hydrophobic interactions in ligand binding. Calculations of tetracaine and <b>pramocaine</b> docking to lactoglobulin revealed that molecular modelling overestimated the role of polar protein–drug interactions...|$|E
