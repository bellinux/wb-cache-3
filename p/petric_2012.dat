Incorporation and integration may refer to paraphrasing and summarizing (Lee, 2010) or perhaps quoting in ways that require syntactic manipulation of the cited text (<b>Petrić,</b> <b>2012).</b> Moreover, Lee (2010) found that higher-scoring texts that maintained authorial voice were not crowded with other source’s ideas or words. The student writers also used sources to advance their own arguments without closing down the conversation with the reader. Student texts receiving low grades (typically Cs or Ds) did not integrate their sources in such a matter and tended to not only populate their texts with more direct quotes but also used sources in a less cohesive, woven manner, which Swales (2014) calls “parenthetical plonking” (p. 135), in which a cited source is put in a text but not discussed or framed.|$|E

Unless managed properly, agro-industrial waste may pose both environmental and health problems (Sharma et al. 1997). For example, Abu Qdais and Alshraideh (2016) reported that there are 118 olive oil mills in Jordan producing annually about 35, 561 tons of solid waste from the olive oil industry. Deterioration of natural water bodies due to olive oil mill wastes is a serious problem as reported by Azbar (2004) and Alburquerque et al. (2006). In contrast, composting and/or co-composting of organic wastes is considered as an effective component in any integrated waste management strategy (Bari and Koenig 2002), and considered as an environmentally friendly option for treatment of such wastes (Korner et al. 2003). The term “composting” refers to the controlled decomposition and stabilization of organic wastes by biological means under aerobic conditions (Dees and Ghiorse 2001; Paredes et al. 1996). Co-composting, however, is the simultaneous composting of two or more types of waste material (Das et al. 2011; <b>Petric</b> et al. <b>2012),</b> with the potential added benefit of enhancing end compost quality (Paredes et al. 1996).|$|R
