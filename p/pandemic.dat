5|$|A <b>pandemic</b> is a {{worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu <b>pandemic,</b> which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza <b>pandemic</b> {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this <b>pandemic</b> was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of <b>pandemic</b> {{influenza}} deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu <b>pandemic,</b> known as the Russian flu.|$|E
40|$|A {{correlation}} between the incidence of influenza <b>pandemics</b> and increased cosmic ray activity is made. A correlation is also made between the occurrence of these <b>pandemics</b> {{and the appearance of}} bright novae, e. g., Nova Eta Car.

25|$|Flu <b>pandemics</b> {{typically}} come in waves. The 1889–1890 and 1918–1919 flu <b>pandemics</b> each came {{in three}} or four waves of increasing lethality. But within a wave, mortality was greater {{at the beginning of the}} wave.|$|R

5|$|In 1957 {{another new}} {{strain of the}} virus emerged and caused a <b>pandemic</b> of Asian flu; {{although}} the virus was not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next <b>pandemic</b> occurred when Hong Kong flu emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 <b>pandemic</b> was the least severe, but 33,800 {{were killed in the}} US. New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 film Outbreak, the 2011 film Contagion and the 2013 film World War Z make {{reference}} to the <b>pandemic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of the <b>pandemic</b> and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which most had initially expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years {{by the time the}} <b>pandemic</b> struck. This left little time for the disease to {{have a significant impact on}} the economy.|$|E
25|$|Deaths in India between 1817 and 1860, in {{the first}} three <b>pandemics</b> of the nineteenth century, are {{estimated}} to have exceeded 15million people. Another 23million died between 1865 and 1917, during the next three <b>pandemics.</b> Cholera deaths in the Russian Empire during a similar time period exceeded 2million.|$|R
50|$|Mortality {{displacement}} denotes {{a temporal}} or temporary {{increase in the}} mortality rate (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as excess mortality or excess mortality rate. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as heat waves, s, epidemics and <b>pandemics,</b> especially influenza <b>pandemics,</b> famine or war.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to combine three topics - international migration, poverty, and <b>pandemics</b> - in the context of public policy formulation at the national level. I revise the literature and put together historical evidence. First of all, I discuss international migration; second, I emphasize the role of geography, development, and poverty; and finally I argue about <b>pandemics.</b> The three topics are brought together at the concluding remarks. Regarding international migration, I point to the importance of internal regulation of the Brazilian emigration process and bilateral agreements. In the case of poverty, the regional perspective points to the limits of external help, the role of good institutions, and the importance of investments in health. In terms of <b>pandemics,</b> international cooperation helps prevent and battle epidemics. migration; poverty; <b>pandemics...</b>|$|R

Sadasivan acted as Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts from 30 May 2006 to 31 March 2008. In May 2007, he was appointed Chairman of the WHO Executive Board, the first time a Singaporean had been so elected since the nation became a member of WHO. During his term, he dealt with issues such as global health development, <b>pandemic</b> preparedness (including the 2009 H1N1 flu <b>pandemic),</b> non-communicable diseases and climate change.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu <b>pandemic,</b> and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human <b>pandemic</b> preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe {{suffered}} occasional {{outbreaks of}} acute diseases (such as plague in 1994). The gains {{on the national}} health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s, {{the impact of the}} HIV/AIDS <b>pandemic</b> and the economic crisis since the year 2000. In 2006, Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies in the world according to UN figure – 44 for men and 43 for women, down from 60 in 1990, but this has since recovered to 53 and 54 respectively. The rapid drop was ascribed mainly to the HIV/AIDS <b>pandemic.</b> Infant mortality rose from 6% in the late 1990s to 12.3% by 2004. By 2014 HIV/AIDS prevalence had been reduced to 15% compared to 40% in 1998.|$|E
