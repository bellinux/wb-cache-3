40|$|Abstract: Over {{a period}} of few years, <b>Pepino</b> <b>mosaic</b> <b>virus</b> (PepMV) {{has become one of}} the most impor-tant viral {{pathogen}} in tomato production worldwide. So far, five PepMV genotypes (EU, LP, CH 2, US 2 and US 1) have been detected. A real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure, using the fluorescence dye SYBR Green was developed for a rapid and reliable de-tection of genetically diverse <b>Pepino</b> <b>mosaic</b> <b>virus</b> isolates. This procedure was used for the detection and identification of PepMV in both Solanum lycopersicum and Nicotiana benthamiana species. The melting temperature (Tm) for members of a particular strain was very similar, with a host effect that did not hinder strain identification. Under optimal reaction conditions, sensitivity of the detection was as low as 100 fg of viral RNA from infected plants. This level of sensitivity indicated that the real time RT-PCR developed in the present study could be used for routine plant health assays.

Among cultivated Solanaceae, eggplant but not pepper or potato were found to be susceptible to PepMV-To. The virus was detected by serology in tomato seeds but it was not seed transmissible to 50 seedlings; it was easi-ly purified by a new procedure, and polyclonal antisera were produced. In tomato and other hosts the virus was efficiently detected by different ELISA procedures and by a quick field immunochromatographic system based on lateral flow, with 100 % correlation between DAS ELISA and this new technique.
