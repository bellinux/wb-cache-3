50|$|A <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>device</b> (PLD) is an {{electronic}} component {{used to build}} reconfigurable digital circuits.

5000|$|Another {{key benefit}} of using PLDs is {{that during the}} design phase {{customers}} can change the circuitry {{as often as they}} want until the design operates to their satisfaction.

Once the design is final, customers can go into immediate production by simply programming as many PLDs as they need with the final software design file.
