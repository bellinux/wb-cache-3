5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes, that is, telescopes that use a <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the <b>primary</b> <b>mirror,</b> the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead.|$|E

25|$|The flawed <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> of the Hubble Space Telescope was {{ground and}} {{polished}} in Danbury by Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit from 1979 to 1981.

The effects of the flaw were corrected during the telescope's first servicing mission in 1993.|$|E

These include the New Technology Telescope, an early pioneer in the use of active optics, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which consists of four individual telescopes, each with a <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> 8.2-metre across, and four smaller auxiliary telescopes. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array observes the universe in the millimetre and submillimetre wavelength ranges, and is the world's largest ground-based astronomy project to date.

The BSF is the primary load-bearing structure during launch and the PMBSS holds the telescope's main instruments, including its mirrors. The BSF was designed and manufactured at ATK's facilities in Magna, Utah. ATK designed and fabricated more than 10,000 parts for the PMBSS. PMBSS is made primarily of lightweight graphite, but numerous other materials including invar, titanium, and other composite materials were used.|$|E

25|$|Since {{speculum}} metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors {{greatly reduced}} {{the light that}} reached the eyepiece, several reflecting telescope designers tried {{to do away with}} them. In 1762 Mikhail Lomonosov presented a reflecting telescope before the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. It had its <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted {{at the front of the}} telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by William Herschel.|$|E
25|$|Since the Newtonian {{reflector}} is {{the most}} common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of the <b>primary</b> <b>mirror.</b> The mirror has to be carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a paraboloid. Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape are surprisingly simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a polishing pitch lap made from a type of tree sap. Through a whole series of random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired paraboloidal shape.|$|E

The mirror blank was produced in 1969 {{as one of a}} set of four, along with those for the AAT, CFHT and Blanco telescopes, and was purchased for the WHT in 1979, ten years after it was made. The primary is solid and un-thinned, so no active optics system is required, despite its weight of [...] The mirror support cell holds the main mirror on a set of 60 pneumatic cylinders. Even under the most extreme loading (with the telescope pointing at the horizon, so the mirror is vertical) the shape of the mirror changes by only during normal operation the deformation is much smaller.|$|E

The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that the centre of rotation is [...] above ground level, which lifts the telescope above ground-layer air turbulence for better seeing. A conventional up-down 6m-wide shutter with wind-blind, several large vents with extractor fans for thermal control, and a [...] capacity crane (used for moving the <b>primary</b> <b>mirror</b> e.g. for aluminising) are all incorporated. The {{size and shape of}} the shutter allow observations down to 12° above the horizon, which corresponds to an airmass of 4.8. The total moving mass of the dome is , which is mounted on top of a three-storey cylindrical building. The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather. The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations (driven [...] down into the volcanic basalt), to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing.|$|E

Methods for optical design of large, optical telescopes with fast <b>primary</b> <b>mirrors</b> are presented in a systematic way. Three different approaches are outlined and commented.

For two-mirror designs, an analytical method has been derived, using aberration control based on Fermat’s principle. Intrinsic apodization for design of extremely fast <b>primary</b> <b>mirrors</b> is analyzed.
