25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (<b>polyisobutylene)</b> {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{rheology}} of {{high molecular}} weight, six-arm-star <b>polyisobutylenes</b> (PIB) was measured and {{compared to the}} behavior of linear PIB. The polymers had equivalent plateau moduli and conformed well in the terminal zone to the time-temperature superposition principle. Moreover, the temperature coefficients of the terminal relaxation times were identical for the star and linear polymers. Since the trans and gauche conformations in PIB have virtually the same energy, this absence of enhanced temperature sensitivity in star PIB, {{as well as the}} thermorheological simplicity, is consistent with an interpretation of the rheology of branched polymers based on an arm retraction mechanism...|$|R

To isolate the contribution of chain ends to the birefringence, the temperature of each experiment was adjusted to yield equivalent creep strains for each sample. Higher molecular weight PIB exhibited less change in the birefringence during creep, but the birefringence during recovery was independent of molecular weight. The sign of the birefringence during the stress-free recovery was opposite (i. e., corresponding to tension) to that during creep, even though the macroscopic deformation was compression...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the ceiling}} temperature, {{there will always}} be excess {{monomers}} in the polymer due to the equilibrium between polymerization and depolymerization. [...] Polymers derived from simple vinyl monomers have such high ceiling temperatures that only a [...] amount of monomers remain in the polymer at ordinary temperatures. [...] The situation for α-methylstyrene, PhC(Me)=CH2, is an exception to this trend. [...] Its ceiling temperature is around 66 °C. Steric hindrance is significant in polymers derived from α-methylstyrene because the phenyl and methyl groups are bonded to the same carbon. [...] These steric effects in combination with stability of the tertiary benzylic α-methylstyryl radical give α-methylstyrene its relatively low ceiling temperature. [...] When a polymer has a very high ceiling temperature, it degrades via bond cleavage reactions instead of depolymerization. A similar effect explains the relatively low ceiling temperature for <b>poly(isobutylene).</b>|$|E

Concentration-dependence of eta was very similar for all four polymer solutes, the increase of eta(c) at 3000 ppm being roughly four-fold (relative to Jet-A) for the L-series and five-fold for the B-series.

40|$|<b>Polyisobutylenes</b> (PIBs) with {{different}} end-groups including chlorine, exo - olefin, hydroxyl, and methyl prepared from aliphatic and aromatic initiators were studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Independently of the end-groups, {{presence or absence}} of aromatic initiator moiety, these PIB deriva- tives were capable of forming adduct ions with NO 3 – and Cl – ions, thus allowing the direct characterization of these compounds in the negative ion mode of ESI-MS. To obtain [PIB + NO 3] – and [PIB + Cl] – adduct ions with appreciable intensities, addition of polar solvents such as acetone, 2 -propanol, or ethanol to the dichloromethane solution of PIBs was necessary. Furthermore, increasing both the polarity (by in- creasing the acetone content) and the ion-source temperature give rise to enhanced intensities for both [PIB + NO 3] – and [PIB + Cl] – ions. Energy-dependent collision induced dissociation studies (CID) revealed that increasing the collision voltages resulted in the shift of the apparent molecular masses to higher ones. CID studies also showed that dissociation of the [PIB + Cl] – ions requires higher collision energy than that of [PIB + NO 3] –. In addition, Density Functional Theory calculations were performed to gain insights into the nature of the interactions between the highly non-polar PIB chains and anions NO 3 – and Cl – as well as to determine the zero-point corrected electronic energies for the formation of [PIB + NO 3] – and [PIB + Cl] – adduct ions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} weight on {{pressure sensitive adhesive}} properties was studied in a model system of commercial <b>polyisobutylenes</b> having a range of {{number average molecular weight}} 25, 000 to 750, 000. High and low molecular weight samples were blended to artificially create two series of broad distribution samples with polydispersities of 4 to 11. Characterization was done by size exclusion chromatography and membrane osmometry. ^ Adhesive performance was assessed for each homopolymer and blend by shear, peel and probe tack testing based on standardized test methods. In the homopolymer series, with an increase in molecular weight, 180 (DEGREES) peel and probe tack decrease to a constant level. Resistance to shear (or creep) passes through a maximum at a number average of 300, 000. While the broad distribution blends generally showed slight improvement over the homopolymer with similar number and weight average molecular weight, there was no conclusive evidence to suggest a relationship with increasing polydispersity. ^ Rheological properties were determined for the homopolymers and blends as a function of frequency. Established trends for molecular weight and frequency were observed in the homopolymer series. Among the blends, little difference in rheological properties was found. ^ The adhesive performance for the homopolymers and blends was linked with the rheological properties of the sample. Each adhesive test was modeled so that a rate of deformation could be calculated for comparison to rheological properties at similar frequencies. In probe tack testing, the ability of the sample to establish contact with the test surface is related to the tensile creep compliance at a time corresponding to probe dwell time. Tack values increase with increasing compliance. Once a sample has wet a surface, its ability to resist subsequent deformation was found to depend on the dissipation factor (G 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 /G 2 ̆ 7) in the homopolymer series. With increasing dissipation factor, there is increased peel and probe tack. The magnitude of the increase is test rate dependent. Resistance to shear (creep) increases sharply with an increase in complex viscosity. The lack of variation in rheological properties and adhesive performance of the blends made it impossible to make any positive conclusions regarding the influence of molecular weight distribution. ...|$|R
