Still, his father paid more than Mr. Tulliver did, and she meant him to feel that she behaved exceedingly well to him.

6000|$|The {{editor of}} {{familiar}} correspondence has {{at all times}} a difficult task before him in the choice what to give and what to withhold. In the case of Keats the difficulty is greater than in most, from the ferment of opposing elements and impulses in his nature, and from the extreme unreserve with which he lays himself open alike in his weakness and his strength. The other great letter-writers in English are men to some degree on their guard: men, if not of the world, at least of some worldly training and experience, and of characters in some degree formed and set. The phase of unlimited youthful expansiveness, of enthusiastic or fretful outcry, they have either escaped or left behind, and never give themselves away completely. Gray is of course an extreme case in point. With a masterly breadth of mind he unites an even finicking degree of academic fastidiousness and <b>personal</b> <b>reserve,</b> and his correspondence charms, not by impulse or openness, but by urbanity and irony, by ripeness of judgment and knowledge, by his playful kindliness towards the few intimates he has, and the sober wistfulness with which he looks out, from his Pisgah-height of universal culture, over regions of imaginative delight into which it was not given to him nor his contemporaries to enter fully. To take others differing most widely both as men and poets: Cowper, whether affectionately [...] "chatting and chirping" [...] to his cousin Lady Hesketh, or confiding his spiritual terrors to the Rev. John Newton, that unwise monitor who would not let them sleep,--Cowper is a letter-writer the most unaffected and sincere, but has nevertheless the degree of reticence natural to his breeding, {{as well as a}} touch of staidness and formality proper to his age. Byron offers an extreme contrast; unrestrained he is, but far indeed from being unaffected; the greatest attitudinist in literature as in life, and the most brilliant of all letter-writers after his fashion, with his wit, his wilfulness, his flash, his extraordinary unscrupulousness and resource, his vulgar pride of caste, his everlasting restlessness and egotism, his occasional true irradiations of the divine fire. Shelley, again--but he, as has been justly said, must have his singing robes about him to be quite truly Shelley, and in his correspondence is little more than any other amiable and enthusiastic gentleman and scholar on his travels. To the case of Keats, at any rate, none of these other distinguished letter-writers affords any close parallel. That admirable genius was from the social point of view an unformed lad in the flush and rawness of youth. His passion for beauty, his instinctive insight into the vital sources of imaginative delight in nature, in romance, and in antiquity, went along with perceptions painfully acute in matters of daily life, and nerves high-strung in the extreme. He was moreover almost incapable of artifice or disguise. Writing to his brothers and sister or to friends as dear, he is secret with them on one thing only, and that is his unlucky love-passion after he became a prey to it: for the rest he is open as the day, and keeps back nothing of what crosses his mind, nothing that vexes or jars on him or tries his patience. His character, as thus laid bare, contains elements of rare nobility and attraction--modesty, humour, sweetness, courage, impulsive disinterestedness, strong and tender family affection, the gift of righteous indignation, the gift of sober and strict self-knowledge. But it is only a character in the making. A strain of hereditary disease, lurking in his constitution from the first, was developed by over-exertion and aggravated by mischance, so that he never lived to be himself; and from about his twenty-fourth birthday his utterances are those of one struggling in vain against a hopeless distemper both of body and mind.|$|E

5000|$|Energy is {{required}} for almost everything in the game: weapons, vehicles and even the player's advanced movements. Autonomous mechanical defenses (so-called [...] "Deployables") consume the most energy. Without energy, registering the enemy's Artifacts as their own cannot be done. Each map {{has a number of}} Generators which can be hacked by each team to provide energy. There are two separate supplies of Energy a player is concerned with: their team's Energy supply (the tall blue bar to the extreme lower right of the HUD) and their personal Energy reserve (the short yellow bar to the immediate left of the team energy bar). The personal Energy reserve is depleted when performing any of the 'advanced' functions of the game; i.e. hacking an object, deploying a turret or a mine, healing a teammate or activating jump jets. Some things, however, draw directly from the team's energy reserve, such as deployed turrets, or driving or firing from a vehicle. The player's <b>personal</b> <b>reserve</b> is refilled from the team's energy bank; therefore, if every team member 'spends' their energy frivolously, the team will soon find itself without defenses, vehicles, or even a place to register stolen artifacts. For this reason, a player should handle their energy responsibly, at least until their team has enough Generators under its control to support multiple energy-intensive activities.|$|E

Previous studies have reported that personality traits predict and influence the course and treatment response of depression. The Temperament and Personality Questionnaire (T&P) assesses eight major constructs of personality traits observed in those who develop depression. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of T&P’s eight constructs on the treatment outcome of depressed patients. Patients and methods: A preliminary 6 -month prospective study was conducted with a sample of 51 adult patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) without remarkable psychomotor disturbance using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. All patients received comprehensive assessment including the T&P at baseline. We compared each T&P construct score between patients who achieved remission and those who did not achieve remission after 6  months of treatment for depression using both subjective and objective measures. All 51 (100 %) patients received the 6 -month follow-up assessment. Results: This study demonstrated that higher scores on T&P <b>personal</b> <b>reserve</b> predicted poorer treatment outcome in patients with MDD. Higher levels of <b>personal</b> <b>reserve,</b> rejection sensitivity, and self-criticism correlated with higher levels of depression. Higher levels of rejection sensitivity and self-criticism were associated with non-remitters; however, when we controlled for baseline depression severity, this relationship did not show significance. Conclusion: Although the results are preliminary, this study suggests that high scores on T&P <b>personal</b> <b>reserve</b> predict poorer treatment outcome and T&P rejection sensitivity and self-criticism correlate with the severity of depression. Longer follow-up studies with large sample sizes are required to improve the understanding of these relationships.

(2006) {{proposed}} {{a new approach}} to classify specific sub-types of non-melancholic depression caused by various stress factors and premorbid personality styles: the Temperament and Personality Questionnaire (T&P). The current study aim was to develop the Japanese version of the T&P and evaluate its reliability and validity. MethodsWe studied 114 patients with non-melancholic depression. Reliability was assessed using the test-retest method. Convergent validity of the T&P was compared with the clinician ratings of each patient for the eight personality traits. We also assessed the impact of depressive state on the T&P. ResultsThe test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients among eight constructs of the T&P ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 89, indicating good-to-excellent reliability. Anxious Worrying (rho= 0. 29), Perfectionism (rho= 0. 17), <b>Personal</b> <b>Reserve</b> (rho= 0. 18), Irritability (rho= 0. 38), and Social Avoidance (rho= 0. 32) showed adequate levels of convergent validity; Rejection Sensitivity (rho= 0. 16), Self-criticism (rho=− 0. 02), and Self-focus (rho= 0. 07) showed relatively weak convergent validity. Perfectionism (rho=− 0. 06), Social Avoidance (rho= 0. 17), Anxious Worrying (rho= 0. 40), <b>Personal</b> <b>Reserve</b> (rho= 0. 30), Irritability (rho= 0. 28), Rejection Sensitivity (rho= 0. 35), Self-criticism (rho= 0. 49), and Self-focus (rho= 0. 24) showed minimal sensitivity to mood state effects. LimitationsOnly one site was used. While a Likert scale was used, the clinician-rated personality trait measure had not been validated.
