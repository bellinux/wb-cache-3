50|$|Sternberger saw {{constitutional}} patriotism as a <b>protective</b> <b>means</b> {{to ensure}} political stability to maintain peace in Germany {{in the aftermath}} of the Second World War. He framed the concept as a way for citizens to identify with the democratic state in order that it could defend itself against internal and external threats. Thus, with the emphasis on state defense and protection, Sternberger linked constitutional patriotism to the concept of militant democracy. He drew on Aristotelianism, arguing that patriotism had traditionally not been linked to sentiments towards the nation. Constitutional patriotism is a development of Sternberger's earlier notion of Staatsfreundschaft (friendship towards the state).|$|E

Spongers put sea sponges on their snout as a <b>protective</b> <b>means</b> against abrasions from sharp objects, stingray barbs, or toxic organisms. The sponges also help the dolphins target fish without swim bladders, since echolocation cannot detect these fish easily against a complex background. Spongers also specifically forage in deep channels, but nonspongers are found foraging in both deep and shallow channels. This foraging behavior is mainly passed on from mother to child. Therefore, since this is a group behavior being passed down by social learning, this tool use is considered a cultural trait.|$|E

The possibility of occurrence of "highly dangerous infection disease is real in the CR and the health care system together with the integrated emergency system services have to be prepared, actually at the moment when a suspicion of its occurrence is pronounced by a competent person. The questions processed here relate to an assessment of the level of cooperation between the integrated emergency system services and further involved entities of South Bohemian region on dealing with this type of emergency situation that might occur in an air transport passenger. The thesis also deals with the issue of current provision of <b>protective</b> <b>means</b> needed for biological protection of the intervening services staff. Topicality of this issue in South Bohemian Region is among others given by the reconstruction of the South Bohemian Airport in České Budějovice, which is being prepared for international operation. And the development of travelling of people who use air transport to distant and exotic parts of the world where they might get infected and return back to the CR still in the incubation period using the quick air transport, {{is one of the reasons}} why this danger must not be underestimated. Personal interviews with representatives of the integrated emergency system services of the South Bohemia Region and related literary and information sources were used for obtaining data and information for the thesis. A tabling method was also used for organization of the data and the data were consequently subject to systemic and causal analysis. An outline of specific <b>protective</b> <b>means</b> available to the individual entities was formed within the analysis of current <b>protective</b> <b>means</b> specified for biological protection of intervening staff, and the outline was assessed in line with applicable European standards.

Methods: Our subjects included those visiting eight emergency departments from March 2009 to February 2010 after an injury with stable vital signs and without acute disease. Samples obtained were tested using the tetanus immunoglobulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The resultant tetanus antibody titers were analyzed. Results: The number of subjects enrolled was 462. The mean titer was 0. 09 ± 0. 14 IU/mL. Twenty-two percent of the subjects had a safe titer level (> 0. 1 IU/mL). Males and urban subjects had higher tetanus antibody titers than did females and suburban subjects. Subjects living in Incheon, Gangwon-do, Chungcheong-do, and Jeju-do had lower titers.

40|$|During recent {{transformations of}} Polish economy the foreign trade is {{supposed}} to answer a purpose of acting in favour of acceleration and lowering the costs of development. The diagnosis of the situation indicates a series of disquieting phenomenons such as disbalancing of commercial balance, lowering in export profitability, unfavourable wares structure in foreign exchange and high indebtedness abroad. Hence the tasks for Polish foreign trade policy must focus on the need of rising the competitiveness of export and diminishing import share in the volume of trade. The above task is feasible {{within the framework of}} strategy aimed at accelerated development of export and mild reduction of import. In the case of protection policy the point is to determine the scope of the protection and to make a choice of <b>protective</b> <b>means</b> for home market. Lack of perfection in functioning of market mechanisms in present Polish economy justifies today mild kind of protection policy with additionally some rigour builtin the whole of the system. Less efficiency in traditional <b>protective</b> <b>means</b> (custom duties, rates of exchange) suggests appealing to other more selective means (anti-dumping and anti-subventionning procedures, agreements and standards relating to goods quality as well as restructural clause). As far as rates of exchange policy is concerned the basic dilemma is the choice of the kind of the rate. Functional reorientation of the rate of exchange is justified because of disbalanced commercial balance: the range of oscillation should be enlarged and steady monthly devaluation - eliminated; the result should be more importance of reaction on external balance. Main conclusion is the constatation of the need for elaboration of long-term policy in Polish foreign trade - including clearly defined tasks and means to realize them. This shall permit to get optimal the process of solving the dilemmas emerging with more intensity during transformation of the economy.

We further evaluated this fraction for anti-inflammatory properties in J 774 macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon (IFN) g to understand the biological effects of awara pulp oil. EUF strongly decreased nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E 2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ?, and interleukin (IL) - 6 and - 10 production in activated J 774 cells.

40|$|Abstract Risks and Protection of Nurses Working in Acute Care Departments Nurses {{working in}} acute care {{departments}} face enhanced risks of injuries, accidents, infections and stress. A burden consists in providing acute care to clients who are undergoing the checkup and have hardly any anamneses. Nurses {{are exposed to}} work stress, stress resulted from human relationships, overloading and shift work. Occupational stress increases risks of injuries, accidents and infections. Nurses are supposed to observe {{the health and safety}} rules as they are presented in work safety trainings, in regulations and standards. All nurses should know them, use <b>protective</b> working <b>means</b> and protect themselves from injuries and accidents. Any injuries and accidents must be reported which bring both advantages and disadvantages. We have surveyed an intensive care unit of the cardiosurgical department, a department of anaesthetics and resuscitation and operating theatres. We asked six respondents in our qualitative research. There were five aims stated. 1. To find out how much the nurses are informed about work safety rules. 2. To find out if there is any relation between nurse´s age and her awareness of risks in acute care departments. 3. To find out if they protect themselves affectively from injuries and accidents. 4. To find out how stress affects nurses´ work in risky departments. 5. To find out if they apply the methods given in work safety rules in case they are injured or infected. The aims have been fulfilled. The analysis of non-standardised interviews resulted into four hypotheses. 1. Nurses are most affected by risk awareness at productive age. 2. Nurses use gloves and mouth protections as the only personal <b>protective</b> working <b>means.</b> 3. Long-term work stress causes psychosomatic illnesses in nurses. 4. Overanxious and lengthy procedure in case of work injury makes nurses to keep the fact in secret. The findings have proved the fact that nurses know the work safety rules. They use ptotective working means marginally. Nurses at productive age and nurse/mothers of small children are aware of the risks. Work stress does not affect their job performance but it definitely leads to injuries and accidents. The procedure in case of work injuries is viewed as lengthy and that is the reason why they do not often follow it...|$|R
