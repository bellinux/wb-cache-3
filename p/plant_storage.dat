50|$|Associated {{purchased}} the Amoroco Terminal in 1923 from the American-Oriental Refining Company (AMORCO) {{and consisted of}} a topping <b>plant,</b> <b>storage</b> tanks, a wharf, pipelines and pumping equipment. The next year a clarifying plant and an Edeleanu liquid dioxide plant, {{the first in the}} United States, were constructed at the Avon Refinery. The quality of the oils treated was so excellent that it prompted the U.S. Navy to purchase these lubricants exclusively from the Avon Refinery for many years. By 1925 the Avon Refinery became the first West Coast refinery to produce gasoline with tetraethyl lead additive and in 1926 the tanker ship S.S. McKittrick received the first crude receipt at the Amorco Wharf. The Southern Pacific Company bought the terminal in 1929 to construct a new railroad drawbridge a year later. In 1926, the Associated Oil Company stock owned by the Pacific Oil Company, which was formed by Southern Pacific Company to handle their oil interests, was sold to a new holding company, the Tide Water Associated Oil Company, which also acquired the Tide Water Oil Company at the same time. Standard Oil of New Jersey, the largest stockholder in Tide Water at the time, later formed a holding company, Mission Corporation, to hold the stocks of Tide Water and Associated.|$|E

40|$|Up to 50 % of {{electricity}} needs in Australia could be supplied by solar power. At these {{high levels of}} solar power generation, solar forecasting is necessary to manage the impact of solar variability. However, {{there has been little}} research on using solar forecasting in Australia. This study used modelling to investigate the benefits of using short-term and long-term solar forecasts to operate a concentrated solar thermal (CST) plant for a year at four sites that covered different climate zones within the Australian National Electricity Market. Using 1 -hour ahead short-term forecasts increased net value by $ 0. 90 -$ 2. 07 million for a CST <b>plant</b> with <b>storage,</b> and by $ 0. 76 -$ 3. 10 million for a CST <b>plant</b> without <b>storage.</b> It also improved reliability by reducing the equivalent forced outage rate by 21 - 38 percentage points for a CST <b>plant</b> with <b>storage,</b> and by 16 - 42 percentage points for a CST <b>plant</b> without <b>storage.</b> Using 1 -hour forecasts achieved 59 %- 94 % of the net value achievable if the 48 -hour forecast were perfect. At each site, the highest net value and reliability were achieved by a CST <b>plant</b> with <b>storage</b> and using 1 -hour forecasts, thus a CST plant should have both storage and short-term forecasts. If only one can be used, then a CST <b>plant</b> with <b>storage</b> and without 1 -hour forecasts achieves higher net value, whereas a CST <b>plant</b> without <b>storage</b> and with 1 -hour forecasts achieves higher reliability. These results demonstrated that using short-term forecasts is beneficial for CST plants that operate in electricity markets that allow updated bids to be submitted at short-term time frames. The results can be used to estimate the return on investment in obtaining short-term forecasts for operating a CST plant. Furthermore, the research method can be adapted into a tool for estimating value to assist CST plant project planning...|$|R

Sequence analysis has revealed that these proteins probably share a common ancestor with a fungal oxalate decarboxylase and/or related bacterial genes. Additionally, all these proteins share a central core sequence with several other functionally diverse enzymes and binding proteins, many of which are associated with synthesis of the extracellular matrix during sporulation/encystment. A possible prokaryotic relative of this sequence is a bacterial protein (SASP) known to bind to DNA and thereby protect spores from extreme environmental conditions. This ability to maintain cell viability during periods of dehydration in spores and seeds may relate to absolute conservation of residues involved in structure determination...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{plants are}} {{the main source of}} vitamin C in the human diet, we still have a limited {{understanding}} of how plants synthesise L -ascorbic acid (AsA) and what regulates its concentration in different plant tissues. In particular, the enormous variability in the vitamin C content of storage organs from different plants remains unexplained. Possible sources of AsA in <b>plant</b> <b>storage</b> organs include in situ synthesis and long-distance transport of AsA synthesised in other tissues via the phloem. In this paper we examine a third possibility, that of synthesis within the phloem. Results We provide evidence for the presence of AsA in the phloem sap {{of a wide range of}} crop species using aphid stylectomy and histochemical approaches. The activity of almost all the enzymes of the primary AsA biosynthetic pathway were detected in phloem-rich vascular exudates from Cucurbita pepo fruits and AsA biosynthesis was demonstrated in isolated phloem strands from Apium graveolens petioles incubated with a range of precursors (D -glucose, D -mannose, L -galactose and L -galactono- 1, 4 -lactone). Phloem uptake of D -[U- 14 C]mannose and L -[1 - 14 C]galactose (intermediates of the AsA biosynthetic pathway) as well as L -[1 - 14 C]AsA and L -[1 - 14 C]DHA, was observed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf discs. Conclusions We present the novel finding that active AsA biosynthesis occurs in the phloem. This process must now be considered in the context of mechanisms implicated in whole plant AsA distribution. This work should provoke studies aimed at elucidation of the in vivo substrates for phloem AsA biosynthesis and its contribution to AsA accumulation in <b>plant</b> <b>storage</b> organs. </p...|$|E
