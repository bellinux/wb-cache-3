5|$|Since Catarina was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> the damage was quite severe. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. Three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to $350 million (2004 USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Since around 1937, Verity had {{expected}} {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War and had <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> through reading military literature. He and Bowes decided to enlist together, and after briefly serving in the Air Raid Precautions in Guiseley until Bowes' wife gave birth, they attempted to join the infantry. However, Bowes was hampered by an old knee complaint and later became a gunnery officer. After serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, Verity was commissioned in January 1940 as a second lieutenant in the Green Howards, and later promoted to captain. Following a spell at the Infantry Training Centre, he was posted to the 1stBattalion. He served at the regimental depot in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he was responsible for training recruits. In the spring of 1941, the battalion moved to Omagh in Northern Ireland for further training. Verity's Yorkshire and England teammate Norman Yardley was also in the 1st Battalion; the fame of these cricketers made an impression on the local population. Playing several cricket matches, Verity frequently took wickets on rough pitches that were unsuitable for batting. There was even time for his appearance in a charity match at Lord's. In August, he returned to England and after a spell in London, he was posted overseas.|$|E

25|$|However {{the twin}} cities had {{expected}} an assault by bombardment and <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The city moat was expanded to a width of 150 meter, forcing Yuan siege weapons {{to set up}} at a distance. In addition to reinforcing their walls with clay, they made netting screens ten centimeters thick and ten meters in length to cover them and dampen projectile impact. As a result, the Yuan siege weapons were both ineffective and inaccurate, and the few shots that did land bounced off the wall harmlessly.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nose}} high {{attitude}} on the ground, propeller powered taildraggers are more {{adversely affected by}} P-factor – asymmetrical thrust caused by the propeller's disk being angled to the direction of travel, which causes the blades to produce more lift when going down than when going up due to the difference in angle the blade experiences when passing through the air. The aircraft will then pull {{to the side of}} the upward blade. Some aircraft lack sufficient rudder authority in some flight regimes (particularly at higher power settings on takeoff) and the pilot must compensate before the aircraft starts to yaw. Some aircraft, particularly older, higher powered aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang, cannot use full power on takeoff and still safely control their direction of travel. On landing this is less of a factor, however opening the throttle to abort a landing can induce severe uncontrollable yaw unless the pilot is <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

Moscheles was instrumental in bringing Felix to London {{for the first time}} in 1829 - Abraham entrusted Felix to his care for this visit. Moscheles had carefully <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> In London, apart from becoming a regular and successful performer, as well as a musical adviser for the soirées of the Rothschilds, he had become an invaluable aid for Sir George Smart and the Philharmonic Society, advising them of the talents of European musicians he encountered on his own concert-tours. When Smart himself toured Europe in 1825 looking for new music and musicians for the Society, Moscheles furnished Smart with a list of contacts and letters of introduction, including both Beethoven and Mendelssohn. (In Prague, Moscheles's brother acted as Smart's guide). Smart visited the Mendelssohns in Berlin and was impressed with both Felix and Fanny. This eventually led to Mendelssohn's invitation to conduct at the Society on his 1829 visit.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{concludes that}} the TMI-2 {{accident}} left a mixed legacy. It did force regulatory and operational improvements on a reluctant industry, but it also increased opposition to nuclear power.

Anti-nuclear advocates were right: a nuclear accident was likely, and the industry was not <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> But their predicted worst-case accident, called the [...] "China Syndrome", did not eventuate. For its part, the industry said that it had reformed itself, but perhaps by then few were listening.|$|E

500|$|Chandler {{used the}} savings {{realized}} from his reorganization {{of government to}} eliminate the state's budget deficit and pay off most of the state's debt. This brought about further savings by eliminating debt service costs; these were applied to improvements in the state's infrastructure and educational institutions. Chandler allocated funds for free textbooks for the state's school children, created a teacher's pension fund, and provided extensive funding for the state's colleges and universities. Because segregation prevented blacks from attending graduate school in the state, Chandler secured an allocation of $5,000 annually to help blacks attend out-of-state graduate schools. He stopped short of desegregating the state's universities, however, telling {{a group of black}} and white educators that [...] "it is not wise to educate the white and colored in the same school in the South.

500|$|Cast member Jonathan Frakes {{directed}} the episode, having <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> while shooting the episode [...] "". He {{said that he}} was not involved in the casting process, as they had offered the role of Captain Morgan Bateson to Kelsey Grammer, who'd accepted. Grammer was a Star Trek fan, and in his role as Frasier Crane on Cheers, he filmed on the Paramount lot near where The Next Generation was produced. Frakes found it a challenge to film the same scenes with the same dialogue over and over but in a way which made them look different. Marvin V. Rush, the director of photography, worked with cameraman Waverly Smothers to develop an attachment for a camera using a bungee cord which allowed for a different style of shooting. Frakes also worked while at home planning out shots {{in order to ensure that}} there was a variety to each loop. Executive producer Rick Berman had made it clear that Frakes could not re-use footage and each loop needed to be filmed fresh, in order to prevent the episode from looking like a clip show.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Julius, a British {{lawyer who}} is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] is [...] "exceptional in a poetry in which {{elsewhere}} Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>it...</b> The song is for, not of Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of living that truth." [...] He accuses Eliot of animating [...] "the topoi of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence"—essentially employing a tired characterisation of a Jewish figure as a voice attesting that Jews have no role in the Christian future. [...] Julius compares Simeon to Moses stating that he is [...] "fated to see the Promised Land but not to enter it ... witness to its truth, but denied its redemptive power, the Jew stands solemnly, humbly, outside Christianity's gates". Further, Julius draws on a quote from Eliot's earlier poem [...] "Gerontion" [...] to say that in this Christian future the Jews [...] "may find a ledge there to squat on".|$|E

To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer.
