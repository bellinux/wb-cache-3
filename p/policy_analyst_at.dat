500|$|Dr. Christopher Neff, a <b>policy</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> the University of Sydney, {{argues that}} terms like [...] "attack" [...] are laden with {{cultural}} stigmatization. Instead {{of the word}} [...] "attack", he proposes labeling human-shark interactions, {{on a scale of}} extremity, as encounters, minor bites, moderate bites and fatal bites. The term [...] "attack" [...] is only appropriate in specific instances where specialists can confirm the predatory nature of the shark-human encounter, which is extremely difficult to do. While many encounters with oceanic whitetip sharks appear predatory in nature, without the verification of a scientific community in each instance, it is best to assume the accidental or nonpredatory intent of the encounters.|$|E

Many of the scientists included in the list demanded their names be removed. The Heartland Institute refused these requests, stating that the scientists [...] "have no right—legally or ethically—to demand that their names be removed from a bibliography composed by researchers with whom they disagree" [...] despite the aforementioned falsification and refutation of much of the list.|$|E

Michael Johns, the former foreign <b>policy</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> The Heritage Foundation and White House speechwriter to President George H. W.

40|$|In most cases, policy {{scholars}} {{interested in}} the role of <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> in promoting and practicing evidence-based policy-making rely on very partial survey results, or on anecdotal case studies and interview research. Despite the existence of a large body of literature on policy analysis, large-scale empirical studies of the work of <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> are rare, {{and in the case of}} <b>analysts</b> working <b>at</b> the sub-national level, virtually non-existent. There has been very little research on this level of policy workers despite the significant powers they exercise in prominent federal systems such as the USA, Germany, Australia, Mexico, Russia, Brazil, Malaysia and Canada. This paper reports on the first comprehensive survey of the work of <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> <b>at</b> the provincial and territorial levels conducted in Canada in 2008 - 2009.

The resulting profile of sub-national <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> presented here reveals several substantial differences between analysts working for national governments and their sub-national counterparts, with important implications for policy training and practice, and for the ability of nations to improve their policy advice systems in order to better accomplish their long-term policy goals through the practice of evidence-based policy-making...|$|R

40|$|Canada’s {{graduated}} {{personal income}} tax leads most taxpayers to expect higher tax rates when they are working than when they are living on lower incomes from their retirement savings. Yet for many people, marginal effective tax rates on income from retirement savings are higher than those they face during working life. Comparing marginal effective tax rates across income levels suggests that many Canadians with savings in tax-deferred vehicles, like Registered Retirement Savings Plans, should put more future saving in tax-prepaid savings plans, particularly Tax-Free Savings Accounts. Pension-plan sponsors, employers contributing to group RSPs, financial service providers, and governments whose future income may depend on taxes on individual savings, should anticipate how differences in marginal tax rates in work and retirement change the rewards from saving in different forms.

40|$|Nine {{working days}} {{following}} the end of each month, the Bureau of the Census publishes its first estimate of retail sales for that month. This Advance estimate is widely reported in the press and examined closely by financial markets and <b>policy</b> <b>analysts.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, the Bureau publishes a Preliminary estimate of retail sales for the previous month and a Final estimate for the month before that. The Advance estimate will normally differ from both the Preliminary and the Final estimates for the same month. Keen interest by <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> and others in using the Advance estimate to reliably predict the change in month-to-month sales (to be later determined more accurately by the Preliminary and Final estimates) causes us to work to reduce these differences. We looked at several possible reasons for the differences. These included added variance due to a smaller Advance sample, nonoverlapping units between the samples, the effects of early reporting, nonresponse, different estimators, different imputation methodology and different seasonal adjustment factors. In this paper, we present the results of our investigation of these reasons and their impact. In summary, the Advance estimate generally predicts the Preliminary and Final estimates quite well. Better early reporting and reducing nonresponse can improve the Advance estimates. Nonetheless, the primary reason for differences appears to be the variance of the smaller Advance sample. We also discuss steps that the Census Bureau is taking to reduce differences in the future. We begin by describing the two voluntary surveys that give rise to the Preliminary and Final monthly retail sales estimates and to the Advance monthly retail sales estimates...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} that <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> <b>at</b> {{the state and federal}} levels intent on designing fiscal policies for rural schools be especially mindful of the great diversity in rural America.

Moreover, rural America, though be-sieged with many long-term issues, remains an impor-tant and vital sector in the fabric of the nation, if for no other reason than that approximately one-fifth of the nation's population still reside in nonmetropolitan ar-eas, or that a significant percentage of the nation's economic activity continues to be centered in these regions [...] Thus the condition of the many parts of rural America that together still represent a significant com-ponent of-the life of this nation should be of vital interest to ail, For those national, state. and local groups and individuals having stewardship for designing and imple-menting education policies and programs that are meaningful and fair, knowledge of the condition of the conglomerate called rural America, though always im-portant, takes on special significance today...|$|R
40|$|Policy makers rely on {{cost-benefit}} analysis (CBA) {{to help them}} select the best policies and projects to alleviate poverty. But CBA, as practiced in the United States, not only fails to inform policy makers about {{the best use of}} scarce resources but helps make poverty worse for many people. International donor organizations—the United Nations, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and World Bank—have sophisticated CBA methods that could better serve policy makers in deciding how to help poor people. The authors look at the results of CBA in four eco-nomic development venues—enterprise zones, military base redevelopment, sports stadiums, and business incentives—for developing a critique of cost-benefit practices. A brief program is offered to correct cost-benefit practice, but it is concluded that reform must come not from policy makers and <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> who now use CBA but from outsiders who want to influence political systems on behalf of poor people. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a powerful tool for state and local policy makers trying to select the best, or more accurately rationalize, economic development policies and projects to alleviate poverty. But policy makers and policy advisers restrict CBA so that it loses its evaluative power, becoming mostly political rather than economic. Consequently, CBA in practice gives short shrift to poverty alleviation. This should not be the case. In this article, we look at how CBA should be properly used as a decision tool in state and local economic development. We propose ways in which CBA practice might be reformed, and we speculate about the likelihood of its reform. We base our perspective of CBA on the work of <b>policy</b> <b>analysts</b> <b>at</b> the World Bank (Ward & Deren, 1991), United Nations (United Nations Industria...|$|R
