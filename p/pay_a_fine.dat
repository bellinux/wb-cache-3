The residents need to be protected during gameplay, as the player has to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> if any are shot by either bandits or Sheriff Quickdraw himself. Some outlaws are mounted on horseback, meaning that the player may have to saddle an imaginary horse to pursue them.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E

5|$|In 60 BC, Hybrida {{was quietly}} {{removed from the}} {{position}} of governor of Macedonia and replaced by Gaius Octavius. The next year, he was prosecuted by Julius Caesar and Marcus Licinius Crassus. The outcome of this was that Hybrida was forced to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> and banished to the Island of Cephallania. Sometime in 47 BC, Hybrida was recalled from his banishment by Caesar. In 45 BC he made himself {{a candidate for the}} position of censor which ultimately failed. The final mention of Hybrida comes from Cicero in 44 BC when Mark Antony divorced himself from Hybrida's daughter Antonia Hybrida Major.|$|E
5|$|In September 2012, the Swiss {{government}} gave banks like Credit Suisse {{permission to}} provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes. In February 2014 it agreed to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion {{as to whether it}} was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation. Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes. The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey's {{ordination}} as {{a priest}} took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported {{by most of the}} York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.|$|E

5|$|The Hanoverian {{succession}} to {{the throne}} of Great Britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since the incorporation of the heralds. The only notable incident for the college in this period, {{during the reign of}} George I, happened in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman pretended to be a herald. The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk, and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine.</b> This hefty sentence was executed, proving that the rights of the College were still respected. In 1737, during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter, to reaffirm their rights and remuneration; this effort proved unsuccessful. Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|The {{contacts}} of Thomas Goodman enabled Erasmus {{to serve}} a seven-year apprenticeship in London with a poultry merchant, John Saunders, and he was made a freeman of the Grocers' Company on 10 February 1635. By 1631 Roger Smith had become an alderman of the City of London and in 1635 he was knighted; Erasmus followed in his father's footsteps, being elected an alderman in 1657, but preferred to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> of £420 {{in order to be}} released from the duties of office. In these early years he was also unwilling to have much involvement in the business of the Grocers' Company, although this changed later in life: the cause of his initial reluctance may have been his preference to concentrate on acquiring his wealth. According to the records of the Aldermen of the City of London, Erasmus was Member of Parliament for Ardee in County Louth between 1665 and 1666.|$|E
5|$|Babe starts serving breakfasts in the pub, {{putting her}} in direct {{competition}} with the local café, which starts a feud with its owner, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). Babe tries to sabotage Kathy's business by poisoning her coffee machine, disgusting the Carter family.

Mick ejects Babe from the Vic and she curses the family, hoping they lose everything.|$|E

5|$|In both {{of these}} instances, a failed retreat by Hybrida and his cavalry led to his unit being {{absolutely}} defeated and any plunder accrued during the attack was forfeited back to the natives. This lack of success, rather than the extortion of the provincials, drew {{the attention of the}} Senate who threatened to recall and prosecute Hybrida for his mismanagement of the province. In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly replaced by Gaius Octavius as the Governor of Macedonia and in March of 59 BC, during the consulship of Caesar and Marcus Culpurnius Bibulus, was prosecuted for the mishandling of the governorship by Caesar and Crassus. In the end, Hybrida was tried by Marcus Caelius Rufus for his participation in the Catilinarian conspiracy and by Lucius Caninius Gallus for his crimes in Macedonia. He was defended by Cicero, not out of duty but as a protest against the current state of affairs in Rome. Despite this, Hybrida was found guilty of his crimes, ordered to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> and be banished from Rome to a place of his choosing. Hybrida had settled upon Cephallenia as his residence for the duration of his exile.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 2017, Édouard was {{suspected}} of having shot at a passer-by with an airsoft gun on 11 February, injuring him in the head. As {{a result of the}} incident, he was interrogated by police and his loan was prematurely terminated by Toulouse. At the time of his loan being cancelled, Edouard had made 17 appearances and scored one goal for Toulouse. It was later revealed that his teammate, Mathieu Cafaro, had confessed to being the one who had fired the gun. Cafaro later recanted, however, and on 13 June the Toulouse Prosecutor asked that Édouard be charged with a four months suspended prison sentence and a €6,000 fine for his involvement in the incident. Édouard alleged that Cafaro fired the shot while Cafaro claimed not to have been in the car {{at the time of the}} shooting. On 4 July, Édouard was sentenced to a suspended four months' prison sentence by the Correctional Court of Toulouse. He was also ordered to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> of €6,000 as well as damages of €2,600 to the victim for the wounds suffered to his ear.|$|E
5|$|Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 {{were held}} in Westminster, the last two called by Archbishop William. The council of 1125 met under the {{direction}} of John of Crema and prohibited simony, purchase of the sacraments, and the inheritance of clerical benefices. John of Crema had been sent to England not only to seek a compromise in the Canterbury–York dispute, but to publicize the decrees of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or prebend, which was a source of consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in clergy's households unless they were relatives. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic houses. It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to give up their wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any such women who did not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled and even forced into slavery. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives. This council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> to the royal treasury to keep their women. William's allowance of this royal fine was condemned by the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon. The festival of the Conception was also allowed at one of these councils.|$|E
