Thus, the newly adopted displacement approach is based on comparing the elastic displacement demand to the inelastic displacement capacity of the primary structural components while ensuring a minimum level of inelastic capacity at all potential <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> locations.|$|E
50|$|In the {{structural}} engineering beam theory term, <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge,</b> {{is used to}} describe the deformation of a section of a beam where plastic bending occurs. In earthquake engineering <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> is also a type of energy damping device allowing plastic rotation deformation of an otherwise rigid column connection.|$|E
5000|$|By {{inserting}} a <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> at a plastic limit load into a statically determinate beam, a kinematic mechanism permitting an unbounded {{displacement of the}} system can be formed. It {{is known as the}} collapse mechanism. For each degree of static indeterminacy of the beam, an additional <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> must be added to form a collapse mechanism ...|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} the third graph in Fig.  5, {{it is worth noting}} that the number of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> is {{significantly}} reduced when a controller is applied. For example, the uncontrolled structure yields <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> under the half-scale intensity Kobe earthquake and the 1.5 scale intensity El Centro earthquake. However, the formation of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> is completely prevented when the semi-active H∞ control strategy is applied. The same is also observed for the Clipped-LQG controller. In addition, in all the cases that <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> are formed in the uncontrolled structure, the number of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> is greatly reduced when the proposed control strategy is applied, and the control effects of the proposed strategy are a little better than those by the other two approaches, except the half-scale Northridge case. Therefore, damage in the structure is greatly decreased. As is evident in the drift response time histories of the in Fig.  3, when the structure yields <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges,</b> a permanent deformation remains in the structures. The degree of residual permanent deformation could be indirectly controlled by decreasing the drifts of the structure throughout the earthquake.|$|R
3000|$|As {{the state}} of over-complete {{collapse}} {{is associated with the}} simultaneous formation of all <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges,</b> it {{can be used as a}} roadmap to induce a controlled, sequential formation of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> without compromising the limit carrying capacity or the minimum weight status of the framework. In joint loaded VG, the drift angle due to racking effects is generally a maximum near the supports and a minimum within the span. This implies that it would be prudent to prevent the possibility of premature formation of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> near the supports. The present section proposes a simple method for delaying the formation of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> near the supports until the rest of the structure tends to become a mechanism. This is achieved by accelerating the sequences of formations of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> by the implementation of reduced beam sections in a calculated manner and then compensating for the loss of the global carrying capacity of the structure. For instance, if it is desired to accelerate the formation of the <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> of a rotationally active member, such as the horizontal elements to the left of joint s or the vertical element at joint s –  1 of Fig.  1 e, then it would be sufficient to reduce the plastic moment of resistance of these members by small percentage [...]...|$|R
30|$|Plastic-hinge {{modeling}} is {{an important}} issue of the plastic analysis for framed structures; it influences not only the accurateness but also the formulation procedure.

50|$|In {{plastic limit}} {{analysis}} of structural members subjected to bending, {{it is assumed}} that an abrupt transition from elastic to ideally plastic behaviour occurs at a certain value of moment, known as plastic moment (Mp). Member behaviour between Myp and Mp is considered to be elastic. When Mp is reached, a <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> is formed in the member. In contrast to a frictionless hinge permitting free rotation, it is postulated that the <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> allows large rotations to occur at constant plastic moment Mp.|$|E

5000|$|The {{equation}} [...] {{is valid}} {{only when the}} stress at the extreme fiber (i.e., {{the portion of the}} beam farthest from the neutral axis) is below the yield stress of the material from which it is constructed. At higher loadings the stress distribution becomes non-linear, and ductile materials will eventually enter a <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> state where the magnitude of the stress is equal to the yield stress everywhere in the beam, with a discontinuity at the neutral axis where the stress changes from tensile to compressive. This <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> state is typically used as a limit state in the design of steel structures.|$|E

40|$|A new {{construction}} concept for structural frames consisting of concrete, steel, and {{carbon fiber composite}} fabrics was developed and implemented in a two-column bridge pier. Two new ideas are incorporated in the system. One is that the pier has pre-assigned column <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> that are shifted away from column ends. Outside <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges,</b> the pier is to remain elastic. The other innovative concept incorporated in the frame is that where <b>plastic</b> <b>hinging</b> and ductility is required, steel reinforcement is used as the longitudinal reinforcement and where elastic behavior is required carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) sheets are used as the longitudinal reinforcement. FRP fabrics provide for confinement and shear capacity at all locations. A quarter-scale, two-column drop-cap pier with square columns was designed and constructed based on the aforementioned concepts. Normal strength concrete and Grade 60 mild steel {{were used in the}} frame. Unidirectional Replark carbon composite fabrics manufactured by the Mitsubishi Corporation were placed on the frame. The frame was studied using computer programs DRAIN 3 -DX and RC-Shake and a shake table testing program was developed. The shake table tests were completed in 2001. The frame was subjected to successive runs of the 1994 Northridge-Sylmar record with increasing amplitudes until failure. The <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> behaved as planned, and the failure occurred after the rupture of the FRP fabrics in one of the <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges.</b> The strain data confirmed the location of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> and the relatively small strains in areas that were intended to remain elastic. Minor cracking of the beam-column joints revealed after the removal of the CFRP fabrics indicated a need for slight refinement of the CFRP design in the joint regions...|$|R
5000|$|Lumped damage {{mechanics}} or LDM is {{a branch of}} structural mechanics that {{is concerned with the}} analysis of frame structures. It is based on continuum {{damage mechanics}} and fracture mechanics. It combines the ideas of these theories with the concept of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> LDM can be defined as the fracture mechanics of complex structural systems. In the models of LDM, cracking or local buckling as well as plasticity are lumped at the inelastic hinges. As in continuum damage mechanics, LDM uses state variables to represent the effects of damage on the remaining stiffness and strength of the frame structure. In reinforced concrete structures, the damage state variable quantifies the crack density in the <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> zone; in unreinforced concrete components and steel beams, it is a dimensionless measure of the crack surface; in tubular steel elements, the damage variable measures the degree of local buckling The LDM evolution laws can be derived from continuum damage mechanics or fracture mechanics. In the latter case, concepts such as the energy release rate or the stress intensity factor of a <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> are introduced. LDM allows for the numerical simulation of the collapse of complex structures with a fraction of the computational cost and human effort of its continuum mechanics counterparts. LDM is also a regularization procedure that eliminates the mesh-dependence phenomenon that is observed in structural analysis with local damage models ...|$|E

50|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{the plastic}} moment (Mp) is a property of a structural section. It {{is defined as}} the moment at which the entire cross section has reached its yield stress. This is theoretically the maximum bending moment that the section can resist - when this point is reached a <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> is formed and any load beyond this point will result in theoretically infinite plastic deformation. In practice most materials work harden resulting in increased stiffness and moment resistance until the material fails. This is of little significance in structural mechanics as the deflection prior to this occurring is considered to be an earlier failure point in the member.|$|E
50|$|Plastic bending {{begins when}} an applied moment causes the outside fibers of a {{cross-section}} {{to exceed the}} material's yield strength. Loaded only by a moment, the peak bending stresses occurs at the outside fibers of a cross-section. The cross-section will not yield linearly through the section. Rather, outside regions will yield first, redistributing stress and delaying failure beyond what would be predicted by elastic analytical methods. The stress distribution from the neutral axis {{is the same as}} the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material (this assumes a non-composite cross-section).

40|$|Abstract. A {{reinforced}} concrete frame model {{was designed by}} PKPM software and then a push-over analysis is performed in this paper. Values of <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> were calculated by Section Builder software, which based on constitutive relations of material and the section forms, then the data was written into corresponding components in the model to carry out push-over analysis. The <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> first appeared {{at the ends of}} beams in the first story,spread to the second story and the ends of columns in the first story. At last <b>plastic</b> <b>hinges</b> spread to the top story. The story drift and interstory displacement rotation of the model in different cases tended to decrease as structural height increase.

50|$|Tensile and {{compressive}} stresses increase proportionally with bending moment, {{but are also}} dependent on the {{second moment of area}} of the cross-section of a beam (that is, the shape of the cross-section, such as a circle, square or I-beam being common structural shapes). Failure in bending will occur when the bending moment is sufficient to induce tensile stresses greater than the yield stress of the material throughout the entire cross-section. In structural analysis, this bending failure is called a <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge,</b> since the full load carrying ability of the structural element is not reached until the full cross-section is past the yield stress. It is possible that failure of a structural element in shear may occur before failure in bending, however the mechanics of failure in shear and in bending are different.|$|E

40|$|Seismic design {{criteria}} have been heavily improved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after the Northridge CA earthquake in 1994. Most {{of the damage}} observed was caused by brittle failure of moment frame connections. This failure was induced by {{the formation of the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> at undesirable locations in the beam and the column near the connection. Using welded flange plate (WFP) connections will force the formation of the <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> away {{from the face of the}} column while preventing the brittle failure of the moment connection.

The purpose of this research is to prove that the <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> will form away from the face of the column, at a distance of approximately half the depth of the beam away from the cover plate. The further away the <b>plastic</b> <b>hinge</b> is from the face of the column the higher the connection demands.

The modeling and analysis of WFP connections was performed using finite element analysis software. A total of eight models with half beam half column configuration were considered in this study.
