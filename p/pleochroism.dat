25|$|In {{addition}} to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, asterism, chatoyancy, iridescence, tarnish, and <b>pleochroism.</b> Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, {{such as in}} opal, results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while <b>pleochroism</b> describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. Iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating {{on the surface of}} crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry. In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure. Chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to identifying {{rocks in the}} field (lithology), petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, petrologists analyze thin sections of rock samples using a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, <b>pleochroism,</b> twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals. Stable and radioactive isotope studies {{provide insight into the}} geochemical evolution of rock units.|$|E
25|$|Media {{that have}} {{different}} indexes of refraction for different polarization modes are called birefringent. Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction. For example, {{this is the}} case with macroscopic crystals of calcite, which present the viewer with two offset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through them. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as <b>pleochroism,</b> are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarization microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become so when subject to mechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarization of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission.|$|E
500|$|When {{viewed with}} {{polarized}} light under a petrographic microscope, widgiemoolthalite appears bluish-green {{and does not}} exhibit <b>pleochroism.</b> It is biaxial positive and has a high optic angle (or 2V). [...] When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 1.630 and 1.640 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.010.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pleochroism</b> is visible, {{with the}} crystal {{appearing}} colourless when viewed along X or Y, and pale red when viewed along Z. <b>Pleochroism</b> {{should not be}} present if the mineral is colourless. It is not fluorescent.|$|E
50|$|Tetragonal, {{trigonal}} and hexagonal minerals {{can only}} show two colors and are called dichroic. Orthorhombic, monoclinic and triclinic crystals can show three and are trichroic. For example, hypersthene, with two optical axes, can have red, yellow or blue appearance when oriented {{in three different}} ways in three-dimensional space. Isometric minerals cannot exhibit <b>pleochroism.</b> Tourmaline is notable for exhibiting strong <b>pleochroism.</b> Gems are sometimes cut and set either to display <b>pleochroism</b> or to hide it, depending on the colors and their attractiveness.|$|E

[...] The mineral exhibits slight <b>pleochroism.</b> <b>Pleochroism</b> is an optical property observed when the mineral is viewed under the microscope in plane polarized light, and when it {{the stage of the}} microscope is rotated the observed colors change. The color change is due to different wavelengths being absorbed in different directions, and the color of the mineral depends on the crystallographic orientation.|$|E
