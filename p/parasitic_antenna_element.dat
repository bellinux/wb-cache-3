40|$|Abstract In this thesis, {{bandwidth}} (BW) enhanced antennas for mobile terminals and {{multilayer ceramic}} packages are presented. The thesis {{is divided into}} two parts. In the first part, electrically frequency-tunable mobile terminal antennas have been studied. The first three antennas presented were of a dual-band planar inverted-F type (PIFA) and were tuned to operate in frequency bands appropriate to the GSM 850 (824 – 894  MHz), GSM 900 (880 – 960  MHz), GSM 1800 (1710 – 1880  MHz), GSM 1900 (1850 – 1990  MHz) and UMTS (1920 – 2170  MHz) cellular telecommunication standards with RF PIN diode switches. The first antenna utilized a frequency-tuning method developed in this thesis. The method was based on an integration of the tuning circuitry into the antenna. The tuning of the second antenna was based on a switchable <b>parasitic</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>element.</b> By combining the two frequency-tuning approaches, a third PIFA could be switched to operate in eight frequency bands. The planar monopole antennas researched were varactor-tunable for digital television signal reception (470 – 702  MHz) and RF PIN diode switchable dual-band antenna for operation at four cellular bands. The key advantage of the former antenna was a compact size (0. 7  cm 3), while for the latter one, a tuning circuit was implemented without using separate DC wiring for controlling the switch component. The second part of the thesis is devoted to multilayer ceramic package integrated microwave antennas. In the beginning, the use of a laser micro-machined embedded air cavity was proposed to enable antenna size to impedance bandwidth (BW) trade-off for a microwave microstrip in a multilayer monolithic ceramic media. It was shown that the BW of a 10  GHz antenna fabricated on a low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrate could be doubled with this technique. Next, the implementation of a compact surface mountable LTCC antenna package operating near 10  GHz was described. The package was composed of a BW optimized stacked patch microstrip antenna and a wide-band vertical ball grid array (BGA) -via interconnection. Along with the electrical performance optimization, an accurate circuit model describing the antenna structure was presented. Finally, the use of low-sintering temperature non-linear dielectric Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) thick films was demonstrated in a folded slot antenna operating at 3 GHz and frequency-tuned with an integrated BST varactor...|$|E

30|$|Research in {{the area}} of ad hoc {{networks}} has yielded important advances, notably in the field of physical layer techniques. In particular, a lot of effort has been spent in (i) applying smart antennas and antenna diversity techniques to ad hoc networks (e.g., [1 – 3]), (ii) developing medium access control protocols suitable for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) ad hoc networks (e.g., [4 – 6]), and (iii) adaptive algorithms for antenna beamforming in ad hoc networks (e.g., [7 – 9]). Directional antennas, like phased arrays[10, 11] and switchable <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>antennas</b> [12, 13] have been proposed as a solution to reduce the interference of adjacent nodes, maximizing overall network throughput[1, 3, 14]. In order to further increase the network spectral efficiency, MIMO spatial multiplexing (SM) techniques and diversity techniques have been adopted [4, 5, 15]. However, directional arrays and MIMO SM/diversity techniques cannot be integrated on compact portable devices, where the limited space available renders mounting multiple directional antennas difficult.|$|R
