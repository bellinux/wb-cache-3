40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} pseudo-dynamic techniques to the dynamic analysis of piping structures. Essentially it consists in coupling a direct time integration algorithm, such as the Newmark method, to an experimental step. At each time step the integration algorithm generates a displacement vector of the structure, which is prescribed for the test specimen. This is mounted in a rigid test rig fitted {{with a set of}} displacement actuators and load cells {{at the level of the}} structure degrees of freedom. The load cells allow the reading of the internal restoring force vector, which is fed back to the direct time integration algorithm in an actual time step. Further calculations for the velocity and acceleration vectors will define a new structure configuration by evaluating a new displacement vector referred to the next time step. This procedure makes it possible to assess experimentally a realistic stress distribution at sections of complex shape <b>piping</b> <b>parts.</b> The method is a precise tool in dynamic analysis and, on being carried out in a quasi-static procedure, it operates with less expensive equipment than is necessary in real dynamic test...|$|E
40|$|The project {{objective}} is to demonstrate the viability of HCNG fuel (30 to 50 % hydrogen by volume and the remainder natural gas) to reduce emissions from light-duty on-road vehicles with no loss in performance or efficiency. The City of Las Vegas {{has an interest in}} alternative fuels and already has an existing hydrogen refueling station. Collier Technologies Inc (CT) supplied the latest design retrofit kits capable of converting nine compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled, light-duty vehicles powered by the Ford 5. 4 L Triton engine. CT installed the kits on the first two vehicles in Las Vegas, trained personnel at the City of Las Vegas (the City) to perform the additional seven retrofits, and developed materials for allowing other entities to perform these retrofits as well. These vehicles were used in normal service by the City while driver impressions, reliability, fuel efficiency and emissions were documented for a minimum of one year after conversion. This project has shown the efficacy of operating vehicles originally designed to operate on compressed natural gas with HCNG fuel incorporating large quantities of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). There were no safety issues experienced with these vehicles. The only maintenance issue in the project was some rough idling due to problems with the EGR valve and <b>piping</b> <b>parts.</b> Once the rough idling was corrected no further maintenance issues with these vehicles were experienced. Fuel economy data showed no significant changes after conversion even with the added power provided by the superchargers that were part of the conversions. Driver feedback for the conversions was very favorable. The additional power provided by the HCNG vehicles was greatly appreciated, especially in traffic. The drivability of the HCNG vehicles was considered to be superior by the drivers. Most of the converted vehicles showed zero oxides of nitrogen throughout the life of the project using the State of Nevada emissions station...|$|E

This type of radiograph exposes both walls, but only resolves {{the image on the}} wall nearest the film. This exposure arrangement takes more time than a panoramic, as the source must first penetrate the WT twice and travel the entire outside diameter of the pipe or vessel to reach the film on the opposite side. This is a double wall exposure/single wall view DWE/SWV arrangement.

Duke proposes to amend its commitments for Auxiliary Building Water Level (Flood) and revise the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) {{to describe the}} flood protection measures for the Auxiliary Building. A markup of the UFSAR revision is enclosed as Attachment 1, which will be submitted per 10 CFR 50. 71 (e) subsequent to NRC approval of this change.

40|$|Researchers from NASA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are {{evaluating}} {{a series}} of electron beam curable composites for application in reusable launch vehicle airframe and propulsion systems. Objectives are to develop electron beam curable composites that are useful at cryogenic to elevated temperatures (- 217 C to 200 C), validate key mechanical properties of these composites, and demonstrate cost-saving fabrication methods at the subcomponent level. Electron beam curing of polymer matrix composites is an enabling capability for production of aerospace structures in a non-autoclave process. Payoffs of this technology will be fabrication of composite structures at room temperature, reduced tooling cost and cure time, and improvements in component durability. This presentation covers the results of material property evaluations for electron beam-cured composites made with either unidirectional tape or woven fabric architectures. Resin systems have been evaluated for performance in ambient, cryogenic, and elevated temperature conditions. Results for electron beam composites and similar composites cured in conventional processes are reviewed for comparison.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to understand the fatigue crack growth behavior and validate analytical procedures for austenitic stainless steel and carbon steel pipes, pipe welds and elbows. The study involved fatigue tests on actual components and specimens. The Paris law has been used for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life. Paris constants have been determined for pipe (base), pipe weld and pipe elbow materials by using Compact Tension (CT) /Three Point Bend (TPB) specimens machined from the actual pipe, pipe weld and pipe elbow. Analyses have been carried out to predict the fatigue crack growth life of these <b>piping</b> components having <b>part</b> through cracks on the outer surface. In the analyses, Stress Intensity Factor (K) has been evaluated through two different schemes. The first scheme considers the ‘K’ evaluations at two points of the crack front i. e. maximum crack depth and crack tip end at the outer surface. The second scheme accounts for the area averaged root mean square stress intensity factor (KRMS) at deepest and surface points. In order to validate the analytical procedure/results, experiments have been carried out on full scale pipes, pipe welds with part through circumferential crack. The tests have also been conducted on the full scale carbon steel elbows having part-through circumferential notch at intrados location and axial notch at crown location on the outer surface. Fatigue crack growth life evaluated using both schemes have been compared with experimental results. Use of stress intensity factor (KRMS) evaluated using second scheme gives better fatigue crack growth life prediction compared to that of first scheme...|$|R
40|$|Copper-zinc alloys (alfa-beta brasses) are {{currently}} {{used to produce}} house water <b>piping</b> and further <b>parts,</b> that might be {{in direct contact with}} drinking water. Lead is added to these alloys in order to improve their machinability. It is well known that lead is unhealthy for humans and, according to EU Council Directive 98 / 83 /EC on the quality of water for human consumption, the admissible Pb content in drinking water has to decrease during the next years because of its high toxicity. The interest in improving public health evocated the need of developing new ecological materials for application on water piping and systems because extensive research indicates that the occurrence of increased Pb content in drinking water can be due to the release (leaching) of Pb from leaded copper alloys. As a consequence of such findings, the dissolution /erosion behaviour of a commercial sanitary brass tap, submitted to a dynamic test simulating the service conditions, has been studied. For that purpose an equipment that enables a long – term direct contact with water has been designed and developed. The chemical composition of the tap and of the final residue produced during the test have been determined by XRF spectrometry and the solutions analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Results concerning metal values dissolution have been compared with the limit values established by the legislation. For the experimental conditions, results show that Pb level in leaching solution is lower than the admissible value indicated for the quality of water for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide an {{evaluation}} of the criticality safety aspects of using up to 8 -in. -inner-diameter (ID) <b>piping</b> as <b>part</b> of a system to monitor the {sup 235 }U enrichment in uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) gas both before and after an enrichment down-blending operation. The evaluated operation does not include the blending stage but includes only the monitors and the piping directly associated with the monitors, which are in a separate room from the blending operation. There are active controls in place to limit the enrichment of the blended UF{sub 6 } to a maximum of 5 weight percent (wt%) {sup 235 }U. Under normal operating conditions of temperature and pressure, the UF{sub 6 } will stay in the gas phase and criticality will not be credible. The two accidents of concern are solidification of the UF{sub 6 } along with some hydrofluoric acid (HF) and water or moisture ingress, which would cause the UF{sub 6 } gas to react and form a hydrated uranyl fluoride (UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 }) solid or solution. Of these two types of accidents, the addition of water and formation of UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } is the most reactive scenario and thus limits related to UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } will bound the limits related to UF{sub 6 }. Two types of systems are included in the monitoring process. The first measures the enrichment of the approximately 90 wt% enriched UF{sub 6 } before it is blended. This system uses a maximum 4 -in. -(10. 16 -cm-) ID pipe, which is smaller than the 13. 7 -cm-cylinder-diameter subcritical limit for UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } solution of any enrichment as given in Table 1 of American National Standard ANSI/ANS- 8. 1. 1 Therefore, this system poses no criticality concerns for either accident scenario. The second type of system includes two enrichment monitors for lower-enriched UF{sub 6 }. One monitors the approximately 1. 5 wt% enriched UF{sub 6 } entering the blending process, and the second monitors the approximately 5 wt% enriched UF{sub 6 } coming out of the blending process. Both use a maximum 8 -in. -(20. 32 -cm-) ID piping, where the length of the larger ID piping is approximately 9. 5 m. This diameter of piping is below the 26. 6 -cm-cylinder-diameter subcritical limit for 5 wt% enriched UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } solutions as given in Table 6 of ANSI/ANS- 8. 1. Therefore, for up to 5 wt% enriched UF{sub 6 }, this piping does not present a criticality concern for either accident scenario. Calculations were performed to determine the enrichment level at which criticality could become a concern in these 8 -in. -ID piping sections. Both unreflected and fully water-reflected conditions were considered...|$|R
40|$|Current levee {{analysis}} and design standards require {{the assumption of}} fully developed steady-state flow conditions for estimation of susceptibility of a levee to underseepage and/or piping via calculation of average uplift gradients. The use of steady state analysis conditions is generally considered the most critical scenario {{in terms of the}} development of pore pressure through and under the embankment; however, steady state seepage is not necessarily representative of real flooding conditions. Therefore, the objective of this research was to explore the transient development of pore pressure within and underneath a levee embankment, and to evaluate the influence of roots and animal burrows on the potential for development of preferential seepage and/or <b>piping.</b> The first <b>part</b> of this dissertation focused on an assessment of the importance of transient seepage analysis in the estimation of heave or uplift gradients in levees for cases where a fine-grained blanket overlays a coarse aquifer layer. A series of analyses was performed to compare steady state and transient uplift gradients as a function of site geometry, aquifer and blanket hydraulic conductivity and flood duration. The results show that for high conductivity aquifers the transient seepage gradients exceed 90 % of the steady state values within a few days during a flood event. However, for other geometries and flood durations, steady state seepage is overly conservative. Therefore, transient seepage analyses should be considered for newly designed levees or levees that are being re-constructed, assuming the sites are well characterized with respect to the geometry and properties of the foundation deposits. The second part of the research focused on the assessment of the effects of woody vegetation and animal burrowing on levee performance, particularly seepage through the embankments. The results of two field seepage tests and the mapping of burrows at two test sites were used to provide prototype conditions for the transient seepage analyses. In general, the seepage tests showed that tree roots/root balls” tended to inhibit seepage front propagation and live roots did not serve as conduits for water as has been postulated in previous studies. The animal burrows, on the other hand, clearly presented readily available seepage paths when open to the waterside of the levee. The density of the burrows and their linear extent was found to be a function of the available food source, vegetation cover, and the frequency with which the burrows were eliminated. However, animal burrows that are not open to the water side do not fill with water until full saturation is reached at the burrow/tunnel wall. This outcome can be shown analytically or through numerical simulations as shown herein. Consequently, the results show that the continuity, the length of the burrows, location of the burrows, and degree of saturation all {{play a role in the}} development of through seepage with the through going burrows/pipes clearly providing a direct seepage path and an opportunity for piping to occur. On the other hand, burrows from the land side of the levees that do not penetrate completely do not start to flow with a significant velocity until after the adjacent soil mass is completely saturated...|$|R
