40|$|Increasing energy {{demands and}} the drive towards low carbon (C) energy sources has {{prompted}} a {{rapid increase in}} ground-mounted solar parks across the world. This represents a significant global land use change with implications for the hosting ecosystems that are poorly understood. In order to investigate {{the effects of a}} typical solar park on the microclimate and ecosystem processes, we measured soil and air microclimate, vegetation and greenhouse gas emissions for twelve months under photovoltaic (<b>PV)</b> <b>arrays,</b> in gaps between <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> and in control areas at a UK solar park sited on species-rich grassland. Our results show that the <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> caused seasonal and diurnal variation in air and soil microclimate. Specifically, during the summer we observed cooling, of up to 5. 2 °C, and drying under the <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> compared with gap and control areas. In contrast, during the winter gap areas were up to 1. 7 °C cooler compared with under the <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> and control areas. Further, the diurnal variation in both temperature and humidity during the summer was reduced under the <b>PV</b> <b>arrays.</b> We found microclimate and vegetation management explained differences in the above ground plant biomass and species diversity, with both lower under the <b>PV</b> <b>arrays.</b> Photosynthesis and net ecosystem exchange in spring and winter were also lower under the <b>PV</b> <b>arrays,</b> explained by microclimate, soil and vegetation metrics. These data are a starting point to develop understanding of the effects of solar parks in other climates, and provide evidence to support the optimisation of solar park design and management to maximise the delivery of ecosystem services from this growing land use...|$|R
40|$|Several {{airports}} in the US have recently installed large photovoltaic (<b>PV)</b> <b>arrays</b> near air-operations areas to offset energy demands, and the US Federal Aviation Administration has published guidelines for new solar installations on airport properties. Although an increased reliance on solar energy will likely benefit airports from {{environmental and economic}} perspectives, bird use of solar installations should be exam-ined before wide-scale implementation to determine whether such changes in land use adversely affect aviation safety by increasing risk of bird-aircraft collisions. We studied bird use of five pairs of <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> and nearby airport grasslands in Arizona, Colorado, and Ohio, over one year. Across locations, we observed 46 species of birds in airfield grasslands compared to 37 species in <b>PV</b> <b>arrays.</b> We calculated a bird hazard index (BHI) based on the mean seasonal mass of birds per area surveyed. General linear model analysis indicated that BHI was influenced by season, with higher BHI in summer than fall and winter. We found no effect of treatment (<b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> vs. airfields), location, or interactions among predictors. However, using a nonparametric two-group test across all seasons and locations, we found greater BHI in airfield grass-lands than <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> for those species considered especially hazardous to aircraft (species 3 ̆e 1. 125 kg). Our results suggest that converting airport grasslands to <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> would not increase hazards associated with bird-aircraft collisions...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} automatically detecting small-scale solar photovoltaic arrays for behind-the-meter energy resource assessment in high resolution aerial imagery. Such algorithms offer a faster and more cost-effective solution to collecting information on distributed solar photovoltaic (<b>PV)</b> <b>arrays,</b> such as their location, capacity, and generated energy. The surface area of <b>PV</b> <b>arrays,</b> a characteristic which can be estimated from aerial imagery, provides an important proxy for array capacity and energy generation. In this work, we employ a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, called SegNet (Badrinarayanan et. al., 2015), to semantically segment (or map) <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> in aerial imagery. This builds on previous work focused on identifying the locations of <b>PV</b> <b>arrays,</b> as opposed to their specific shapes and sizes. We measure the ability of our SegNet implementation to estimate the surface area of <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> on a large, publicly available, dataset that has been employed in several previous studies.

40|$|The Photovoltaic (PV) {{energy is}} one of the {{renewable}} energies that attracts attention of researchers in the recent decades. Since the conversion efficiency of <b>PV</b> <b>arrays</b> is very low, it requires maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control techniques to extract the maximum available power from <b>PV</b> <b>arrays.</b> In this paper, two categories of MPPT algorithms, namely indirect and direct methods are discussed.
