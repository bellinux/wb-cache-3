5000|$|Cameroon has an {{extremely}} heterogeneous population, consisting of approximately 250 ethnic groups. Cameroon Highlanders constitute the [...] at 38 {{percent of the}} total population. They include the Bamileke and the Bamoun. The coastal tropical forest peoples, including the Bassa, Douala, and many smaller entities account for about 12 percent of the population. In the southern tropical forest, ethnic groups include the Ewondo, Bulu, and Fang (all Beti subgroups), and the Maka and Pygmies (officially called Bakas). They account for about 18 percent of the population. The Fulani (Fulɓe; Peul or <b>Peuhl)</b> account for about 14 percent of the population and the Kirdi account for about 18 percent.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} names (and spellings of the names) {{used in other}} {{languages}} {{to refer to the}} Fulɓe. Fulani in English is borrowed from the Hausa term. Fula, from Manding languages, is also used in English, and sometimes spelled Fulah or Fullah. Fula and Fulani are commonly used in English, including within Africa. The French borrowed the Wolof term Pël, which is variously spelled: Peul, Peulh, and even <b>Peuhl.</b> More recently the Fulfulde / Pulaar term Fulɓe, which is a plural noun (singular, Pullo) has been Anglicised as Fulbe, which some people use. In Portuguese, the terms Fula or Futafula are used. The terms Fallata Fallatah or Fellata are of Kanuri origins, and are often the ethnonyms by which Fulani people are identified by in Sudan.|$|E
40|$|Kanwa' is {{a mineral}} salt that is {{extracted}} from the subsoil in northeastern Nigeria. It is transported to the sub-humid zone {{of the country where}} it is sold to <b>Peuhl</b> Pastoralists who use it to supplement their cattle feed. According to a recent study of the International Livestock Centre for Africe (ILCA), ' Kanwa ' can also be used as a fertilizer. It contains a wide variety of elements, such as phosphorus and copper, which are missing in certain Nigerian soils. ILCA researchers have also analysed its effect on plant growth. Trials with plots of Stylosanthes hamata, a nitrogen-fixing forage, have been quite encouraging. Another point in favour of kanwa is its low price: between 8 - 10 naira (about US $ 10 - 12. 50) per 100 kilos (220 pounds). Used in conjunction with phosphorus to fertilize nitrogen-fixing crops, it could improve agricultural productivity at less cost than commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Before promoting the use of kanwa as an inorganic fertilizer, however, research must be continued to estimate Nigeria's reserves of kanwa, to determine the optimum doses for different crops and soils, and to compare {{the costs and benefits of}} this new use of a mineral salt traditionally used to supplement cattle feed.

40|$|Background: In Mali, malaria is {{the leading}} cause of death and the primary cause of {{outpatient}} visits for children under five. The twin towns of Mopti and Sévaré have historically had high under-five mortality. This paper investigates the changing malaria burden in children under five in these two towns for the years 1998 - 2006, and the likely contribution of previous interventions aimed at reducing malaria. Methods: A retrospective analysis of daily outpatient consultation records from urban community health centres (CSCOMs) located in Mopti and Sévaré for the years 1998 - 2006 was conducted. Risk factors for a diagnosis of presumptive malaria, using logistic regression and trends in presumptive malaria diagnostic rates, were assessed using multilevel analysis. Results: Between 1998 - 2006, presumptive malaria accounted for 33. 8 % of all recorded consultation diagnoses (10, 123 out of 29, 915). The monthly presumptive malaria diagnostic rate for children under five decreased by 66 % (average of 8 diagnoses per month per 1, 000 children in 1998 to 2. 7 diagnoses per month in 2006). The multi-level analysis related 37 % of this decrease to the distribution of bed net treatment kits initiated in May of 2001. Children of the Fulani (<b>Peuhl)</b> ethnicity had significantly lower odds of a presumptive malaria diagnosis when compared to children of other ethnic groups...|$|E

40|$|Groundnut haulms {{along with}} cowpea hay are major crop {{residues}} used for animal fattening in the West African Sahel. In traditional sheep fattening, feeds are always provided ad-hoc and in an unregulated fashion, which is rather wasteful. As a preliminary study to establish the optimal feeding levels of groundnut haulms for profitable sheep fattening, a feeding trial was conducted for 70 days with four levels of groundnut haulms (0, 150, 300 and 450 g/day) and a basal diet of bush hay. The effects of supplementation with groundnut haulms on feed intake, water consumption, live weight changes and economic return were determined. Twenty-four <b>Peuhl</b> Oudah rams with average initial weight of 28. 6 kg (SD = 1. 4) were randomly allocated to four treatments defined by the four levels of groundnut haulms in the diet. Faeces and urine were collected in weeks 5 and 9 of the trial. Digestible organic matter intake (g/(kg LW) 0. 75) and nitrogen intake (g/day) increased linearly {{with the level of}} groundnut haulms offered. Sheep that were fed only bush hay lost 18. 4 g/day, while those that were offered 150, 300 and 450 g of groundnut haulms gained 1. 4, 19. 3 and 40. 2 g/day, respectively. The gross return ranged from 1883 to 4946 FCFA per ram. Net benefit, after removing the feed and veterinary costs from the gross return, ranged from 368 to 1400 FCFA per ra...|$|E
40|$|Coagulant {{properties}} {{present in}} the latex extracted from Calotropis procera (fam. Asclepiadaceae) are well known. This extract is used by <b>Peuhl</b> community in Benin to produce Wagashi, a cheese known in West African states. From literature {{it is known that}} a wide number of chemical compounds were extracted, including cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, phenol compounds, terpenoids, and 2 proteolytic enzymes: calotropain FI and calotropain FII. Proteolytic enzymes that are {{present in the}} latex of Calotropis procera undergo easily oxidizing phenomena and for this reason their activity declines after 1 or 2 d. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the proteolytic enzyme present in Calotropis procera is the only factor influencing milk coagulation, and finally if it can be stabilized. The extract from Calotropis was autoclaved at 100 °C to denaturate the proteolytic enzyme used for the milk coagulation. Its gelation activity was also verified. Several trials on the stabilization of the proteolytic enzyme, which contained active sites of cystein, were performed using extract from potato or natural flour from tapioca, gari, carob gum, and an antioxidant compound rich in cystein, glycin, and glutamic acid. The best results were obtained with extract from potato tuber and the antioxidant compound. Results showed clearly that the coagulation process of milk was exclusively enzymatic. The proteolytic enzymes calotropain FI and calotropain FII present in Calotropis procera were stabilized successfully for several months and preserved their proteolytic activity in both types of trials. This would allow in the future to have a proteolytic enzyme readilyavailable to produce Wagashi cheese in a traditional way...|$|E

Children of the Fulani (<b>Peuhl)</b> ethnicity had significantly lower odds of a presumptive malaria diagnosis when compared to children of other ethnic groups. Conclusions Presumptive malaria diagnostic rates have decreased between 1998 - 2006 among health care-seeking children under five in Mopti and Sévaré. A bed net treatment kit intervention conducted in 2001 is likely to have contributed to this decline. The results corroborate previous findings that suggest that the Fulani ethnicity is protective against malaria. The findings are useful to encourage dialogue around the urban malaria situation in Mali, particularly in the context of achieving the target of reducing malaria morbidity in children younger than five by 50 % by 2011 as compared to levels in 2000. </p...|$|E
