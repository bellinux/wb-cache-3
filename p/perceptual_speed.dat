40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to report how verbal {{rehearsal}} speed (VRS), a form of covert speech used to maintain verbal information in working memory, and another verbal processing <b>speed</b> measure, <b>perceptual</b> encoding <b>speed,</b> are related to 3 domains of executive function (EF) at risk in cochlear implant (CI) users: verbal working memory, fluency-speed, and inhibition-concentration. Method: EF, speech perception, and language outcome measures were obtained from 55 prelingually deaf, long-term CI users and matched controls with normal hearing (NH controls). Correlational analyses were used to assess relations between VRS (articulation rate), <b>perceptual</b> encoding <b>speed</b> (digit and color naming), and the outcomes in each sample.

Verbal rehearsal speed was related to 2 EF domains in the NH sample but was unrelated to EF outcomes in CI users. <b>Perceptual</b> encoding <b>speed</b> was related to all EF domains in both groups.

40|$|Borders {{defined by}} {{small changes in}} {{brightness}} (luminance contrast) or by differences in colour (chromatic contrast) appear to move more slowly than those defined by strong luminance contrast(1 - 4). As spatial coding is influenced by motion(5 - 7), if placed in close proximity, {{the different types of}} moving border might appear to drift apart(8). Using this configuration, we show here that observers instead report a clear illusory spatial jitter of the low-luminance-contrast boundary. This visible interaction between motion and spatial-position coding occurred at a characteristic rate (similar to 22. 3 Hz), although the stimulus motion was continuous and invariant. The jitter rate did not vary with the speed of movement. The jitter was not due to small involuntary movements of the eyes, because it only occurred at a specific point within the stimulus, the low-luminance-contrast boundary.

Studies investigating cognitive impairments in people with poly-drug use are limited. This study is designed to assess executive functions of patients with dual drug dependence (DDD) on opioid and (Amphetamine-Type Stimulants) ATS entering medication-assisted-treatment at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Methodology: A total of n= 96 male respondents (n= 56 patients, and n= 40 control group) were recruited for this cross-sectional study.

40|$|In visual hemi-neglect, non-spatial deficits such as reduced {{intrinsic}} alertness {{can significantly}} modulate {{the degree of}} left visual field inattention. However, to date, the precise mechanisms mediating this effect are hardly understood. In the present study, we assessed the influence of increased alertness on both general attentional capacity (<b>perceptual</b> processing <b>speed)</b> and spatial attentional selection processes (spatial distribution of attentional weighting). For this purpose, a whole-report paradigm based on Bundesen's ‘theory of visual attention’ (TVA) was combined with a non-spatial, visual alerting cue. Three different cue-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs; of 80, 200, and 650 ms), allowed us to observe {{the time course of}} the alerting-cue effects. A group of six patients with visual hemi-neglect was examined and their performance compared with six healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, and education. In neglect patients, the alerting cue evoked a phasic increase of <b>perceptual</b> processing <b>speed.</b> However, this effect was mainly found in the ipsilateral, i. e. in the “preserved” hemifield. Importantly, however, patients displayed a fast-evolving and short-lasting, phasic modulation of spatial attentional weighting, with a re-distribution of attentional weights from the pathological rightward bias to a normal, more balanced distribution of visual attention. In control participants, the cueing effects on <b>perceptual</b> processing <b>speed</b> and spatial weighting were generally less pronounced than in neglect patients. Replicating results of a prior study, cueing induced a stable, slightly leftward, distribution of attentional weights, whilst in the no-cue condition, a temporary rightward shift of attentional weights was found. This pattern of effects suggests a close interaction between alertness and spatial-attentional weighting in the syndrome of visual hemi-neglect. It supports the hypothesis that the manifestation of spatial neglect involves at least in part intrinsic alertness deficits. It also provides clues to a more detailed account of the mechanisms responsible for alleviating neglect in patients following manipulations of the alertness level, both in the short (cueing) and in the long term (alertness training) ...|$|R

40|$|The A allele of the Fras 1 -related {{extracellular}} matrix protein 3 (FREM 3) rs 7676614 {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) was linked to major depressive disorder (MDD) in an early genome-wide association study (GWAS), and to symptoms of psychomotor retardation in a follow-up investigation. In line with significant overlap between age- and depression-related molecular pathways, parallel work has shown that FREM 3 expression in postmortem human brain decreases with age. Here we probe the effect of rs 7676614 on amygdala reactivity and <b>perceptual</b> processing <b>speed,</b> {{both of which are}} altered in depression and aging. Amygdala reactivity was assessed using a face-matching BOLD fMRI paradigm in 365 Caucasian participants in the Duke Neurogenetics Study (192 women, mean age 19. 7 ± 1. 2). <b>Perceptual</b> processing <b>speed</b> was indexed by reaction times in the same task and the Trails Making Test (TMT). The effect of rs 7676614 on FREM 3 mRNA brain expression levels was probed in a postmortem cohort of 169 Caucasian individuals (44 women, mean age 50. 8 ± 14. 9). The A allele of rs 7676614 was associated with blunted amygdala reactivity to faces, slower reaction times in the face-matching condition (p< 0. 04), as well as marginally slower performance on TMT Part B (p= 0. 056). In the postmortem cohort, the T allele of rs 6537170 (proxy for the rs 7676614 A allele), was associated with trend-level reductions in gene expression in Brodmann areas 11 and 47 (p= 0. 066), reminiscent of patterns characteristic of older age. The low-expressing allele of another FREM 3 SNP (rs 1391187) was similarly associated with reduced amygdala reactivity and slower TMT Part B speed, in addition to reduced BA 47 activity and Extraversion (p< 0. 05).

ADHD patients showed significant reductions of working memory storage capacity of a moderate to large effect size. <b>Perceptual</b> processing <b>speed,</b> task-based, and spatial selection were unaffected.

40|$|The {{cognitive}} causes {{as well as}} the neurological {{and genetic}} basis of developmental dyslexia, a complex disorder of written language acquisition, are intensely discussed with regard to multiple-deficit models. Accumulating evidence has revealed dyslexics’ impairments in a variety of tasks requiring visual attention.

This first parameter-based group study of attentional components in developmental dyslexia addresses potentially altered attentional components that have recently been associated with parietal dysfunctions in dyslexia. We aimed to isolate the general attentional resources that might underlie reduced span performance, i. e., either a deficient working memory storage capacity, or a slowing in visual <b>perceptual</b> processing <b>speed,</b> or both. Furthermore, by analysing attentional selectivity in dyslexia, we addressed a potential lateralized abnormality of visual attention, i. e., a previously suggested rightward spatial deviation compared to normal readers.
