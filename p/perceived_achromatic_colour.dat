40|$|We {{investigated}} in three separate experiments the <b>perceived</b> <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour,</b> transparency, and phenomenal attributes of concentric-circle neon-brightness-spreading displays. Stimuli {{were obtained by}} varying the luminances of the outer arc (OA) and inner arc (IA) of circle, while keeping the background luminance constant. In the first experiment, observers modified the luminance of an adjustable region to match the achromatic colour of the central area of the displays; additional adjustments were performed on sets of control figures without IA (subjective figures) and without OA. In the second experiment, observers judged the transparency of the central area of the displays using either numerical ratings or dichotomous judgments. In the third experiment, they used four possible categories (light, shadow, filter, opaque) to describe {{the appearance of the}} displays. Only displays with intermediate background luminance were perceived as non-transparent. Displays with intermediate IA luminance were seen as transparent filters, whereas those with intermediate OA luminance were categorised as either lights or shadows, depending on luminance polarity. Adjustment data show that a simple contrast rule accounts well for induction effects in OA-only and IA-only figures. Data concerning complete figures show an interaction between OA and IA luminances in determining the percept; in particular, the contrast effect of OA luminance appears modulated by IA luminance in a nonmonotonic fashion. We discuss the implications of these findings on our current understanding of the mechanisms of neon brightness and colour spreading...|$|E
40|$|Four {{experiments}} are reported, {{the aim of}} which was to explore the achromatic-colour and distance relations that determine the probability of achromatic surfaces grouping perceptually. The first two experiments were performed to test Wertheimer's conjecture that similarity and dissimilarity of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> jointly determine grouping. The results indicate that only similarity of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> determines grouping. Data from the other two experiments show that grouping is determined by absolute, relative, and Gillam's distances.

The results of an experiment designed to test whether grouping of achromatic surfaces depends on one or on both of these differences are here reported.

The problem of whether colour constancy also occurs when variegated stimuli are completely covered by a filter has been studied less often and with mixed results.

Our results show poor <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> constancy. Depending on the filter and the colour of the areas of the Mondrian, the grey colours of the Mondrian seen through the filter shifted from the expected grey colour by up to more than two Munsell steps in the 10 -step grey scale. We also found that the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> shifts caused by failure of constancy were asymmetrical.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of synesthesia {{has received a}} great deal of interest recently in the scientific literature. Many previous studies stressed the unidirectional nature of this phenomenon.

40|$|Color-grapheme synesthetes {{automatically}} <b>perceive</b> <b>achromatic</b> {{numbers as}} colored (e. g. 7 is turquoise). Up until recently, synesthesia {{was believed to}} be unidirectional. For instance, the number 7 gives rise to the percept of turquoise but the perception of turquoise does not trigger the number 7. However, some recent studies argue for bidirectional connections (Cohen Kadosh et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 2007; Knoch et al. 2005). In this study, a multiplication verification task (e. g. 7 x 2 = 14, true/false?) was used to test bidirectionality. In agreement with previous studies we observed that the presentation of colors evokes numerical magnitudes. The current findings add two important notions to previous studies: (a) The influence of color on the processing of numerical information can be extended to multiplication verification tasks and (b) The perception of color can both facilitate and interfere with the processing of digit-related information.

Likewise, discriminating aurally presented digit targets took longer when the color of the prime was incongruent with the synesthetic percept for the target. These priming effects were absent in non-synesthetes. We conclude that binding between digits and colors in grapheme-color synesthetes can occur bidirectionally across senses.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine whether {{fostering}} positive activating affect during multimedia learning enhances learning outcome. University students were randomly assigned to either a multimedia learning environment designed to induce positive activating affect through the use of “warm” colours and rounded shapes (n= 61) or an affectively neutral environment that used <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> and sharp edges (n= 50). Participants learned about the topic of functional neuroanatomy for 20 minutes and had to answer several questions for comprehension and transfer afterwards. Affective states as well as achievement goal orientations were investigated before and after the learning phase using questionnaires. The results show that participants in the affectively positive environment were superior in comprehension as well as transfer when initial affect was strong. Preexperimental positive affect was therefore a predictor of comprehension and a moderator for transfer. Goal orientations did not influence these effects.

40|$|It {{has been}} informally shown [Gilchrist et al, 1999 Psychological Review 106 795 - 834; Adelson, 2000, in The New Cognitive Neurosciences Ed. M Gazzaniga (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) ] that {{simultaneous}} lightness contrast (SLC) is enhanced when {{the dark and}} light surrounds of the classic display are replaced by articulated fields of equivalent average luminances. We explored this effect systematically, by comparing dark and light homogeneous and articulated surrounds in all possible combinations. Relative to their surrounds, the two targets could be double increments in luminance, double decrements, or one increment and one decrement. Observers adjusted the luminance of one target to match the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> of the other. Gilchrist et al's (1999) anchoring model accounts for increased SLC on articulated surrounds by assuming that (i) SLC occurs because in the local framework (target plus immediate surround) the incremental target is white rather than grey, and (ii) increasing the articulation of such a surround causes a stronger weighting of the local framework, thus magnifying {{the difference between the}} two targets. Our results are consistent with the first but not with the second assumption, and are discussed in the light of a modified version of the anchoring model...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} grey shades in {{a visual}} scene {{can be derived}} from relative luminance values only when an anchoring rule is given. The anchoring theory of lightness (Gilchrist et al, 1999 Psychological Review 106 795 - 834) assumes that the highest luminance is perceived as white, and the appearance of all the other regions depends on their relationship to such white. It is thus a crucial prediction of the theory that equal regions representing luminance increments relative to their surrounds shall be perceived as identical. Our stimuli were incremental targets on two uniform surrounds placed side by side. We used the method of adjustment: observers varied the luminance of the test patch (set on a black surround) to match the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> of the comparison patch (set on a variable surround). We found that a target on a black surround looks always lighter than the same target on a more luminant surround.

40|$|Each year {{millions}} of greyscale reproductions of colour images are made. The {{majority of these}} are produced by removing the chromatic information, which leaves a greyscale made by just the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> variable. One problem with this approach is {{how to make a}} greyscales for images that contain equilumiant edges and/or borders in a way that preserves the image content In our experiment we evaluated some of the more recent algorithmic attempts to tackle the colour-to-greyscale problem, and compared the performance of these methods against greyscale images created manually by human observers. We used an image preference experiment where 10 participants carried out pair-wise comparisons of greyscales produced by 5 different mathematical algorithms and 1 human. Overall, we employed 10 different test images with varying amounts of equiluminant detail, and included images with different levels of content complexity (ranging from outdoor scenes to pie charts). We find that two algorithms significantly outperform the other computational techniques (including luminance), and that these algorithms both attempt to preserve local colour contrast in the greyscale algorithms. Furthermore, we find that neither of these techniques is significantly preferred over human greyscales. Finally, the interactions between images and algorithm are strong, indicating that image content is important in deciding which is the best greyscale version. These results support the motivation for this research area: there are better ways to convert colour to greyscale than simply using luminance and that images created by human observers are comparable to those produced by algorithms...|$|R
30|$|The {{patterns}} {{we investigated}} {{are black and}} white, but individual cones are red, green or blue (M, L or S), and RGCs of different types exhibit different colour opponency properties and prevalences and thus different resolutions for different opponent colours. Thus, the contrasts for {{a black and white}} image that occur in the retina must be mediated by B–Y or R–G opponents, with the former being primary in mammals [137]. To explore the different spatial frequency characteristics of different RGC types, DeValois and DeValois [138] investigated both chromatic and achromatic versions of the checkerboard illusion. For chromatic and achromatic images of the same size, they demonstrated the assimilation in chromatic checkerboards where there was contrast for the achromatic version. They explained that assimilation effect is due to the chromatic system having much lower spatial frequencies compared to the achromatic system. For the Tile Illusions, Westheimer [139] investigate an isoluminant heterochromatic version of one sample Bulge pattern [109] and suggest that the illusion can disappear when the black and white tiles are replaced by isoluminant ones. Although this is not clear in the isoluminant version presented in the article, it can be expected for the above reasons at certain sizes and scales. More psychophysical experiments are needed to clarify the role of colour in Tile Illusions, including testing these illusions in both chromatic and <b>achromatic</b> versions on <b>colour</b> blind people as well as normal subjects. Shapiro [140] developed a quantitative model for the visual response of the cone cells with two separate pathways, one for luminance and chromatic information and one for contrast information. He presented the output of the model for disc-ring stimulus containing two discs of identical chromaticity and luminance, one surrounded by light ring and one surrounded by a dark ring. He showed that the contrast pathway appears to have a faster response compared to the colour pathway (Fig.  5 in [140]). A quantitative model of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> computation of similar stimulus used in [140] has been investigated by Rudd and Zemach [141] based on a distance-dependent edge integration mechanism. They have shown the outperformance of the edge integration model over the highest luminance rules of Anchoring theory [26].|$|R

Findings demonstrated that single colours and paired colours both affect warmth perception in interiors. The effects of single colours in interiors are subtle in warmth perception: red is perceived warmer than green and green is perceived warmer than white. All single colours have a moderate level of warmth in interiors as pairs, consequently red (warm colour) appears to increase and white (<b>achromatic</b> <b>colour)</b> appears to decrease the warmth perception of their pairs. Furthermore, as single materials timber and fabric have the same level of warmth and are warmer than plasterboard whereas there is not any difference between pairs.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis thesis {{investigates the}} role of colour in the {{cognitive}} processesing of emotional information. The research is guided by the effect of colour diagnosticity which has been shown previously to influence recognition performance of several types of objects as well as natural scenes. The research presented in Experiment 1 examined whether colour information is considered a diagnostic perceptual feature of seven emotional categories: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise and neutral. Participants (N = 119), who were naïve to the specific purpose and expectations of the experiment, chose colour {{more than any other}} perceptual quality (e. g. shape and tactile information) as a feature that describes the seven emotional categories. The specific colour features given for the six basic emotions were consistently different from those given to the non-emotional neutral category. While emotional categories were often described by chromatic colour features (e. g. red, blue, orange) the neutral category was often ascribed <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> features (e. g. white, grey, transparent) as the most symptomatic perceptual qualities for its description. The emotion 'anger' was unique in being the only emotion showing an agreement higher that 50 % of the total given colour features for one particular colour - red. Confirming that colour is a diagnostic feature of emotions led to the examination of the effect of diagnostic colours of emotion on recognition memory for emotional words and faces: the effect, if any, of appropriate and inappropriate colours (matched with emotion) on the strength of memory for later recognition of faces and words (Experiments 2 & 3). The two experiments used retention intervals of 15 minutes and one week respectively and the colour-emotion associations were determined for each individual participant. Results showed that regardless of the subject’s consistency level in associating colours with emotions, and compared with the individual inappropriate or random colours, individual appropriate colours of emotions significantly enhance recognition memory for six basic emotional faces and words. This difference between the individual inappropriate colours or random colours and the individual appropriate colours of emotions was not found to be significant for non-emotional neutral stimuli. Post hoc findings from both experiments further show that appropriate colours of emotion are associated more consistently than inappropriate colours of emotions. This suggests that appropriate colour-emotion associations are unique both in their strength of association and in the form of their representation. Experiment 4 therefore aimed to investigate whether appropriate colour-emotion associations also trigger an implicit automatic cognitive system that allows faster naming times for appropriate versus inappropriate colours of emotional word carriers. Results from the combined Emotional-Semantic Stroop task confirm the above hypothesis and therefore imply that colour plays a substantial role not only in our conceptual representations of objects but also in our conceptual representations of basic emotions. The resemblance of the present findings collectively to those found previously for objects and natural scenes suggests a common cognitive mechanism for the processing of emotional diagnostic colours and the processing of diagnostic colours of objects or natural scenes. Overall, this thesis provides the foundation for many future directions of {{research in the area of}} colour and emotion as well as a few possible immediate practical implications...|$|R

Our results suggest that the black tail patterns, especially spots on T 5, are important for sex discrimi-nation, but only in combination with other melanin-based or morphological features. The presence of black tail spots on T 5 is also an indicator of male age. However, {{there is no indication that}} presence, size and asymmetry of these black spots are indicators of indi-vidual quality of both sexes in the terms of breeding performances...|$|R
40|$|Gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{afterglow}} {{observations in}} the Swift era have a <b>perceived</b> lack of <b>achromatic</b> jet breaks {{compared to the}} BeppoSAX or pre-Swift era. Specifically, relatively few breaks, consistent with jet breaks, are observed in the X-ray light curves of these bursts. If these breaks are truly missing, it has serious consequences on the interpretation of GRB jet collimation and energy requirements, {{and the use of}} GRBs as cosmological tools. Here, we address the issue of X-ray breaks that are possibly 'hidden' and hence the light curves are misinterpreted as being single power laws. We do so by synthesizing X-ray telescope (XRT) light curves and fitting both single and broken power laws, and comparing the relative goodness of each fit via Monte Carlo analysis. Even with the well-sampled light curves of the Swift era, these breaks may be left misidentified, hence caution is required when making definite statements on the absence of achromatic breaks...|$|R

We show how a number of precedents, including GRB 990510 & GRB 060206, exist for such hidden breaks and how, even with the well sampled light curves of the Swift era, these breaks may be left misidentified. We do so by synthesising X-ray light curves and finding general trends via Monte Carlo analysis. Furthermore, in light of these simulations, we discuss how to best identify achromatic breaks in afterglow light curves via multi-wavelength analysis...|$|R

40|$|Many {{biological}} and artificial neural networks require the parallel extraction of multiple features, and meet this requirement with distinct populations of neurons that are selective to one {{property of the}} stimulus while being non-selective to another property. In this way, several populations can resolve a set of features independently of each other, and thus achieve a parallel mode of processing. This raises the question how an initially homogeneous population of neurons segregates into groups with distinct and complementary response properties. Using a colour image sequence recorded from a camera mounted {{on the head of}} a freely behaving cat, we train a network of neurons to achieve optimally stable responses, that is, responses that change minimally over time. This objective leads to the development of colour-selective neurons. Adding a second objective, decorrelating activity within the network, a subpopulation of neurons develops with <b>achromatic</b> response properties. <b>Colour</b> selective neurons tend to be non-oriented while achromatic neurons are orientation-tuned. The proposed objective thus successfully leads to the segregation of neurons into complementary populations that are either selective for colour or orientation...|$|R
40|$|Gamma-ray burst {{afterglow}} {{observations in}} the Swift era have a <b>perceived</b> lack of <b>achromatic</b> jet breaks {{compared with the}} BeppoSAX era. We present our multi-wavelength analysis of GRB 060206 as an illustrative example of how inferences of jet breaks from optical and X-ray data might differ. The results of temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fit the data {{within the context of}} the standard blast wave model. We find that while the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it from the X-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromatic break at about 16 h. This break and the light curves fit standard blast wave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. As the pre-Swift sample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the Swift era most well-sampled light curves are in the X-ray, caution is needed when making a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definite statements on the absence of achromatic breaks. ...|$|R
