In most cases, parts made of silicon tombac, are produced through the high pressure die casting process, which is normally specialized on metals with relatively low melting temperatures. But in this case the temperature melting range of silicon tombac is in the area of 950 to 1000 °C, which is relatively high for casting into permanent moulds. The advantage is the productivity of this highly automated casting process.

The calculations should really result in quantitatively correct temperature fields in casting and mould. For this reason the non-stationary heat transfer resistance between melt/casting and mould was measured {{as a function of}} the solidification time, the interface temperature, the geometric conditions as well as the influence of coatings. Both heat flow density (q) as well as heat transfer coefficient (#alpha#) show a characteristic, time-dependent course. During gap formation #alpha# and q fall very quickly on subsequently constant values. A further decrease of #alpha# and q due to an assimilation of the boundary surface temperatures ensues not before solidification of the casting is finished. Moreover the results show, that the heat transfer resistance depends in a characteristic way on casting thickness, mould preheating temperature and particularly on the kind and condition of the coating. The consideration of the found relationships in a FEM simulation program leads to very good agreements between measured and calculated temporal temperature changes in casting and moulds, both in the semi-industrial laboratory scale as well as at actual component (engine blocks, brake housings).

40|$|Abstract. Oxide {{coatings}} offer {{great potential}} for their use in forming operations in the semi-solid state. Advantages {{of these types of}} coatings are high resistance against abrasive wear, high hot hardness and low thermal conductivity. Nevertheless deposition by pulsed Magnetron Sputter Ion Plating-PVD for oxide coatings is quite challenging: deposition rates are low and insulating layers on the target surface can cause arcing. On laboratory scale it was possible to deposit γ-Alumina using PVD in a temperature range, where hot working steel can be utilized. The next important step in the development towards an industrial application for larger forming tools is the upscaling process to larger coating units. In this work the process development of oxide coatings on an industrial coating unit for large tools was described. To increase adhesion of oxide top-layer additional bond coats were applied. Different process parameters like oxygen content, total pressure and substrate bias were varied, to improve the performance. The relationship between coating properties and process parameters of the deposited films were characterized by X-Ray-diffraction, Nanoindentation and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). By using reactive pulsed PVD-process it was possible to deposit γ-Al 2 O 3 on large steel tools for semi-solid melt protection. The developed coatings showed for thixoforging processes of X 210 CrW 12 an extraordinary stability in field tests. The lifetime of the <b>permanent</b> <b>moulds</b> was increased by using PVD thin film coatings as a tool protection...|$|R
