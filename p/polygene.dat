5000|$|A <b>polygene,</b> {{multiple}} factor, multiple gene inheritance or quantitative gene is {{a member}} of a group of non-epistatic genes that interact additively to influence a phenotypic trait. The term [...] "polygene" [...] is usually used to refer to a hypothetical gene as {{it is often difficult to}} characterise the effect of an individual gene from the effects of other genes and the environment on a particular phenotype. Advances in statistical methodology and high throughput sequencing are, however, allowing researchers to locate candidate genes for the trait. In the case that such a gene is identified, it is referred to as a quantitative trait locus (QTL). These genes are generally pleiotropic as well. The genes that contribute to type 2 diabetes are thought to be mostly polygenes. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.|$|E

Six germination traits including imbibition rate, germination rate, germination index, root length, shoot length and vigor index were investigated. A mixed major gene and <b>polygene</b> inheritance model was applied to conduct genetic analysis for germination ability. Significant differences were detected in all the germination traits under salt stress among RILs in rice, and the early germination stage (0 – 5 days) might be the salt sensitive stage. The frequency distributions of the germination traits under salt stress in the RIL population showed continuous segregation, suggesting that they were quantitative traits controlled by several genes. The germination traits under salt stress were regulated by two or three major genes plus <b>polygene,</b> and mainly dominated by major genes with high heritability values, accounting for 12. 5 %– 99. 0 % of the total phenotypic variation.

40|$|Understanding {{the genetic}} {{architecture}} of quantitative traits can greatly assist {{the design of}} strategies for their manipulation in plant-breeding programs. For a number of traits, genetic variation can {{be the result of}} segregation of a few major genes and many <b>polygenes</b> (minor genes). The joint segregation analysis (JSA) is a maximum-likelihood approach for fitting segregation models through the simultaneous use of phenotypic information from multiple generations. Our objective in this paper was to use computer simulation to quantify the power of the JSA method for testing the mixed-inheritance model for quantitative traits when it was applied to the six basic generations: both parents (P- 1 and P- 2), F- 1, F- 2, and both backcross generations (B- 1 and B- 2) derived from crossing the F- 1 to each parent. A total of 1968 genetic model-experiment scenarios were considered in the simulation study to quantify the power of the method. Factors that interacted to influence the power of the JSA method to correctly detect genetic models were: (1) whether there were one or two major genes in combination with <b>polygenes,</b> (2) the heritability of the major genes and <b>polygenes,</b> (3) the level of dispersion of the major genes and <b>polygenes</b> between the two parents, and (4) the number of individuals examined in each generation (population size). The greatest levels of power were observed for the genetic models defined with simple inheritance; e. g., the power was greater than 90 % for the one major gene model, regardless of the population size and major-gene heritability. Lower levels of power were observed for the genetic models with complex inheritance (major genes and <b>polygenes),</b> low heritability, small population sizes and a large dispersion of favourable genes among the two parents; e. g., the power was less than 5 % for the two major-gene model with a heritability value of 0. 3 and population sizes of 100 individuals. The JSA methodology was then applied to a previously studied sorghum data-set to investigate the genetic control of the putative drought resistance-trait osmotic adjustment in three crosses. The previous study concluded that there were two major genes segregating for osmotic adjustment in the three crosses. Application of the JSA method resulted in a change in the proposed genetic model. The presence of the two major genes was confirmed with the addition of an unspecified number of <b>polygenes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} studies <b>polygene</b> mapping of a backcross population derived from haploid potato (Solanum tuberosum) and a diploid wild species (Solanum berthaultii) showed {{at least eight}} quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with tuber dormancy. The same population was mapped for abscisic acid (ABA) content in tubers so that any QTLs identified could be compared with those detected previously. At least three distinct loci on three chromosomes (2, 4, and 7) were associated with variation in ABA content. One of the QTLs was detected only as a main (single locus) effect, and two QTLs were found through two-locus interaction analysis (epistasis). Interaction between QTLs at markers TG 234 (chromosome 2) and TG 155 (chromosome 4) explained 20 % of total phenotypic variance for this trait. The interaction closely resembled one previously detected for dormancy, suggesting an association between high ABA content and long tuber dormancy. Although relationships between ABA level and dormancy could be demonstrated through <b>polygene</b> mapping, {{there was no indication}} of a relationship between these traits when they were subjected to a conventional correlation test.

Genetic variance due to <b>polygenes</b> was assumed constant. Optimal control theory was used {{to formulate}} selection on an index of major gene effects and estimates of polygenic breeding values and to derive index weights that maximize cumulative response over multiple generations. Optimum selection strategies were illustrated using an example and compared with mass selection and with selection with full emphasis on the major gene (genotypic selection). The latter maximizes the single-generation response for a major gene with additive effects. For the example considered, differences between selection methods in cumulative response {{at the end of}} a planning horizon of 5, 10, or 15 generations were small but responses were greatest for optimum selection. Genotypic selection had the greatest response in the short term but the lowest response in the longer term. For optimum selection, emphasis on the major gene changed over generations.

Suboptimality of genotypic selection in the longer term was caused not so much by gametic phase disequilibrium but rather by unequal selection pressure on the major gene (and, therefore, on <b>polygenes)</b> over generations, as frequency and variance at the major gene changed.

F 1, F 2, Rc 1, and Rc 2 generations were obtained by crossing resistant (BRS Facual, CNPA 2984, or CNPA 2043) and susceptible (Delta Opal, CNPA 999, or CNPA 2161) genotypes, and were assessed under field conditions with artificial inoculation of the pathogen (Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides). Genetic control of the trait varied among the crossings. For Delta Opal x BRS Facual and CNPA 2161 x BRS Facual, phenotypic segregations in the F 2 generation did not differ from the expected proportions for the hypothesis of duplicate genes (15 : 1). For Delta Opal x CNPA 2043, thesegregation did not differ from the expected proportions for dominant recessive epistasis (13 : 3). The hypothesis of genetic control by one major gene was supported only for the Delta Opal x CNPA 2043 crossing.

METHODS: One environmental and 4 genetic models (general, mixed inheritance, major gene, and <b>polygene)</b> were tested for Horse Owner Assessed Respiratory Signs Index (1 - 4, unaffected to severely affected) by segregation analyses of the 2 half-sib sire families, both combined and separately, using prevalences estimated in a representative sample. RESULTS: In all data sets the mixed inheritance model was most likely to explain the pattern of inheritance. In all 3 datasets the mixed inheritance model did not differ significantly from the general model (P=. 62, P= 1. 00, and P=. 27) but was always better than the major gene model (P <. 01) and the <b>polygene</b> model (P <. 01). The frequency of the deleterious allele differed considerably between the 2 sire families (P=. 23 and P=. 06). In both sire families the displacement was large (t= 17. 52 and t= 12. 24) and the heritability extremely large (h(2) = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Segregation analyses clearly reveal the presence of a major gene playing a role in RAO.
