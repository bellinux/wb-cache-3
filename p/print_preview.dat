25|$|Version 5.5 {{followed}} in July 2000. First released to developers at the 2000 Professional Developers Conference in Orlando, Florida, then {{made available for}} download, version 5.5 focused on improved <b>print</b> <b>preview</b> capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with Windows Me. Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption. Although {{it is no longer}} available for download from Microsoft directly it can also be installed with MSN Explorer 6.0 as msnsetup_full.exe. The full version of MSN Explorer can be downloaded only if you use Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 if Internet Explorer 5.5 has not yet been installed. The full version will work on also Windows ME and Windows XP but you will need to download it on Windows 2000 or earlier and transfer the setup file to the newer operating system. If you still want to download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.|$|E

In {{practice}} (though this may {{vary according to}} country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight {{on the night before}} its cover date, further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include breaking news which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already <b>printed.</b> <b>Previews</b> of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as Newsnight in the United Kingdom.

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Protext is its programmability. A mail merge {{programming}} language allows {{the user to}} input data from a text file or Prodata database. This is achieved by 'Stored commands' within {{the body of the}} text, an idea borrowed from the 'dot commands' of WordStar. Stored commands are similarly used to control formatting and layout of the text for <b>printing.</b> A <b>preview</b> mode showed the formatted layout but Protext did not display the fonts on screen.|$|R
5000|$|Preview: For in-print books where {{permission}} {{has been}} granted, {{the number of}} viewable pages {{is limited to a}} [...] "preview" [...] set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures, some based on user-tracking.

All books acquired through the Partner Program are available for preview.|$|R

5|$|However, Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon's move to Pittsburgh in 2006. While no television, {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which <b>printed</b> both a <b>preview</b> and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin's 98FM. Anthrocon still retains tight control over media access, {{not only to the}} convention grounds but to the membership, and has official policy that forbids unmonitored dealings with unauthorized members of the media.|$|R
5000|$|A {{column on}} page 95 {{of the special}} {{explains}} that the story [...] "Man-Gods", planned for this issue and promoted on Marvel Bullpen Bulletins pages and elsewhere, had become lost by the U.S. Postal Service. The story, with art by Niño, is unrelated to [...] "Man-God", an adaptation of Philip Wylie's Übermensch novel Gladiator, by Thomas and Tony DeZuniga, {{that appeared in the}} Marvel/Curtis magazine Marvel Preview #9 (Winter 1976). However, a 37-page story titled [...] "Man-Gods from Beyond the Stars", by co-plotter Thomas, writer Doug Moench and artist Niño, had by this time seen <b>print</b> in Marvel <b>Preview</b> #1 (1975). [...] The column stated that the replacement for [...] "Man-Gods" [...] was the four-page Goodwin story and the 15-page [...] "Arena" [...] reprint.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, {{there was}} a mix-up booking the print for a {{screening}} at The Silent Movie Theatre in Los Angeles, California, so MGM sent over un-inspected reels marked [...] "Screening Print." [...] Presumably this was an original <b>preview</b> <b>print,</b> as it included additional scenes that were {{cut out of the}} widely released version (including the complete Coming and Child of Love musical sequences which had been truncated in the final print), a simpler entrance for Mr. Topps at the end (instead of exiting from a Rolls Royce, he merely transforms from the previously seen hippie leader), and the closing credits were presented in a different font and layout. This version was screened a few times at The Silent Movie Theatre, and it subsequently ran at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in August 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 {{gave the}} {{software}} an overall A rating. The book {{stated that it}} [...] "heralds {{a new era in}} word processing" [...] for Atari 8-bit owners, and [...] "a good reason in itself to purchase an Atari". It praised AtariWriter's ease of use and <b>print</b> <b>preview,</b> and concluded that the software was [...] "a must for every serious writer and Atari owner".|$|E
50|$|By {{previewing}} {{what the}} layout {{will look like}} when printed without actually printing, users can check and fix possible errors before they pursue on the actual printing. Most applications have a <b>Print</b> <b>Preview</b> feature and some applications, like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Office, automatically open ‘Print Preview’ feature when ‘Print’ menu is selected. This feature is useful for {{making sure that the}} layout is the way user expects to be before the actual printing.|$|E
50|$|Optical margin {{alignment}} outdents letters like A, V, W, Y, and punctuation {{into the}} margins to align the text border optically. Some users remark {{that it makes}} the text margin look crooked, but this is because text frames or margin guides are visible. If text frames are not visible, e.g. in <b>print</b> <b>preview,</b> or when printed, {{the edge of a}} block of text looks more even if optical margin alignment is enabled.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{release was}} 107 minutes long. It was a critical, {{but not a}} box-office, success, recording a loss of $53,000 on its initial run. It was subsequently re-released under the title The Devil and Daniel Webster with nearly half an hour cut, reducing the film to 85 minutes. The cuts were crudely done. The film was restored to its full length in the 1990s and has been issued in that form on home video. However, the title has remained The Devil and Daniel Webster. The restored portions on the video {{had been taken from}} inferior prints of the movie, but the quality has been notably improved on the DVD release. A <b>preview</b> <b>print</b> titled Here Is a Man was found in the estate of the director and served {{as the basis for the}} film's restoration and DVD release.|$|R
5000|$|Once Crawford was signed, {{an effort}} {{to go for a}} similar star name led to Cooper coming on board, on loan from Paramount two weeks after the {{projected}} date of principal photography, although some sources indicate that Cooper, Robert Young and Franchot Tone were Hawk's first choices. Press releases had touted that Crawford had insisted on Cooper as her co-star. Cooper was in a slight decline with two other [...] "mediocre" [...] films in release, and when the opportunity to work with Hawks came, it also aligned him with the mercurial Crawford, albeit in what he later would regard as a [...] "misguided project". A series of rewrites with both Faulkner and other screenwriters along with the cutting of key opening scenes led to a confusing jumble of versions, as the original screen time of 135 minutes of a <b>preview</b> <b>print</b> indicates.|$|R
500|$|There {{was much}} {{improvisation}} in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had {{focused on the}} story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted {{to try something new}} each time. It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor, and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon. Bridges described this approach as [...] "a $200 million student film", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were {{trying to come up with}} dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded. The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set. The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige subsequently had the scene removed from all <b>preview</b> <b>prints</b> in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.|$|R
