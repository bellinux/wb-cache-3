5|$|Since 1993, the Commune urbaine d'Antananarivo (CUA) has {{increasingly}} sought {{to protect and}} restore the city's architectural and cultural heritage. In 2005, CUA authorities partnered with the city planners of the Île-de-France to develop the Plan VertPlan Bleu strategy for creating a classification system for Zones de Protection du <b>Patrimoine</b> Architectural, Urbain et Paysager, {{areas of the city}} benefiting from legal protection and financial support for their historic and cultural heritage. The plan, which is being implemented by the Institut des Métiers de la Ville, prevents the destruction of historic buildings and other structures, and establishes construction codes that ensure new structures follow historic aesthetics. It also provides for awareness raising campaigns in favor of historic preservation and undertakes projects to restore dilapidated historic buildings and sites. Under this plan, 19th-century sites, like the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal and the second residence of Rainilaiarivony, have been renovated.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{progress}} toward reconstruction was seen under {{the administration of}} President Marc Ravalomanana (2001–2009) who created the Comité national du <b>patrimoine</b> (CMP, or National Heritage Committee) responsible for overseeing the effort. The less time-intensive restoration projects {{were the first to}} be undertaken and completed. Efforts to restore the chapel, the monument least affected by the fire due to its stone structure, focused particularly on restoring its roof, steeple and wooden pews along with altar panels that had burned in the fire. Work on the chapel was completed in 2003. Reconstruction work on Mahitsy began in 2001 and was completed in January 2003, while planning for the reconstruction of Besakana began in December 2003 but stalled in 2009. The restoration of the nine royal tombs in the Rova complex was completed in October 2003. In early January 2006, Phase1 of the Manjakamiadana reconstruction commenced. This phase was scheduled for completion in May 2008. The reconstruction of the larger wooden palaces, such as Tranovola and Manampisoa, has not been planned.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{importance}} and its exceptional state, Dougga remains {{off the beaten}} track for many tourists (the site receives around 50000 visitors per year). In order to make it more attractive, the construction of an on-site museum is being considered, while the Institut national du <b>patrimoine</b> has established a website presenting the site and the surrounding region. For the time being, visitors with sufficient time can appreciate Dougga, not only because of its many ruins, but also for its olive groves, which give the site a unique ambiance.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the French Protectorate in Tunisia in 1881 {{led to the creation}} of a national antiquities institute (Institut national du <b>patrimoine),</b> for which the excavation of the site at Dougga was a priority from 1901, parallel to the works carried out at Carthage. The works at Dougga concentrated at first on the area around the forum; other discoveries ensured that there was an almost constant series of digs at the site until 1939. Alongside these excavations, work was conducted to restore the capitol, of which only the front and the base of the wall of the cella were still standing, and in particular between 1908 and 1910 to restore the mausoleum.|$|E

He added symmetrical pavilions with high roofs. Les de Lachaume, a family of notaries and tax prosecutors, were the owners in the 19th century.

Probably built in the fifteenth or sixteenth century, the church {{gradually}} became a ruin {{in the middle of the}} last century. Following the intervention of the monks of this church, a restoration program was set up in 2006. With the agreement of the National Museum in Asmara and the World Monuments Fund, funding was collected together by the German Embassy, the French Embassy, and the Alliance Française of Asmara, which made it possible to restore the church, between 2006 and 2008. Teams of workmen and women were created to this end. Only traditional techniques were employed for the masonry of the walls, the wooden roofing, the plastering, and the interior paintwork. This project, which conforms to the Charter of Venice, could serve as an example for similar restorations in the region and as a model for professional training. Finally, a trilingual article (English, German, and Tigrinya) was published in the Collection " Cultures et <b>Patrimoines</b> d'Erythrée ", 2009...|$|R

The contributors and actors from international to local levels are interested in validating methodologies and technologies for sharing resources in a distributed environment as well as investigating the services which can be derived from these sources. The experiences encountered during the development of this portal brought to light the issues surrounding the creation an OAI service provider for cultural heritage purposes which ranged from technical to content concerns. [URL] Cyberdocs is a free/open-source platform for publishing structured electronic documents. Cyberdocs was realized as a result of experiences from the Cyberthèes project, an information processing platform for scholarly publishing initiated by Presses de l'Université de Montréal in 1997. The platform consists of modules serving three purposes: conversion, management, and publication (including OAI Repository and Harvester implementations). The use of standard technologies and open-source software to create this platform provides various technical and organizational benefits which can be of value to a larger community. The future of the Cyberdocs project will focus on incorporation more resources to support various types electronic structured documents, greater support for multilingualism in interfaces, and encouraging the involvement of more interested parties; therefore, allowing the platform to grow and become more useful to a larger public.
