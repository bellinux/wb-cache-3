40|$|The role of {{off-shore}} {{countries in}} international money laundering schemes has long {{attracted the attention}} of policy makers. Virtually all initiatives aimed at combating money laundering, both at the domestic and international level, tackle the issue. 1 Policy makers are mainly concerned with two sources of costs stemming from money laundering. Firstly, the possibility of laundering proceeds of crime affects the incentive of a potential criminal. In a world where money of illicit origins cannot be laundered the possibility of linking the capital to the crime reduces the ex ante incentive of the criminal to commit the crime in the first place. At the margin, more crimes will be committed if money laundering is possible. From this perspective, combating money laundering is equal, in the aggregate, to combating <b>predicate</b> <b>offences.</b> Secondly, capitals that are laundered return to the legal financial sector generating serious negative effects: Competition is distorted; the allocative efficiency of the market is undermined. 2 Policy makers concentrate their attention on the negative effects of money laundering and on the possibility that off-shore centers might facilitate the task of criminal organizations. Concerns are raised by regulation adopted in off-shore centers, that may greatly contribute to launder money of illicit origins. The main product offered by off-shore centers to potential mone...|$|R

This includes selected dynastic periods, the time between the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and the beginning of economic reform, the resurgence of money laundering following the 1980 s, and underground banking. It explores the money laundering 'problem' and contemporary responses in China. This includes discussion of the external pressures exerted by international bodies and agreements, including the influence of the United States, and an overview of the domestic Chinese response to the 'problem' of money laundering. Data collection methods included reviews of money laundering cases identified in newspaper and journal articles, and court cases. It also includes twenty (N= 20) interviews with participants drawn from the fields of banking, police, security, entrepreneurs and members of the general public. These methods permitted the identification of twenty-three (N= 23) cases that were subject to systematic analysis, and compared against international evidence on money laundering methods and <b>predicate</b> <b>offences.</b> Using the generic AML structure of prevention and enforcement components (Levi and Reuter 2006) that addresses the international standards, an effort is made to assess the potential impact of the AML regime in the context of China.

40|$|The Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) revised in February 2012 include “tax crimes (related {{to direct}} taxes and {{indirect}} taxes) ” {{in the list}} of “designated categories of offences”. Thus, states are encouraged to include a range of tax offences in their definition of predicate offences. However, the standards defined by FATF are not compulsory, and they are framed in a fairly supple manner, allowing the national lawmakers to limit money laundering to the proceeds of serious offences and to decide how they will define the predicate offences and any elements that make them serious. The pressure on Switzerland to define predicate crimes in tax matters must nevertheless be considered as strong, since many countries already consider that money laundering can be committed in relation to such crimes and strive to create a level playing field for the financial industry. This contribution reflects on how serious tax offences could be defined with the aim not only of satisfying the international standards, but also and foremost, of giving adequate assistance and protection to Swiss criminal enquiries in tax matters. It then analyses how the requirement that the laundered assets are “proceeds” of the <b>predicate</b> <b>offence</b> could be dealt with in this context.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to measure the size of the money {{laundering}} and terrorism financing problem, identify threats and trends, the techniques employed and the amount of funds involved to determine whether the information obtained about money laundering and terrorism financing in real‐world environments can be transferred to virtual environments such as Second Life and World of Warcraft. Design/methodology/approach – Analysis of 184 Typologies obtained from a number of anti‐money laundering and counter‐terrorism financing (AML/CTF) bodies to: determine whether trends and/or patterns can be identified in the different phases of money laundering or terrorism financing, namely, the placement, layering and integration phases; and to establish whether trends and/or behaviours are ubiquitous to a particular money laundering or terrorism financing Type. Findings – Money launderers and terrorism financers appeared to have slightly different preferences for the placement, layering and integration techniques. The more techniques that are used, the more cash can be successfully laundered or concealed. Although terrorism financers use similar channels to money launderers, they do not utilise as many of the placement, layering and integration techniques. Rather, they prefer to use a few techniques which maintain high levels of anonymity and appear innocuous. The sums of monies involved in money laundering and terrorism financing vary significantly. For example, the average maximum sum involved in money laundering cases was AUD 68. 5 M, as compared to AUD 4. 8 for terrorism financing cases. Originality/value – This paper provides some insight into the relationship between <b>predicate</b> <b>offence,</b> the predominant techniques utilised in carrying out that offence and the sums of money involved. 27 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Organised {{crime is}} a global phenomenon. It {{is a problem in}} South Africa as it is a problem in most countries. International and {{regional}} organisations, in particular, United Nations, Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and African Union (AU), have developed legislative measures and laid down minimum standards to assist party and non-party states to combat the scourge. Member countries and signatories to those instruments are ever encouraged to bring about national legislative and regulatory frameworks to criminalise predicate crimes, curb money laundering, confiscate instrumentalities and proceeds of such crimes, and to co-operate amongst themselves in their endeavours to fight the scourge. South Africa is a signatory and state party to the Vienna Convention, the Palermo Convention, African Union conventions, Southern African Development Community protocols, and has embraced Financial Action Task Force Forty Recommendations. As a signatory and a state party to these instruments, South Africa has passed, in its parliament, a vast array of legislative tools aimed at complimenting the criminalisation of organised crime related conduct (thus extending range of predicate crimes, and has also put in place preventative measures to be taken by financial, non-financial and professional institutions against money laundering practices, in order to deny organised criminals of illicit proceeds and a further use of property as an instrument of crime. The legislative framework is also aimed to foster international co-operation in the form of mutual assistance, extradition and enforcement of foreign judgements and sentences. There is a public perception, though, that crime pays in South Africa. The general public perception is that crime pays because the laws of the country always lag behind the ingenuity of organised criminals who, it is believed, are always a step or two ahead in better organisation of their nefarious activities and in the use of sophisticated methods of execution to achieve their goals. The objective of this research is to evaluate existing South African laws intended to deal with organised crime with relevant international instruments in order to establish whether the laws are adequate and are being implemented effectively to fight the scourge. The hypothesis of this research project is that South Africa has adequate laws (compliance); however, the problem lies in their implementation (enforcement). To obtain the necessary information to achieve the said objectives, the views made by various writers on organised crime were considered. The legislation currently in place to combat organised crime was identified and measured against aforementioned instruments in order to establish whether they do achieve the minimum standards set for the fight against organised crime. The comparison was done following the perspectives contained in these instruments in chapter form. In this regard, over-achievements as well as under-achievements were highlighted. For an example, article 6 of the Palermo convention instructs state parties to include as <b>predicate</b> <b>offences</b> all serious crime, punishable by maximum deprivation of liberty of at least 4 years or more, for money laundering. The Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA), on the other hand, contains no list of specific <b>predicate</b> <b>offences,</b> but makes an open-ended reference to the „proceeds of unlawful activities‟. It is, therefore, all-encompassing. Another example {{can be found in the}} South African definition of corruption. The South African statutory definition penalises corruption „in the widest sense and in all its forms, whereas that in the Palermo Convention is limited or restricted, as it does not instruct for the criminalisation of corruption involving foreign public officials or international civil servants. The evaluation of existing South African laws shows that South Africa has adequate laws to fight organised crime. There is, however, a room for improvement in their implementation, particularly in the prosecution of organised crimes. The South African government is urged to make available adequate financial resources to enable prosecutors to carry out their functions effectively in the fight against the scourge...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines an attorney’s {{reporting obligation}} {{in terms of}} section 29 of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act 38 of 2001 (FICA) to report suspicious and unusual transactions, which {{are not subject to}} legal professional privilege. In order to contextualise this reporting obligation and to understand its application, terminology such as the proceeds of crime and money laundering is explained. Global best practice anti-money laundering guidelines, as manifested in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, are evaluated as well as typologies related to attorneys as targets for money laundering purposes. The establishment and development of the domestic regulatory and legislative frameworks to address the challenges around the proceeds of crime and money laundering are discussed, with specific reference to the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121 of 1998, which inter alia criminalised money laundering, and the FICA. Special focus is placed on section 29 of FICA and terminology such as “transaction” and “suspicion” is evaluated as well as section 37 of the FICA, which acknowledges the legal professional privilege. The research explains the principles around the legal professional privilege and the requirements for the privilege to sustain and also indicates that there are clear limitations to the application of the legal professional privilege, as mere confidential information is not privileged and the right to confidentiality can be limited by legislation. The research also evaluates contradictory views around the section 29 FICA reporting obligation by attorneys and addresses possible reasons for low reporting. As attorneys have a definite reporting obligation in terms of section 29 of FICA, ramifications of non-reporting may include an attorney being the subject of a criminal investigation for possible association with <b>predicate</b> <b>offences,</b> offences under POCA as well as FICA non-reporting offences. Relevant role players will therefore need to partner towards assisting the profession in understanding and discharging this reporting obligation. Recommendations addressing the role of the provincial law societies as well as the Financial Intelligence Centre in assisting towards maturing the regulatory regime are also discussed. The research concludes with an ethical and positivistic approach towards discharging the reporting obligation and suggestions regarding the way forward {{in order to protect the}} reputation of an elite profession.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{underscore}} the current supranational anti-money laundering (AML) regimes articulating challenges of harnessing them as a robust framework. Some aspects of the above framework are created under the auspices of the United Nations treaties, some are regional-based initiatives while others are ad hoc arrangements. Design/methodology/approach – The paper was written on the basis of the supranational framework against money laundering such as the United Nations Convention against drug trafficking and other psychotropic substances. Owing to the limitations of the above AML model law, the paper utilised a qualitative research methodology, exploring a wide range of the current AML regimes. The paper has also exploited the revised AML framework which expands the scope of the offence to encompass, not only proceeds from drug trafficking but also serious criminal activities (smuggling, fraud, serious financial crimes, and the sale of stolen goods). Ideally, the paper has been written based on the provisions of the United Nations Convention against transnational organised crimes and its attendant three protocols adopted in Palermo (2000); and the Financial Action Task Force (2004). The foregoing regimes underscore an essential framework for the study of money laundering and its attendant <b>predicate</b> <b>offences</b> globally. Findings – The findings of the study clearly demonstrate that the current AML framework is not robust enough to caution countries against the threat of money laundering. There is a gaping gap in the law of money laundering within and between regions even though there is a global framework in place. This is presumably the reason why some countries have not fully transposed some aspects of current AML regimes locally. Social implications – The gaps in the law against money laundering – both in relation to the way they are created and enforced signify that states still need to do more collectively to stem the threat of money laundering. The current intransigence in application of AML laws in some countries sign-post the inherent challenges of globalisation of international finance. Originality/value – While there is a growing body of literature generated on supranational AML regimes, this paper is distinctly based on the interplay of global and local factors in harnessing it. Thus, the research design of this paper is connected by two strands – a review of existing supranational AML framework and the inherent challenges faced by individual states in domesticating it. The paper is also written based on some practical experiences of harnessing global AML regimes in some countries. Crimes, Money laundering...|$|R
