40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to (a) explore the {{relationship}} of student cognitive skill indicators (predictor variables) to student performance in online and face-to-face MBA courses (criterion variables) at a Midwestern United States University (University) conferring undergraduate and graduate degrees in a variety of academic fields; (b) determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between the predictor and criterion variables; and, (c) determine if there is any statistically significant difference between any statistically significant correlations of predictor and criterion variables. A sample of 322 students were studied using seven-years of pre-existing data (Fall 2006 - Fall 2013) from the Center for Scholarship Teaching and Learning (CSTL) online course database, the student module of Ellusian database used by the University Registrar's office, and the Institutional Research department at the University. Statistical correlation and regression procedures were used to analyze the data. Contrary to existing online education research, this study did not conclusively indicate that students' ability to write effectively had any significant relationship to students' performance in online versus face-to-face courses in the MBA program at the University. This finding, combined with the foundational learning theory research, suggests that online course design, pedagogy, and assessment may be mitigating the affect differences in student writing skills and learning has on student performance in online versus face-to-face courses. This study also found significant differences in the relationship of student GMAT-Verbal score, GMAT-Analytical Writing score and GMAT-Total score, and student performance in online versus face-to-face MBA courses. Student GMAT-Verbal score and GMAT-Total score significantly correlated with student performance in face-to-face MBA courses, but did not significantly correlate with online MBA courses. Student GMAT-Analytical Writing score significantly correlated with student performance in face-to-face MBA courses, but had a weaker correlation with student performance in online MBA courses. These findings suggest that the use of GMAT scores in making MBA program admission decisions may not be appropriate. This study indicated that GMAT scores were not valid predictors of student performance in online MBA courses at the University. Finally, this study indicated that students with undergraduate grade point averages less than 3. 0, and students with combined undergraduate grade point averages and GMAT scores outside the threshold of the requirements for regular MBA program admittance, performed successfully. Comparing this finding with the findings that student Writing Proficiency Exam scores and EN 140 Grades of students were also valid predictors of student success in Online MBA program courses; and, the finding that GMAT scores were not valid predictors of student performance in Online MBA program courses; suggest that the use of Undergraduate Grade Point Average and GMAT scores for MBA <b>program</b> <b>admission</b> <b>requirements</b> should be reviewed and possibly revised...|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{of sport}} {{management}} programs {{is important for}} potential {{students as well as}} for the future development of sport management as an academic discipline. The historical evolution of sport management programs in the United States moved from the physical education model to a more business-oriented curriculum. Given this historical development, debate exists among sport management professionals regarding administrative housing of current and future sport management programs. The purposes of this study were to: (1) Provide an overview of the development of U. S. sport management programs, (2) Provide a snapshot of sport management <b>programs</b> including <b>admissions</b> <b>requirements</b> and faculty profiles, and (3) Analyse critical issues facing the field of sport management. A random sample of 137 institutions offering undergraduate sport management programs in the United States were invited to participate in the study; 50 usable surveys were returned. Results indicate a lack of diversity (racial and gender) among sport management faculty, and a large proportion of part-time faculty without a terminal degree in the field. curriculum academic <b>programs</b> <b>admissions</b> sport management...|$|R

40|$|A Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree {{has been}} a popular choice for {{continued}} education across almost every discipline {{since its inception in}} the early 20 th century. Today, MBA programs have become even more popular because of a prevalent need for post-Baccalaureate education as a criterion for continued advancement in the workplace. Because MBA programs are not limited to those who hold a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in a business discipline, most programs require completion of a set of undergraduate courses in business fundamentals as a prerequisite to MBA <b>program</b> <b>admission.</b> This <b>requirement</b> often creates a critical barrier to entry for many potential MBA students due to its time and expense. Schools and colleges of business have implemented many different solutions; however, in most cases, the solutions are still expensive, rigid in structure, and require months (often more than a year) to complete. This presentation describes the collaboration between the Gordon Ford College of Business and the Division of Extended Learning and Outreach at Western Kentucky University to create a fully digital, self-paced solution to provide instruction in the business fundamentals necessary for a student entering the MBA program without a BS degree in a business discipline. This single course can be completed in as few as seven weeks or as many as nine months, and the student can select the order and timeline in which to complete the eight subject areas within the course...|$|R
