5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b> At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; {{some of them would}} have to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state.

This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E

5000|$|All {{particles}} (for example, the quarks) {{have something}} called spin. The spin of a particle shows us what a particle looks like from different directions. For example, a particle of spin 0 {{looks the same}} from every direction. A particle of spin 1 looks different in every direction, unless the particle is spun completely around (360 degrees). Hawking's example of a particle of spin 1 is an arrow. A particle of spin two needs to be turned around halfway (or 180 degrees) to look the same. The example given {{in the book is}} of a double-headed arrow. There are two groups of particles in the universe: particles with a spin of 1/2, and particles with a spin of 0, 1, or 2.

5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume.

This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b> The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position.

On the contrary, if the Principe holds (Fermi-Dirac case), the regularity domain of the probabilistic description is narrowed by the Principle itself. In this paper a recursive definition of regularity is proposed, able to unify the three Statistics. In this general formulation <b>Pauli's</b> <b>Exclusion</b> <b>Principle</b> can be found as a particular case. The paper is based on the notion of stochastic process with exchangeable increments.

5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the <b>Pauli</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{possibility}} {{of the existence of}} quark stars has been discussed by several authors since 1970. Recently, it has been pointed out that two putative neutron stars, RXJ 1856. 5 - 3754 in Corona Australis and 3 C 58 in Cassiopeia are too small and too dense to be neutron stars; they show evidence of being quark stars. Apart from these two objects, there are several other compact objects which fit neither in the category of neutron stars nor in that of black holes. It has been suggested that they may be quark stars. In this paper it is shown that a black hole cannot collapse to a singularity, instead it may end up as a quark star. In this context it is shown that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as an ultrahigh energy particle accelerator, hitherto inconceivable in any terrestrial laboratory, that continually accelerates particles comprising the matter in the black hole. When the energy E of the particles in the black hole is ≥ 10 2 GeV, or equivalently the temperature T of the matter in the black holes is ≥ 10 15 K, the entire matter in the black hole will be converted into quark-gluon plasma permeated by leptons. Since quarks and leptons are spin 1 / 2 particles,they are governed by <b>Pauli’s</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b> Consequently, one of the two possibilities will occur; either <b>Pauli’s</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> would be violated and the black hole would collapse to a singularity, or the collapse of the black hole to a singularity would be inhibited by <b>Pauli’s</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> and the black hole would eventually explode with a mini bang of a sort.
