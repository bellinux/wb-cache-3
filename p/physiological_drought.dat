The leaf growth and Chlorophyll content has significantly shown to vary from the control ones while the grain yield was not affected. While many plant species naturally accumulate proline and protein as major organic osmolytes when subjected to different abiotic stresses. These compounds are thought to play adaptive roles in mediating osmotic adjustment and protecting sub cellular structures in stressed plants.

As a result of drip-irrigation with local high salinity groundwater (2.8 ~ 29.7 g/L), soil salt crusts develop extensively in the shelterbelt [7, 10]. Under salinity water drip-irrigation, salt accumulates at soil surface, and salt content of distribution layers of trees roots is lower, so salt-injuries don't happen. But, unexpected precipitations can leach salt of soil salt crusts downwards, if soil salt contents of distribution layers of roots exceeds trees' salt-tolerance threshold, plants <b>physiological</b> <b>drought</b> might happen, even results in plants death.

30|$|Alternative {{strategies}} {{consist of}} seeking a drought-yield {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) without trade-offs on yield under optimum conditions through quantitative genetic approaches, and further characterization of the <b>physiological</b> <b>drought</b> response mechanisms of the breeding lines containing those QTLs (Swamy et al. 2013; Dixit et al. 2015 b; Henry et al. 2015). This top-down approach allows the identification of drought resistance-related traits as whole plant strategies to increase productivity and may be relevant to multiple drought stress scenarios in targeted environments (Passioura 2012). For instance, when introgressed in the drought-susceptible high-yielding popular rice variety IR 64, two major-effect drought-yield QTLs (qDTY 2.2 and qDTY 4.1) improved yield through higher root hydraulic conductivity and better transpiration and plant growth (Henry et al. 2015). Ultimately, the selective combination of QTLs showing distinct and potentially complementary drought-resistance physiological mechanisms will help future breeding programs.|$|E

The results of analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences {{for most of the}} traits investigated. Mean comparison exhibited that most of the genes controlling drought tolerance criteria are located on chromosomes 4 H and 5 H. The overall consideration of the indices using Stress Tolerance Index (STI), Germination Stress Index (GSI) and physiological Multiple Selection Index (MSI) indicated that most of the genes responsible for the inheritance of drought tolerance predictors are located on chromosomes 4 H and 5 H, hence they can be transferred for the breeding of drought tolerance in barley through chromosome engineering and for mapping QTLs by the molecular breeding procedures. A three dimensional-plot and cluster analysis confirmed the same conclusion. Correlation analysis discarded chlorophyll a and b also proline as an indicator of drought tolerance, but proved that Excised Leaf Water Retention (ELWR), Relative Water Content (RWC), Relative Water Deficit (RWD), Relative Water Loss (RWL), Chlorophyll Fluorescence (CHF), Cell Membrane Stability (CMS) and Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) are <b>physiological</b> indices of <b>drought</b> tolerance and they can be used for the improvement of drought tolerance and grain yield via correlated response.

30|$|The {{groundwater}} {{that used}} for irrigation {{all the time}} contains computable quantities of dissolved substances, which are called salts. The salts existing in the groundwater, besides affecting {{the growth of the}} plants directly, also affect the soil structure, permeability and aeration, which indirectly affect the plant growth. The most influential water quality guideline on crop productivity is the water salinity hazard measured by electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids (Ahmad et al. 2002). Water used for irrigation can vary greatly in quality depending upon type and quantity of dissolved salts. The primary effect of high EC water on crop productivity is the inability of plant to compete with ions in the soil solution for water leading to <b>physiological</b> <b>drought.</b> The higher the EC, the lesser the water available to plants, even though the soil may appear wet. Since plants can only transpire “pure” water, usable plant water in the soil solution decreases dramatically as EC increases (Kumar et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|Plants in saline {{soils are}} {{subjected}} to <b>physiological</b> <b>drought</b> as Na+ and Cl- ions bind water {{that is needed to}} be mobilized by the plants (Fuzy et al. [2008]). In the presence of salinity stress, mycorrhizal apple seedlings maintained relatively higher leaf turgidity compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. The phenomenon is ascribed to improved hydraulic conductivity of apple plants with a longer root and an altered root system morphology induced by AM fungi (Dehne [1982]; Kothari et al. [1990]). In our study apple seedlings inoculated with AM fungi were shown to possess a lower leaf osmotic potential in contrast to non-inoculated plants under salt stress condition. The result might be attributed to the reason that fungal hyphae extend from the root surface into the soil, increase the surface areas of root and thus acquire more macroelement beyond the depletion zone (Schnepf et al. [2011]). The fungal accumulating solutes maintain a relatively lower osmotic potential beneficial for plant osmotic adjustment, consequently enabling host plants to use water more efficiently (Graham and Syversten [1984]).|$|E

[Fagaceae]) seedlings that grow in distinct populations in Washington state, in order to aid in restoration efforts by informing growers of the potential differences between the acorn collection sites. Acorns from six Washington populations east of the Cascades, as well as one population from Whidbey Island, were collected and grown in containers under controlled conditions. The plants were assessed with and without moderate and severe drought stress induced by withholding water. The most extreme differences in photosynthetic characteristics for non-stressed seedlings from different populations were in stomatal conductance rates, which in some cases differed between populations by 2 fold or more. Differences in response to drought occurred across populations after 14 days of withholding water (Fig 4). Seedlings from the northernmost population of Garry oak on the east side of the Cascades (Swauk Creek) were most susceptible to lowered photosynthetic rates induced by drought stress, while an island population from the west side of the cascades (Oak Harbor) showed the least drought-induced reduction of assimilation. Differences among populations were also observed in the occurrence of drought induced embolisms, and in changes in leaf water potential, relative water content, and production of the osmolyte proline in response to drought. This study shows that seedlings from different populations of Garry oak have distinct <b>physiological</b> responses to <b>drought</b> that may lead to changes in survivorship for seedlings used in reforestation efforts for Garry oak savannas as they are exposed to drought stress in the field...|$|R

Driven by local water conservation plans, more and more golf courses are irrigated with effl uent water, which is usually high in salinity and rich in detrimental salts (Marcum et al., 1998; Suplick-Ploense et al., 2002).

30|$|EC {{which gives}} an {{indication}} of the salinity hazard is the most important water quality guideline on crop productivity (Johnson and Zhang 1990). Water with high salinity is toxic to plants and poses a salinity hazard (Fipps 2003). According to Ayers and Westcott (1985), groundwater with an EC value greater than 3000  µS/cm (> 3000  µS/cm) is termed “Fair” and would greatly affect crop productivity or yield. The water is termed “Good” if the EC ranges between 700 and 3000  µS/cm while “Excellent” refers to waters with EC values less than 700  µS/cm (< 700  µS/cm). From the classification suggested by Ayers and Westcott (1985), groundwaters in the study area can be termed as “Excellent” and “Good”. This result may be a reflection of the satisfactory crop productivity in the study area. High EC water results in the inability of plants to compete for ions in the soil, resulting in <b>physiological</b> <b>drought</b> and subsequently decreasing the crop yield. This means that even though the field appears to have plenty of moisture, the plants wilt because of the inability of the roots to absorb water (Fipps 2003).|$|E

40|$|Drought and {{elevated}} temperature often occur {{alone or in}} combination in many areas, limiting cool-season grass growth. Rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration may affect plant adaptation to drought and high temperature. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effectiveness of elevated CO 2 in mitigating the negative effects of drought or elevated temperature alone or a combination of these stresses on physiological processes in a perennial grass species. The effects of these treatments on water relations, photosynthesis, and respiration were determined in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. cultivar Rembrandt). Grass plants were subjected to the following treatments in growth chambers: heat stress (30 degrees C or 5 degrees C above the optimal level of 25 degrees C), drought stress by maintaining soil water content at 50 % of field capacity, or the combined two stresses for 28 d. Stressed and unstressed control plants were exposed to a constant level of either ambient CO 2 (400 mu L L- 1) or elevated CO 2 (800 mu L L- 1). At ambient CO 2 concentration, drought and the combined stress for 28 d caused significant decline in leaf relative water content (RWC), photochemical efficiency (ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence [F-v:F-m]), net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), maximal ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) -limited rate of photosynthesis (V-cmax), and maximal electron transport-limited rate of photosynthesis (J(max)) but increased membrane electrolyte leakage (EL) and dark respiration rate (R-d). Elevated temperature to 5 C above the optimal level resulted in the increases in g(s), EL, and R-d but had no significant effects on the other <b>physiological</b> parameters. <b>Drought</b> stress for 28 d was more detrimental than increasing temperature by 5 degrees C for tall fescue and the combined stress was more detrimental than either stress alone.

Aims: To investigate spatial and temporal variation in the fuel moisture content of Calluna vulgaris. Methods: Calluna vulgaris plants were sampled in different sites and seasons to examine vertical profiles in moisture content. Live moisture content was monitored throughout autumn 2003 and spring 2004. Changes were compared to trends in temperature, soil resistance and rainfall. The effect of exposure was examined by comparing shoot moisture content in sheltered and exposed locations. Results: Significant spatial and temporal variation in moisture content was observed.

Riparian lianas are generally untoothed and thus do not contribute to the trend, and there is little association between toothed riparian species and ecological attributes indicating early successional lifestyle and disturbance response. Instead, the pattern is best explained by differences in water availability. Toothed species' proportional richness declines with proximity to the coast, also a likely effect of water availability because salt stress causes <b>physiological</b> <b>drought.</b> Our study highlights water availability as an important factor impacting the distribution of toothed species across landscapes, with significance for paleoclimate reconstructions. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum is a {{traditional}} crop, which has been grown especially in the countries of Africa and Asia. It {{is used as a}} food, fodder, source of fiber and energy. Because of its tolerance to various abiotic stresses, especially drought, sorghum is often called "the camel of crops", {{and there are a lot}} of studies trying to clarify the basis of this tolerance. Nowadays, suitable sorghum genotypes are considered as an alternative in other parts of the world (North and Middle America, Europe) or to widen the planting areas. The first part of this thesis summarizes results of current studies aimed on sorghum <b>physiological</b> responses to <b>drought,</b> high salinity, extreme temperatures, aluminium toxicity and the combination of these stresses. The second part explains the ways how to alleviate effect of stresses on the plant. It includes the application of various compounds and genetic modifications.

30|$|Across a {{wide range}} of {{environmental}} conditions, forest types and tree species we found carbon isotope ratios of wood to be a strong and reliable indicator of past drought occurrence (Fig. 2 a). However, despite this clear <b>physiological</b> signal of <b>drought</b> on δ 13 C, we only found a weak and context-dependent effect of these same drought events on tree growth (Fig. 2 b). Previous studies have suggested that the relationship between carbon isotopes and growth might not be a simple one (Ferrio et al. 2003; Peñuelas et al. 2008; Jansen et al. 2013; Hentschel et al. 2016; Shestakova et al. 2017), but to our knowledge none had explored the relationship across a broad enough range of species and environmental conditions to draw this conclusion robustly. The relatively small declines in growth we observed in response to drought suggest that most European tree species are – on average – able to maintain growth under conditions of low soil water availability.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} various methods {{available}} for irrigation scheduling, contrasting traditional water-balance and soil moisture-based approaches with those based on sensing {{of the plant}} response to water deficits. The main plant-based methods for irrigation scheduling, including those based on direct or indirect measurement of plant water status and those based on plant <b>physiological</b> responses to <b>drought,</b> are outlined and evaluated. Specific plant-based methods {{include the use of}} dendrometry, fruit gauges, and other tissue water content sensors, while measurements of growth, sap flow, and stomatal conductance are also outlined. Recent advances, especially in the use of infrared thermometry and thermography for the study of sto-matal conductance changes, are highlighted. The rela-tive suitabilities of different approaches for specific crop and climatic situations are discussed, with the aim of indicating {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} different approaches, and highlighting their suitability over different spatial and temporal scales. The poten-tial of soil- and plant-based systems for automated irrigation control using various scheduling techniques is also discussed...|$|R
