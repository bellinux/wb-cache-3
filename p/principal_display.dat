In particular, this study examined behaviors that teachers in three North Carolina middle schools felt their <b>principals</b> <b>displayed</b> that helped encourage them to continue teaching in their current schools. Teachers in three middle schools, one from each geographical region of the state, completed an online survey. Also, the researcher visited each middle school and interviewed the three principals and their supervisors to collect additional data concerning positive teacher working conditions and reduced rates of turnover. The data generated from middle school teachers {{who participated in this}} study indicated there were specific behaviors that positively impacted teacher working conditions and encouraged them to continue teaching in their current schools. Based on the data analysis, several suggestions for principals are included to help them improve teacher working conditions and reduce turnover in their schools. Principals should try to establish meaningful relationships with their teachers. Principals should behave ethically and refrain from showing favoritism. Also, principals should show their support of teachers. Principals should also try to create an atmosphere of cooperation and collegiality within their schools...|$|R

It has many layers such as benevolence, openness, reliability, competence, and honesty (Hoy 2 ̆ 6 Tschannen-Moran, 1999). <b>Principals</b> who <b>display</b> collegial and supportive behaviors generate a high level of trust whereas <b>principals</b> who <b>display</b> restrictive and directive behaviors generate low levels of trust (Goddard, Tschannen-Moran, 2 ̆ 6 Hoy, 2001). Principals are vital stakeholders in a school community. This is especially true for principals who serve high poverty schools where the challenges are unique and daunting. Despite the research on the importance of relational trust as a social capital tool for schools, there is little research that includes the principals’ perception of trust in their stakeholders. This descriptive quantitative study explored the relationship between the principals’ level of trust with his/her major stakeholders and the principals’ level of engagement in key leadership behaviors. High poverty middle school principals from a northeastern area were surveyed. The survey instrument includes statements on trust, organizational climate, leadership behaviors.

40|$|Introduction As {{a result}} of the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations and Tobacco Products Directive, all packs of {{cigarettes}} (factory-made and hand-rolled) in the United Kingdom must be drab brown, display pictorial warnings on the <b>principal</b> <b>display</b> areas, and contain no less than 20 cigarettes or 30 grams of tobacco. The legislation was phased in between May 2016 and May 2017. Our objective was to monitor pack, brand and product changes pre- and post-implementation.   Methods Our surveillance of the cigarette market involved a review of the trade press, a monthly monitor of online supermarkets, and regular visits to stores, from May 2015 to June 2017.   Results Pre-standardised packaging there were changes to the pack graphics (e. g. redesigned packs and limited-editions) and pack structure (e. g. re-sealable inner foil), and the issue of a number of re-usable tins. Post-standardised packaging, changes included newer cigarette pack sizes for some brand variants (e. g. 23 and 24 packs). Changes to the branding pre-standardised packaging included brand extensions, and post-standardised packaging included brand and/or variant name change, often with the inclusion of colour descriptors, and brand migrations. Product changes pre-standardised packaging included the introduction of novel filters (e. g. filters with two flavour-changing capsules, tube filters, firmer filters, and filters with granular additives). There was non-compliance with the legislation, with slim packs, which are not permitted, on sale after standardised packaging was implemented.   Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to monitor developments in markets introducing standardised packaging, and have policy implications for countries considering this measure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Guidelines for the {{implementation}} of Article 11 of the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) require that cigarette health warning labels should include pictures and take up 50 % or more of the <b>principal</b> <b>display</b> area. This study examined how the association between large pictorial warnings, those covering ≥ 50 % of the front and back of the package, and the prevalence of cigarette smoking varies by educational attainment. Methods: We pooled individual-level tobacco use data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in 18 countries between 2008 and 2013 and linked them with warning label requirements during the same period from the MPOWER database and reports regarding warnings. The respondents’ self-reported exposure to warnings was examined according to education. Logistic regressions were further employed to analyze education-specific associations between large pictorial warnings and smoking prevalence, and whether such association differed by education was examined using an interaction test. Results: At the time of the survey, eight out of 18 countries had imposed graphic warning labels that covered ≥ 50 % of the package. These warnings were associated with a 10. 0 % (OR = 0. 89; 95 % CI: 0. 81, 0. 97; p ≤ 0. 01) lower cigarette smoking prevalence among adults with less than a secondary education or no formal education, but not among respondents with at least a secondary education. Less educated respondents were also less likely to be exposed to warnings in all 18 countries. The association between strong warnings and lower smoking prevalence among less educated respondents could be greater if their exposure to warnings increases. Conclusions: Prominent pictorial warning labels can potentially reduce health disparities resulting from smoking across different education levels...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of principal participation in the Davis Principal Coaching Initiative, an executive leadership capacity building development program, on leader practice and professional practice of teachers. This mixed-method comparative case study investigated the following five research questions: (1) How does participation in the Davis Principal Coaching Initiative (DPCI) prepare principals to become effective instructional leaders? (2) How does the DPCI influence the knowledge, beliefs and leadership practices of urban school principals? (3) How does an urban school principal create and sustain organizational structures and processes that promote effective teacher practice and improve student outcomes? (4) What leadership support structures enable leader practice? And, (5) How can the VAL-ED instrument serve as a coaching tool to assist principals to become effective instructional leaders?; Quantitative data were collected from the results of the Vanderbilt Assessment of Leadership in Education (VAL-ED) survey, an instrument that provided a summary of the principals, teachers and supervisors’ perceptions on the principal’s leadership behaviors (Murphy et al. 2006). Qualitative data were collected from pre-post interviews, observations and document analysis.; Key findings revealed that the DPCI provided the principals with professional development that increased their capacity as instructional leaders; and the coaching structure helped the principal implement district initiatives, and provided the principals with moral and daily support at the school site.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the number, function {{and size of}} <b>principal</b> military <b>displays</b> and establishes a basis to determine the opportunities for technology insertion {{in the immediate future}} and into the next millennium. <b>Principal</b> military <b>displays</b> are defined as those occupying appreciable crewstation real-estate and/or those without which the platform could not carry out its intended mission. DoD ÒofficeÓ applications are excluded from this study. The military displays market is specified by such parameters as active area and footprint size, and other characteristics such as luminance, gray scale, resolution, angle, color, video capability, and night vision imaging system compatibility. Funded, future acquisitions, planned and predicted crewstation modification kits, and form-fit upgrades are taken into account. This paper provides an overview of the DoD niche market, allowing both government and industry a necessary reference by which to meet DoD requirements for military displays in a timely and cost-effective manner. The aggregate DoD installed base for direct-view and large-area military displays is presently estimated to be in excess of 313, 000. Miniature displays are those which must be magnified to be viewed, involve a significantly different manufacturing paradigm and are used in helmet mounted displays and thermal weapon sight applications. Some 114, 000 miniature displays are presently included within future weapon system acquisition plans. For vendor production planning purposes it is noted that foreign military sales could substantially increase these quantities. The vanishing vendor syndrome (VVS) for older display technologies continues to be a growing, pervasive problem throughout DoD, which consequently must leverage the more modern, especially flat panel, display technologies being developed to replace older, especially cathode ray tube, technology for civil-commercial markets.

40|$|Studies {{on women}} {{principals}} and leadership {{have been conducted}} in both developed and developing countries. Not much research on women leadership has been undertaken in Sekhukhune region in rural Limpopo, South Africa. The study’s interests were in the representation of women in leadership in this region. It sought to explore leadership experiences of women principals working in secondary schools in rural areas. In addition, the study sought to understand what led to their appointment, particularly in a deeply traditional and patriarchal society such as Sekhukhune region, considering both barriers as well as enhancers and how they impacted on their progress to principalship. Data were collected by means of qualitative methods; semi-structured interviews were held with six women principals from public schools only. Structured observation was also conducted during school visits, as well during interviews wherein field notes were also taken. School documents such as SGB and minute books, some policy documents, noticeboard documents, time-books, attendance registers were analysed. Existing literature on women and leadership was reviewed. Data collected was transcribed, analysed, interpreted, and findings were presented. Women principals spoke of their everyday work experiences {{within the context of}} sharing challenges and strengths in their careers. The study found out that women are their own motivators, which serves as a strong enhancer. However, women still face organisational barriers particularly in the selection procedures where gender discrimination is evident. Findings revealed that women principals continue to face myriad administrative and personal challenges when caring out their managerial duties. These include resistance from communities and staff often displayed by stereotypical attitudes and discrimination. In order to cope with some of the challenges, participants in this study innovatively employed various leadership styles such as care and nurturing, collaboration, androgyneity and spirituality. Stereotyping still exists as leadership is viewed from a male perspective. In conclusion, this study discovered that women <b>principals</b> <b>displayed</b> some values of liberal feminism in their leadership experiences; they demonstrated that they can do great things by taking part in the public sphere.
