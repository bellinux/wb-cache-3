500|$|Stephanie McGrath of Jam! {{said the}} song is [...] "a nice break from the 'baby babys', 'yeah yeahs' and insistent drum beats that pepper the other songs" [...] of Oops!. David Veitch of the Calgary Sun {{compared}} the backing vocals to [...] "nicely old-fashioned shoo-be-doo-doos". Lyrically, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] alludes to how Spears wants to hear her boyfriend say he needs her {{all the way and}} that he loves her. Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well," [...] she continued. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think. I don't think Shania would probably sing some of the words that I'm saying." ...|$|E
500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{felt the}} album's lyrics have an [...] "emotional and {{pictorial}} directness, rare for Yorke". The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The album title was inspired by [...] "these huge elephants {{that we have in the}} room at the moment, in the west, and people are desperately trying to erase them from public consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Anupama Chopra of NDTV and Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com gave Enthiran {{a rating}} of {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Chopra criticised the film's {{portions}} in the second half, describing them as [...] "needlessly stretched and cacophonous", but concluded her review by saying, [...] "Robot rides on Rajinikanth's shoulders and he never stoops under the burden. Aided by snazzy clothes, make-up and special effects, he makes Chitti endearing." [...] Srinivasan, however, said that Shankar [...] "strikes the balance between science fiction and masala quotient." [...] She concluded that, [...] "Whichever way you look at it, [...] is one of those rare films that give you just enough material to <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> in, and enjoy yourself." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave {{a rating of}} three out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, it's the fantastic special effects and an inspired performance from [...] that keeps the film fresh." [...] Mayank Shekhar, writing for Hindustan Times, rated it three stars and said, [...] "Leave aside jokes running on the Internet. This film, just a few feet too long, is fine entertainment by itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Phantasmagoria {{received}} mixed reviews. Vince Broady, {{executive editor}} of Multimedia World, said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride {{that will make you}} jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced gamers, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest.|$|E
500|$|... "Shut Up and Drive" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Bill Lamb from About.com commented {{that there are}} better songs on Good Girl Gone Bad, but [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] captures [...] "the spirit of summer {{just as well as}} Rihanna's first hit 'Pon de Replay'". Lamb further continued, [...] "The lyrics are pure fluff, and the vocals have the now familiar thin and reedy quality common to many of Rihanna's efforts. However, like any successful sports car, the look, feel, and speed of 'Shut Up and Drive' <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> in despite the model's shortcomings." [...] Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters wrote that [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] is a sassier version of Aretha Franklin's [...] "Freeway of Love" [...] and Michael Jackson's [...] "Speed Demon". He also stated that the song would have fit comfortably on Gwen Stefani's first album. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine found that the song did not live up to its campy title, while Rodney Dugue from The Village Voice described it as simultaneously [...] "goofy and sexually daring". Andy Kellman from AllMusic also referred to it as [...] "a sleek, forthcoming proposition...as undeniable and rocking as Sugababes' 2002 UK smash 'Freak Like Me'". [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] won Most Popular R Song at the People's Choice Music Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times {{wrote that}} Scott was [...] "one {{of the most}} {{influential}} film directors of the past 25 years, if {{also one of the most}} consistently and egregiously underloved by critics" [...] and called him [...] "ne of the pop futurists of the contemporary blockbuster." [...] She felt that [...] "here was plenty about his work that was problematic and at times offensive, yet it could have terrific pop, vigor, beauty and a near pure cinema quality. These were, more than anything, films by someone who wanted to <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> in hard and never let you go." ...|$|E
2500|$|The media {{reported}} that Bourque's Facebook account {{was filled with}} images and [...] "occasionally jokey posts about {{the right to bear}} arms".

A post added to his Facebook page the day of the shooting contains a photo with a quote from Dave Chappelle, [...] "You ever notice a cop will <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> over for a light out, but if your car is broke down they drive right past you?". He also tended to share images with slogans such as [...] "Free Men Do Not Ask Permission to Bear Arms" [...] and [...] "Militia Is Only a Bad Word if You're a Tyrant".|$|E
2500|$|For many years, Batchelor {{resided in}} Grosse Pointe, Michigan. In his final months, Batchelor {{lived in a}} nursing home in Detroit. Sportswriter Joe Falls {{remained}} close to Batchelor in his later years. After Batchelor died, Falls described a visit to Batchelor at the nursing home:"Batch couldn't have weighed more than 60 pounds at the end, but his mind was nimble. He'd drift between fantasy and fact. ... But before you could feel pangs of sadness at his deterioration, he'd <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> close to the bed and whisper: 'I think it's great the Lions got Munson from the Rams. They couldn't win with Plum and Munson has the poise to be a good quarterback. Pour me a drink' Batch went out the way he would have wanted, with his lifelong friend and companion, Jack Daniels, at his side. He couldn't eat at the end, and water repulsed him, so they let him sip his favorite liquid." ...|$|E

40|$|The Rubberband Theory {{states that}} as {{you live in the}} current reality, you end up being pulled in two {{different}} directions: creative tension is <b>pulling</b> <b>you</b> towards a future vision and emotional tension <b>pulls</b> <b>you</b> towards the old paradigm. Applying this to 4 -H means that many of us {{are in the middle of}} being pulled between the opportunities of the future (creative tension) which may lead to a new vision of 4 -H and the traditions of the past (emotional tension). The pull on both ends can and often does create daily tension...|$|R

2500|$|Angus Stone {{began to}} play his new solo music at Splendour in the Grass in Byron Bay in July 2012. In September that year he {{embarked}} on a solo tour of the US, UK, continental Europe, and Australia with sold out shows including Brussels, Utrecht, Berlin and both his Los Angeles and New York shows. Upon {{the start of his}} solo tour Angus said, [...] "To play live as my own in front of those people, it's going to be a different trail of gravel and gold, but none the less very exciting ... it's a whole different trip". His live performances have garnered praise, The Stanford Dailys Sasha Arijanto reported being [...] "bewitched by the dulcet sounds from the stage". After Stone's show in Montreal, Caitlin Grimes from Confront Magazine stated, [...] "don’t think I can name another artist who can manage to grab you by the wrist and <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> into such stories with him". Stone completed his first solo shows in Australia including at Enmore Theatre in Sydney on 1 November. He performed at the Australian summer festivals including Homebake, [...] Woodford, [...] Falls (both Lorne and Marion Bay), and [...] Southbound in Western Australia.

2500|$|... "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] was {{considered}} as a sequel to Spears' debut album, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1999), percolating with a carefully measured blend of familiar pop, funk, R and power balladry. Spears said during an interview that the album has a more mature, R-flavored pop sound. [...] "It's not something I changed purposefully", Spears said of the album's sound and added: [...] "It's just something that kind of changed on itself with me being older. My voice has changed {{a little bit and}} I'm more confident, and I think that comes across on the material." [...] One of its producers, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins talked about working with Spears on a Rolling Stones cover, stating: [...] "It's going to shock everybody", adding: [...] "It has flavors of the original, but it's a straight 2000 version — new to the ear. Which I think is cool, because people who appreciate that song are going to love it. And I made it so new and young that the young kids that love Britney are going to love it. It's going to grab both a mature and young audience." [...] Spears also worked with Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, telling MTV News: [...] "When you hear the song, it's so pure and delicate. It's just one of those songs that <b>pull</b> <b>you</b> in", and added: [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen … they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think.
