Unlike other RTS games where resources seem to magically pop {{from one place to}} another where needed, in Trash they must travel through pipe. This also applies to technologies which are researched. Technology can be shared with an allied player by constructing a pipe to link your pipe system with your ally's. If the pipe between two bases of the same player is broken, the two bases become effectively isolated, as a result, the resource indicator is divided into two in order to show readings for each base. Then the player can only use the resources available on one pipe network for building on that network, unless the pipe is rebuilt.|$|E

5000|$|Trenchless {{rehabilitation}} {{includes such}} construction methods as sliplining, thermoformed <b>pipe,</b> <b>pipe</b> bursting, shotcrete, gunite, cured-in-place pipe (CIPP), grout-in-place pipe, mechanical spot repair, and other methods for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of existing buried pipes and structures without excavation, {{or at least}} with minimal excavation. Mechanical spot repair is applied where damaged pipelines require the re-instatement of structural integrity. Sliplining, CIPP, and thermoformed pipe lining involve pulling or inverting a new liner into an existing pipe, then applying heat and/or pressure to force the liner to expand to fill the pipe. CIPP technologies combine a carrier (felt or fibreglass) impregnated with heat, ultraviolet light, or ambient curable resin to form a [...] "pipe within a pipe". Pipe bursting fractures a pipe from the inside and forces the fragments outwards while a new pipe is drawn in to replace the old. [...] The other methods are primarily for fixing spot leaks.Trenchless rehabilitation methods are generally more cost-effective than traditional exhume (dig) and replace methods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a validated numerical model (using 3 -D finite element method (FEM)) of an unreinforced T-section <b>pipe.</b> <b>Pipe</b> profiling severely compromises the localized performance of the T-section pipe. The main objective was to develop a less conservative tool to investigate the key factors that influence failure in T-section pipes. Strain gauges were mounted on the T-section to capture the induced strains as the pressure was gradually increased until the pipe burst. The executed FEM analysis provided comparable results to the experimental measurements which provided a cost effective tool to validate the numerical model. This result allows for better placement of branch piece reinforcements based on experimentally obtained results. The developed tool c be used to optimize the design and sizing of reinforcing crotch plates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper aims {{from the}} {{simulation}} tests {{to highlight the}} influence of the diameter and material quality, reflected by the flow limit of the pipe and the quality and technological parameters at the bending under pressure of the pipes. From literature, those quality parameters which characterize a correct bending are: the ovality of the transversal section, the variation of the wall thickness or eccentricity, the lack of whetstones, the resistance in function of the bent <b>pipe.</b> <b>Pipe</b> material characteristics influence the quality parameters of the under pressure bending process, in the sense that at the materials with small flow limit, ovality or variation of the wall thickness are small. At pipes under pressure bending, ovalities and variation of the wall thickness are in permissible limits valid recommended for domains without special precision restrictions...|$|E

In order to be able to cope with a range of pipe, materials and coverings, to allow for future modifications and to be able to incorporate a wide range of NDT inspection equipment, a modular approach was considered for the design of the mobile robot. Either two different inspection sensors may be mechanically incorporated into the chassis of the crawler and deployed at the same time or just a double-sided acting sensor (e. g. X-Ray) ...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} {{transients}} that occur when gravity flow is suddenly changed to pressure flow by {{the occurrence of}} a surge {{in the form of}} a travelling hydraulic jump in the line. The pressure head fluctuations associated with this transient have been studied. The transition is complicated by the mixture of air and water in the pipe. The transients in this two-phase air-water flow have been considered in this study. Some of the factors affecting these pressure transients are: pipe size, pipe shape, flow velocity, Froude number, relative depth of flow, alignment of the <b>pipe,</b> <b>pipe</b> material, venting arrangements and boundary conditions such as pumps, interceptors, and drop pipes. A mathematical model is developed to describe the mechanics of surcharging of a sewer; the model predicts the surge velocity, the surcharge at the surge front relative to sewer crown, the water level in the sump well or manhole, the velocity of the water surface in the sump well, the distance travelled by the surge front and, the transient pressure rise in the air-water two-phase flow. The mathematical model results are compared with the experimental results from the present study. The mathematical model results are in general agreement with the experimental data but the experimental pressure fluctuations were approximately 50...|$|E

40|$|The {{two broad}} {{categories}} of fiber-reinforced composite liner repair and deposited weld metal repair technologies were reviewed and evaluated for potential application for internal repair of gas transmission pipelines. Both {{are used to}} some extent for other applications and could be further developed for internal, local, structural repair of gas transmission pipelines. Evaluation trials were conducted on pipe sections with simulated corrosion damage repaired with glass fiber-reinforced composite liners, carbon fiber-reinforced composite liners, and weld deposition. Additional un-repaired pipe sections were evaluated in the virgin condition and with simulated damage. Hydrostatic failure pressures for pipe sections repaired with glass fiber-reinforced composite liner were only marginally {{greater than that of}} pipe sections without liners, indicating that this type of liner is generally ineffective at restoring the pressure containing capabilities of pipelines. Failure pressure for pipe repaired with carbon fiber-reinforced composite liner was greater than that of the un-repaired pipe section with damage, indicating that this type of liner is effective at restoring the pressure containing capability of <b>pipe.</b> <b>Pipe</b> repaired with weld deposition failed at pressures lower than that of un-repaired pipe in both the virgin and damaged conditions, indicating that this repair technology is less effective at restoring the pressure containing capability of pipe than a carbon fiber-reinforced liner repair.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to understand the fatigue crack growth behavior and validate analytical procedures for austenitic stainless steel and carbon steel pipes, pipe welds and elbows. The study involved fatigue tests on actual components and specimens. The Paris law has been used for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life. Paris constants have been determined for pipe (base), pipe weld and pipe elbow materials by using Compact Tension (CT) /Three Point Bend (TPB) specimens machined from the actual <b>pipe,</b> <b>pipe</b> weld and pipe elbow. Analyses have been carried out to predict the fatigue crack growth life of these piping components having part through cracks on the outer surface. In the analyses, Stress Intensity Factor (K) has been evaluated through two different schemes. The first scheme considers the ‘K’ evaluations at two points of the crack front i. e. maximum crack depth and crack tip end at the outer surface. The second scheme accounts for the area averaged root mean square stress intensity factor (KRMS) at deepest and surface points. In order to validate the analytical procedure/results, experiments have been carried out on full scale pipes, pipe welds with part through circumferential crack. The tests have also been conducted on the full scale carbon steel elbows having part-through circumferential notch at intrados location and axial notch at crown location on the outer surface. Fatigue crack growth life evaluated using both schemes have been compared with experimental results. Use of stress intensity factor (KRMS) evaluated using second scheme gives better fatigue crack growth life prediction compared to that of first scheme...|$|E
