In order to {{overcome}} parameterization problems of existing applications, we propose a unified sample-based approach to represent geometry and {{appearance of the}} 3 D object {{as well as the}} brush surface. The generalization of 2 D pixel-based paint models to point samples allows us to elegantly simulate paint transfer for 3 D objects. In contrast to mesh-based <b>painting</b> <b>systems,</b> an efficient dynamic resampling scheme permits arbitrary levels of <b>painted</b> detail. Our <b>system</b> provides intuitive user interaction with a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) input device. As opposed to other 3 D <b>painting</b> <b>systems,</b> real brushes are simulated including their dynamics and collision handling...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Corrosion {{protection}} {{is one of}} the important performance properties of organic coatings. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> for the protection of steel substrates from corrosion at high temperature atmospheres using silicone resin blend materials. Design/methodology/approach - An anti-corrosion <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> for high temperature atmosphere has been developed using silicone polyester resins. Silicone resin has been chosen due to its good resistance for corrosion in all kinds of environments. The <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> was prepared from the best performing binder system with the addition of inorganic pigments. Heat stability was studied according to ASTM D 2485 standards. Adhesion, impact resistance, film formation, thermal stability and electrochemical properties of the prepared coatings were evaluated by cross hatch adhesion method, tubular impact testing, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ELS), respectively. Findings - The <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> possessed good adhesion properties and had high-impact resistance. The SEM graphs showed the uniform formation of the film surface. From thermal analyses, the prepared <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> withstood temperatures up to 400 degrees C. The heat-treated specimen has also been evaluated for corrosion protection by EIS, which showed high resistance after 30 days of immersion in 3 percent NaCl solution. Originality/value - In this work, an attempt has been made to develop a good <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> using silicone resin and polyester resin blend materials. This research will be useful for the application for high temperature atmosphere and it can give a valuable guidance to the students who are interested in pursuing research in organic coatings...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the influence of curcumin dye natural colorant on adhesion, mechanical, thermal and electrochemical properties of blend poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) - acrylic polyol. Design/methodology/approach - Extracted curcumin yellow dye colorant from Curcuma Demostica was mixed with PMMA-acrylic polyol blended polymer in the volume ratios of 9 : 1, 8 : 2 and 7 : 3. The mixtures were applied on pre-treated cold-roll mild steel panels. All of the paint coating samples were subjected to potential time measurement (PTM), rapid impact deformation, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cross hatch and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) tests. Findings - The addition of curcumin dye colorant was able to improve the adhesion, flexibilities and resistance against electrolytes penetration of the blended poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) - acrylic polyol polymer <b>paint</b> <b>system.</b> Cross hatch test studies showed that high amount of curcumin dye colorant (AP 30 <b>paint</b> <b>system)</b> had the lowest peel-off coating area from the substrate. The FTIR test had confirmed the high concentration of hydroxyl group in the AP 30 sample. The hydroxyl group was able to promote hydrogen bonding between coating substrate interface. The AP 30 sample had the highest coating flexibilities when tested with rapid impact test. This {{was due to the}} lowest glass transition value T-g which indicated lowest cross linking density in the coating molecules structure. In the PTM test, AP 30 <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> had shown the highest rate electrolytes penetration within the AP sample. Research limitations/implications - The composition of curcumin dye colorant in the polymer blend is limited from 10 percent to 30 percent pigment volume concentration. Increasing the amount of lawsone pigment will result inhomogeneous mixtures. Originality/value - The AP <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> is suitable for interior applications. This <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> has to be mixed with suitable additive materials to improve its performance for exterior purpose...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{research}} activity carried {{out over the}} last 3 years in the Laboratory of Industrial Corrosion Control at the University of Trento. The subject is related to corrosion control through an organic coating <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> for steel substrates. In other words, it coveres the investigation of anticorrosive pigments as viable alternatives to replace the use of hazardous and toxic substances commonly present into an organic coating <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> {{and in addition to}} this, to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), the organic coating <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> itself has been designed to be solvent-free. Much of the work over the development of a water based full <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> containing the environmentally friendly nanoparticles was based on electrochemical techniques. Therefore, the contents within the next pages are divided into three main parts: i) a background about the use of electrochemical techniques for corrosion and corrosion control through organic coatings; ii) the electrochemical investigations of the environmentally friendly anticorrosive pigments; iii) the incorporation into one water based organic coating system. Also, great effort has been spent to understand the mechanisms of the coatings degradation as well as the mechanisms of anticorrosion protection given by the pigments. In this way, the results of interest have been delivered to scientific community via a number of publications in different journals as well as congresses participations. Lastly, the activities in this thesis were supported by the SteelCoat project. SteelCoat was a consortium cooperation project within the EU Seventh Frame Programme (FP 7), involving several companies and universities. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the corrosion resistance of a water-based commercial <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> applied on carbon steel. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the conventional three-electrode configuration was employed to test the various components of the <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> during their exposure to 3 wt. % NaCl aqueous solution. An efficient protection against corrosion was provided by the acrylic polymer containing zinc phosphate pigments when it was applied as a multilayer system. In this way, the high density of pores produced in the polymer matrix during the curing process could be avoided to become direct ionic pathways for the transport of aggressive species from the environment towards the surface of the underlying metal substrate...|$|R

50|$|Class 3: These {{chemical}} conversion coatings provide a corrosion preventive film for electrical and electronic applications where lower resistant contacts, relative to class 1A coatings, and anodic coatings {{in accordance with}} MIL-A-8625, are required. Because Class 3 coatings are thinner they {{are more susceptible to}} corrosion than class 1A coatings. If it is required to paint areas surrounding electrical Class 3 coatings improve adhesion of <b>paint</b> <b>systems</b> on aluminum and aluminum alloy material. Keep in mind that un-coated aluminum will naturally oxidize if left un-coated. If your goal is to ground to the surface of your aluminum part, then a thin class 3 coating keeps the oxide from building up and provides a better surface for grounding to be accomplished. Also keep in mind that {{chemical conversion}} coating is not conductive, so to accomplish a good ground, sufficient pressure is required between the parts.|$|E
40|$|Water-borne {{anticorrosive}} paints are acquiring increasing {{relevance for}} the anticorrosive protection of steel surfaces {{exposed to the}} atmosphere, mostly due to the restrictions imposed by environmental and health protection agencies, However, some companies continue to be reluctant to use paints of this type to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion.

The single light spots arising from the pigment structure and orientation in the <b>paint</b> <b>system</b> seem to spring back and forth when a painted metal plate is tilted. Also, the color of the other components of the paint has an influence in addition to the concentration of the pigment.
