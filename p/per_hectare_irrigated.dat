30|$|Grain sorghum is the {{principal}} summer crop and it usually is planted in January {{to take advantage of}} stored soil water and summer rainfall. Yields are moderate, usually less than 5 tonnes <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> with the average yield for the region being 1.6 – 1.8 tonnes <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Most farms grow areas in excess of 1000  ha to compensate for the low yield. Because the crop relies on stored soil water and because rainfall is less frequent in late summer. Most crops experience a “terminal drought.” Wheat is the main winter crop, planted in April and May, although some crops are planted earlier to enable them to avoid frost at flowering time. Yields seldom exceed 5  tonnes <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> in rain-grown conditions. Chickpeas have become a favored winter crop in recent years because of their drought hardiness and ability to exploit stored soil water. Yields of 2.5  tonnes <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> are common. Under irrigated conditions, cotton is the preferred crop although maize is also grown. Irrigated cotton yields can exceed 10 bales <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> and <b>irrigated</b> maize yields can also exceed 10  tonnes <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{critical}} {{phase of}} the cultivation is the quality control of the mycorrhizal plants.

40|$|Forage sorghum {{is one of}} {{the most}} heat and drought {{resistant}} cereal forage having the potential to yield nutritious forage even during the months of extreme heat for dairy animals. It yields considerably higher biomass production with less use of fertilizers and irrigations. It can be grown in almost all types of soils and has the potential to tolerate soil toxicities without considerable reduction in green forage yield. But in Pakistan, <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> green forage yield of sorghum is much less (about 13 tons <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> in <b>irrigated</b> tracts) than the potential. Rainfed areas are producing even less green forage yield than irrigated tracts. A variety of factors reduce forage sorghum yield including selection of unsuitable forage sorghum cultivars, poor seed bed preparation, weeds and fewer use of fertilizers. Appropriate agronomic management strategies hold the key in bridging the gap between forage sorghum yield and potential. Appropriate variety selection, pre-sowing seed priming and seed treatment with fungicide, fine seed bed preparation, line sowing, balanced use of fertilizers at optimum time, irrigation management, insect-pest management and harvesting at 50 % flowering stage are few of the strategies which can increase the forage sorghum yield to a great extent. Appropriate agronomic management strategies are bound to increase the forage sorghum yield as well as its quality attributes particularly protein contents. In this way, sustainable supply of green forage during summer reduces the drastic effects of forage shortage and ultimately milk production on sustainable basis can be ensured to cater the needs of rising population...|$|R

The results show that nitrate content in 30 % of the drainage ditches is above the tolerance limit for human consumption. In areas of crops that are very demanding of nitrogen fertilizers (corn, vegetables), nitrate levels reached 100 mg 1 - 1 during the irrigation period. At the Arba outlet, average nitrate levels were 40 mg 1 - 1 with maximum levels of 57 mg 1 - 1, while before entering the area the concentrations were 2 mg 1 - 1.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Philippine {{comparative advantage}} in rice production and whether government policies encourage the rice sector to exploit its advantage° Rice production has grown at 6 ° 0 percent annually in 1970 s. This {{growth has been}} due to yield increases from newer modern varieties and more fertilizer and to increases in irrigated area° Government policies have contributed to growth principally through irrigation investments. Irrigation is heavily subsidized but other price policies tax producers° Domestic rice prices are slightly below world prices and most input prices are above world levels. The distortion in net incentives however is not large° The net effect of government policy is to provide slightly positive protection for irrigated farms (3. 6 %) and slightly negative protection for rainfed farms (- 4. 7 %). Rice production on both rainfed and irrigated environments is socially profitable in 1979. Although yields are higher on irrigated fields costs per unit of rice output are similar in rainfed systems° Government policies reduce private profitability in rainfed farms, but in social terms these farms are quite competitive. A comparison of the DRC for irrigated rice with the 1974 estimate of Herdt and Lacsina (1976) shows that rising yields have increased Philippine comparative advantage in rice. Future comparative advantage {{will depend on the}} relative growth of yields and irrigation costs. If capital cost <b>per</b> new <b>hectare</b> <b>irrigated</b> continues to grow at past rates, yields will have to increase at least 2 ° 8 percent annually to maintain current comparative advantage° Although the Philippines has a comparative advantage in rice production, exports were unprofitable for the government marketing agency in 1977 to 1979. Government control of exports puts a barrier between world and domestic markets so that world quality premiums are not reflected in domestic prices. The domestic milling industry therefore has no incentive to become competitive in higher quality international markets. Inelastic demand for low-quality Philippine rice on world markets then limits profitable exports. If private traders were allowed to export, {{they should be able to}} respond to world market incentives to produce and export good quality rice at a profit...|$|R

40|$|The {{drylands}} of semi-arid and arid {{areas of}} subtropical regions. {{contribute significantly to}} the world's food production, particularly of coarse grains, cereals, pulses, and oilseed. Although present yields of these crops are low, they have excellent production potential in dryland conditions. In the seventies, a number of concepts and techniques have been developed that can substantially improve the productivity {{of many of these}} drylands. But they have yet to be exploited extensively and intensively. There are good indications that the new farming practices can bring about a breakthrough in production in deep Vertisols, which occupy many million hectares in India. An analysis of constraints to productivity and production in drylands shows that, besides environmental and socio-economic constraints, technological constraints also seriously limit productivity in many of these areas. Water is a limiting factor in drylands and provision of water for only "lifesaving" irrigation (i. e [...] the minimum to prevent total crop loss) can stimulate a favourable chain reaction. However, even without irrigation, appropriate biological technology coupled with fertilisers can enhance productivity manifold. Fertiliser-responsive genotypes with higher yield potential and stability against yield reducers are becoming a catalyst of change in drylands. Such genotypes are available in the case of sorghum, millet, and maize, but not yet for pulses and oilseeds. Dryland farmers are becoming interested in the use of fertilisers' for dry-farm crops, but their first preference is for high-value, market-oriented crops, high-yielding cereals and for lands with better moisture-storage capacity capable of giving stable yields and assured returns. The unirrigated lands of the semi-arid tropics (SAT) in India are at present given less than 18 kg of NPK <b>per</b> <b>hectare,</b> while <b>irrigated</b> fields in the same area receive about 58 kg <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> annually. It is concluded that the rate of growth of fertiliser use in both these situations is commensurate with the technology and the infrastructure but there is considerable scope for increase. This suggests a need for intensive research on the loss and efficiency of notrogenous and Phosphatic fertilisers under dryland conditions and the development of implements for seeding and fertiliser application at proper depth in relation to soil moisture. To avoid shortfalls in production of coarse grains, pulses, and oil seeds and to substantially increase their productivity, intensified support for research and development of dryland agriculture is needed. Investment in dryland agriculture should be considered a cast of social justice and equity to prevent an increasing gap between the disadvantaged populations of these poor areas {{and the rest of the}} world...|$|R
