40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWarfare in the 21 st century has matured {{to the point}} where military technology and force are no longer the keys to victory. Today’s warfare has become a war of ideas. Success in war now means winning {{the hearts and minds of}} citizens to prevent them from becoming radicalized. The research question posed is how can the United States effectively fight the war of ideas, and can it develop its own counter-strategic strategy? Utilizing the case study method aspects of the United Kingdom’s counter radicalization PREVENT strategy were examined. Based on this research, a U. S. policy model is proposed where the United States develops its own counter-radicalization strategy. The findings of this research show that a U. S. counter-radicalization strategy should be implemented. However, it would be carried out at the local level(i. e., mayor’s offices and/or governor’s offices). It will require the coordinated effort of several federal agencies to establish <b>programs</b> to <b>address</b> radicalization factors. The findings propose that this coordination be carried out by an appointed Counter radicalization Czar through the Department of Homeland Security. The Czar would have intra-departmental authority to coordinate federal agencies to promote and provide <b>programs</b> that <b>address</b> <b>counter</b> radicalization factors that make individuals susceptible to the terrorist message.

5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Intel MCS-85 device family, the 8237 is an 8-bit device with 16-bit addressing. However, it is {{compatible}} with the 8086/88 microprocessors. The IBM PC and PC XT models (machine types 5150 and 5160) have an 8088 CPU and an 8-bit system bus architecture; the latter interfaces directly to the 8237, but the 8088 has a 20-bit address bus, so four additional 4-bit address latches, one for each DMA channel, are added alongside the 8237 to augment the <b>address</b> <b>counters.</b> However, because these external latches are separate from the 8237 <b>address</b> <b>counters,</b> they are never automatically incremented or decremented during DMA operations, making it impossible to perform a DMA operation across a 64 KiB address boundary. Attempts to cross a 64 KiB boundary in a DMA transfer will wrap around within one 64 KiB block of memory. (For example, if a DMA channel and the associated <b>address</b> latch were <b>programmed</b> to transfer 256 bytes to ascending addresses starting at address 0x3FF8C, instead of transferring to addresses 0x3FF8C through 0x4008B, data would be transferred to addresses 0x3FF8C through 0x3FFFF and then to 0x30000 through 0x3008B.) ...|$|R
