After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Fund,</b> the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies.

50|$|In the United States, a <b>permanent</b> <b>fund</b> {{is one of}} {{the five}} {{governmental}} fund types established by GAAP. It is classified as a restricted true endowment fund for governments and non-profit organizations. Put simply, a <b>permanent</b> <b>fund</b> may be used to generate and disburse money to those entitled to receive payments by qualification or agreement, {{as in the case of}} Alaska citizens or residents that satisfy the rules for payment from their <b>permanent</b> <b>fund</b> from State oil revenues. It was first introduced through GASB Statement 34. The name of the fund comes from the purpose of the fund: a sum of equity used to permanently generate payments to maintain some financial obligation. Also, a fund can only be classified as a <b>permanent</b> <b>fund</b> if the money is used to report the status of a restricted financial resource. The resource is restricted in the sense that only earnings from the resource are used and not the principal. For example, a fund can be classified as a <b>permanent</b> <b>fund</b> if it is being used to pay for accounting services for a perpetual endowment of a government-run cemetery or financial endowments towards a government-run library.|$|R
50|$|The revenue {{distribution}} process {{varies from}} state to state. States predominantly generate revenue from leasing activities or sales of renewable resources (such as grazing leases and timber sales), uses that provide annual income for the beneficiaries. Additionally, revenues {{from the sale of}} trust lands or the sale of non-renewable natural resources are invested into a permanent fund to generate interest for distribution to the beneficiaries. These <b>permanent</b> <b>funds,</b> and the interest payments derived from them, are used for many purposes related to the public school system, including guaranteeing school bonds and loans, funding construction and providing land for public institutions, and supplementing teacher salaries.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, Calgary, Canada {{was chosen}} as host city for the pageant, a {{decision}} announced on March 13, 1984.

An agreement was reached whereby funds from the city could be used but had to be repaid, although some complained about [...] "using sex to sell the city". By late April there were indications that the pageant might be moved to Miami, Florida due to the continued financial issues, but that negotiations {{in the hope of}} Calgary retaining the event were ongoing. Despite the attempts of Calgary's Tourist Bureau, Miami was officially announced as the new venue on 12 May 1984, a decision which cost Calgary $125,000 and left the city facing a potential lawsuit from Miss Universe Inc., the pageant owner.|$|E
50|$|Oil and gas {{production}} {{is a significant}} source of revenue for the state. As of 2000, taxes and royalties on oil, natural gas, and carbon dioxide production together accounted for more than 25% of the revenue to the state's general fund. The balance in New Mexico's Severance Tax and Land Grant <b>Permanent</b> <b>Funds,</b> the earnings from which are dedicated to funding of schools and some state government operations, was almost entirely derived from these same sources. A 2009 analysis found that New Mexico was receiving less revenue from the combination of its oil and gas taxes and royalties for oil and gas from public lands than most other U.S. states with substantial production of hydrocarbon fuels. This discrepancy was explained by the caps that state law placed on the maximum prices of oil and natural gas that could be subject to taxation. The maximum tax for oil was based on a price of $18 per barrel, but the market price rose to $112 per barrel as of May 2011. The maximum tax for natural gas was based on a price of $1.35 per 1000 cubic feet, but the market price for that volume of gas in May 2011 was $4.35. Other states were receiving much more tax and royalty revenue {{as a result of these}} high prices. Legislation enacted in 2010 established a rate of 0.24% (an increase from 0.19%) for the oil and gas conservation tax rate on oil if the average price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was more than $70 per barrel in the previous quarter.|$|E

The Fund grew from an initial investment of $734,000 in 1977 to approximately $53.7 billion as of July 9, 2015. [...] Some growth was due to good management, some to inflationary re-investment, and some via legislative decisions to deposit extra income during boom years.

5000|$|While the Permanent Fund {{generally}} generated large surpluses {{even after}} payment of the Dividend PFD, the state general fund operated at a substantial deficit. However, the consolidated account of both General and <b>Permanent</b> <b>Funds</b> usually shows a surplus. The Funds' ultimate uses were never clearly spelled out at its inception, leaving no current consensus over what role Fund earning should {{play in the}} current and expected state budget shortfalls. However, some people argue that the original intent was to fund state government after the temporary oil riches ceased, while others note that the Fund's intent changed from its 1976 origin when in 1982 the Dividend program began. Public opinion strongly favors the Dividend program. Indeed, in 1999, with oil prices going as low as $9 per barrel and Alaska's oil consultant Daniel Yergin forecasting low prices [...] "for the foreseeable future", the State put an advisory vote before Alaskans, asking if government could spend [...] "some" [...] part of Permanent Fund earning for government purposes. Gov. Knowles, Lt. Gov. Ulmer, and many other elected officials urged a [...] "yes" [...] vote. Campaign spending greatly favored the [...] "yes" [...] side. The public voted [...] "no" [...] by nearly 84%. (Oil prices rose dramatically, starting about two weeks after Yergin's prediction, to above $60 per barrel, though the quantity produced continues to fall.) Perceived support of the dividend program is so universally strong that it ensures the dividend's continuity {{and the protection of}} the Fund's principal, since any measure characterized as negatively impacting dividend payouts represents a loss to the entire populace. That is, legislators willing to appropriate the Fund's annual earnings are constrained by the politically suicidal nature of any decrease in the public's dividend.|$|E

40|$|Judicious {{choice of}} the better {{combination}} of self-financing and borrowing {{is one of the}} thorniest problems that firms seek often to solve in the area of financing. Such dosage of financing is often the result of a policy of financing that quantifies in monetary terms, the targeted objectives in the framework of the overall strategy of firms. Our research problem consists of exploring determinant variables of the choice of means of financing by Moroccan industrial firms, trying to shed light on various behavioral financial profiles of firms. The choice of industrial firms is dictated by the fact that firms operating in the industrial sector need more <b>permanent</b> <b>funds</b> to finance their long-term investment and exploitation cycles.
