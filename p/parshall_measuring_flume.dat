The objective was to study the effects of irrigation water regimes on growth, yield and quality of the potato crop. Watering regimes used in the experiment were 500, 600, 700 and 800 mm per growing period in 1992 / 93 season and 240, 320, 400, 480, 560 and 640 mm per growing period in 1993 / 94 season. The <b>Parshall</b> <b>Flume</b> <b>measuring</b> device was used for the application of the required water regimes. The results showed that stem emergence was delayed by low water regimes. Vegetative growth and yield components responded positively to the increasing water regime up to 600 and 560 mm in 1992 / 93 and 1993 / 94, respectively. Highest (800 mm) and lowest (240 mm) watering regimes were associated with the lowest total and marketable yields. The highest yield of 17. 9 tons/ha. was obtained by the watering regime 600 mm per season. Less water regimes (240 ­- 500 mm) were associated with low yield and high tuber infestation as a result of soil cracking and exposure of tubers to pests primarily potato tuber moth. It is concluded that the optimum irrigation water regime for the potato crop under Shambat environment ranges from 560 to 600 mm per season applied in 8 to 10 irrigations, depending on the prevailing climatic conditions.

40|$|Submerged flow {{exists in}} a <b>measuring</b> <b>flume</b> when a change in flow depth {{downstream}} from the flume causes a change in flow depth upstream for any particular constant value of discharge. When a change in tailwater depth {{does not affect the}} upstream depth, free flow exists. To evaluate the discharge under free-flow conditions, it is necessary to measure only a flow depth upstream from the contracted section (throat) of the flume, whereas two flow depths must be measured to evaluate the discharge under submerged-flow conditions. The two flow depths normally measured when submerged flow exists consist of the same upstream depth used for free flow and a depth measured in the throat, although this need not be the case as will be shown later. Most of the earlier investigations regarding <b>measuring</b> <b>flumes</b> have emphasized the development of free-flow calibrations or ratings for various flume geometries. Notable free flow investigations have been made by V. M. Cone, Parshall, Engel, Khafagi, Robinson and Chamberlain, and Ackers and Harrison, to mention a few. Various methods of analyzing submerged flow have been presented by Parshall, Khafagi, Villemonte and Gunaji, Robinson and Chamberlain, and Robinson.

The most common <b>measuring</b> <b>flume</b> is the <b>Parshall</b> flume developed by Ralph Parshall at Colorado State University. Common to most flumes is the basic geometry consisting of a converging inlet section, a throat, and a diverging outlet section. Occasionally, the diverging outlet section is removed under free flow conditions, and the water is allowed to jet directly from the throat section into the downstream channel. This is not always permissible, however, in unlined channels because of possible erosion problems. In flat gradient channels, a flume may be installed to operate under conditions of submerged flow rather then free flow in order to (1) reduce energy losses, and (2) allow placement of the flume on the channel bed to minimize the increase in water surface elevation upstream from the flume. The purpose of the research effort reported herein was to develop a flume which would operate satisfactorily under both free flow and submerged flow conditions...|$|R

Because of the previous findings, it was felt this method of analyzing submerged flow could be applied to highway embankments. A highway embankment is a form of broad-crested weir when overtopped by flood waters. Being a weir, the flood discharge over the embankment is only a function of the upstream depth for free flow conditions.

A method of analyzing subcritical (submerged) flow has been developed for flumes. Because of previous findings, it was felt that this method of analyzing submerged flow could be applied to highway embankments. A highway embankment, when overtopped by flood waters, is a form of broad-crested weir. Being a weir, the flood discharge over the embankment is only a function of the upstream depth for free flow conditions.

40|$|SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION The {{discharge}} {{occurring in}} an open channel can be measured by placing a constriction in the channel. Flumes are commonly used as constriction in open channels. A flume is a specially designed and calibrated section built into a channel, the physical properties of which allow the calculation of the discharge. The narrowest section of the flume is usually called the throat. The velocity of flow through the throat, for any given flow rate, increases with {{a decrease in the}} flow depth. The ideal condition for measurement of discharge is a throat sufficiently constricted to produce critical-depth in the throat. Whenever the geometry of a channel produces critical flow the relationship between discharge and head is independent of conditions downstream, making discharge a function of only the upstream depth. Thus, when critical-depth occurs in the throat, the only measurement required to determine the discharge through the flume is the upstream depth of flow, thus making the wide use of critical-depth flumes desirable for measurement purposes. Flumes of carious shapes are used to obtain a condition of critical-depth, the most common and well known being the Parshall flume. One purpose of this investigation has been to study the trapezoidal shaped flumes which several researches (Ackers and Harrison, 1963; Ludwig and Ludwig, 1951; Palmer and Bowlus, 1936; Robinson and Chamberlain, 1962; and Wells and Gotaas, 1948) have investigated. However, the primary purpose of this investigation has been the design, calibration, and evaluation, by model study, of a trapezoidal <b>measuring</b> <b>flume</b> to be constructed in the distribution system of the D. M. A. D. Company (Delta, Melville, Abraham, and Deseret Irrigation Companies) in Delta, utah. The flume to be constrcuted will be used to measure irrigation waters in a canal (Canal 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2) having a capacity of 300 cfs (cubic feet per second) and located below the D. M. A. D. Dam. The essential objectives of the model study have been: (1) investigation of several entrance and exit conditions to obtain the most economical, efficient, and practical design, (2) correlation of the data from this study with that of previous research, and (3) comparison of head losses in trapezoidal flumes with those of rectangular and Parshall flumes. The trapezoidal flume has been designed as a critical-depth flume utilizing present tailwater conditions (the present depth-discharge relationship for Canal 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 is illustrated in Figure 1). However, increased developments by the D. M. A. D. Company in the channel downstream from the proposed flume may yield increased depth of flow for any particular discharge, thereby increasing the degree of submergence. In case the tailwater depths should rise much above the present levels for any particular discharge, submergence of the flume will undoubtedly occur and then two variables will have to be measured both the upstream and tailwater depths. Consequently, the calibration of the trapezoidal <b>measuring</b> <b>flume</b> was extended to submerged flow in this investigation. After the prototype structure has been constructed, a field calibration will be conducted. This field calibration will be compared with the calibration for the prototype structure as predicted from the model study.

This method is not suitable for streams with large amount of debris, sediment or solids. Construction and installation are difficult (Shieh et al. 1996; Baffaut et al. 2015).

40|$|Much of {{the western}} United States is {{considered}} to be rangeland. Rangeland areas produce a diverse mix of benefits and products, and their overall health, in an ecosystem context, is of national importance. Because sediment yield from a watershed is an integrated expression of all soil erosion and sedimentation processes occurring within it, it is logical that we seek to quantify and interpret sediment yield in the context of soil/site stability and watershed function as measures of rangeland health. Depth integrated suspended sediment samples were combined with runoff <b>measured</b> using <b>flumes</b> to calculate sediment discharge and yield from two experimental watersheds in the southwestern USA. Sediment yield estimates for individual runoff events were summed to produce estimates of annual sediment yield from these two rangeland watersheds. Estimated annual sediment yield data were then combined with the concepts of sediment delivery ratio and soil loss tolerance to assess soil/site stability at the watershed scale. Analyses suggest that using sediment yield estimates from distributed watershed processes with time-space averaged soil loss tolerance values is inconsistent. Thus, new distributed soil/site stability criteria are needed to replace the soil loss tolerance concept in assessing the health of rangeland watersheds. Sediment transport/yield models are used at interior points in a watershed to simulate distributed sedimentation processes. However, application of these models requires calibration and validation data and is thus dependent upon the availability ofsediment concentration and yield databases. Therefore, additional efforts are required to build sediment yield databases through rescue of historical data along with continued measurement and monitoring at existing and new sampling sites...|$|R

40|$|The St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory (SAFHL) was {{contracted}} by Anchor Wall Systems, Inc. {{to perform}} hydraulic testing of its Anchor Vertica units. The testing was performed during March and April of 1995 in SAFHL's largest <b>flume,</b> <b>measuring</b> 6 ft high x 9 ft wide x 253 ft long, {{with a maximum}} discharge capacity of 300 ft^ 3 /s. The tests were undertaken to evaluate Vertica block performance when subjected to conditions which may be encountered in channel and shoreline applications. This report describes the test procedures and technical data obtained during the testing of the Vertica units. As such this report provides background for a video produced by Promotovision entitled "Anchor Keeps the Water Away. " Two different test walls were constructed to evaluate three potential mechanisms {{which could lead to}} possible failure. 1. Wall performance when subjected to high velocity water flowing past a channel wall entrance and passing along a channel side wall. 2. The effects of rapid drawdown on a wall under saturated backfill conditions. 3. The effects of repeated wave impact on wall performanc...|$|R
40|$|Predicting {{flow and}} mass {{transport}} in vegetated regions has {{a broad range}} of applications in ecology and engineering practice. This paper presents large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flow and scalar transport within a fully developed open-channel with submerged vegetation. To properly represent the scalar transport, an additional diffusivity was introduced within the canopy to account for the contribution of stem wakes, which were not resolved by the LES, to turbulent diffusion. The LES produced good agreement with the velocity and concentration fields <b>measured</b> in a <b>flume</b> experiment. The simulation revealed a secondary flow distributed symmetrically about the channel centerline, which differed significantly from the circulation in a bare channel. The secondary circulation accelerated the vertical spread of the plume both within and above the canopy layer. Quadrant analysis was used to identify the form and shape of canopy-scale turbulent structures within and above the vegetation canopy. Within the canopy, sweep events contributed more to momentum transfer than ejection events, whereas the opposite occurred above the canopy. The coherent structures were similar to those observed in terrestrial canopies, but smaller in scale due to the constraint of the water surface. National Science Foundation (U. S.)
