50|$|All R/C models {{generally}} {{require the}} purchase of additional accessories. For electrical vehicles, battery packs and a suitable charger are needed to power the car and are seldom included. A soldering iron and supplies are often necessary to build high-performance battery packs or install upgraded electronics with low-resistance connectors. A Li-Polymer battery with a hard case is most popular for RC cars, with the most common voltages being 7.4 V or 11.1 V. For nitro-powered vehicles, a glow <b>plug</b> <b>heater</b> and fuel are needed to start the engine, as well as 4 AA size batteries, or a rechargeable 6-volt 5-cell battery pack to power the onboard electronics. Nitro vehicles also require a means of cranking the engine over, which can be achieved using a pullstart, starterbox, battery operated rotostart, or by an electric drill. Relatively expensive model fuel, spare glow-plugs, and after-run oil are also needed. Gasoline-powered vehicles require only a receiver battery pack and a means to start the engine, usually the included pullstart. Hobby-grade vehicles almost always require 8 AA size batteries to power the transmitter, though some can use rechargeable transmitter pack or simply rechargeable AAs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe puffing and micro-explosion of {{a single}} burning droplet {{comprised}} of neat diesel, rapeseed methyl ester (RME); binary fuel mixtures of diesel–ethanol, diesel–RME, RME–ethanol; and ternary microemulsion of these fuel blends at various compositions have been studied using high speed backlight imaging method. Fuel droplet was suspended {{on the tip of}} a 130 μm gauge thermocouple and it was ignited using a glow <b>plug</b> <b>heater.</b> Based on the temporal variation of droplet projected area, the characteristics of fuel droplets studied were classified into smooth burning, puffing and explosion. A ternary plot has been proposed to identify the mixture composition of the blends that can result in smooth burning, puffing and explosion. Micro-explosion phenomenon was observed in the ternary blends with ethanol percentages between 10 % and 40 %. Secondary droplets resulted from the puffing and explosion of suspended parent droplet were observed to undergo further explosion. The time scales associated with complete disintegration of secondary droplets are found to be comparable to the mixing and the chemical reaction time scales of sprays in diesel engines...|$|E
50|$|<b>Plugged</b> in, undertank <b>heaters</b> provide even warmth {{under the}} pad. A {{substrate}} must be used, and the device {{should always be}} connected to a thermostat or rheostat {{to prevent it from}} overheating and burning the animals.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} block heaters called a [...] "freeze plug heater" [...] can be installed, {{replacing}} {{one of the}} core <b>plugs.</b> The electrical <b>heater</b> is used to warm the engine coolant (and therefore the engine) before start up.|$|R
2500|$|Diesel fuel [...] {{in general}} is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines, whose fuel {{ignition}} takes place, without any spark, {{as a result of}} compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel. (Glow <b>plugs,</b> grid <b>heaters</b> and block heaters help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather.) Diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency. This is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load; as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine, their efficiency still remains very high.|$|R
40|$|Three loss {{mechanisms}} in fountain-effect pumps are identified and analyzed. Two of these mechanisms reduce the mechano-caloric effect, {{by reducing the}} mass transferred per unit heat input. The first loss mechanism of these losses {{is the result of}} normal fluid leakage through the pump. The second loss mechanism {{is the result of the}} finite separation between the porous <b>plug</b> and the <b>heater.</b> The third loss mechanism reduces the thermomechanical effect. It results from the Gorter-Mellink interaction within the porous plug. All three of these loss mechanisms are shown to reduce pump efficiency. They are then applied to an example to illustrate the relative significance of the three mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|Victor {{extended}} their {{range of a}} 25 cwt and a 2-ton vehicle {{by the addition of}} a 12 cwt model in 1936. All of their vehicles were designed to have a top speed of 20 mph. The electric motor was mounted just behind the front wheels, and drove the rear wheels through a propellor shaft and bevel rear axle. The front wheels were fitted with independent suspension, to reduce pitching, and the buyer could specify whether they wanted steering to be by a tiller or a wheel. [...] In 1945 Victor announced that it had developed a battery-electric vehicle which did not need a separate charger, but could be plugged into any standard <b>heater</b> <b>plug.</b> This principle had been tried to good effect in Europe. Other innovations included the concept of a standard battery, which could be fitted to eight different vehicles with payloads ranging from 10 cwt to 80 cwt. A single battery would be fitted to the smallest vehicle, and four to the largest. They also announced a scheme by which batteries could be hired, rather than bought outright.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. <b>Heater</b> <b>plugs</b> were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees {{before top dead center}} (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow <b>plugs</b> and grid <b>heaters</b> to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due to the absence of throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the diesel engine {{performance}} and drivability have significantly improved with the latest technologic developments. Nevertheless, one of the disadvantageous of diesel engines {{is related to the}} difficulties for starting at cold conditions, particularly in the conditions where the ambient temperature is near or below 0 ºC. Additionally, the harmful exhaust emissions are also at significantly important levels during the cold start conditions. Most of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from diesel engines are produced during the engine warm-up period.   In order to improve cold start characteristics of diesel engines, many measures have been proposed, such as glow <b>plugs</b> and air <b>heaters</b> in air intake lines. In this study, in order to increase the cold start performance and improve the exhaust emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine, phase change materials (PCMs) have been used. PCMs have high heats of fusion and they can absorb latent energy before melting. During the phase change, temperature of PCMs remains nearly constant. In this study, a PCMs was used with the 45 - 51 ºC melting temperature band in a heat exchanger. Hot water from an external source was circulated in the exchanger to carry out the experiments in the same conditions and was used as heat source in order to melt the PCMs. Engine intake air has been passed through the exchanger before engine intake manifold.   During the engine cooling period, the PCM in the produced heat exchanger have increased the cooling time period of engine intake air. An experimental setup has been established to observe the cold start characteristics of the two cylinder diesel engine with and without using the produced exchanger. Temperature measurements from different points, CO exhaust emissions, engine speed and in cylinder pressure measurements have been used to evaluate the contribution of exchanger and increasing the intake air temperature by using the PCMs. The experiments have been carried out at different PCMs and ambient temperatures. The increase in the temperature of intake air at low ambient temperatures assists the engine cold start performance, decreases the starting time of engine and improves the engine exhaust emissions characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project has been to demonstrate the use of alkaline reagents injected into the furnace of coal-fired boilers {{as a means of}} controlling sulfuric acid emissions. The project was co-funded by the U. S. DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 99 FT 40718, along with EPRI, the American Electric Power Company (AEP), FirstEnergy Corporation, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Carmeuse North America. Sulfuric acid controls are becoming of increased interest for coal-fired power generating units for a number of reasons. In particular, sulfuric acid can cause plant operation problems such as air <b>heater</b> <b>plugging</b> and fouling, back-end corrosion, and plume opacity. These issues will likely be exacerbated with the retrofit of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOX control, as SCR catalysts are known to further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO{sub 2 } to SO{sub 3 }. The project tested the effectiveness of furnace injection of four different magnesium-based or dolomitic alkaline sorbents on full-scale utility boilers. These reagents were tested during one- to two-week tests conducted on two FirstEnergy Bruce Mansfield Plant (BMP) units. One of the sorbents tested was a magnesium hydroxide slurry byproduct from a modified Thiosorbic{reg_sign} Lime wet flue gas desulfurization process. The other three sorbents are available commercially and include dolomite, pressure-hydrated dolomitic lime, and commercially available magnesium hydroxide. The dolomite reagent was injected as a dry powder through out-of-service burners. The other three reagents were injected as slurries through air-atomizing nozzles inserted through the front wall of the upper furnace. After completing the four one- to two-week tests, the most promising sorbents were selected for longer-term (approximately 25 -day) full-scale tests on two different units. The longer-term tests were conducted to confirm sorbent effectiveness over extended operation on two different boilers, and to determine balance-of-plant impacts. The first long-term test was conducted on FirstEnergy's BMP Unit 3, and the second was conducted on AEP's Gavin Plant, Unit 1. The Gavin Plant test provided an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sorbent injected into the furnace on SO{sub 3 } formed across an operating SCR reactor. A final task in the project was to compare projected costs for furnace injection of magnesium hydroxide slurries to estimated costs for other potential sulfuric acid control technologies. Estimates were developed for reagent and utility costs, and capital costs, for furnace injection of magnesium hydroxide slurries and seven other sulfuric acid control technologies. The estimates were based on retrofit application to a model coal-fired plant...|$|R

Sulfuric acid controls are becoming of increasing interest to utilities with coal-fired units for a number of reasons. Sulfuric acid is a Toxic Release Inventory species, a precursor to acid aerosol/condensable emissions, and can cause a variety of plant operation problems such as air <b>heater</b> <b>plugging</b> and fouling, back-end corrosion, and plume opacity. These issues will likely be exacerbated with the retrofit of SCR for NO{sub x} control on some coal-fired plants, as SCR catalysts are known to further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO{sub 2 } to SO{sub 3 }. The project is testing the effectiveness of furnace injection of four different calcium- and/or magnesium-based alkaline sorbents on full-scale utility boilers. These reagents have been tested during four one- to two-week tests conducted on two First Energy Bruce Mansfield Plant units. One of the sorbents tested was a magnesium hydroxide slurry produced from a wet flue gas desulfurization system waste stream, from a system that employs a Thiosorbic{reg_sign} Lime scrubbing process. The other three sorbents are available commercially and include dolomite, pressure-hydrated dolomitic lime, and commercial magnesium hydroxide. The dolomite reagent was injected as a dry powder through out-of-service burners, while the other three reagents were injected as slurries through air-atomizing nozzles into the front wall of upper furnace, either across from the nose of the furnace or across from the pendant superheater tubes. After completing the four one- to two-week tests, the most promising sorbents were selected for longer-term (approximately 25 -day) full-scale tests. The longer-term tests are being conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the sorbents tested over extended operation and to determine balance-of-plant impacts. This reports presents the results of the short-term tests; the long-term test results will be reported in a later document. The short-term test results showed that three of the four reagents tested, dolomite powder, commercial magnesium hydroxide slurry, and byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry, were able to achieve 90 % or greater removal of sulfuric acid compared to baseline levels. The molar ratio of alkali to flue gas sulfuric acid content (under baseline conditions) required to achieve 90 % sulfuric acid removal was lowest for the byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry. However, this result may be confounded because this {{was the only one of}} the three slurries tested with injection near the top of the furnace across from the pendant superheater platens. Injection at the higher level was demonstrated to be advantageous for this reagent over injection lower in the furnace, where the other slurries were tested...|$|R

The Gavin Plant testing provided an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sorbent injected into the furnace on SO{sub 3 } formed across an operating SCR reactor. This report presents the results from those long-term tests. The tests determined the effectiveness of injecting commercially available magnesium hydroxide slurry (Gavin Plant) and byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry (both Gavin Plant and BMP) for sulfuric acid control. The results show that injecting either slurry could achieve up to 70 to 75 % overall sulfuric acid removal. At BMP, this overall removal was limited by the need to maintain acceptable electrostatic precipitator (ESP) particulate control performance. At Gavin Plant, the overall sulfuric acid removal was limited because the furnace injected sorbent was less effective at removing SO{sub 3 } formed across the SCR system installed on the unit for NOX control than at removing SO{sub 3 } formed in the furnace. The long-term tests also determined balance-of-plant impacts from slurry injection during the two tests. These include impacts on boiler back-end temperatures and pressure drops, SCR catalyst properties, ESP performance, removal of other flue gas species, and flue gas opacity. For the most part the balance-of-plant impacts were neutral to positive, although adverse effects on ESP performance became an issue during the BMP test...|$|R
