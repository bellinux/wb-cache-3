Acid gases are removed from the flue gases by passing through a two-stage scrubber to remove acid components, especially halogen compounds such as hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid. A counter flow neutral scrubber follows, using a lime slurry to remove sulphur oxides (SO2, SO3). The pollutant gases are either dissolved in water droplets (acids) or bound as calcium salts (SO2, SO3) and thereby are successfully removed from the flue gas.

Three filter media were used: crushed glass, sand, and a shallow podzolized soil. The parameters used to measure biofilm build-up were: soil water retention, total phosphorus (Tot-P) content and loss on ignition (LOI). The LOI and Tot-P deposition near the filter surface were lowest in the glass filters. Soil water retention curves indicated that biofilm formation mainly occurred in the uppermost 0. 03 m depth below the filter surface and gradually decreased with depth. This indicates that measurements of volumetric water content using time domain reflectrometry probes may be used as an in situ proxy for measurements that would normally require the destructive sampling of a filter...|$|R

The HFBR has been successfully used to remove organic carbon and ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 -N) from domestic wastewater. In this treatment method, wastewater is allowed to flow over and back along a stack of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets.

Advance Water Treatment plants can also {{be referred to as}} Advanced Wastewater Purification (AWP) systems. They are most commonly found on ships that sail in Alaskan waters and sometimes work in parallel with an onboard Marine Sanitation Device. Royal Caribbean International, for example, have installed AWP systems on their ships which treat wastewater using advanced technology. Royal Caribbean AWP systems include three types of water purification systems, Scanship, Hydroxyl/Headworks and Navalis. Scanship and Hydroxyl use biological treatment while the Navalis system primarily uses advanced oxidation and filtration methods. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems use bacterial to consume the waste while also utilizing a chemical in order to break down and remove solids. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems are very similar to water treatment plants based on shore. This involves a simple five stage process. The first stage involves a prefilter where screens removes heavy and noticeable solids from the waste influent. Then the wastewater is passed through a biological reactor which uses beneficial bacteria to further break down any solids. Next the influent is pumped through a flotation unit which removes floatable waste. Afterwards, the clean water is passed through <b>polishing</b> <b>filters</b> which make the water even cleaner. The last and final stage involves an ultraviolet light reactor which disinfects the water.

Two pilot-scale vertical-flow soil filter eco-technologies, a roughing filter (RF) and a <b>polishing</b> <b>filter</b> (PF) with plants (willows), were operated independently in a single-stage configuration and coupled together in a multistage (RF √æ PF) configuration to investigate the MTBE and benzene removal performances. Both filters were loaded with groundwater from a refinery site contaminated with MTBE and benzene as the main contaminants, with a mean concentration of 2970 816 and 13, 966 1998 mg L 1, respectively.

40|$|Odour {{control systems}} in {{wastewater}} collection systems are typically designed to remove hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S); however other compounds in sewer related foul air {{also lead to}} odour complaints. Methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide are rarely investigated for performance in these treatment systems despite being key odorants. Volatile organic compounds readily occur and rarely contribute substantially to odour impact, but could affect the removal of other more odorous compounds. The most common odour control systems are biologically based (biofilters or biotrickling filters) or adsorption based (predominantly activated carbon). Samples on the inlet and outlet of 10 activated carbon systems, 5 biofilters and 3 biotrickling filters across Sydney, Melbourne and Perth in Australia were taken approximately every month for 18 months. Samples were analysed {{for a wide range}} of volatile organic and sulfurous compounds as well as H 2 S. The collected data were filtered for warm and non-warm periods, wet weather, and for those where data points were greater than three times the standard deviation over the average (known as ‚Äòspikes‚Äô). Performance of treatment systems were analysed under these conditions. An analysis of the most common volatile organic and sulfurous compounds on the inlet samples found that there was no clear relationship between any compounds, meaning that when sampling sewer foul air, all key odorants needed to be tested. All treatment system types perform well at H 2 S removal. Activated carbon systems exhibited the poorest and most variable treatment of non-H 2 S based compounds, particularly halogenated volatile organics; however treatment of most compounds improved during spike conditions. Biofilters generally showed the most stable and greatest removal of non-H 2 S based compounds; however treatment deteriorated during spike conditions. In selecting an odour treatment technology, the concentration and variability of contaminants, treatment required and the space available, allow the most efficient technology selection to be made. Two stage processes are generally required for high level treatments whilst single stages are appropriate for lower treatments. Biofilters are generally preferred as the first (or only) stage, with biotrickling filters used where space is constrained.

40|$|A nano-aluminum-oxide {{fiber of}} only 2 {{nanometers}} in diameter {{was used to}} develop a ceramic-fiber filter. The fibers are electropositive and, when formulated into a filter material (NanoCeram(TradeMark)), would attract electro-negative particles such as bacteria and viruses. The ability to detect and then remove viruses as well as bacteria is of concern in space cabins since they may be carried onboard by space crews. Moreover, an improved filter was desired that would polish the effluent from condensed moisture and wastewater, producing potable drinking water. A laboratory- size filter was developed that was capable of removing greater than 99. 9999 percent of bacteria and virus. Such a removal was achieved at flow rates hundreds of times greater than those through ultraporous membranes that remove particles by sieving. Because the pore size of the new filter was rather large as compared to ultraporous membranes, it {{was found to be}} more resistant to clogging. Additionally, a full-size cartridge is being developed that is capable of serving a full space crew. During this ongoing effort, research demonstrated that the filter media was a very efficient adsorbent for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), and endotoxins. Since the adsorption is based on the charge of the macromolecules, there is also a potential for separating proteins and other particulates {{on the basis of their}} charge differences. The separation of specific proteins is a major new thrust of biotechnology. The principal application of NanoCeram filters is based on their ability to remove viruses from water. The removal of more than 99. 9999 percent of viruses was achieved by a NanoCeram <b>polishing</b> <b>filter</b> added to the effluent of an existing filtration device. NanoCeram is commercially available in laboratory-size filter discs and in the form of a syringe filter. The unique characteristic of the filter can be demonstrated by its ability to remove particulate dyes such as Metanyl yellow.

40|$|Voltammetry {{is one of}} a few {{analytical}} methods, {{suitable for}} on-line monitoring of trace metals and is sufficiently sensitive in the low Œºg/L range for this purpose. The advantages of in-situ use of voltammetry are low cost and no or minimal sample change, since the sample is taken automatically and analysis is performed immediately without a need to collect a sample manually risking contamination and metal loss. Automatic monitoring is essential to record the natural variations of metal concentration in natural or industrial water and registration of accident due to natural or anthropogenic reasons. Remote monitoring of trace metals is of special importance due to their biological role. For that reason extensive research has been carried out internationally to develop suitable monitoring methods. The introduction of the innovative solid silver amalgam and other solid metal electrodes made the use of voltammetry suitable for remote monitoring without the use of toxic electrode materials. An automatic trace metal system (ATMS) in combination with solid silver amalgam electrode has been applied for long time monitoring of zinc and iron in waste water. The system worked automatically with manual maintenance every five days. Sample taking, addition of electrolyte solution, stirring, chemical analysis, electrode cleaning and cell draining were carried out automatically, while electrode <b>polishing,</b> <b>filter</b> changing and calibration were carried out manually every five days. For comparison, verification and to provide a better insight into the complex waste water matrix manual samples have been taken regularly and analyzed with ICP-MS. From data obtained from those two analytical methods a speciation study was performed. The automatic voltammetric system for continuous monitoring of trace metals has been applied in three different locations for monitoring of trace metals in different water samples. River water and drainage water has been used as complex natural water matrixes. A solid silver amalgam electrode {{has been used as a}} working electrode. The systems have been fully automated to measure the labile concentration of trace metals for a long time monitoring and store the collected data. Manual maintenance has been performed to calibrate the systems and to clean the working electrodes. Additionally, random samples have been collected manually and analyzed by ICP-MS for the total dissolved metal concentration for data verification and getting better insight into sample matrix. Development of the ATMS has provided an opportunity to monitor earthquake precursor in ground water. A monitoring station has been installed in Husavik, Northern Iceland, for monitoring of trace metals in a ground water. The monitored concentration of metals clearly indicated changes in the ground water prior to the earthquake. The results revealed increased electrolabile concentrations of zinc, iron and copper 7 - 8 days before the earthquake. The increased concentrations lasted until the occurrence of the earthquake and were possible to monitor by the ATMS. The characterization and application of a Nafion coated solid silver amalgam electrode has been tested for the determination of trace metals by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). Effect of model surfactants, commonly presented in natural water sources has also been investigated. It has been found that Nafion coated electrode is useful in surfactant containing samples. The performance of the Nafion coated silver amalgam electrode has been investigated and compared to uncoated silver amalgam electrodes. The modification of the electrode yields higher sensitivity. Moreover, the long time use of Nafion film and practical application has been tested by the use of DPASV in polluted river water sample and has shown to work optimal for 2 weeks. New electrodes made of silver germanium and silver antimony have been tested and found to be suitable for determination of metals by DPASV with very good linearity. This type of electrodes extends potential window to both positive and negative direction. Additionally, very good sensitivity for cadmium has been observed. The practical application has been tested for applying the electrodes in monitoring station to monitor zinc concentration in polluted river water. Moreover, Nafion coating has been applied and has been found to be advantageous considering electrode stability. The aim of this work has been to test silver amalgam and other solid metal electrodes for application in natural and environmental water samples for use in long time online monitoring in field. The papers included in this thesis prove successful applications of these electrodes in different environmental matrixes. The results provide positive evidence about the ability of voltammetry in combination with solid metal electrodes (bare and modified with Nafion) as a working electrodes to be employed in automatic monitoring of trace metals in polluted water with minimal sample pretreatment and minimal maintenance of the system. The use of solid metal electrodes avoids the use of liquid mercury in voltammetric analyses, and offers an environmental friendly alternative suitable for use in field. Due to ease to use, nontoxic fabrication materials, wide cathodic potential window, long time stability, and good sensitivity these electrodes can be applied for continuous online monitoring in various environmental and industrial solutions. They are also easy to modify and this extends the application even further. Several experimental projects at different locations and in different water samples (river-, sea-, ground-, drainage- and waste water) have shown sufficiently long time stability without the need for physical presence for maintenance. These results strongly indicate that further developed and improved method may in future be used as a commercial warning system for environmental pollution accidents.

Materials and Methods : Using a 60 CO gamma radiation machine with emission rate of 405. 38 CGy/min, water and wastewater samples were irradiated at doses of 20 - 160 Gy and 80 - 240 Gy, respectively. Microbial cultures were performed on the samples to assess the pre- and post-irradiation coliforms content. Results : The results of microbial tests showed that approximately 100 % of the total and fecal coliforms in water samples were inactive at 160 Gy dose of gamma radiation. At a dose of 240 Gy, gamma-ray efficiency for inactivation of the total coliforms in the effluent was different, considering the sample quality. The efficiency for secondary effluent, <b>polished,</b> and <b>filtered</b> samples was 56, 83, and 64 %, respectively. In this case, reduction of fecal coliforms was 46, 58, and 81 %, respectively. The effective reduction of the coliforms in the effluent samples (80 - 50 %) was also observed at doses of 120 - 240 Gy. According to the dose-response curves, as the radiation dose increases, the inactivation of the coliforms increases linearly. Conclusion: At gamma doses used in this study, the coliforms were removed completely. But for wastewater samples, although the removal efficiencies were above 80 %, the environmental standards related to microbial parameters were not satisfied. Therefore, it is necessary to use higher doses of gamma radiation...|$|R

The research reveals how the <b>Polish</b> cultural <b>filter</b> affected the image of Swedish reality in the translations. The analysis took into account the transfer of both verbal and visual aspects of the cultural elements. A smooth transfer was achieved in the following sphere: changes in the linguistic code between interlocutors from different social strata; {{the way in which}} people from the privileged classes were addressed; the transfer of the verbal folklore of children. The folklore of Swedish and Polish children was shown to be more or less congruent, which may indicate the existence of a universal, transnational children‚Äôs code. The reconstruction of intertextual references was achieved in relation to the Bible. References to world literature succeeded in crossing the cultural border only partially. The complexity of the cultural code of the original led to an exoticization of the translated text.

40|$|Norway has {{endorsed}} strict regulations regarding wastewater discharge also in rural areas. In areas defined as vulnerable i. e. most inland area the phosphorus (P) discharge limit is 1 mg P/l or 90 % removal. Both package treatment plants and nature based systems (constructed wetlands, soil infiltration) are used. Constructed wetlands or filterbed system (wetlands without macrophytes) have excellent purification performance, but require {{a large area}} according to current guidelines resulting in large investment costs. When using the phosphorus sorbing material Filtralite P, leaching of calcium in the early stage of the system may clog outlet pipes or form a white layer of CaCO 3 at the discharge point. The lost calcium may also reduce the longevity of the systems P-removal. At H√∏y√•s farm in √Ös municipality a compact filter bed system with post <b>polishing</b> sand <b>filter</b> to trap the leaching calcium has been built. A compact Pfilter combined with a polishing sandfilter has not been tested in Norway before. Two different Psorbing materials Filtramar and Filtralite P are tested and compared in the two 4 m 3 P-filter units of the system. to find the maximum phosphorus retention capacity {{in order to increase}} the life time and to reduce the investment cost. Samples were collected during the first month of system operation in October 2012. Samples were taken at an interval of around two weeks. Samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity BOD 5 (mg/l), COD (mg/l), total phosphorus (mg/l) and orthophosphate (mg/l). In addition a batch experiment has been conducted to find the phosphorus sorption capacity of Filtralite P and Filtramar. The Batch experiment results showed that the sorption isotherms of Filtralite P and Filtramar had different behaviors at high initial concentrations (50 - 480 ppm) and at low initial P concentrations (0 - 50 ppm). With an initial concentration of 480 ppm, Filtramar (shellsand) had a P sorption capacity of 8. 22 g P/kg, while Filtralite P was found to have a P sorption capacity of 1. 23 g P/kg. At low initial concentrations comparable to real wastewater concentrations Filtramar (shellsand) had a P sorption capacity of 149 mg P/kg, while Filtralite P was found to have a P sorption capacity of 476 mg P/kg. Thus at lower initial concentrations of phosphorus, Filtralite P had higher P-sorption capacity than Filtramar did. The use of Langmuir equation to calculate the maximum sorption capacity and the saturation points of the filter materials showed that Filtramar had life time (26. 2 years) ten times more than service life of Filtralite P (2. 45 years). However it is not wise to determine replacement time of filter materials based on batch experiments results only. Batch experiments can only be used to compare and rank filter materials according to their phosphorus retention capacity and not for estimation of their life time. The overall removal of the H√∏y√•s treatment system in its first three months of operation was 90 % BOD 5 removal, 76 % COD removal, 98 % total phosphorus removal and 99 % orthophosphate removal. The results meet or exceed current discharge limits for the recipient with eutrophication risk and user interests. Insulation of bio-filter and sand filter by tree bark is a good solution to protect from frost but it leaches organic substances and produces color in wastewater and that may increase COD in the effluents and also block P-sorption sites of the filter media. The bark should be replaced...|$|R
40|$|Biogas {{produced}} by anaerobic digestion {{is often used}} in gas turbines to produceelectricity. In order to increase {{the value of the}} gas and to enable utilization of the gas in other applications, it may be advantageous to upgrade the biogas. In this way, the carbon dioxide as well as various impurities are removed and biomethane is produced. Biomethane is similar to natural gas and can be used in similar applications, e. g. fed into the natural gas grid, or as vehicle fuel. Several different biogas upgrading techniques are on the market today. Some of themmake use of the fact that carbon dioxide and methane have different solubility indifferent solvents. By choosing a solvent which has a high solubility for carbon dioxide but lets methane pass through unchanged, the carbon dioxide can be separated from the methane in biogas efficiently. Common solvents used for biogas upgrading are water, amines as well as organic solvents such as Genosorb¬Æ. The difference in adsorption behavior of carbon dioxide and methane on a surface at different pressures is used in pressure swing adsorption (PSA), which can be used to effectively separate carbon dioxide from methane. Another common biogas upgrading technique uses the fact that carbon dioxide is more likely to pass through a semi permeable barrier, e. g. a membrane, than methane. By letting biogas pass through such a membrane, the carbon dioxide can thus be removed from the gas, leaving concentrated methane in the product stream. Finally, the difference in boiling point between methane and carbondioxide may be used to separate the gases in cryogenic distillation. For this report, data on the specific investment cost was collected from companies supplying biogas upgrading plants using the above described processes. The data shows a span of investment costs, but it also shows that there is no significant general difference in investment cost between the different techniques when considering a given standard project. Also the energy consumption is rather similar for the different upgrading techniques. When deciding on a suitable biogas upgrading process, it is therefore important to rather consider other aspects. These may include the ability of the different processes to handle specific impurities present in the actual project orspecific requirements in product gas quality. Also the need for consumables such as anti-foam, chemicals for pH regulation as well as operational costs for any needed pretreatment differs between biogas upgrading processes but is of course also dependent on the pretreatment needed in a project. It {{is important to remember that}} the conclusion regarding specific investment cost in this report is related to a standard case. In a real project, where more or less pre- and posttreatment will be needed depending on the choice of upgrading technique, the investment cost for different biogas upgrading techniques will most likely differ. Biogas produced from various substrates such as agricultural residues, biological waste or sewage sludge contains low concentrations of unwanted substances, e. g. impurities, such as H 2 S, siloxanes, ammonia, oxygen and volatile organic carbons (VOC). H 2 S is separated from the methane in most biogas upgrading techniques. How efficient this removal is and thus whether it is enough to meet product gas requirements differs between the different techniques. Scrubbers using absorption in water, amines or organic solvent usually remove most of the H 2 S, while <b>polishing</b> <b>filters</b> are needed for membrane upgrading and PSA. When separated from the methane gas, H 2 S, however, ends up in a CO 2 rich side stream such as stripper air where it usually needs to beremoved due to environmental legislation. If the CO 2 stream is utilized, the necessity to remove H 2 S depends on what the gas is used for. H 2 S thus needs to be removed from the gas at some point in most cases, but depending on the biogas upgrading technique used, this may need to be done in the raw biogas or there may be a choice regarding where in the process to remove H 2 S. Siloxanes may be harmful to process equipment when present at too high concentrations. In scrubber systems the produced biomethane usually needs further drying and the main part of siloxanes are removed in the dryers. Ammonia is soluble in water and the concentrations commonly found in biogas are usually removed in the condensation which is usually part of a biogas upgrading system in order to protect the upgrading system from liquid water. Ammonia is not usually a problem in biogas upgrading systems. However, when H 2 S and ammonia arepresent simultaneously, it is important to prevent precipitation of compounds formed when these two react with each other. Since anaerobic digestion occurs under anaerobic conditions, e. g. with no oxygen present, the concentration of oxygen in biogas is usually low. Improper adjustment of oxygen injection systems used in order to biologically remove larger concentrations of H 2 S may increase the oxygen levels of the raw biogas. However, the oxygen concentration is commonly monitored carefully in biogas systems in order to minimize the explosion risk. Biomethane quality requirements when the gas is fed into a natural gas grid are currently limiting the oxygen content in biomethane to almost zero, especially in gas grids which include gas storage systems. It may therefore be necessary to remove oxygen from the product gas, or raw biogas if preferred, if the oxygen present in the raw biogas is passed to the produced biomethane. This is valid for scrubber techniques except membrane and PSAsystems which remove a significant amount of the oxygen. The product gas leaving the plant must uphold certain gas quality criteria, either set as a bilateral agreement with the transporter and/or buyer of the biomethane, which currently are based on national specifications. A new CEN standard on biogas injection of H gas quality has recently been sent to formal vote, regulating levels of minor impurities such as siloxanes and ammonia, and major ones such as hydrogen and oxygen. The minimum calorific content is specified, but the wobbe index is not. Allowed sulfur levels are still relatively high, and not including the contribution of odorization, which is still an issue handled nationally in Europe. Biomethane and compressed natural gas (CNG) delivered at the point of retail is also under standardization. There are efforts to introduce a second dedicated non-grid based grade, which will be beneficial to the sales of biomethane, since most of the parameters will easily be upheld by normal upgrading, with the exception of raw biogas containing larger amounts of siloxanes. In biogas upgrading with membrane separation, amine scrubbers and PSA, very pureCO 2 can be produced. In biogas upgrading using these techniques, besides biomethane, CO 2 can be produced and utilized. The most common ways to use CO 2 are for the use in greenhouses, in the food and cooling industry or to utilize access electricity to let the CO 2 react with H 2 to produce methane, co-called power-to-gas. Power to gas constitutes a way to store access electricity in the form of gas which is gaining increased interest during recent years...|$|R
