25|$|In {{people who}} have {{undergone}} gallbladder removal, the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and flatulence. Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when {{there is evidence of}} perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and use of a skin <b>protectant.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Drying {{seeds and}} {{limiting}} {{the amount of}} moisture that accumulates on seeds and plants is shown to control {{the development of the}} protist from infected seeds and young plants. The preemptive use of systemic <b>protectant</b> fungicides prevents the progression of P. philippinensis. [...] Less sprayings in the dry season has proven to be more effective than more sprayings in the wet season. [...] Also, combining mineral oil with fungicide reduces yield loss while still being cost effective.|$|E

[...] Edge connectors, placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then gold-plated. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.|$|E
2500|$|In 1854, James Ambrose Cutting and his partner, Isaac A. Rehn, {{took out}} three patents that were [...] "improvements" [...] in the wet-plate {{collodion}} process. Cutting developed {{a method for}} adhering the two pieces of glass together using Canada balsam. Though meant {{as a way to}} hermetically seal the ambrotypes as a preservation method, the process was ultimately unnecessary as the varnish layer itself worked extremely well as a <b>protectant.</b> In fact, ambrotypes that utilized Cutting's patent are known to exhibit deterioration caused by the technique. Numerous high-profile lawsuits (E. Anthony, J. Gurney, C.D. Fredericks, J. Bogardus) and disputes surrounding the patents may have had an intimidating effect, and discouraged a wider use of [...] "instantaneous" [...] (stop action) photography during the Civil War. Cutting's patented formula featured the chemical component, bromide of potassium, which greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the collodion. When the patent extensions came up for renewal in 1868, the Patent Office decided that the original patents should not have been issued, and the extension was denied. The decision was partly based on evidence found in Henry Snelling's book, [...] "The History and Practice of Photography." [...] Snelling in 1853 had described the use of the same key ingredients found in Cutting's high-speed, emulsion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Effect on life {{process of}} S. oryzae was {{observed}} in grains treated with various grain <b>protectants.</b> All grain <b>protectants</b> {{were found to be}} significantly superior in affecting the life process of the pest over untreated check, the oil of A. indica (18. 00 eggs) was found to be most effective in reducing the number of egg laid by weevil which was followed by A. indica powder, M. azedarach and M. dioica being 21. 00, 24. 67 and 31. 00 eggs, respectively. The incubation period was non significant in different grain <b>protectants</b> which varied from 6. 48 to 8. 95 days. However, it was 6. 48 days in M. azedarach signify the minimum larval period was in the treatment C. nucifera (19. 30 days), significantly highest larval period (26. 50 days) was recorded on grains treated with A. indica powder. There was no significant variation in pupal period of the pest and it ranged from 12. 54 to 13. 94 days in different treatments. The F 1 population of the pest ranged from 3. 33 to 31. 00 adults in different grain <b>protectants,</b> while it was 76. 33 adults in untreated check.

5000|$|After {{the main}} {{friction}} zone, some car washes have a dedicated care zone. Prior to entering the care zone, {{the car is}} rinsed with fresh water. This is immediately followed {{by a series of}} extra services. In many car washes, the first of these services is a polish wax. Polish waxes fill in microscopic imperfections in the vehicle's clear coat, thus improving shine. After the polish wax application is typically a retractable mitter or top brush and, in some cases, side brushes or wrap-around brushes. Next is a <b>protectant,</b> which creates a thin protective film over a vehicle's surface. Protectants generally repel water, which assists in drying the car and aiding in the driver's ability to see through their windshield during rain. A low-end wax or clear coat <b>protectant</b> follows the main <b>protectant.</b> A drying agent is typically applied {{at the end of the}} tunnel to assist in removing water from the vehicle's surface prior to forced air drying.
