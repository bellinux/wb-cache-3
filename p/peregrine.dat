5|$|By 1975, <b>peregrine</b> falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, {{primarily}} as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train <b>peregrine</b> falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the <b>peregrine</b> falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> falcon is the {{national}} animal of the United Arab Emirates. Since 1927, the <b>peregrine</b> falcon has been the official mascot of Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. The 2007 U.S. Idaho state quarter features a <b>peregrine</b> falcon. The <b>peregrine</b> falcon has been designated the official city bird of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the <b>peregrine</b> proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the <b>peregrine,</b> but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the <b>peregrine,</b> and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed {{at different times of}} year than neighboring <b>peregrine</b> falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E

5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for My Flight in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} <b>peregrine</b> falcon population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of <b>peregrine</b> falcons inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no <b>peregrine</b> falcons were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, <b>peregrine</b> falcon populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings for My Flight take place, only 324 pairs of <b>peregrine</b> falcons were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the Rocky Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|E

5|$|Some {{controversy}} has existed over {{the origins of}} captive breeding stock used by The <b>Peregrine</b> Fund in the recovery of <b>peregrine</b> falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several <b>peregrine</b> subspecies {{were included in the}} breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum (Falco peregrinus anatum), the near extirpation of the anatum in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.|$|E
50|$|The {{lesson of}} <b>Peregrine’s</b> {{life is not}} that God worked a miracle, but that a {{faithful}} servant placed himself, unconditionally, {{in the hands of}} God. <b>Peregrine’s</b> trust in God therefore serves as a model for those dealing with sickness.|$|R

5|$|The {{life span}} of <b>peregrine</b> falcons in the wild is up to 15.5years. Mortality {{in the first year}} is 59–70%, declining to 25–32% {{annually}} in adults. Apart from such anthropogenic threats as collision with human-made objects, the <b>peregrine</b> may be killed by larger hawks and owls.|$|E
5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> falcon {{became an}} {{endangered}} species primarily due {{to the use of}} organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female <b>peregrine</b> falcons and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since <b>peregrine</b> falcons lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells break under the stress of both the rocky ledge and the weight of the parents during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> falcon population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the <b>peregrine</b> falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> falcon is host to a {{range of}} parasites and pathogens. It is a vector for Avipoxvirus, Newcastle disease virus, Falconid {{herpesvirus}} 1 (and possibly other Herpesviridae), and some mycoses and bacterial infections. Endoparasites include Plasmodium relictum (usually not causing malaria in the <b>peregrine</b> falcon), Strigeidae trematodes, Serratospiculum amaculata (nematode), and tapeworms. Known <b>peregrine</b> falcon ectoparasites are chewing lice, Ceratophyllus garei (a flea), and Hippoboscidae flies (Icosta nigra, Ornithoctona erythrocephala).|$|E

5|$|During the <b>peregrine</b> falcon decline, Houle studied {{biology at}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The institution's block {{scheduling}} system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, {{allowing her to}} travel frequently to experience various ecosystems {{in addition to her}} academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe <b>peregrine</b> falcon activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the <b>peregrine</b> falcons, Houle had to decide whether to continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for My Flight combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with the community at Chimney Rock during her first summer there.|$|E

5|$|<b>Peregrine</b> falcons {{have been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release back into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. <b>Peregrine</b> falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The <b>Peregrine</b> Fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.|$|E
