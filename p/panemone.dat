50|$|A <b>panemone</b> {{windmill}} {{is a type}} {{of vertical}} axis wind turbine. It has a rotating axis positioned vertically, while the wind-catching blades move parallel to the wind. By contrast, the shaft of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) points into the wind while its blades move at right-angles to the wind's thrust. That is, a <b>panemone</b> primarily uses drag whereas the blades of a HAWT use lift.|$|E
50|$|The <b>panemone</b> {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{efficient}} types of wind turbine. Despite this {{it is also one of}} the most commonly re-invented and patented forms.|$|E
50|$|The vanes of a <b>panemone</b> {{are moved}} by the wind in a circle to turn the drive shaft. To {{accomplish}} this they must move with the wind only while {{on one side of}} the circle, and move against the wind on the other side. To prevent the vanes moving upwind from being blown back by the wind, one half of the <b>panemone</b> may be shielded, or else the vanes may be attached so that they can turn edge-on to the wind when the wheel is moving them upwind.|$|E

50|$|Wind-harnessing devices which rely on drag {{reach their}} maximum {{efficiency}} if the collector is {{pushed away from}} the wind. Because the wind panels do no work while returning to the upwind side of the device, the rotor in the Persian <b>panemone</b> design can only take energy from wind striking half the collection area (see diagram).|$|E
50|$|Historically the {{earliest}} known wind machine {{was made by the}} Persians and it was the <b>panemone</b> design, consisting of a wall, with slits, surrounding a vertical axle containing four to eight fabric sails. As the wind blew, the sails would turn the axle, which was in turn connected to grain grinders or some form of water transportation device (though little is known of the actual details of such methods).|$|E
50|$|No {{one knows}} when people first built {{windmills}} to do work. The first instance {{may have been}} in China more than 2,000 years ago, but archaeologists have found no definite record of their use there before 1219 AD. The earliest recorded windmill design found was Persian in origin, and was invented around 500 - 900 AD. Other sources date it to as early as 200 to 250 B.C.. This design was the <b>panemone,</b> with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft. It was first built to pump water, and subsequently modified to grind grain as well.|$|E
