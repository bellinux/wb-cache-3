40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) {{were studied}} in three apple orchard plots in the Hudson Valley of New York during June and July 1980. Selected voles from each plot were given {{miniature}} radiotransmitters and then tracked before, during, and after rotary mowing. A total of 11 <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> and 6 meadow voles were tracked. Home range size was much larger for meadow <b>voles</b> than <b>pine</b> <b>voles.</b> During mowing, meadow voles were noticeably {{affected by the}} mower; <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> were not. No change occurred in the area utilized before and after mowing for either species, nor did any significant mortality result from the treatment. Voles of both species showed a slight but significant tendency to remain closer to the tree rows after mowing. We conclude that rotary mowing has a negligible effect on vole movement and survival under the conditions of this study...|$|R
40|$|Free-ranging <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) and meadow voles (M. pennsylvanicus) were radio-tracked in a {{maintained}} apple orchard {{environment in}} August and December 1980. Meadow voles maintained larger home ranges than <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in the summer, but had similar-sized ranges in December. The home ranges for both species decreased {{with the onset}} of winter. <b>Pine</b> and meadow <b>voles</b> showed a strong tendency to remain within rows and to restrict most of their movement to areas beneath the canopy. Despite some overlap in space use between the species, the movements of both vole species suggested mutual avoidance.

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>voles</b> and meadow voles {{exhibited}} differential {{preferences for}} various Malus clones. When damage to dormant stems in a 24 -hr test {{was assessed by}} either a graded damage scale or percentage consumption by weight, <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> preferred Golden Delicious, M. 9, and M. 26 and consistently avoided M. x sublobata PI 286613 (2 ̆ 26132 ̆ 2) and related clones and Robusta 5. Dehydrating stems magnified the disparity among cultivars, as attractive stems continued to suffer extensive damage, while 613 became even less palatable. In the autumn phase all varieties showed increased acceptance. Meadow <b>voles,</b> like <b>pine</b> <b>voles,</b> exhibited differential acceptance of cultivars, but their preferences differed somewhat from <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in that they extensively damaged Robusta 5. When bark and pulp portions of rootstocks were separately presented to <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in 1 hr tests, weight consumed followed expected varietal preferences. With dormant stocks, significantly more bark was consumed than pulp in both 613 and Golden Delicious samples, and, in both fractions Golden Delicious was consumed more than 613. In autumn-cut stocks Golden Delicious was preferred to three other varieties overall, as was its pulp fraction. Humans readily detected textural contrasts among rootstocks, some {{of which can be}} measured during the dormant phase as lower densities and higher water content for the extremely preferred rootstocks. Humans also reported taste differences among cultivars, describing rootstocks and fragments as bitter more often for Golden Delicious and 613 than for Robusta 5 and M. 9. Taken together, these rootstock data suggest that stem texture may be a primary factor for rootstock acceptability. Taste probably also plays a role in rootstock preferences. Pine dowels soaked in fruit extract, sucrose, or quinine solutions or water or oil and individually presented to paired <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> for 24 hr tests were gnawed differentially with enhanced gnawing for oil and extract-treated dowels, and less gnawing of quinine-treated dowels...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{biochemical}} and hematologic {{values are}} important parameters for assessing animal health and experimental results. Although normal reference values for many rodent {{species have been}} published, there is a dearth of similar information for the genus Microtus. In addition, most studies use a {{mean and standard deviation}} to establish reference intervals, but doing so is not the recommendation of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards) or the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish normal reference parameters for plasma biochemistry and hematology in mature <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) by using the nonparametric rank percentile method as recommended by the 2 laboratory medicine organizations mentioned. Samples of cardiac blood from a closed colony of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> were collected at euthanasia and evaluated under rodent settings on 2 automated hematology analyzers from 2 different manufacturers and on the same type of automated biochemistry analyzer. There were no sex-associated clinically significant differences between the sexes; younger animals had a lower hematocrit, higher mean corpuscular volume, and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration than did older animals. Only platelet counts differed when comparing hematologic values from different analyzers. Relative to rats and mice, <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> have a lower mean corpuscular volume and higher red blood cell count, higher blood urea nitrogen, much higher alanine aminotransferase, and lower glucose and phosphorous concentrations. Hematology and plasma biochemical results obtained in this study are considered representative for healthy adult laboratory <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> under similar environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Several {{behaviors}} of <b>pine</b> and meadow <b>voles</b> were studied, specifically those affecting {{the role of}} taste in ingestion. These behaviors include: 1) caching, 2) gnawing, 3) grooming, and 4) taste aversions. Male <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> cached more than females, particularly when housed with females. Solitary females more than those housed in mixed sex pairs. When presented with peanuts and pine dowels in one-hour tests, <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> cached peanuts first; the addition of flavorants {{did not affect the}} sequence in which they were cached. In six-hour tests, however, sucrose— and oil-soaked items were cached first. Gnawing by <b>pine</b> <b>voles,</b> like caching, was enhanced by the addition of oil and fruit extract to dowels and rootstocks. However, flavoring dowels with bark homogenates did not alter the extent of gnawing. Durations of auto- and mixed-sex pairs of voles after one vole had been unilaterally-coated with a gel. Consistently, soiled voles groomed more than did clean voles, licking the soiled side of their fur more than the clean side. The clean vole groomed the soiled partner more than himself, suggesting that soiled fur is a powerful stimulus for both auto- and hetero-grooming. Adding tastants to the gel before applying it to the fur did not alter grooming durations in either species. A taste aversion to saccharin was induced in <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> and meadow voles via drinking water. When voles were later coated unilaterally with a saccharin- flavored gel, grooming duration was unaffected by the taste aversion treatment. Attempts to induce a taste aversion via grooming a saccharin- flavored gel from the fur did not succeed. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that various non-feeding behaviors can result in ingestion of a material, however, that vole responses to tastants vary with different behavioral contexts. Grooming behavior might be exploited as a means of delivering toxicants to the fur for the control of vole populations...|$|R
40|$|Light is an {{environmental}} variable which has considerable effect on small mammal activity patterns. This constantly repeating 24 hour signal {{provides information on}} a daily basis and has been shown to synchronize all physiological patterns in an animals existence. Laboratory studies have shown that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> are slightly nocturnal (Pearson, 1947) or confined their activity to the hours of twilight and darkness (Werner, 1951). Both authors indicate that activity occurs in bouts of about 1 hour duration followed by an hour of rest. Benton (1955) observed from trapping that more activity occurred at night but cautioned that due to the fossorial habit of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> activity could occur below ground during the day and bias the data. Continuous trapping data from both above and below ground sources indicate that there is activity both above and below ground at night but only below during the day. Activity is restricted to the burrow system. Gettle (1975) radiotelemeted <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> and found that during any 15 minute period of the day (24 hour period), 50 % of the experimental animals were moving actively.
