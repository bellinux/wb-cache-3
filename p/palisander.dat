50|$|Some {{rosewood}} {{comes from}} Dalbergia retusa, {{also known as}} the Nicaraguan rosewood or as <b>palisander,</b> which is controlled by CITES under Appendix 2 which allows some commercial activity. Several species are known as Guatemalan rosewood or Panama rosewood: D. tucerencis, D. tucarensis, and D. cubiquitzensis. Honduran rosewood:D. stevensonii, also on CITES Appendix 2, is used for marimba keys, guitar parts, clarinets and other musical and ornamental applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} the vanilla cultivation in the Sava Region encouraged {{the reconstruction of the}} road that connects the towns, called the Route de la vanille (The Vanilla Route) {{in the second half of}} 2005. However, due to the volatile fluctuations in the price of vanilla, in turn often caused by the dramatic cyclones occurring the southwestern Indian Ocean, many poor vanilla farmers in the Sava Region have periodically been forced to resort to the mostly illegal logging of ebony, <b>palisander,</b> and rosewood.|$|E
50|$|The {{pre-eminent}} rosewood appreciated in {{the western}} world is D. nigra known as Rio, Bahia, Brazilian Rosewood, <b>Palisander</b> de Rio Grande, or Jacarandá; heavily exploited in the past, it is now listed on CITES Appendix I. The second most desired rosewood {{in the western}} world is D. latifolia known as (East) Indian Rosewood or Sonokeling. Most rosewoods are a rich brown with a good figure. Note that {{only a small number of}} Dalbergia species yield rosewood. Several East Asian species are important materials in traditional Chinese furniture.|$|E
50|$|Dalbergia retusa (Caviuna, Cocobolo, Cocobolo Prieto, Funeram, Granadillo, Jacarandáholz, Nambar, ñamba, Nicaraguan Rosewood, <b>Palisander,</b> Palissandro, Palo Negro, Pau Preto, Rosewood, Urauna) is a {{plant species}} in the genus Dalbergia. It is known to produce the wood called cocobolo. It is a fair-sized tree, {{reported}} to reach 20-25 m in height. This is probably the species contributing most of the wood in the trade. Because of the wood's great beauty and high value, the trees yielding this wood have been heavily exploited and are now rare outside national parks, reserves, and plantations.|$|E
50|$|Variations {{may include}} a {{separate}} glued-on neck, a two-piece top plate of contrasting woods, old-style friction tuning pegs in <b>palisander</b> or ebony, guitar-style box construction, {{or even a}} hollowed-out neck. The size, shape, and number of soundholes is highly variable and may be a single round or oval hole, dual crescents, or even multiple holes of varying arrangement. Another variant is a neck with two holes bored 3/4 of the way through, parallel to the fretboard {{and close to the}} headstock (an innovation said to color the instrument's tone).|$|E
50|$|Henningsen {{was both}} the {{proprietor}} of a furniture-making workshop {{with a team of}} cabinetmakers in central Copenhagen as well as the designer of his own products. An active member of the Cabinetmakers Guild from 1927, he was admired by his peers for the high quality of his craftsmanship. Many of his pieces were crafted in exotic woods such as <b>palisander</b> and mahogany. All his furniture is handmade in line with traditional, labour-intensive methods from the 19th century. His pieces are noted for their elegance, above all for the soft curves in the arms of his chairs and sofas, demonstrating his traditional approach aiming to combine style and comfort.|$|E
50|$|Wilhelm Carpelan {{changed hands}} again on 30 April 1982, {{when she was}} {{purchased}} by animator Antti Peränne from Espoo. The interior of the vessel was then rebuilt and the cabin walls were panelled with <b>palisander</b> acquired from the Swedish steamship Achilleus that was being broken up in Hamina. She was also fitted with a hydraulic tilting mast in order to fit under the bridges of Länsiväylä. After rebuilding, she was registered as a pleasure boat and included in the classic ship registry of the Finnish National Board of Antiquities in 1995. Peränne took great care of his historic vessel, for which he received a grant of 7,000 euro from the Finnish National Board of Antiquities in 2011, {{until his death in}} 2012.|$|E
50|$|Anders Juhaninpoika Nevalainen, Russian gold- and silversmith, Fabergé workmaster of Finnish origin. Born in Pielisjärvi, Finland in 1858. Apprentice in Finland and in St. Petersburg in 1874, goldworker in 1875, master {{goldsmith}} in 1885. In 1884 married Maria Karolina Liljerot. One {{of their}} five children was Avrid, {{who was a}} clockmaster. As master first working in the jewelry atelier of August Holmström, and soon became as head of workshop under exclusive contract with Fabergé. His workshop made silver-mounted frames in birchwood, <b>palisander</b> or lacquer, silver- and gold cigarette-cases, enameled silver-gilt cases with leather sleeves, several small silver-gilt objects. His initials A.N, mostly used with K.Fabergé mark without the double-headed eagle Imperial Warrant. The family returned to Finland after the Russian Revolution in 1917. Died in Terijoki in 1933.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{makers of}} oboes d'amore include Howarth of London ({{instruments}} in African Blackwood or Cocobolo wood), F. Lorée in Paris (instruments in African Blackwood or Violetwood) and others such as French makers Rigoutat, Fossati and Marigaux, Italian maker Bulgheroni (who offer instruments in Grenadilla, Violetwood, Cocobolo, Rosewood, <b>Palisander,</b> and Cocus wood), Japanese maker Joseph and German makers Püchner, Mönnig and Ludwig Franck. New instruments cost approximately £8,250 at 2016 prices (roughly $11,885 US), {{comparable to the}} cost of a new cor anglais. This cost, coupled with the limited call for the instrument, leads many oboists not to possess their own , but to rent one when their work dictates the need. For the same reason, however, second-hand oboes d'amore surface from time to time with very little wear (and yet with very little reduction in price over a new instrument).|$|E
5000|$|Charles and Ray Eames {{aimed to}} develop {{furniture}} that could be mass-produced and affordable, {{with the exception of}} the Eames Lounge Chair. This luxury item was inspired by the traditional English Club Chair. The Eames Lounge Chair is an icon of Modern style design, although when it was first made, Ray Eames remarked in a letter to Charles that the chair looked [...] "comfortable and un-designy". Charles's vision was for a chair with [...] "the warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman's mitt." [...] The chair is composed of three curved plywood shells: the headrest, the backrest and the seat. In early production, beginning in 1956 and running through the very early 1990s, the shells were made up of five thin layers of plywood which were covered by a veneer of Brazilian rosewood. The use of Brazilian rosewood was discontinued in the early 1990s, and current production since then consists of seven layers of plywood covered by finishing veneers of cherry, walnut, <b>Palisander</b> rosewood (a sustainably grown wood with similar grain patterns to the original Brazilian versions), and other finishes.|$|E
40|$|Kratek pregled terminologije rodu Dalbergia s posebnim poudarkom na primerljivosti angl. {{rosewood}} in nem. Rosenholz ter na zavajajočih imenih. Vrste rodu Dalbergia so namreč anatomsko podobne, vendar se razlikujejo po gostoti, barvi lesa in barvi alkoholnega akstrakta (Brazier &Franklin 1961). Obrazložena je etimologija imena <b>palisander.</b> A brief outline {{is given}} of the terminology {{of the genus}} Dalbergia. The problem is discussed with particular emphasis on the incomparability of the engl. rosewood and germ. Rosenholz {{as well as on}} the misleading names. Species of Dalbergia are similar in anatomical structure but differ in density, wood colour, and colour of the alcoholic extract (Brazier & Franklin 1961).
