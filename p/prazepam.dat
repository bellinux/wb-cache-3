5000|$|Medication is {{the main}} method of {{managing}} pain in TMD, mostly because there is little if any evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} surgical or dental interventions. Many drugs have been used to treat TMD pain, such as analgesics (pain killers), benzodiazepines (e.g. clonazepam, <b>prazepam,</b> diazepam), anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin), muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine), and others. Analgesics that have been studied in TMD include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. piroxicam, diclofenac, naproxen) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). Topical methyl salicylate and topical capsaicin have also been used. Other drugs that have been described for use in TMD include glucosamine hydrochloride/chondroitin sulphate and propranolol. Despite many randomized control trials being conducted on these commonly used medications for TMD a systematic review carried out in 2010 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support or not to support the use of these drugs in TMD. Low-doses of anti-muscarinic tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or nortriptyline have also been described. [...] In a subset of people with TMD who are not helped by either noninvasive and invasive treatments, long term use of opiate analgesics has been suggested, although these drugs carry a risk of drug dependence and other side effects.

The study was performed in double-blind and crossover conditions. Serum levels of <b>prazepam</b> and its major metabolite N-desmethyl-diazepam were measured by HPLC. No <b>prazepam</b> was detected at a concentration higher than 20 ng/ml (limit of detection) whereas N-desmethyl-diazepam reached concentrations around 140 ng/ml. To correlate this observation with the clinical data, the affinity of <b>prazepam</b> and N-desmethyl-diazepam was compared measuring their ability to displace 50 % of 3 H-flunitrazepam bound to benzodiazepine receptors contained in synaptosomal preparation obtained from rat brain.

40|$|Painful {{conditions}} are frequently accompanied by sleep disorders. Here we present the case, never previously reported, of {{high doses of}} zopiclone and <b>prazepam</b> abuse in a patient suffering from migraine and insomnia. A 37 -year-old female Caucasian patient, nursing degree, with two 7 -year-old twin daughters, began to suffer from migraines in her childhood. Migraine worsened and was associated with insomnia after the daughters’ birth. Eight months ago, migraine and insomnia further worsened {{in conjunction with the}} prescription of fluoxetine and <b>prazepam</b> as migraine prophylaxis and of zopiclone for insomnia. From that moment, the patient increased the dose of zopiclone up to 20 tablets (150 mg) nightly and <b>prazepam</b> up to 20 tablets (400 mg) daily. As acute migraine treatment she also used ketorolac 1 - 2 f every day intramuscularly. The patient was hospitalised for withdrawal of medications and to treat migraine. Hair analysis documented the history of this patient and the good progress of the treatment. Zopiclone and <b>prazepam</b> are considered drugs with low abuse potential. However, the final outcome of a drug treatment may be influenced by non-drug factors, such as the patient’s characteristics and the treatment milieu. In fact, in a stressful context, the prescription of zopiclone in a patient vulnerable for migraine triggered abuse of this drug and of <b>prazepam,</b> which was associated with chronification of migraine and analgesics overuse, without relieving insomnia. In prescribing hypnotics and anxiolytics to patients with chronic pain there must therefore be great caution...|$|E
40|$|Zopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} agent, indicated {{for short-term}} treatment of insomnia (max. 4 weeks) at the dose of 7. 5 mg/day. It has been marketed {{as a drug}} with a lower potentiality of overuse than benzodiazepines. <b>Prazepam,</b> a prodrug for desmethyldiazepam, is a benzodiazepine derivative drug indicated {{for the treatment of}} anxiety at the dose of 20 - 40 mg/day. Its abuse liability is described as lower than other benzodiazepines, because of the slow onset and long duration of action. Insomnia and anxiety are prevalent symptoms in general population, in particular among migraine patients. Here we are going to present the case of a chronic migraine patient with zopiclone and <b>prazepam</b> dependence, and analgesic overuse, whose hair was analysed to detect the use of the drugs. The drugs in her hair were detected by liquid chromatography/electrospray tamdem mass spectrometry [LC/ESI-MS/MS (Agilent technology, Palo Alto, CA, USA) ] (Matuszewski et al., 2003). Description of the case: 37 -year-old female migraine patient, Secondary School Diploma, married. Two 7 -year-old twin daughters, she runs a tobacconist shop. Smoker (15 cigarettes/day), teetotaller, she drinks 1 coffee/day. She started suffering from headache as a child. After puberty, she had perimenstrual migraines. Migraine disappeared during pregnancy, but worsened after her daughters’ birth. It has been daily and associated to severe insomnia for 3 years. In summer 2009, a psychiatrist prescribed her fluoxetine and hypnotics. The patient came to Headache Centre in January 2010. She suffered from daily headache and unbearable insomnia and every day she used at least an intramuscular injection of ketorolac (Toradol 10 mg), 20 tablets of zopiclone (Imovane 7. 5 mg), 20 tablets of <b>prazepam</b> (Prazene 20 mg). She was admitted to day hospital to be detoxified. At admission, a sample of hair was collected for drug testing. During hospitalization, <b>prazepam</b> and zopiclone were gradually reduced. In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, delorazepam (En) was administered intravenously and a prophylactic migraine treatment was started, with topiramate (Topamax) 25 mg in the evening, which was then gradually increased to 100 mg/day. At the discharge, the patient was taking 4 tablets of zopiclone and 4 of <b>prazepam</b> a day. The psychiatrist also recommended mirtazapine (Remeron) 30 mg/day. At two- month follow-up, the patient was taking every day: topiramate 100 mg (with good migraine improvement), 2 tablets of zopiclone, and 2 of <b>prazepam.</b> Another hair sample was collected. At the admission in the proximal hair segment (recent use) fluoxetine 6. 3 ng/mg, zopiclone 6. 68 ng/mg, <b>prazepam</b> 0. 67 ng/mg were detected; in the distal hair segment (previous use) fluoxetine 1. 7 ng/mg, zopiclone 3. 94 ng/mg, <b>prazepam</b> 0. 92 ng/mg were detected. At two- month follow-up, in the proximal hair segment (recent use) fluoxetine 1. 9 ng/mg, topiramate 6. 3 ng/mg, mirtazapine 1. 0 ng/mg, delorazepam 0. 14 ng/mg, <b>prazepam</b> 0. 06 ng/mg were detected and zopiclone was not detectable. Therefore hair analysis confirmed the pharmacological history of the patient. Zopiclone and <b>prazepam</b> dependence had been nearly only reported in subjects with predisposition to abuse or suffering form psychiatric disorders (Cimolai, 2007). Doses were always lower than in the case that we described. In this patient, insomnia, anxiety, and the stressing family situation were, besides from migraine, the main factors which had led to an increasing use, up to 150 mg/day of zopiclone and 400 mg/day of <b>prazepam,</b> with consequent dependence.

40|$|Diazepam and the {{structurally}} related 1, 4 -benzodiazepin- 2 -ones tetrazepam, <b>prazepam</b> and flunitrazepam are chiral molecules {{because they}} adopt a ground state conformation featuring a non-planar seven membered ring {{devoid of any}} reflection-symmetry element. The two conformational enantiomers of this class of benzodiazepines interconvert rapidly at room temperature by a simple ring flipping process. Low temperature HPLC on the Whelk-O 1 chiral stationary phase allowed us to separate the conformational enantiomers of diazepam and of the related 1, 4 -benzodiazepin- 2 -ones, under conditions where the interconversion rate is sufficiently low, compared to the chromatographic separation rate. Diazepam, tetrazepam and <b>prazepam</b> showed temperature dependent dynamic HPLC profiles with interconversion plateaus indicative of on-column enantiomer interconversion (enantiomerization) in the temperature range between − 10 °C and − 35 °C, whereas for flunitrazepam on-column interconversion was observed at temperatures between − 40 °C and − 66 °C.

30|$|Mr K, aged 48, {{was found}} {{sweating}} by his partner {{at home at}} 11.50  pm. He claimed to have attempted suicide. She immediately called the Emergency Unit to ask for support. At the phone, the physician on duty indicated her to give a pill of Lysanxia (<b>prazepam)</b> to decrease the level of stress of the victim. However, the clinical situation worsened and {{he was taken to}} the hospital at 1.00  am. At his arrival at 1.28  am he was in cardiac arrest. Despite intensive resuscitation manoeuvres, death was pronounced at 2.30  am. At home, an empty plastic bag with a 100  g caffeine label was found. The drug was bought via Internet 6  months earlier. External body examination and autopsy revealed the lack of any traumatic injury.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION:: Late {{termination}} of pregnancy combines psychological distress with severe physical pain. The present study evaluated {{the benefit of}} adding oral pregabalin to epidural analgesia during this procedure. METHODS:: Healthy women were randomly allocated to receive either oral pregabalin 150 mg/ 12 h or <b>prazepam</b> 10 mg/ 12 h at the induction of the late {{termination of}} pregnancy procedure. When they felt abdominal pain (numerical rating scale ranging from 0 [no pain] to 100 [worst pain possible]), patient-controlled epidural analgesia was activated and set to deliver ropivacaine 0. 1 % with sufentanil 0. 25 μg/ml, 5 ml/h with a bolus dose of 5 ml/ 30 min. Rescue analgesia was available as needed by administration of 10 ml ropivacaine 0. 1 % (pain score less than 60 / 100) or 0. 2 % (at least 60 / 100). The primary outcome was the consumption of epidural analgesics. RESULTS:: Forty-eight patients participated in the study. Demographic and obstetric data were similar. Pregabalin reduced total ropivacaine consumption 11. 3 ± 3. 2 mg/h (mean ± SD) versus 15. 1 ± 4. 9 mg/h in the <b>prazepam</b> group (P = 0. 005), an effect related to {{a decrease in the}} need for rescue analgesia. In the pregabalin group, fewer women asked for rescue dose (75 vs. 96 %; P = 0. 048), and the number of rescue doses per patient was reduced (1 [0 - 2] vs. 2 [1 - 3]); median [interquartile range], P = 0. 005), particularly the need for ropivacaine 0. 2 %. DISCUSSION:: This is the first study considering the use of pregabalin for labor pain associated with late termination of pregnancy, showing that pregabalin 150 mg/ 12 h is a helpful adjuvant to epidural analgesia. Modulation of both visceral sensitization and affective component of pain may contribute to the benefits observed...|$|E
