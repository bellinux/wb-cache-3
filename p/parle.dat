5|$|The rich fur areas {{along the}} upper Mississippi, Minnesota, Des Moines, and Missouri Rivers, {{otherwise}} occupied by {{peoples of the}} First Nations, were exploited by independent fur traders operating from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin {{in the late eighteenth}} century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, these traders established fur posts in the Minnesota River valley at Lake Traverse, Big Stone Lake, Lac qui <b>Parle,</b> and Traverse des Sioux. The large fur companies also built posts, including the North West Company's stations at Pembina and St. Joseph in the valley of the Red River. The paths between these posts became parts of the first of the Red River Trails.|$|E
2500|$|William de <b>Parles</b> {{himself was}} dead by 1227. In 1230 John de <b>Parles</b> claimed half the advowson of Handsworth from the priory, {{the other half}} {{remaining}} with Lenton Priory. [...] The prior remitted his claim, and in return John gave the priory a house in Birmingham. The disputes with the <b>Parles</b> family abated for thirty years. However, in 1260 William de <b>Parles</b> and eleven of his men attacked the prior, who barely escaped with his life. The miscreants did not turn up for the court hearing. It seems that violence was for William {{a way of life}} and he was subsequently hanged for his crimes. An inquisition held at Wolverhampton in April 1280 uncovered his erratic property dealings and found that he had in his later years granted to the prior of Sandwell 20s. rent annually from his mill at Hamstead.|$|R

2500|$|The priory {{was soon}} {{involved}} {{in a series of}} disputes with the <b>Parles</b> family that lasted for several decades. In 1211 William de <b>Parles</b> sued the prior for 10 acres in Sandwell and in 1212 for 10 acres in Handsworth. The precise connection of the <b>Parles</b> family with Handsworth, to the south-east of the priory, is unclear. The manor had been part of William Fitz-Ansculf's huge holdings and would have passed via the Paynels to their successors, the de Somery family, as part of the lordship of Dudley. However, not until 1242 is there clear evidence that John de <b>Parles</b> held Handsworth from Roger de Somery as an under-tenant. It is possible that Pain de <b>Parles</b> acquired a foothold at Handsworth in the 12th century through his wife, Alice, but documentation is no longer extant. William de <b>Parles</b> claimed lands in Handsworth by right of Pain and Alice. The lay advocate of the priory was now Richard, son of the founder and grandson of Guy de Offeni. The prior called upon him to vindicate the priory's claim to the land. The result of the case is unknown. William de <b>Parles</b> seems to have adhered to the [...] rebel side against King John in the First Barons' War. In 1216 his Handsworth lands were confiscated and granted to Robert de Teneray. In 1222 he gave up his claim to the Sandwell land in return for £5, given to him by the advocate, Richard. However, Richard died without issue shortly after and was succeeded by his brother, William, who survived for only two more years. In June 1224 William de <b>Parles</b> took advantage of a perceived weakness to claim half the advowson of the priory, alleging that it was he who had presented Prior Reynold during the reign of King John. William the advocate died before the case could be settled, leaving a young son, William, as heir. The case was adjourned sine die.|$|R

25|$|On 28 June 1922 the Irish Civil War (1922–1923) began. County Wexford's Civil War was {{far more}} viciously fought than its War of Independence – with many more deaths (on both sides). Again it was a guerrilla war. After {{the signing of the}} Treaty, the I.R.A. as a whole in County Wexford was divided. The North Wexford and South Wicklow Brigade of the I.R.A., led by Joseph Cummins, {{supported}} the Treaty, but the South Wexford Brigade of the I.R.A., led by Thomas O’Sullivan, opposed it. Anti-Treaty I.R.A. units in the county were organized into the Enniscorthy, Murrintown, Kyle, and New Ross Flying Columns, consisting of about 12–20 men each. Numerous attacks on the county's Railways by anti-Treaty I.R.A. units were a major feature of the War in County Wexford. A vicious circle of reprisal killings soon ensued – a sample of these are as follows. On 24 July 1922, an anti-Treaty I.R.A. unit ambushed a train near Killurin Railway Station and 3 Free State soldiers were killed. On 10 October 1922, a senior Free State army officer, Commandant Peter Doyle, of Ballinakill, Marshalstown, was shot in the grounds of St. Aidan’s Cathedral, Enniscorthy, by anti-Treaty I.R.A. On 13 March 1923, the Free State side executed 3 anti-Treaty I.R.A. prisoners held in Wexford Jail – James <b>Parle,</b> John Creane, and Patrick Hogan. In a reprisal killing, on 23 March 1923 anti-Treaty I.R.A. took 3 Free State soldiers from a Public House at Ballagh, parish of Adamstown. They were taken to the village of Adamstown where they were shot dead early next morning, on 24 March 1923. The 3 men were Parick Horan, Edward O'Gorman, and Thomas Jones. A fourth Free State soldier, John Croke, was also wounded at the Pub. There were many other killings also. Some of these were stated to be 'accidental'. A number of large houses were burnt down by anti-Treaty I.R.A. units – most notably Castleboro House (February 1923), owned by the Carews, Wilton (March 1923), owned by the Alcocks, and Ballynastragh (March 1923), owned by the Esmondes. The Free State side also imprisoned many suspects.|$|E
