In 1879, the Østfold Line (then the Smaalen Line) opened in 1879, giving these areas a regular service {{unaffected by the}} weather. In 1897, a public meeting was held regarding transport in the upper parts of Nordstand, the Ekeberg area. On 15 March 1899, Solicitor Einar Borgen, Engineer A. J. Jackwitz and Robert Iversen sent an application to build an electric railway from Oslo to Ljan. They were later supplemented with Contractor S. Sørensen. The application was considered in Aker Municipal Council on 14 March 1901, and <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>hold.</b> It was again considered a year later, {{this time it was}} <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>hold</b> because the politicians wanted to see how the new Railway Act would affect the plans.|$|E

5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee {{concluded that there was}} sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E

In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010.

Missouri departed on 13 November 1990 for the troubled waters of the Persian Gulf. She departed from Pier 6 at Long Beach, with extensive press coverage, and headed for Hawaii and the Philippines for more work-ups en route to the Persian Gulf. Along the way she made stops at Subic Bay and Pattaya Beach, Thailand, before transiting the Strait of Hormuz on 3 January 1991. During subsequent operations leading up to Operation Desert Storm, Missouri prepared to launch Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and provide naval gunfire support as required.|$|E

After the war the ship was extensively redesigned to incorporate improved boiler technology, anti-torpedo bulges, and a general increase in armor protection based on British wartime experiences. Given the hull number of CC-3, Saratoga was laid down on 25 September 1920 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link {{was passed}} by the various {{municipal}} councils in February and March 1988. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry, which connected to southern Bømlo, remain, but that the other four ferry services be terminated. During late 1989, advance tolling on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990. However, the start date was not supported by the national government and the issue <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing {{it could become a}} traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>hold</b> since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 were taken from the Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council.|$|E

5|$|When Stephen King's novella Apt Pupil was {{published}} {{as part of}} his collection Different Seasons in 1982, producer Richard Kobritz optioned feature film rights to the novella. Kobritz met with actor James Mason to play the novella's war criminal Kurt Dussander, but Mason died in July 1984 before production {{as a result of a}} heart attack. The producer also approached Richard Burton for the role, but Burton also died in August that same year. By 1987 production on the film began with Nicol Williamson cast as Kurt Dussander, and 17-year-old Rick Schroder was cast as Todd Bowden. In that year, Alan Bridges began direction of the film with a script co-written by Ken Wheat and his brother Jim Wheat. After ten weeks of filming, the production suffered from a lack of funds from its production company Granat Releasing, and the film had to be <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>hold.</b> Kubritz sought to revive production, but when the opportunity came a year later, Schroder had aged too considerably for the film to work. Forty minutes of usable footage was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|World War I caused several {{changes at}} the school. During the {{conflict}} and for some time afterwards, Georgia Tech hosted a school for cadet aviators, supply officers, and army technicians. Tech also started a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit; {{the first in the}} Southern United States, it became a permanent addition to the school. World War I affected the school academically as well: the United States government asked for and financed an automotive school for army officers, a rehabilitation program for disabled soldiers, and a geology department. Federal aid also helped to establish Tech's Industrial Education Department, courtesy of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. The war also <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>hold</b> extensive fundraising efforts for a new power plant, and made it difficult to find engineers willing to teach at the school; Matheson toured Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and MIT in 1919 but failed to secure a single hire, as none of the students wished to work for such low wages.|$|E
