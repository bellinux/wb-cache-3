5|$|Adult {{crocodilians}} {{are typically}} territorial and solitary. Individuals may defend basking spots, nesting sites, feeding areas, nurseries, and overwintering sites. Male saltwater crocodiles establish year-round territories that encompass several female nesting sites. Some species are occasionally gregarious, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> droughts, when several individuals gather at remaining water sites. Individuals of some species may share basking sites {{at certain times}} of the day.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, {{continued}} to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms.

In contrast, La Niña years are associated with lower precipitation; precipitation is below average during October–December.|$|E

Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures and various campaign settings.|$|E

5|$|After the crown, {{the most}} {{important}} government institution in the late Middle Ages was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers. Unlike its counterpart in England, the king's council in Scotland retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by parliament, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} switch of coaches, Thorpe {{indicated}} that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400m and 200m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.|$|E

5|$|Animal Sacrifice of {{a buffalo}} or goat, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> {{smallpox}} epidemics, has been practiced {{in parts of}} South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.|$|E
5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, <b>particularly</b> <b>during</b> the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E
