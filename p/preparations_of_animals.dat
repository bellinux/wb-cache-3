40|$|Appreciation of {{exhibits}} in {{a museum}} can be equated to a virtual experience of lives in the contexts originally surrounding the exhibits. Here {{we focus on the}} importance of weight information, and hence tested whether experiencing a weight during museum exhibit appreciation affects the beholders’ satisfaction and recognition memory for the exhibits. An experiment was performed at a museum exhibiting skeletal <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> We used nine preparations and prepared four weight stimuli as weight cues in accordance with the actual weight of four of the preparations: Remaining five preparations was displayed without weight stimuli. In the cued condition, participants were asked to lift up the weight stimuli during their observation of the four exhibits. In the uncued condition, participants observed the exhibits without touching the weight stimuli. After observation of the exhibits, the participants responded to a questionnaire that measured their impressions of the exhibits and the museum, and performed a recognition test on the exhibits. Results showed that memory performance was better and viewing duration was longer with weight lifting instruction than without instruction. A factor analysis on the questionnaires revealed four factors (likeability, contentment, value, and quality). A path analysis showed indirect effects of viewing duration on memory performance and willingness-to-pay for the museum appreciation through the impression factors. Our findings provide insight into a new interactive exhibition that enables long appreciation producing positive effects on visitors’ impression, memory, and value estimation for exhibits...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms of drug {{transport}} in {{the liver}} have been investigated predominantly in rodents. Most of the in vitro drug research {{in the liver}} is performed in liver <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> The results of such experiments frequently are discussed in relation to anticipated metabolic profiles in man, but these extrapolations are often inappropriate because of large interspecies differences in drug metabolism. In the present study, the mechanisms and specificity of the uptake of the organic cation rocuronium and the cardiac glycoside digoxin were investigated in human hepatocytes and were compared with results obtained in rat hepatocytes. The extraction ratio for the intact liver was calculated from the measured uptake rates of the compounds in the human cells in vitro and compared with published in vivo data. The initial hepatic extraction ratio, calculated from the in vitro uptake data for digoxin and rocuronium, very well reflected the initial extraction ratio for distribution in the liver in vivo in man. Uptake of 100 mu M rocuronium was inhibited by 40 mu M K-strophantoside (80 % inhibition), and although not significantly, by 160 mu M procainamide ethobromide, whereas no inhibitory effect {{was found in the}} presence of 160 mu M taurocholic acid. In a previous study in rat hepatocytes, marked inhibition of digoxin uptake by quinine and only minimal inhibition by the diastereomer quinidine was demonstrated, showing clear stereoselectivity in transport inhibition. Unexpectedly. the uptake of digoxin in human hepatocytes was not inhibited significantly by quinidine or quinine, which indicates clear species differences. This is the first study to investigate the uptake mechanisms of organic cations and cardiac glycosides in human hepatocytes in some detail. The results show that uptake characteristics of drugs found in rats can not be extrapolated directly to humans...|$|E
40|$|It is the {{inherent}} nature of humans to depend upon {{flora and fauna}} to find cures against various ailments. This dependence {{has given rise to}} different traditional medicinal practices throughout the world. Although plants were the prime targets for explorations for curatives, however animals were not far behind. Various body parts of the animals were used in the preparations of natural medicines. This practice has given rise to a distinct branch of medicine called zootherapy. In ancient times, zootherapists mainly depended on whole body <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> metabolic products (corporal secretions and excreta) or non-animal materials (nests and cocoons). Out of these resources, seven major materials gained prominence for drug preparations. These are honey, wax, adder, beaver testicles, musk oil, coral, and ambergris (Lev, 2003). A more detailed insight would reveal a diverse world of zootherapy. Alexiades (unpublished data) recorded the use of 50 local animals for traditional drug preparations by the Ese Eja people of Peru. Smashed ants (Pseudomyrmex sp.) are used by locals of Latin America to cure toothache. Blood obtained from black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) were used to treat epilepsy and stroke. In Sudan, honey is used in curing hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders, gastric ulcers and wound healing. Over 500 species of insects, mites and spiders are used in to treat complicated diseases in Chattisgarh (Oudhia, 1995). Recent scientific advances have enlightened the modern world about the medicinal power of zootherapy and provided a sound scientific basis of these ancient therapeutic practices that was erstwhile shrouded in an aura of mystery and superstition. The surge in research into medicines from animals has led to the recognition of 252 essential chemicals by the World Health Organization. 8. 7...|$|E

40|$|Intact and chromatically spinal {{sectioned}} minnows {{of known}} background histories; {{were exposed to}} illuminated white and black backgrounds for 2 months. A definite skin area was photographed and the melanophores lost and formed in it were recorded. Loss and formation of melanophores occurred simultaneously in intact minnows whether placed on a white or on a black background although their relative numbers were very different in the two situations and depended largely on previous background histories. After chromatic spinal section, the loss of melanophores was reduced and formation increased in minnows on a white background, whereas the reverse was observed in minnows on a black background, these results followed irrespective of difference in background histories. two conclusions are drawn from the results. Firstly, that the chromatic nerve fibres play a significant part in 'morphological' colour changes of the minnow. Secondly, that a dineuroic control is involved. It is suggested that the pigment-aggregated transmitter substance promotes loss of melanophores and limits their formation and that the pigment-dispersing transmitter promotes their formation and limits their loss. In {{the second set of}} experiments minnows were exposed on a black background for varying periods to allow melanophore formation, the ages and time of appearance of melanophores were photographically determined. The background responses of the newly formed melanophores were assessed microscopically in fixed <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> killed in at different time-intervals. The results were interpreted according to the generally accepted belief that slow and rapid colour changes indicate hormonal and nervous mediation respectively. The age of the melanophores was: found to be a significant factor in determining their background responses, the older melanophores being more responsive. It is suggested that the sensitivity to hormonal control develops first {{in the life of a}} pigment cell, to be followed later by sensitivity to nervous control, nervous control, however, does act appear simultaneously for w/B and B/w adaptations. It develops first for B/w colour change. This differential development is considered to provide evidence for double innervation of melanophores. <p...|$|E

One of the examples is a hill village named Kotyang, where maize and finger millet are grown as staple crops in terraced upland fields. The other is a village located in the suburbs of Kathmandu named Bhadrakali, where rice and wheat are cultivated alternately in paddy fields.

40|$|According to {{clinical}} observations and state-ments in textbooks, impaired hepatic function {{may result in}} a greater than normal duration or intensity of drug action. There is little evi-dence concerning the reason for this increased response. A review of Brodie et at. (1958) presents the work of several investigators showing that many drugs are metabolized by enzymes in the liver microsomes. One of the constituents of bile, deoxycholic acid, has been found to disrupt and destroy certain microsomal structures (Palade and Siekevitz, 1956). In addition, this bile acid has been shown by Gillette (J. R. Gillette, per-sonal communication) to inhibit in vitro some microsomal drug enzyme systems. Therefore, it was postulated that animals with ob-structive jaundice might have an enhanced response to a given dose of a drug. This increased response, in part, might be caused by the de-structive action of bile acids on certain liver structures and their associated drug-enzyme systems.

It deals with the problems of remote and marginalised areas, explains the use of radio stations and other media, and shows how to set up specific disease contingency plans. Special attention is warranted in case rinderpest emerges in a country that had been previously declared free of the disease and infection. For this disease in particular, FAO has published another manual (number 7) that provides information on the nature of rinderpest and on the principles and strategic options relating to the control and elimination of the disease.

Role of rural women, over of men, is more influenced with different economic, social, cultural and ecologic factors. Rural women are considered as a noticeable potential in the community either directly (crops production, livestock, handicrafts, cottage industries) or indirectly by helping the agricultural sector (as labor).

40|$|AbstractSurfactant protein C (SP-C) is an {{essential}} component for the surface tension-lowering activity of the pulmonary surfactant system.

SP-C is also {{an essential}} component <b>of</b> various surfactant <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> origin currently used to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) in preterm infants. The limited supply of this material and the risk of transmission of infectious agents and immunological reactions have prompted the development of synthetic SP-C-derived peptides or recombinant humanized SP-C for inclusion in new preparations for therapeutic use. We describe herein the recombinant production in bacterial cultures of SP-C variants containing phenylalanines instead of the palmitoylated cysteines of the native protein, as fusions to the hydrophilic nuclease A (SN) from Staphylococcus aureus. The resulting chimerae were partially purified by affinity chromatography and subsequently subjected to protease digestion. The SP-C forms were recovered from the digestion mixtures by organic extraction and further purified by size exclusion chromatography. The two recombinant SP-C variants so obtained retained more than 50 % α-helical content and showed surface activity comparable to the native protein, as measured by surface spreading of lipid/protein suspensions and from compression π–A isotherms of lipid/protein films. Compared to the protein purified from porcine lungs, the recombinant SP-C forms improved movement of phospholipid molecules into the interface (during adsorption), or out from the interfacial film (during compression), suggesting new possibilities to develop improved therapeutic preparations...|$|R
