Overlooking Nicéphore Niépces contribution in this way led Niépces son, Isidore to resent his father being ignored as having {{been the first to}} capture the image produced in a camera by chemical means, and Isidore wrote a pamphlet in defence of his fathers reputation Histoire de la decouverte improprement nommé daguerréotype(History of the discovery improperly named the daguerreotype with a note on its real inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce ...|$|E

50|$|Laminate {{flooring}} (also called floating wood tile in the United States) is a multi-layer synthetic flooring product fused {{together with}} a lamination process. Laminate flooring simulates wood (or sometimes stone) with a <b>photographic</b> applique <b>layer</b> under a clear protective layer. The inner core layer is usually composed of melamine resin and fiber board materials. There is a European Standard No. EN 13329:2000 specifying laminate floor covering requirements and testing methods.|$|R
50|$|DeFazio's {{later work}} shifted towards large <b>photographic</b> enlargements <b>layered</b> with various {{materials}} such as oil-soaked tissue, water-based paint, and fiberglass resin. Kiss in a Red Storm 1-5, consisted {{of a series of}} identical photographic prints of a man in mid-kiss with a woman. These prints are layered between deteriorated pieces of yellow, liquid absorbing paper (with poor mechanical strength characteristics) that had been soaked in oil and haphazardly littered with red paint in nondescript chaotic patterns. The translucence of the oil-soaked paper and paint layered over the photographs adds an additional layer of texture and transformation.|$|R
40|$|Gelatin {{has been}} used as a binder or {{dispersing}} agent for light-sensitive and non-light-sensitive <b>photographic</b> <b>layers.</b> The ability to keep the silver halide crystals finely dispersed and to protect the silver halide crystals and other additives from abrasion and other mechanical and chemical influences make gelatin desirable in photographic applications. However, gelatin is very sensitive to changes in humidity. Although this sensitivity to moisture is favorable when the film must be processed, it is also a drawback to the use of gelatin in an emulsion layer. The absorption of moisture can induce swelling stresses, causing dimensional instability commonly observed as bending or curling in the photographic films. ^ This dissertation focuses on the effects of moisture on the state of stress and dimensional stability of gelatin coatings. The hygroscopic effects on the thermal, mechanical, and transport properties were also investigated. Two types of polymer latices, poly(ethyl acrylate) and poly(ethyl methacrylate), were studied as additives to gelatin. The effects of latex concentration, latex particle size, drying condition at vitrification, and gelatin concentration at set point were examined as a function of relative humidity. The goal is to develop an understanding of these properties and assist in controlling or selecting conditions which will minimize the dimensional instability of photographic films over a wide range of use conditions. ^ A vibrational holographic interferometry method and a thermomechanical analyzer were adopted to measure the stresses and dimensional changes as a function of relative humidity. The incorporation of a polymer latex can reduce the moisture sensitivity, and hence increases the dimensional stability of the emulsion layer exposed to the moisture. Composite theories for an isotropic composite filled with spherical particles were applied to determine the humidity expansion coefficient and elastic moduli of the gelatin-latex films. The experimental data were in excellent agreement with the theories. The decrease in swelling stress with an addition of the polymer latex was explained by the incremental linear elasticity theory. Based on this theory, the best material (i. e., minimum swelling stress, lowest Eβ value) was found to be the gelatin film with 40 parts PEA and 15 % gelatin concentration at set point, and was dried at the LMERH condition (130 F/ 5. 5 % RH). ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the study of {{auto-ignition}} of hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures behind reflected shock waves. Because of their bearing on the problem of knock in internal combustion engines, n-heptane and iso-octane were chosen as the combustible species. Their stoichiometric mixtures with oxygen had to be diluted with 70 % argon to reduce the influence of the boundary <b>layer.</b> <b>Photographic</b> records demonstrated the existence of two different modes of ignition, as has been previously established for the hydrogen-oxygen system. The pressure-temperature limits between these regions of mild and strong ignition were determined. From the same experimental tests, induction time data were obtained over the pressure range of 1 - 4 atm and the temperature interval of 1200 - 1700 K...|$|R
40|$|From {{here you}} can see is an {{exploration}} of the experience of place through reference to a historical genre of Japanese books called meisho zue. The meisho zue functioned as guidebooks to famous places and views throughout Edo period Japan. Places were both real and imagined and the books included prints, poetry, lists, and descriptions. Utilizing the book form as a model, a group of views was identified and a series of prints was created. The views were chosen based on a collection of source material that included photographs, maps, journals, and historical records regarding specific sites associated with two emigrant trails utilized in the early 1850 ???s to cross into California. The exhibition includes large-scale, layered monoprints printed over <b>photographic</b> composites. <b>Layering</b> sheets and colors mimics the view of the work table in the studio and reveals the remnants of the working process. Displaying unbound paper recalls the activity of moving through space, of gathering information (sights, smells, vistas, sensations), one moment atop the next, used to create and identify place. The layered pages are also a direct reference to the book form which can be experienced sequentially or out of order, front to back, and as a reference. Process and display are applied to examine the construction of place through experience. CSU, Chic...|$|R
40|$|The sunspot {{spectrum}} shows many molecular lines, {{of which}} {{some have been}} identified. These lines are formed farther out in the sunspot atmosphere than the atomic lines or the continuum, and are thus useful for probing the outer <b>layers.</b> <b>Photographic</b> spectrograms were obtained for three different sunspots under carefully selected seeing conditions, showing molecular absorption lines due to MgH, CaH, and TiO. Analysis led to estimates of the effective rotational temperatures of each; {{in the case of}} CaH, no definite conclusions could be drawn. Predicted rotational temperatures and observational f-values were calculated on the basis of model umbral atmospheres due to several authors. A new model was derived from the molecular lines measured here, and shown to differ widely from previous models. The usefulness of photographic spectra for this purpose is seriously questioned, and suggestions are made for new observations...|$|R
5000|$|Ghost: Rhythms, a 2013 {{of early}} work at Kavi Gupta Gallery, shows the {{influence}} of action painting, Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. Binion pulls stylistic tropes common to folk artists as well, borrowing quilting patterns, <b>layering</b> <b>photographic</b> imagery and motifs and grids. He does all this while using one implement: his characteristic [...] "crayon," [...] or paint stick, which allowed him to move past oil paint. [...] "In 1972 when I started to use them, they were basically industrial marking sticks," [...] he recalls. Binion effectively converts an elementary tool into a refined hand-held instrument. He thrives in the effort of that conversion, having developed an ornate and labored approach that demands strenuous hours, and—as Binion has noted—resonates with the cotton-picking of his childhood. He had to train himself to be ambidextrous to negotiate hand fatigue, and works an entire surface of a painting in one sitting, before returning to rework that surface {{the next day or}} week or month. Some works take years to complete. Depending on how long he lets the paint dry, it becomes more or less malleable, responding to his hand like pigmented, sculptural putty. What results is a mash-up of pointillism.|$|R
40|$|Purchased for the Camosun College Art Collection by the Camosun College Cultural Enhancement Committee {{from the}} Fran Willis Gallery, Victoria, BC. In 1987 Ken Flett {{received}} a diploma in Photographic Arts from the Alberta College of Art. Throughout his career {{he has used}} photography in his work, often building on top of selected <b>photographic</b> images with <b>layers</b> of various media (including paint, fabric, paper, glue, and found objects such as letters or pressed flowers) to produce “bricolages” (bricolage works are constructed from various everyday materials which are easily accessible, or on-hand in the artist’s workspace). A self-described humanist, Flett chooses to work with photographs which feature people he feels a deep connection for. Flett also works with textiles, creating two-dimensional works featuring people and spaces with fabric and thread; constructs figurines from textiles and other various materials, including metal, shell, canvas, and fur; as well as produces stop-motion animation. Flett has exhibited throughout British Columbia as a solo artist and in group exhibitions across Canada since the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. He has been the recipient of Canada Council for the Arts and BC Arts Council grants, participated in the Canada Council Mexico Artists Residency Program in 1996, and has received awards for excellence in various juried art shows.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{experimental}} study {{was one of}} the fundamental observations in relation with formation of the Lichtenberg figures, which is to know the function of existence of the air film. The insulating oil film was used for removing the air film along the <b>photographic</b> emulsion surface <b>layer.</b> The thickness of oil film was controlled. At this state, the chopped impulse wave was applied, and the obtained Lichtenberg figures were researched. The result obtained was thus: -For a thin oil film (more or less 0. 010 cm), the positive and negative Lichtenberg figures were observed similar to those which are naked dry plates. But the streamers became wider in width, longer in length, larger in number, and very regular. In case of increasing the thickness of an oil film (more or less 0. 050 cm), not only these macroscopic (ordinary) figures were recognized, but also very dense microscopic figures appeared around both electrodes. When the thickness of an oil layer is increased over 0. 20 cm, there will not appear these macroscopic figures but the microscopic dense figures. These consist of wide part like leaves, and fine dendritic figures. The length of dense dendritic streamers around the positive electrode was longer than the negative one. Then, the writer thought that the existence of the air film along the emulsion surface has dominant effects for appearing the macroscopic figure. When the dry plate was naked, the critical crest voltage for appearance of both figures was about 2 kV. But in the case of oil immersion it was about 10 kV for the dense microscopic figures. This seems to be the phenomenon due to the electrical characteristic of the insulating oil used for it...|$|R
