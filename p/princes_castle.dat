50|$|After World War II, Kroc found {{employment}} as a milk shake mixer salesman for the foodservice equipment manufacturer <b>Prince</b> <b>Castle.</b> When <b>Prince</b> <b>Castle</b> Multi-Mixer sales plummeted because of competition from lower-priced Hamilton Beach products, Kroc {{was impressed by}} Richard and Maurice McDonald who had purchased eight of his Multi-Mixers for their San Bernardino, California store, and visited them in 1955. Kroc became convinced that the concept and design of this small chain {{had the potential to}} expand across the nation.|$|R

50|$|By 1955, Martino {{was doing}} double duty after Kroc opened his first McDonald’s {{restaurant}} in Des Plaines, Illinois - running his <b>Prince</b> <b>Castle</b> sales operation for multimixers {{as well as}} the fledgling McDonald’s Systems office. When a young man dropped by the office selling bibles, Martino instead converted him and his wife into McDonald’s franchisees. Thus, Sandy and Betty Agate became successful franchisees in Waukegan, Illinois, whose operation was soon a model for others to follow.|$|R

50|$|Ray Kroc is a {{traveling}} salesman selling <b>Prince</b> <b>Castle</b> brand milkshake mixers in 1954 but with little success. While {{he has a}} supportive wife, Ethel, and has saved enough to live a simple and comfortable life in Arlington Heights, Illinois, he craves more. After learning that a drive-in in San Bernardino is ordering an unusually large number of milkshake mixers, Ray drives to California to see it. What he finds is McDonald's—a highly popular walk-up restaurant with fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging, and a family-friendly atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the film}} is set in Austria, it was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic. The city of Vienna is {{represented}} in the film by Tábor and Prague, while the scenes set in Eisenheim's childhood village were shot in Český Krumlov. The Crown <b>Prince's</b> <b>castle</b> is actually the historical fortress of Konopiště (located near Benešov), formerly the home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. The front gates of Leopold's Vienna palace (the Hofburg) were actually the front gates of Prague Castle. All other shots were at Barrandov Studios in Prague.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the player}} reaches {{what appears to}} be the dark <b>prince's</b> <b>castle,</b> and faces a golden wizard-knight at the end (which {{transforms}} into a demonic skull). If the game is played on Easy, this is the final level. If played on Normal, the dark prince's true stronghold — a castle resting on a giant, green skull — arises, and the game continues for a few more levels, ending with a confrontation with the dark prince himself. In the end, through the utilization of all four characters, the kingdom is saved.|$|R

50|$|By 1954, The McDonald brothers' stand was {{restaurant}} equipment manufacturer <b>Prince</b> <b>Castle's</b> biggest purchaser of milkshake blending machines. <b>Prince</b> <b>Castle</b> salesman Ray Kroc traveled to California to discover why {{the company had}} purchased almost {{a dozen of the}} units as opposed to the normal one or two found in most restaurants of the time. Enticed by the success of the McDonald's concept, Kroc signed a franchise agreement with the brothers and began opening McDonald's restaurants in Illinois. By 1961, Kroc had bought out the brothers and created what is now the modern McDonald's Corporation. One of the major parts of his business plan was to promote cleanliness of his restaurants to growing groups of Americans that had become aware of food safety issues. As part of his commitment to cleanliness, Kroc often took part in cleaning his own Des Plaines, Illinois outlet by hosing down the garbage cans and scraping gum off the cement. Another concept Kroc added was great swaths of glass which enabled the customer to view the food preparation, a practice still found in chains such as Krispy Kreme. A clean atmosphere was only part of Kroc's grander plan which separated McDonald's {{from the rest of the}} competition and attributes to their great success. Kroc envisioned making his restaurants appeal to suburban families.|$|R

However, recent interdisciplinary research in 2004 and 2005 has shown that the fort at Venz (between Gingst and Trent onat the Neuendorfer Wiek) is much more likely to be the <b>prince's</b> <b>castle</b> and temple of Charenza, which was surrendered without a fight on 16 June 1168 to the King of Denmark Valdemar I and his army commander, Absalon of Roskilde, after negotiations had been held. This was one day after the conquest of the Jaromarsburg castle and temple site on Cape Arkona.|$|R

50|$|This mode is {{essentially}} the game's story mode. Each course is unlocked as Arle progresses through the story. An interesting feature of this mode, however, {{is the ability to}} attain and deliver various items throughout the courses. The item side quest can be played after clearing the game. Each item is received after the player completes the course for the second time. The player navigates through six different areas - Hamaji Forest, Gold Town, Gachinko Dungeon, Magical Tower, Dark <b>Prince</b> <b>Castle</b> and Trial Labyrinth - each with their own special Rule Henka. The first five areas are each unlocked by completing the one before it, but Trial Labyrinth has to be unlocked after completing an item delivery quest following the completion of the first five areas a second time.|$|R
