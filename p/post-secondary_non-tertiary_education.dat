The usual ISCED division into low, medium and high is then adopted where low is equivalent to ISCED 0 – 2 (i.e. primary and lower secondary education), medium is given by ISCED 3 – 4 (i.e. upper secondary and <b>post-secondary</b> <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education)</b> and high is ISCED 5 – 7 (i.e. tertiary education).

The conclusion of the thesis presents evaluation of the previous parts. It is clear that the competition in the particular market is strong, and therefore it is necessary for every company to strive for some kind of competitive advantage. Regarding the choice of a suitable linguistic course {{from the point of view}} of a student, we suggest several factors that one should consider.

40|$|AbstractThe {{continuous}} {{increase in}} the level of education in the EU countries is one of the fundamental objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Taking into consideration the fact that the economical efficiency is significantly influenced by the quality of the human resource, the level of education of the active population is an important variable in the process of the economic growth. The current different politics applied in the EU 28 countries 20 years ago had a big structural diversity as a direct consequence concerning the level of education of the active population. Based on these findings, the paper analyses the evolution of the characteristics of the active population in the EU 28 countries on the level of education in the last 10 years, a period which includes the economical crisis. The analyses based on official databases show the tendency of increasing the share of the active population with tertiary education and the relative stability of those with upper secondary and <b>post-secondary</b> <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education.</b> At the same time the fact that the difference between the countries with high shares of the tertiary education attainment level and those with still low shares is continuously increasing is emphasized, the process still being divergent.

40|$|In summary, {{the returns}} to {{investment}} in education in Singapore tend to increase {{with years of}} schooling, with the returns to tertiary education generally higher than those for <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education.</b> This {{is similar to the}} findings for other Asian newly industrialised economies like South Korea and Hong Kong. As the structure of Singapore’s economy shifts towards higher value-added and knowledge activities, there will continue to be an increase in the demand for skilled and educated human capital. We can thus expect the demand for workers with tertiary education to increase, which implies that the rate of returns to tertiary education is likely to remain high and above those for secondary and below education. Education will hence continue to be an attractive investment for individuals. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent demographic, {{economic}} and political trends have drawn attention {{to the issue of}} effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources in the education sector. In the context of the renewed interest for the optimisation of resource use, this paper attempts to review the literature on budgeting and accounting in OECD education systems. The analysis of accounting and budgeting in education systems provides an understanding of decision-making processes regarding education policies and projects, in terms of prioritisation, planning, allocation, monitoring and evaluation of resource use. The subjects covered in the paper also help to understand how resources are distributed. Greater requests for transparency from citizens are indeed pressuring governments to justify how public resources are allocated, and which variables determine the levels of funding flowing to schools. Finally, accounting standards and budgeting methods are studied in the current paper as they may also have an impact on effectiveness and efficiency of resource use. This report first explores governance questions underlying budgeting and accounting. Subsequently, the report reviews procedures and tools adopted by countries for budgeting and accounting. Finally, it presents methods for evaluation and monitoring of resource use. The paper attempts to identify trends and commonalities in country practices in primary, secondary and <b>post-secondary</b> <b>non-tertiary</b> education; however, there are great variations on the studied topics across and within countries...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform the}} first {{comprehensive}} fiscal incidence analyses in Brazil and the US, including direct cash and food transfers, targeted housing and heating subsidies, public spending on education and health, and personal income, payroll, corporate income, property, and expenditure taxes. In both countries, primary spending is close to 40 percent of GDP. The US achieves higher redistribution through direct taxes and transfers, primarily due to underutilization of the personal income tax in Brazil {{and the fact that}} Brazil’s highly progressive cash and food transfer programs are small while larger transfer programs are less progressive. However, when health and <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education</b> spending are added to income using the government cost approach, the two countries achieve similar levels of redistribution. This result may be a reflection of better-off households in Brazil opting out of public services due to quality concerns rather than a result of government effort to make spending more equitable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact on public {{education}} spending of social democratic participation in government. By means of a pooled time-series analysis of spending in OECD democracies, it is shown that social democrats have increased public spending primarily on higher education. This finding {{is at odds with}} simple class-based models of partisan preferences (Boix) that predict a preference for <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education.</b> As an alternative, the notion of a 'new politics of public investment in education' (Iversen) is presented. From this perspective, political parties are not merely transmission belts for the economic interests of social classes, but use policies and spending strategically to attract and consolidate voter groups. By increasing public investment in tertiary education, social democrats cater to their core electoral constituencies (for example, by expanding enrolment) and, at the same time, new middle-class constituencies to escape electoral dilemmas and reforge the cross-class alliance with the middle class...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{understand}} to which extend developments of labor force participation rates in selected European countries between 2000 and 2010 {{can be explained by}} age- and education-specific changes in participation rates as compared to changes in populations’ structural composition by age and education. We apply a decomposition methodology that allows us to disentangle changes in age- and education specific labor force participation rates from changes in the age and educational structure of the population. Our results show that labor force participation rates of adult women would have increased even more, {{had it not been for}} the downward pressure from the shift in the age composition towards older age-groups with relatively lower levels of participation. This downward pressure also depressed male participation. The increase in participation among older persons is mainly explained by participation increases among those with <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education</b> and reinforced by a general shift towards higher levels of educational attainment. Our results indicate that labor supply may not decrease to the extent expected due to population aging, given educational expansion and education specific patterns of economic activity...|$|R

40|$|Defense date: 01 / 06 / 2011 Examining Board: Prof. Jaap Dronkers, European University Institute (Supervisor) Prof. Sven Steinmo, European University Institute Prof. Beatrijs Cantillon, Antwerp University Prof. Markus Jäntti, Stockholm UniversityThe main {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is to examine how public services impact on inequality in income distribution in fourteen European countries. In other words, it investigates how adding the monetary value (equalling to cost of production) of public childcare, <b>non-tertiary</b> and tertiary <b>education,</b> health care and elderly care services to a household’s disposable income alters income distribution and how efficiently public services work in the mechanism of redistribution. Moreover, it studies how the public spending on these services is distributed across income classes and household types. Many previous studies have already hinted that the omission of services from welfare state research may contribute to a biased and deficient understanding of social policies. Besides, the inclusion of these categories of social spending is likely to influence not only countries but also income classes and household types in distinct ways – making this study all the more significant. While previous studies may have incorporated health care and <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education</b> within the concept of income, this thesis presents the first attempt to include childcare and elderly care services in research on income distribution, {{as well as a}} more thorough analysis of higher education. Likewise, the use of a wider comparative perspective to examine income inequality in social-democratic, conservative, Mediterranean, postcommunist, and liberal welfare states contributes to the existing literature on European social policies. The results of this thesis illustrate that in-kind benefits can function as a redistributive tool in European welfare states. Firstly, the quintile share ratio decreased on average by a third when moving from disposable income to final income (excluding higher education that is more pro-rich). Secondly, however, the variation both between countries and services is considerable, and thus different in-kind transfers should be analysed separately: the greatest impact on inequality is achieved through <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education</b> and health care (17 and 16 per cent reduction respectively), while the inclusion of childcare and elderly care reduced inequality by 4 and 6 per cent on average. In the social-democratic cluster, elderly care contributed much more efficiently on equal distribution of resources than elsewhere. Thirdly, we observe a pattern of redistribution towards the poor, even within subgroups. Fourthly, the clustering of countries did not show a coherent pattern and it is especially hard to fit childcare to the traditional welfare state regime typology. Finally, we see that {{it is not only the}} level of public spending, or the comprehensiveness of coverage, that influence the received results in one direction or the other, but also the socio-demographic structure of society and the equality of access to services. In conclusion, further research should be conducted on the regional variations of the quality and quantity of services provided. Likewise, more effort should be devoted to studying the inequality of access to different services (as undertaken here with higher education). In the context of economic crisis and concern about the sustainability of public provision of services, this thesis aims at providing important evidence about egalitarian consequences of potential political reforms in the public services sector. Whilst not the raison d’être of services, redistributive effects should be considered when adjusting social policies to face the challenges of modern societies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: One {{expected}} {{consequence of}} population aging in Europe is the shrinkage {{of the labor}} force. Most existing labor force projections allow only inferences about the size and age structure of the future labor force. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In comparison to existing labor force projections, which disaggregate only by age and sex, these projections include information about {{the highest level of}} educational attainment (tertiary vs. <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education),</b> so that an additional level of heterogeneity in labor force participation is considered. This heterogeneity enters the projection methodology through population projection data as well as labor force participation data, since both components are decomposed in the three dimensions of age, sex, and education. Based on data from the European Labor Force Survey (EU LFS), three scenarios were designed to project the economically active population for 26 EU countries up to 2053. RESULTS: Adding the educational dimension to labor force projections discloses a significant shift towards tertiary education degrees between 2008 and 2053. This educational upgrading of the European labor force is not driven by developments in a few large countries but can be expected to take place in each of the 26 analyzed countries. CONCLUSION: A better educated but shrinking labor force is {{likely to be able to}} alleviate some of the anticipated economic consequences of population aging. The presented projections of education-specific labor supply can serve as inputs into forecasts of economic growth that include educational differentials in labor productivity...|$|R
30|$|Educational {{attainment}} {{in terms}} of the highest educational degree is measured using a coarsened, three-category version of the 1997 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). I differentiate between workers with low (ISCED levels 0 – 2), intermediate (ISCED levels 3 – 4), and high education (ISCED levels 5 – 6). This is equivalent to the highest degree being below the upper secondary level, at the upper secondary (including the <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>post-secondary)</b> level, and at the tertiary level, respectively. In a sensitivity analysis, I explored the consequences of using a more fine-grained education measure with five categories. Findings were reassuring (see the “Robustness checks” section below).|$|R
30|$|In a first step, we {{describe}} the transition from education to first stable job depending on the educational attainment. We approach this from an event history perspective. For a descriptive overview, we estimate failure functions using the Kaplan–Meier product-limit method. In the multivariate analyses of the transition from education to a first stable job, we apply Cox proportional hazards regression models (Blossfeld and Rohwer 2002; Cleves et al. 2010; Cox 1972). We chose an event history approach because {{it allows us to}} take right-censored cases into account and avoid bias caused by cases who were at risk for less than the defined observation period (48  months). We have no theoretical concerns about time dependency, which is introduced in this model as an unspecified baseline hazard rate. As our main interest is the direction and strength of the covariate effects on the event occurrence (not the search duration), the Cox model is appropriate. 7 We assume that individuals are available for the labour market as soon as they leave the educational system, so the start of the observation period is set accordingly. We observe that 192 dropouts enter vocational training after leaving higher education. As these individuals are unavailable for the labour market for at least 2  years, we define these cases as being ‘not at risk’ and set them to censored from the time the vocational training starts. We do not allow them to re-enter the risk set after graduation from vocational training. In the same way, we treated 639 individuals who are unavailable for the labour market for reasons of parental leave, military or voluntary service, sick-leave and <b>non-tertiary</b> <b>education.</b> In a second step, we select respondents who successfully entered the labour market and conduct ordinary least squares (OLS) models to analyse the occupational status of the first stable job.|$|R
30|$|In a first check I used a more {{fine-grained}} {{measure of}} highest educational degree. In particular, I used a five-category measure {{that is based}} on a six-category variable provided as part of the PIAAC public use files. The original variable differentiates among the following levels: below upper secondary (ISCED 0 – 2, 3 C short), upper secondary (ISCED levels 3 A, 3 B, 3 C long), <b>post-secondary,</b> but <b>non-tertiary</b> (ISCED 4 A, 4 B, 4 C), professional tertiary (ISCED 5 B), bachelor’s (ISCED 5 A short), and research degree at the master’s level and above (e.g., PhD; ISCED 5 A long/ 6). It is not possible to implement this level of disaggregation for all countries because some of the categories are very small in some countries. This applies to the ‘post-secondary, but non-tertiary’ category in particular. 10 As in the main analysis, I therefore collapsed it with the upper secondary group to obtain a five-category measure. I restricted this supplementary analysis to the 12 countries with at least 40 observations for each of the five educational categories because estimating within-group standard deviations based on fewer cases would be dubious. 11 I ran a factor analysis similar to the one from the main analysis, but this time with 10 rather than 6 residual within-group standard deviations (one for each combination of the 5 educational groups and 2 skill domains). The average eigenvalue of the first factor across the 10 plausible values was 4.85 and the average value of Cronbach’s alpha was 0.87. 12 As in the main analysis, I constructed an index of internal homogeneity by reverse coding the scores for the first factor. The country-level correlation between the homogeneity measure used in the main analysis and the one based on the five-category education measure is 0.98, suggesting that results for the main analysis would look similar if it were possible to use a more fine-grained education measure for all countries.|$|R
