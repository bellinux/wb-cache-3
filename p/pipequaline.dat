While its {{profile of}} anxiolytic effects without sedation would appear to have potential medical applications, <b>pipequaline</b> has never been developed for medical use and is currently only used in scientific research.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pipequaline</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} PK-8165) is an {{anxiolytic}} drug {{that was never}} marketed. It possesses a novel chemical structure that is not closely related to other drugs of this type. The drug has a similar pharmacological profile to the benzodiazepine family of drugs, but with mainly anxiolytic properties and very little sedative, amnestic or anticonvulsant effects, and so is classified as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, zimelidine {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} soon after its marketing in 1983 {{due to the}} emergence of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between indalpine and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by Rhône Poulenc, indalpine was abruptly taken off the market by Rhône Poulenc, to the surprise of others. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized indalpine as being [...] "born at the wrong time" [...] during a period when [...] "indalpine and psychiatry was under siege" [...] by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries. In line with indalpine's fate, research and development was halted relating to the 2 other 4-alkyl-piperidine derivatives developed by Pharmuka, viqualine (a serotonin releasing agent) and <b>pipequaline</b> (a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator), both in different stages of development at the time.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aejaz_Ahmed/publication/270512329_Available_online_www_The_Importance_of_Six_Membered_Saturated_Nitrogen_Containing_Ring_in_Psychological_disorders/links/54acc5430cf21c47713a73a6.pdf ...|$|E
