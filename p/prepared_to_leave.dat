5|$|As {{the teams}} <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their {{dressing}} rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit {{by a short}} period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
5|$|As Hayes <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> office, several {{delegations}} of reform-minded Republicans {{urged him}} to run against the incumbent Republican, John Sherman, for United States Senate. Hayes declined the offers, preferring to preserve party unity and retire to private life. Hayes especially looked forward to spending time with his children, two of whom (daughter Fanny and son Scott) {{had been born in}} the past five years. Initially, Hayes tried to promote railway extensions to his hometown, Fremont. He also managed some real estate he had acquired in Duluth, Minnesota. Not entirely removed from politics, Hayes held out some hope of a cabinet appointment, but was disappointed to receive only an appointment as assistant U.S. treasurer at Cincinnati, which he turned down. He agreed to be nominated for his old House seat in 1872 but was not disappointed when he lost the election to Henry B. Banning, a fellow Kenyon College alumnus. In 1873, Lucy gave birth to another son, Manning Force Hayes. That same year, the Panic of 1873 hurt business prospects across the nation, including Hayes's. Sardis Birchard died that year and the Hayes family moved into Spiegel Grove, the grand house Birchard had built with them in mind.|$|E

He was readmitted in February 1927, the bar having decided that the authorship of his propaganda tracts was in question (as well as covered by the 1924 amnesty).|$|E

25|$|In May 1966, Margaret Whitman {{announced}} {{her decision to}} divorce her husband because of his continued physical abuse. Charles Whitman drove to Florida to help his mother move to Austin.

Whitman's youngest brother, John, also left Lake Worth and moved to Austin with his mother. Patrick Whitman, the middle son, remained in Florida and worked in his father's plumbing supply business.|$|E

Instead while keeping fire on the Spanish defenses, the English concentrated by taking all the booty from every ship and then placed it all aboard Ramírez’s former ﬂagship which Langton uses as his main prize. Langton having been satisfied with what he had then <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and so on the third day the English departed with the six prizes and their guns blazing keeping the Spanish at bay from a potential counterattack.|$|E
25|$|However, {{tensions}} between the Farnese and other Italian nobility were not limited to local events in Parma. Historian Leopold von Ranke gives an account of a 1639 visit to Rome by Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza. The Duke arrived in Rome to great fanfare - he was given gifts and escorted around the city by Pope Urban's Cardinal-nephews, Antonio Barberini and Francesco Barberini. But the Duke refused to pay due deference to the Pope's other nephew; the newly appointed Prefect of Rome, Taddeo Barberini. As the Duke <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> he suggested that an escort from the city (ordinarily reserved for the Grand Duke of Tuscany) would be appropriate. Francesco Barberini refused. The Duke took his leave but urged the Pope to chastise both Cardinal-nephews.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) {{was formed}} by Taylor's former teammates, Lester and Frank Patrick. They {{encouraged}} Taylor to come west. In November 1912, {{it was announced that}} he would be paid $1,800 to join the Vancouver Millionaires. As he <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> for the west coast, Taylor said he would not play in the NHA again under any circumstances. Before he left, Taylor said one of the two new Toronto teams in the NHA was owned by Lichtenhein, who was plotting to send Taylor to Toronto and prevent him from playing for Ottawa. The accusation was denied by the presidents of both Toronto teams and by Lichtenhein, who all said he had no ownership stake in either team.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} itself {{started when}} Russia considered Ypsilantis' deposition {{to go against}} {{the letter of the}} Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the Treaty of Jassy. While the Russian Count and Ambassador Arbuthnot <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Istanbul, The Porte convened to have the two Princes reinstated. Despite this, Russian troops under General Ivan Michelson and Count Mikhail Miloradovich entered the two Danubian Principalities (see Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)). Prince Ypsilantis had previously escaped to the Russian camp, and was briefly considered by his allies as ruler over both principalities (just before Russian occupation took over); the French Consul to Moldavia, Charles-Frédéric Reinhard, reportedly not informed of Sébastiani's contacts with Selim, was arrested by the Russian troops. As a major consequence of this chain of events, France pulled the strings of Ottoman foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Donovan {{became the}} first man to be named the U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year {{three years in a row}} before {{returning}} to the Bayer Leverkusen first team in January 2005. After playing seven matches with Leverkusen in the spring season, only two of which were starts, Donovan requested to leave the club. Despite a late offer from English Premier League club Portsmouth, Donovan expressed a desire to return to the United States. Upon his re-entry to MLS, San Jose was denied the chance to re-sign Donovan because Earthquakes general manager Alexi Lalas had traded away his rights. The Los Angeles Galaxy, his hometown team, were able to trade leading scorer Carlos Ruiz to FC Dallas to get on top of the MLS allocation order as Donovan <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Germany.|$|E

25|$|Late that December, Pușcariu {{suffered}} a stroke that left him unable to use {{his right hand and}} forced him to learn to write with his left. During his remaining three years, he continued to be active in writing his memoirs and working on the dictionary project. In January 1948, as the Romanian royal family <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country permanently following the establishment of a Communist regime, he was sent an invitation to leave his residence in Bran and join them in exile. However, he refused, stating he wished to remain in his native country. Reportedly, he was only spared imprisonment by the fact of his partial paralysis. He had been placed on trial by the new regime but not yet sentenced when he died in Bran in May 1948, of heart failure.|$|E
25|$|The Union forces <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Hampton Roads on December 10, but {{a winter}} storm hit the fleet for three days, {{preventing}} the fleet's departure until the 14th. The transports carrying Butler's force arrived at Fort Fisher first, since the navy took longer to refuel at Beaufort than expected. When Porter's ships {{arrived on the}} 19th, another storm hit the fleet, causing some ships to scatter and forcing the army transports to return to Beaufort. After the storm subsided on the 23rd, Porter decided to start the attack without Butler, ordering the Louisiana to be blown up that night. Near midnight, the ship was towed close to the fort's seawall and set on fire. However, the Louisiana was farther out to sea than the navy thought, perhaps {{as far as a}} mile offshore; as a result, Fort Fisher was undamaged by the blast.|$|E
25|$|The life of Joseph Smith from 1827 to 1830 {{includes}} {{some of his}} life's most significant events, {{and some of the}} most important history of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Restorationist religious movement he initiated during this period. This movement gave rise to Mormonism, and includes such denominations as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ. The period covered by this article begins in late 1827, after Smith announced he had obtained a book of golden Plates buried in a hill, guarded by an angel, near his home in Manchester, New York (near Palmyra village). See Early life of Joseph Smith Because of opposition by former treasure-seeking colleagues who believed they owned a share of the golden plates, Smith <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Palmyra area for his wife's home town of Harmony, Pennsylvania (now Oakland). From late 1827 to the end of 1830, Smith would translate the golden plates, publish the Book of Mormon, and establish the Church of Christ.|$|E

25|$|Ansar Allah (sometimes Anglicised as Ansarullah), known popularly as the Houthis, a Zaidi {{group with}} {{its origins in}} the mountainous Sa'dah Governorate on Yemen's {{northern}} border with Saudi Arabia, began waging a low-level insurgency against the Yemeni government in 2004. The intensity of the conflict waxed and waned {{over the course of}} the 2000s, with multiple peace agreements being negotiated and later disregarded. The Houthi insurgency heated up in 2009, briefly drawing in neighbouring Saudi Arabia on the side of the Yemeni government, but quieted the following year after a ceasefire was signed. During the early stages of the Yemeni Revolution in 2011, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared the group's support for demonstrations calling for the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Later in the year, as Saleh <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> office, the Houthis laid siege to the Sunni-majority village of Dammaj in northern Yemen, a step toward attaining virtual autonomy for Sa'dah.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 2011, the 1st Squadron {{was ordered}} into active Federal service. In {{the middle of}} the year, the {{squadron}} deployed to Kuwait to provide base management, regional security and security for convoys moving between Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn, the United States withdrawal from Iraq. On 3 April 2012, the 1st Squadron cased its colors at Camp Buehring as it <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Kuwait to return to the United States after the completion of Operation New Dawn. It was released from active Federal service after return to Minnesota on 26 June. In 2015, the squadron participated in the eXportable Combat Training Capabilities (XCTC) exercise, which included live-fire drills at the platoon level. At the time, the 1st Squadron was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Kemp; 1st Squadron's headquarters and headquarters troop were based in Duluth, A Troop in Hibbing, B Troop in Pine City, and C Troop in Cloquet.|$|E
25|$|As Harkins and Felt <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> Diệm took Lodge {{aside for}} an {{individual}} discussion and repeatedly asked what the Americans wanted, repeating his request for 20 minutes. This was a trick on Diem's part, as the fake coup was about to start. In reference to a United Nations inquiry over his repression of the Buddhists, Diệm claimed that Buddhists had been brainwashed by the Americans. Diệm claimed he had closed the pagodas because among the students were communists about to throw grenades and perpetrate bombings during the UN visit. The president also claimed that some Americans were planning a coup against him and promised to give Lodge names. The American ambassador replied with a poker face that he was committed to removing any of his countrymen {{who were involved in}} plotting, even though he was doing so himself. Lodge was not taken in by Diệm, as Washington had already told Diệm what reforms were necessary, such as the removal of Nhu {{and the use of the}} special forces to fight communists rather than dissidents; Diệm had not responded to US advice. Lodge knew that the real coup was in the offing and did not want to stop it, even if Diệm's overtures were genuine.|$|E
