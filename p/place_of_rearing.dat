40|$|This study cross-validated the Africentrism Scale and {{investigated}} the relation-ship between Africentrism and demographic variables in a diverse sample of in-dividuals of African descent. Participants were 206 individuals who identified as African, African American, or Caribbean/West Indian. Demographic variables included age, gender, ethnic background, educational level, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing,</b> {{and level of}} identification with African ancestry. The results suggested that age and education were related to Africentrism with younger and less educated individu-als endorsing less Africentrism. No other demographic variables emerged as sig-nificant predictors. Caribbeans had a slightly lower score than others after con-trolling for age. Overall, the Africentrism Scale demonstrated solid internal consistency (coefficient alpha) and convergent validity (inverse association to a measure of cultural misorientation). In addition, the obtained factor structure was similar to that obtained in the original sample...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES: Several {{studies which}} have {{suggested}} foods {{for the new}} environment of reared grasscutter, report the composition, zootechnical performance, digestibility of these foods. However, very few investigations reveal the constitution of blood grasscutter after having provided food for measuring of concentrations blood nutrients. The main {{purpose of this study}} is the determination and assessment of blood nutrients through hematology and biochemical parameters and C-reactive protein in reared grasscutters subjected to a complete granulated food. METHODOLOGY: Eight subadult Grasscutters aged six months in Benin are subjected to different foods (foods from Côte d'Ivoire and another food usually distributed in Benin). In each animal, a blood sample is taken fasting the morning in tubes with anticoagulant and without anticoagulant. Through these blood samples, haematological and biochemical parameters were determined and evaluated through comparisons of statistical tests. RESULTS: The results of these investigations showed that the mean values of all blood nutrients were normal compared to some studies conducted elsewhere. In addition, our work has shown that both foods do not significantly different through the evaluated blood nutrients. However, concentrations of urea (28 ± 2. 8 mg/dl) and phosphorus (102. 5 ± 14. 3 mmol/l) are increased in grasscutter subjected to complete granulated food compared to food usually distributed in grasscutter <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing</b> (21. 3 ± 3. 8 mg/dl and 78. 5 ± 9 mmol/l respectively). Furthermore, various relationships were observed between haematological, biochemical parameters, weight gain and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: The complete granulated food provides good and best content of nutrients in blood of subadult grasscutters...|$|E

50|$|A sedan delivery, {{commonly}} called a delivery in American English {{and a car}} derived van in British English, is a two-door station wagon with driver and front passenger seats or driver's only seat, and steel sheet-metal panels in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>rear</b> side windows.

5000|$|An unusual variant {{unique to}} New Zealand, {{available}} for some years, was a [...] "van", basically the manual Avenger wagon {{with a flat}} <b>rear</b> floor in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>rear</b> seats and fixed, rather than wind-down, rear door windows. This, and rival models, was introduced around 1975 to get around strict post-oil crisis government hire purchase laws {{in the country that}} required a 60 per cent deposit for a new car with only 12-month terms versus 25 per cent and three years for a light commercial vehicle, which is what these so-called [...] "vans" [...] were classified as.|$|R

50|$|All KS-3 {{airframes}} {{were converted}} from war-surplus Wackett airframes. The changes included reducing the wing and tail-plane incidence, covering the fixed leading-edge slots, removing the rounded wing-tip fairings, adding a 13 cubic foot (400 litre) aluminium chemical hopper in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rear</b> seat and modifying the control routes around the hopper outlet.|$|R
50|$|The R27 is {{outwardly}} {{similar to}} the 2006 R26, with several aerodynamic modifications. The front wing design, for example, is very {{similar to the}} R26's.

5000|$|Another type is a cap made {{of heavy}} cloth with paired earflaps, {{sometimes}} lined with fur or lambskin, {{and a single}} visor in front.

50|$|In <b>place</b> <b>of</b> {{the usual}} <b>rear</b> solid axle, there is {{independent}} suspension from lower wishbones, the original trailing arms, an upper strut and an anti-roll bar. At the front a radius rod {{on each side}} {{was added to the}} standard double wishbones.|$|R
2500|$|Many ERT 1965 {{cars had}} the battery {{relocated}} to the trunk, which was changed mid-year from complaints of fumes, and featured over-rider traction bars, relocated A-arms, {{as well as}} other modifications. Over-rider traction bars are named so because of their design being on top of the leaf spring as opposed to underneath them. There was only one transmission available, a 4-speed Borg-Warner T-10 manual. The exhaust system in the 1965 G.T. 350 was a side-exit dual exhaust with glass-pack mufflers. For this one year, the G.T. 350 also featured special 130mph-rated Goodyear [...] "Blue Dot" [...] tires, named for the prominent blue dot on each sidewall. The 1965 G.T. 350 had a full size spare tire mounted in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>rear</b> seats, making it a 2-seat-only vehicle (to be allowed to race under SCCA regulations as a [...] "sports car"), and rode on either silver-painted steel wheels or special cast-magnesium center [...] "Cragar Shelby" [...] 15" [...] rims with chromed center caps marked with a stylized [...] "CS". Total 1965 model year production was 562 units.|$|R

5000|$|The Roundup {{represented}} the base trim level available within the Edsel brand for a station wagon, {{and was only}} available during Edsel's introductory year of 1958.

A split-back front seat was standard to allow access to the back seat. In <b>place</b> <b>of</b> roll-down <b>rear</b> windows, the Roundup used sliding windows.|$|R
2500|$|One Canguro was {{modified}} to fly under power by Adriano Mantelli. [...] His first version, flown in 1955 had a 16.4kW (22hp) motor {{mounted on a}} pylon above the wing.

50|$|The P.1216 {{was planned}} to be powered by a plenum chamber burning {{equipped}} vectored thrust engine. This used three swivelling engine nozzles rather than the four used in the Harrier.

50|$|In 1969 three {{competition}} Fulvia 1.6 HF {{were transformed}} into racing barchettas by Claudio Maglioli.

In spite of the chassis bracing needed to preserve rigidity without the roof, the car resulted 200 kg lighter than the coupé; the suspension had to be retuned {{to compensate for the}} lighter weight, and one leaf was removed from the front spring.The car was christened Fulvia HF F&M Special, where F and M stood for the initials of Lancia team manager Cesare Fiorio and of Maglioli.The barchetta's first major race entry was the 1969 Targa Florio. Sandro Munari and Rauno Altonen drove one to a ninth overall placement as well as to a class victory.|$|R
50|$|A van {{version of}} the XJ was offered in {{addition}} to the standard passenger vehicles in some European markets. Available in both right- and left-hand-drive models, they were designed to comply with relaxed motor tax regulations in some EU member states governing vehicles intended for primarily commercial use. Both two- and four-door versions are known to have been sold, with the main differences from the standard models being metal panels in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rear</b> side windows, no rear seats, and a completely flat cargo area. Two- and four-wheel-drive variants were available, powered by the VM Motori 2.5 L diesel engine mated to the Aisin AX-15 manual transmission. Photographs of this model can be found here.|$|R
