5000|$|The exact {{quantitative}} {{contribution of}} the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous flow to the heart to HRT is unknown. The simplistic view assumes that HRT is solely dependent upon parasympathetic activity because atropine, a parasympathetic activity blocker abolishes HRT while a beta-blocker (sympathetic blocker) {{has no effect on}} HRT. The {{contribution of the}} compensatory pause, the pause between the PVC and the next normal beat, to HRT is also unknown. Whether the single beat blood pressure increase after a compensatory pause occurs in both normal and compromised hearts as well is at present uncertain. To date, no <b>physiological</b> <b>parameter</b> has been linked in a quantitative manner to turbulence slope, whereas turbulence onset was shown by researchers in Calgary, Canada to be linearly dependent upon duration of subnormal blood pressure in a well designed experiment. [...] Finally, the reason the size of HRT after a PVC predicts cardiac death is suggested by its mechanism. Parasympathetic nervous activity to the heart is believed to be protective and sympathetic nervous activity, deleterious, to the heart. Especially after a heart attack, sympathetic nervous activity tends to be increased. A healthy HRT indicates the presence of a healthy amount of parasympathetic activity, countering sympathetic activity. To take a wider view, however, it may be that a healthy HRT is also an indication of a healthy brain, and is the reason small HRT also predicts a likelihood of death from non- cardiac causes as well as from cardiac causes.|$|E

The <b>physiological</b> <b>parameters</b> analyzed were the number of chewing cycles, chewing time, masseter amplitude, and cycle duration, which were obtained from masseter surface electromyography recorded in ten (seven male and three female) healthy, young participants. The six test foods differed in size dimensions (length, width, and height) and in textural properties (hardness, fracturability, and adhesiveness). The quantitative relationships were examined using linear regression.

This paper describes the feasibility of a novel dry electrode interfacing using Patterned Vertical Carbon Nanotube (pvCNT) for <b>physiological</b> <b>parameter</b> sensing. The electrodes were fabricated on circular discs (φ = 10 mm) stainless steel substrate. Multiwalled electrically conductive carbon nanotubes were grown in pattered pillar formation of 100 µm squared with 50, 100, 200 and 500 µm spacing. The heights of the pillars were between 1 to 1. 5 mm. A comparative test with commercial ECG electrodes shows that pvCNT has lower electrical impedance, stable impedance over very long time, and comparable signal capture in vitro. Long duration study shows minimal degradation of impedance over 2 days period. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using pvCNT dry electrodes for <b>physiological</b> <b>parameter</b> sensing.

Pre and post-test quasi experimental design with non-random assignment. Method. A total of 113 participants {{were assigned to the}} control group or intervention group depending on the day of their procedure. Participants' anxiety levels were measured objectively by comparing their vital signs and subjectively by the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Scale. Participants' <b>physiological</b> <b>parameters</b> (blood pressure, pulse and respiration) and State Trait Anxiety Scale were measured at two time periods. The control group undertook the usual relaxing activities provided in the waiting room compared with the intervention group who listened to music of their own choice in reclining chairs while waiting for the procedure. Results. The <b>physiological</b> <b>parameters</b> for both the control and intervention groups dropped significantly during the waiting period, however, only the intervention group had a significant reduction in reported anxiety levels. Conclusions. These results suggest that providing self-selected music to day procedure patients in the preprocedure period assists in the reduction of <b>physiological</b> <b>parameters</b> and anxiety, yet, a relaxing environment can assist in the reduction of <b>physiological</b> <b>parameters.</b> Relevance to clinical practice.
