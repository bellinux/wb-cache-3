40|$|Radioactive wastes are {{confined}} in 49 underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site. The waste is transported between tanks primarily via an underground transfer piping system. Due to the hazardous {{nature of the}} waste, the inner core stainless steel pipe is typically surrounded by a carbon steel <b>pipe</b> <b>jacket,</b> which provides secondary containment. Recently several through-wall penetrations were discovered on a segment {{of one of the}} jackets. An evaluation was performed to verify the failure mechanism and to estimate the degree of damage that occurred to the pipe segment. Failure analysis of a section of the jacket confirmed that pitting corrosion on the exterior of the pipe led to the through-wall penetration. Ultrasonic measurements on sections of the pipe were utilized to determine the remaining wall thickness in adjacent areas of the pipe. Based on these measurements, the degree of pitting and general corrosion was determined. Pit growth rate models were then developed to estimate the life expectancy of sections of the pipe that had not been excavated. The calculations estimated that the occurrence of through-wall failures in this jacket will begin to increase substantially in 12 years. Given that this pipe segment will be utilized beyond this time, short-term and long-term solutions to this failure were proposed. The short-term solutions focused on the repair or replace decisions that must be made to return the jacket to service as soon as practical. The long-term solutions focused on a broader strategy to address jacket integrity issues in the entire tank farm facility. These solutions included the evaluation of innovative remote inspection and repair techniques...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effect of vacuum level on the mass flow characteristics of a liquid nitrogen transfer line held in the horizontal orientation. A demouniable transfer line has been designed and fabricated allowing experiments under varying jacket vacuum conditions. The experiments made were ∙ LN_ 2, carrying pipe exposed to atmosphere ∙ LN_ 2, carrying <b>pipe</b> enclosed by <b>jacket</b> at varying vacuum levels ∙ LN_ 2, carrying <b>pipe</b> enclosed by <b>jacket</b> filled with carbon dioxide at atmospheric pressure. When the liquid line was enclosed by an outer jacket with air at atmospheric pressure, the interspace pressure fell ≈ 100 mbar below the atmospheric pressure, as the line cooled to 77 K. Under these conditions, the liquid mass flow rate was higher (and the cool-down rime less) than that of a liquid line directly exposed to atmosphere. Experiments have been performed wirh coarse vacuum (800 - 1 mbar), medium and high vacuum (10 ^- 1 - 10 ^- 5 mbar) in the jacket for different LN_ 2, supply dewar pressures. For coarse vacuum conditions, liquid mass flow rates were high as compared to high vacuum conditions for 2 OO- 300 s after the start of cool-down, but the flow rare decreased on reaching the steady stare. Improvement in jacket vacuum resulted in increase of the steady stare liquid mass flow rates. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the level of jacket vacuum for a particular application. Experiments were made with the interspace filled with CO_ 2, at atmospheric pressure. During LN_ 2, transfer, CO_ 2, condensed to a vacuum of about 1 O^- 3 mbar. The liquid fraction mass flow rare was initially very low before the CO_ 2, condensed. After CO_ 2 condensation the liquid fraction mass flow rare increased becoming comparable to that of a vacuum insulated transfer line...|$|R

40|$|The {{cryogenic}} {{system for}} the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) under construction at CERN will include twelve new local helium transfer lines distributed among five LHC points in underground caverns. These lines, being manufactured and installed by industry, will connect the cold boxes of the 4. 5 -K refrigerators and the 1. 8 -K refrigeration units to the cryogenic interconnection boxes. The lines have a maximum of 30 -m length and may possess either small or large re-distribution units to allow connection to the interface ports. Due to space restrictions the lines may have complex routings and require several elbowed sections. The lines consist of a vacuum jacket, a thermal shield and either three or four helium process pipes.

Like many who attend law school, I was an {{undergraduate}} history major. The humanities, my college pre-professional advisor assured me, were ideal preparation for the rigors of law school. I believed the hype. Three years later, on my first day of Contracts, my blind faith in the inherent compatibility of the humanities and legal education was rewarded with a sinking feeling that would, in time, give way to nausea. I had been duped. I had envisioned exuberant discussions led by a pipe-smoking, tweed-jacketed professor about the great moments {{in the history of}} contract law.

As we marched methodically through the substance of each course, we never stopped to dwell on the connections that linked cases that were thematically distinct, but connected contextually and chronologically. Though {{it would have been easy}} to submit to this standard law school pedagogy, I did not swallow my misgivings and fall in line. I did not go gently into that good night!

40|$|Currently, {{established}} cryogenic {{industries are}} faced with increasing heat transfer due to deteriorating insulation systems. Although various thermal insulation methods are utilised within the cryogenic industry, a common method is to employ a vacuum <b>jacket.</b> Vacuum <b>Jacketed</b> <b>Piping</b> (VJP) is characterised by a system of concentric pipes with an evacuated annular space, which aims to restrict the flow of atmospheric heat into the system. This ensures the internal liquid remains cold to maintain its form, rather than absorbing heat and evaporating to produce Boil Off Gas (BOG), which must be re-liquefied to be stored and sold. With the establishment of vacuum conditions within the jacket, low pressures are maintained using seals. Due to the extreme pressure differentials between the evacuated space and the environment of around 800 million times less than atmospheric, each seal has an inherent leak, which enables atmospheric contaminants to enter the annular space. Because of this, these insulation systems are expensive and are utilised {{over long periods of}} time, which results in a build-up of contaminates, causing a reduction in insulation performance. One contaminant in particular, water, has a substantial impact on the thermal efficiency of VJP, due to the tendency to freeze around the internal pipe. For flexible vacuum jacketed pipes, the ice layer significantly hinders the structural integrity of the system to alleviate internal stresses. This demonstrates the importance of analysing the level of water intrusion into vacuum jacketed systems. With tightening maintenance budgets in the current industry climate, the decision matrix to assess whether a process component should be maintained is dependent on its overall impact to the process. Without detailed heat transfer modelling of insulation performance, isolating specific impacts on BOG production using plant data is difficult and relatively inaccurate. This establishes the importance for a model to be developed to assist operating facilities in identifying the thermal performance of vacuum jacketed insulation. The water content required to form ice layers of sufficient thicknesses was analysed and the overall impact of this layer on the total heat transfer was determined. Despite the model’s ability to explore the relationship between various heat transfer variables, the overall applicability to practical systems requires further data to ensure the results correspond to those calculated...|$|R
40|$|NASA Stennis Space Center's (SSC's) large {{rocket engine}} test {{facility}} requires {{the use of}} liquid propellants, including the use of cryogenic fluids like liquid hydrogen as fuel, and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer (gases which have been liquefied at very low temperatures). These fluids require special handling, storage, and transfer technology. The biggest problem associated with transferring cryogenic liquids is product loss due to heat transfer. Vacuum jacketed piping is specifically designed to maintain high thermal efficiency so that cryogenic liquids can be transferred with minimal heat transfer. A vacuum jacketed pipe is essentially two pipes in one. There is an inner carrier pipe, in which the cryogenic liquid is actually transferred, and an outer <b>jacket</b> <b>pipe</b> that supports and seals the vacuum insulation, forming the "vacuum jacket. " The integrity of the vacuum jacketed transmission lines that transfer the cryogenic fluid from delivery barges to the test stand must be maintained prior to and during engine testing. To monitor the vacuum in these vacuum jacketed transmission lines, vacuum gauge readings are used. At SSC, vacuum gauge measurements are done on a manual rotation basis with two technicians, each using a handheld instrument. Manual collection of vacuum data is labor intensive and uses valuable personnel time. Additionally, there are times when personnel cannot collect the data in a timely fashion (i. e., when a leak is detected, measurements must be taken more often). Additionally, distribution of this data to all interested parties can be cumbersome. To simplify the vacuum-gauge data collection process, automate the data collection, and decrease the labor costs associated with acquiring these measurements, an automated system that monitors the existing gauges was developed by Invocon, Inc. For this project, Invocon developed a Wireless Integrated Microelectronic Vacuum Sensor System (WIMVSS) that provides the ability to gather vacuum-gauge measurements automatically and wirelessly, in near-real time - using a low-maintenance, lowpower sensor mesh network. The WIMVSS operates by using a self-configuring mesh network of wireless sensor units. Mesh networking is a type of networking where each sensor or node can capture and disseminate its own data, but also serve as a relay to receive and transmit data from other sensors. Each sensor node can synchronize with adjacent sensors, and propagate data from one sensor to the next, until the destination is reached. In this case, the destination is a Network Interface Unit (NIU). The WIMVSS sensors are mounted on the existing vacuum gauges. Information gathered by the sensors is sent to the NIU. Because of the mesh networking, if a sensor cannot directly send the data to the NIU, it can be propagated through the network of sensors. The NIU requires antenna access to the sensor units, AC power, and an Ethernet connection. The NIU bridges the sensor network to a WIMVSS server via an Ethernet connection. The server is configured with a database, a Web server, and proprietary interface software that makes it possible for the vacuum measurements from vacuum jacketed fluid lines to be saved, retrieved, and then displayed from any Web-enabled PC that has access to the Internet. Authorized users can then simply access the data from any PC with Internet connection. Commands can also be sent directly from the Web interface for control and maintenance of the sensor network. The technology enabled by the WIMVSS decreases labor required for gathering vacuum measurements, increases access to vacuum data by making it available on any computer with access to the Internet, increases the frequency with which data points can be acquired for evaluating the system, and decreases the recurring cost of the sensors by using off-the-shelf components and integrating these with heritage vacuum gauges...|$|R
