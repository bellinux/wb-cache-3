Palmerston held that [...] "if we can procure for it {{ten years of}} peace under the joint protection of the five Powers, and if those years are <b>profitably</b> <b>employed</b> in reorganizing the internal system of the empire, {{there is no reason}} whatever why it should not become again a respectable Power" [...] and challenged the [...] that an old country, such as Turkey should be in such disrepair as would be warranted by the comparison: [...] "Half the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity." [...] However, when the power of Muhammad Ali appeared to threaten the existence of the Ottoman dynasty, particularly given the death of Sultan Mahmud II on 1 July 1839, he succeeded in bringing the great powers together to sign a collective note on 27 July pledging them to maintain the independence and integrity of the Turkish Empire in order to preserve the security and peace of Europe. However, by 1840 Muhammad Ali had occupied Syria and won the Battle of Nezib against the Turkish forces. Lord Ponsonby, the British ambassador at Constantinople, vehemently urged the British government to intervene. Having closer ties to the pasha than most, France refused to be a party to coercive measures against him despite having signed the note in the previous year.|$|E

In the parallel processing area, there is a trend to use networks of workstations as a virtual parallel machine. The obvious advantage of such systems is their low cost. The availability of public domain software (such as PVM and MPI) to configure a parallel virtual machine over a network of workstations has led several researchers to study performance issues in this area. In this paper, we propose the use of network of workstations to improve the performance of database queries.

40|$|Abstract — The Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) or Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) feature {{extraction}} typically used for {{automatic speech recognition}} (ASR) employ several principles which have known counterparts in the cochlea and auditory nerve: frequency decomposition, mel- or bark-warping of the frequency axis, and compression of amplitudes. It seems natural to ask if one can <b>profitably</b> <b>employ</b> a counterpart of the next physiological processing step, synaptic adaptation. We therefore incorporated a simplified model of short-term adaptation into MFCC {{feature extraction}}. We evaluated the resulting ASR performance on the AURORA 2 and AURORA 3 tasks, in comparison to ordinary MFCCs, MFCCs processed by RASTA, and MFCCs processed by cepstral mean subtraction (CMS), and both in comparison to and in combination with Wiener filtering. The results suggest that our approach offers a simple, causal robustness strategy which is competitive with RASTA, CMS and Wiener filtering and performs well in combination with Wiener filtering. Compared to the structurally related RASTA, our adaptation model provides superior performance on AURORA 2 and, if Wiener filtering is used prior to both approaches, on AURORA 3 as well.

However, perhaps there are solutions {{to some of these}} problems that can satisfy multiple objectives. This report explores the technical feasibility and economic potential for capturing CO 2 from coal- or lignite-fired utility boilers and applying the CO 2 as an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process in the mature oil provinces of Texas. This capture accomplishes twin goals⎯sequestering a substantial amount of CO 2 for an extended period and increasing the efficiency of oil recovery. The types of CO 2 sources are diverse. To mitigate the impact of these, a number of management strategies are available, ranging from effluent reduction to capture and sequestration. One alternative is to utilize mature oil reservoirs to form a set of sequestration reservoirs. From the oil production side, one challenge for the domestic oil industry during the next millennium will be to <b>profitably</b> <b>employ</b> advanced technology to increase resources from existing reservoirs. Many advanced recovery strategies hold potential for accomplishing this goal. One promising area is enhanced oil recovery through the use of CO 2 flooding.

40|$|Possibly {{the most}} far-reaching, {{controversial}} research currently being {{conducted in the}} international biological science community involves human gene therapy experimentation. In this paper, I report {{the dynamics of the}} political process which ultimately found the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) of the National Institutes of Health approving for the first time protocols of this genre.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} inferring expressive safety properties of higher-order functional programs using first-order decision procedures. Our approach encodes higher-order features into first-order logic formula whose solution can be derived using a lightweight counterexample guided refinement loop. To do so, we extract initial verification conditions from dependent typing rules derived by a syntactic scan of the program. Subsequent type-checking and type-refinement phases infer and propagate specifications of higher order functions, which are treated as uninterpreted first-order constructs, via subtyping chains. Our technique provides several benefits not found in existing systems: (1) it enables compositional verification and inference of useful safety properties for functional programs; (2) additionally provides counterexamples that serve as witnesses of unsound assertions: (3) does not entail a complex translation or encoding of the original source program into a first-order representation; and, (4) most importantly, <b>profitably</b> <b>employs</b> the large body of existing work on verification of first-order imperative programs to enable efficient analysis of higher-order ones. We have implemented the technique {{as part of the}} MLton SML compiler toolchain, where it has shown to be effective in discovering useful invariants with low annotation burden. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{insights about}} when versioning is an optimal strategy for information goods. Our characterization of {{this class of}} goods is that variable costs are invariant with quality, including the special case of zero variable costs. Our analysis assumes a monopoly firm that has an existing product {{in the market and}} has an opportunity to segment the market by introducing additional lower-quality versions. We derive a simple decision rule for determining the optimality of versioning based on the solution to a single product maximization problem. Versioning is optimal when the optimal market share of the lower quality version, offered alone, is greater than the optimal market share of the high quality version, offered alone. A firm can <b>profitably</b> <b>employ</b> versioning for an information good if it can design the lower quality in a way that, relative to their valuations for the high-end version, high-type consumers have a lower relative valuation for the lower quality than do low-type consumers. When variable costs increase, a firm that offered only one product version need not consider adding another version. When variable costs decrease, the firm should explore adding a lower quality version...|$|R
60|$|Although the {{inclination}} to borrow has no fixed or necessary limit except the power of giving security, yet it always, in point of fact, stops short of this; from {{the uncertainty of the}} prospects of any individual producer, which generally indisposes him to involve himself to the full extent of his means of payment. There is never any permanent want of market for things in general; but there may be so for the commodity which any one individual is producing; and even if there is a demand for the commodity, people may not buy it of him but of some other. There are, consequently, never more than a portion of the producers, the state of whose business encourages them to add to their capital by borrowing; and even these are disposed to borrow only as much as they see an immediate prospect of <b>profitably</b> <b>employing.</b> There is, therefore, a practical limit to the demands of borrowers at any given instant; and when these demands are all satisfied, any additional capital offered on loan can find an investment only by a reduction of the rate of interest.|$|R

The favourite argument of those who support prize fellowships is that they are the only means by which a child of the working-class can raise himself to the highest positions in the land.

Second, these prize fellowships will continue, and must continue, to be carried off by those who can afford time and money to educate their sons for the competition. Third, I doubt the expediency--and the history of Oxford within the last twenty-five years strikingly confirms this doubt--of giving to a young man of any class what is practically a premium on indolence, and the removal of a motive to self-reliant and energetic spirit of enterprise. The best thing that I can think of as happening to a young man is this: that he should have been educated at a day-school in his own town; that he should have opportunities of following also the higher education in his own town; and that at the earliest convenient time he should be taught to earn his own living.|$|E

These, it appears to me, may be all reduced to one sophism as their common genus; the mistaking the conditions of a thing for its causes and essence; and the process, by which we arrive at the knowledge of a faculty, for the faculty itself. The air I breathe is the condition of my life, not its cause. We could never have learned that we had eyes but {{by the process of}} seeing; yet having seen we know that the eyes must have pre-existed in order to render the process of sight possible. Let us cross-examine Hartley's scheme under the guidance of this distinction; and we shall discover, that contemporaneity, (Leibnitz's Lex Continui,) is the limit and condition of the laws of mind, itself being rather a law of matter, at least of phaenomena considered as material. At the utmost, it is to thought the same, as the law of gravitation is to loco-motion. In every voluntary movement we first counteract gravitation, in order to avail ourselves of it. It must exist, {{that there may be a}} something to be counteracted, and which, by its re-action, may aid the force that is exerted to resist it. Let us consider what we do when we leap. We first resist the gravitating power by an act purely voluntary, and then by another act, voluntary in part, we yield to it in order to alight on the spot, which we had previously proposed to ourselves. Now let a man watch his mind while he is composing; or, to take a still more common case, while he is trying to recollect a name; and he will find the process completely analogous. Most of my readers will have observed a small water-insect on the surface of rivulets, which throws a cinque-spotted shadow fringed with prismatic colours on the sunny bottom of the brook; and will have noticed, how the little animal wins its way up against the stream, by alternate pulses of active and passive motion, now resisting the current, and now yielding to it in order to gather strength and a momentary fulcrum for a further propulsion. This is no unapt emblem of the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking. There are evidently two powers at work, which relatively to each other are active and passive; and this is not possible without an intermediate faculty, which is at once both active and passive. In philosophical language, we must denominate this intermediate faculty in all its degrees and determinations, the IMAGINATION. But, in common language, and especially on the subject of poetry, we appropriate the name to a superior degree of the faculty, joined to a superior voluntary control over it.|$|E

Some companies within the market are diversified, meaning they are involved in many different kinds of businesses, while other are focused, which implies that they are focused on one business segment. Different research views explain different motives for diversification. The resource view explain diversification by claiming that a company having underused resources needs to <b>profitably</b> <b>employ</b> them elsewhere in order to expand. The agency view explains diversification with the agent’s different incentives compared to the principal. The market power view implies that by having more resources a company can strengthen its competitiveness. Furthermore, there may be financial and synergetic motives behind diversification. This thesis investigates the relation diversification has with size, sales growth, financial efficiency ratios, and stability. By doing this we can explain the motives behind diversification in the Nordic media market through using existing theories and hence applying a deductive research approach. The thirty largest media companies in the Nordic media market were analyzed. The degree of diversification had a positive relationship with the total revenue of the investigated firms. Furthermore, diversified firms on average had higher revenues than its focused counterparts. The more diversified the firms are the higher sales growth they have and diversified companies had a higher average sales growth than the focused firms. A higher degree of diversification did not increase the firms’ financial efficiency and diversified firms did not have a higher average efficiency. However, one of the measured ratios, ROA, was higher for focused firms. Based on knowledge gained from portfolio theory we believed, before conducting the statistical analyses, that a higher degree of diversification would stabilize the cash flows for the investigated companies. However, no statistical evidence was found supporting that a higher degree of diversification would improve cash flow stability...|$|R
